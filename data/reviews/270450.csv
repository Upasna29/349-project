"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BroDuck/recommended/270450/","BroDuck","BroDuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BroDuck/","1383 products in account","Heres my original review for RRDDD:\n"Disco Dodgeball is a game that grabs you by surprise. You first try it out and don't expect to like it all that much but then you look and it's been nearly 30 minutes of you throwing glowing balls at robots with moustaches. Seriously addicting and I cannot wait to see this game come out of early access."\n\n~Version 1.0 Review.~\nHoly hell the game has changed a lot.\nRRDDD is still the same game at the core, you're a robot playing dodgeball. Except now there are many many different game modes that change the way the game plays and is so refreshing. One of my favorites being the Arcade mode which is a single player mode where you face bots and you try to rack up cash by killing them in unique ways (dunk, duck hunt, helicopter, etc.) The cash you earn from killing the bots allow you to purchase different upgrades. There is more customization now allowing for your robot to be unique. There is now a feature to customise your Robot's face and have it show up on the end game leaderboards. If I could recommend Disco Dodgeball before, I can recommend it infinitely more today because the price to content ratio in the game is absolutely insane.","February 19, 2015","true","18.2"," 128 of 136 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","128","136","7","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/270450/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Arena shooters is not a genre that has received much love in the recent years. 1999 spawned the best two games of that category, Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament, and since then there have been little to no changes to the formula. Unambitious games with little tweaks on Quake 3 and new coats of paint on Unreal Tournament.\n\nStrangely, the most unique spin on the arena shooter formula comes from this game with a ridiculous title: Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball. Instead of weapons there are insta-kill balls to throw (they can be caught), and the movements are on wheels which give some momentum, fluidity and... skill. Predicting trajectories and movements while aiming and moving leaves room for a lot of exciting action, rewarded by a commentator naming the specific skill shot ("flying squirrel!""zombie!" "quick draw!").\n\nThe fluidity of the game itself ties in with the atmosphere. There is some cool electro/techno music playing while panels and lights on the levels change color according to the beat and the movement of players. Really enthralling.\n\nEven if the game has a huge skill ceiling, just playing casually for fun is entirely possible and can even be relaxing. Bots on easy are good for that. There are tons of game modes. Arcade with permanent progression for solo play, and then variants of deathmatch, race, hold a ball to score points, and throwing a ball in hoops to score points. Mutators can be applied to modify the game, and power-ups can be turned on or off.\n\nI will now go over the two main issues of the game. The first one is that... well it's a small indie game so there are not many people playing online, and even less if you are not in North America. Still, one or two servers up are enough to have some fun, but the game would definitively benefit from a population boost (and it deserves it). Then the second issue, the netcode is not too good and lag can be a real problem, especially for those like me having to play against people in another continent. Apparently the developer is working on that and also intends to keep adding features to the game!\n\nAs a conclusion, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a unique arena shooter that is a pleasure to play, at any level. It feels complete and neatly designed, and yet it is the work of only one developer! A nice little surprise, give it a spin!","April 3, 2015","true","15.6"," 83 of 89 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","83","89","5","0"

Different game modes add a lot of variety. For instance: classic deathmatch, FFA modes, hoops (think dodgeball mixed with basketball), elimination, and more.\nThere are also different "skill shots", that depends on the way you kick an adversary's ♥♥♥, and rewards you with cool explosions, xp, an epic voice anouncing your shot, and the right to brag a little and feel great.\n\nThere's a lot of things I'm probably forgetting, but all in all, this game is insanely fun, highly playable for an early access, easy to learn, and the community is great.\n\nSpecial mention to Erik, the Dev. Great guy and really invested in Disco Dodgeball. You'll probably find him kickin' some ♥♥♥ in the game from time to time!","March 28, 2014","true","19.8"," 83 of 89 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","83","89","0","1"

I didn’t expect much going into this game and was incredibly surprised with the amount of polish and depth in this game. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball has nearly every feature I like to see in games like this and more. (See “pros” list for a more list of the cool features) The first thing you will notice once you open Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is the amazing soundtrack, and if the techno dance music isn’t your thing you can add your own music. Along with the soundtrack the visual style goes perfectly with this type of music and will get nearly anyone hyped up to play. While playing solo I had tons of fun and the challenges were great, but I did have some problems with connections on the online multiplayer. People were teleporting around, but I do think this was due to those players connections. Overall, I would highly suggest everyone to check this game out.\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\nPros\nAwesome Music and You Are Able To Load Your Own Tracks\nSeveral Game Modes\nWell Made Crafting\nSteam Marketplace\nSteam Workshop\nThe Bots Are Not Dumb\nCool Cosmetic Items (Unlockable Through Challenges, Crafting, or Steam Market)\nStat Tracker\nFun Singleplayer and Multiplayer\nUnique Graphics Style\n\n\nCons\nConnectivity Issues.

Well here I am on Steam and I come across a colorful lookin' game on sale. My eye doctor said that vivid colors would be good for my vision. So my wife said "what the heck is that?" and I said it's "dodgeball" and so she said alright.\n\nI thought I'd ask the man that made the game his opinion on it and he seemed like a pretty nice guy.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/270450/discussions/0/617328415077052066/\n\nWell mannered I thought, and seemed like the hard workin' type to have made this game on his own.\n\nSo I get the game and I start it up and my wife is over there knitting some mittens for the grandkids when this noise started banging out of the computer speakers. Startled us at first but then I thought it sounded kinda nice. I started movin' in places I haven't moved since my younger days and so I got up and got to moving. My wife said she was physically attracted to me for the first time in years.\n\nThank you Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball for saving my marriage.\n\n10/10 would cut the rug again.\n\nUPDATE: Okay kids, you wanted a more helpful review and now since grandpa has had some time with the game, I can give some insight about the actual thing!\n\n1. It's great! It has helped my eyesight, just like the doctor ordered. The graphics are what you see and they look great.\n\n2. There is a learning curve but it's very rewarding once you get good at it! For instance, if you're used to shooters, you might find yourself hitting the reload button from time to time in this game for no reason. You gotta pick up a ball to be armed kid!\n\n3. HOOPS!!!! Best game mode ever, reminds me of my days playing along side the famous Bill Russell. Plenty of other game modes too if you want to try something else.\n\n4. The single player arcade mode is a terrific place to practice. It's also pretty fun too.\n\n5. It's just a really friendly community, what's the last game you played where people were saying "Wow! Great game guys!" or "Nice moves!" instead of "git gud" or "you suck!" Also, there's a neat kudos system in place where you can compliment opponents in real time with the press of a key! Nice!\n\n6. Logging into the game at 3am (don't tell my wife!) and you'll still find people online playing, so for an online indie game, the community is thriving pretty well.","February 24, 2015","true","36.2"," 73 of 80 people (91%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","91","73","80","59","3"

I saw this game from a youtuber a while ago and I thought it looked great so I decided to buy it. If you can't tell by my hours on the game I have been enjoying it ever since.\n\nIt has a very unique feel and having to actually pick up each shot you fire is a small thing that makes it very different from other shooters. There are also many skillshots you can preform which give you more to do once you get better at the game. As of writing this review the game has one of the best communities I can think of, I currently run a group that organizes events for the game and am having a blast. The developer is a great guy who clearly cares about and works hard on the game and its community.\n\nThe games multiplayer is very entertaining with a good amount of gamemodes and maps and the singleplayer has a lot of good content too. As of writing this review an arcade mode was just added to the singleplayer that is a great timewaster for when I don't want to deal with other people.\n\nI would definitely reccomend this game and I think you can easily get your 15 dollars out of it. You probably won't play it as much as me but everyone I know that picks it up says it was worth their hard earned money.","January 14, 2015","true","314.2"," 58 of 61 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","58","61","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wellsnaperoonison/recommended/270450/","wellsnaperoonison","Missy Freakoutnow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wellsnaperoonison/","63 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATE FOR OFFICIAL RELEASE: *happy screaming*\nThis is everything anyone would want for a release. The arcade mode, as a highlight, is pleasantly addictive and the updated levelling system makes my inner completionist squeal its head off. There's even a bunch of steam cards now which, for me, was a happy surprise when I checked the announcements. This game is just great. Buy it already.\n\nOnto actual review:\n\nWhenever someone asks me what my favourite games are, I always smile and then start blurting off about the Portal series, how Stanley Parable is like the best thing ever, why they should start playing SCP Containment Breach like right now and how Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is possibly my favourite game of all time. When my mates and I get past the whole, "Wait, robot dodgeball disco wut?" part of this conversation it usually always ends up in the same way. I will happily go off into a spiel about how great this game is and how we should all get together and play it one day, only to have them go, "Oh ... okay" and have the conversation dropped. This is disappointing. But... the thing is... when I finally get them to play... They can't stop.\n\nPrepare ye self for a fairly large review because this game deserves one.\n\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball makes me squeal every time the menu boots up. Just... When the menu boots up, everything goes into slow motion for a second, goes back to reality, hits me in the face a few times and then places tingles up my back. The music. The in-sync lights. The rotating camera view. The font for goodness sake. Everything about that menu makes me so excited. So excited for what I'm about to get myself into. And oh, what you're about to get yourself into.\n\nThis game is all about skill. You need to practise for awhile to be even remotely good. But don't let that phase you. When you score you feel this rise of accomplishment that builds and builds as you get better at the game.\n\nThe game modes are vast and so are the maps which makes the game fun and prompts you to keep playing instead of shelving it and not playing again. Coupled with this, the graphics are pretty and even on my toaster run well and don't stick. The AI (Artificial Intelligence) is challenging and generally doesn't run into walls (trust me when I say that you will run into walls more often than the AI at first) and can have their difficulty changed to suit your level of expertise in the game. Also... the gameplay is smooth and responsive and rarely ever inhibits your skill in the game. You know those games that cause you to lose because of how awful the gameplay is (yeah I'm looking at you, awful camera view in newer Sonic games)? Well unless something drastic happens to the gameplay... I don't think you'll EVER have this happen to you in this game. If you lose, it's because you need to practise more. And I know ALL about this.\n\nThe multiplayer (online and on LAN) works wonderfully and my mates and I have only experienced small amounts of lag when joining lobbies (we live half way across the world from each other). It's fun and challenging and the competition runs high when playing together. It's great fun to chase down your friend and it's also terrifying being chased down.\n\nThe levelling up system in the game is stable and challenging. The more games you win, the more players you hit and the higher score you gain gains XP accordingly for your current level. It doesn't exactly feel gruelling (like levelling up in Skyrim ugh) but it does feel fair.\n\nYou can also customise your robot (your player model) with different moustaches, colours and, as you level up, you can add other accessories to your robot. What's better than devastating your friends in a death match whilst sporting a ringmasters moustache and a snazzy pair of red sunglasses. What's better than that?\n\nObviously there are some bugs and glitches, but they aren't game breaking and I rarely come across them unless I'm trying to propel myself full speed into another robot or at a wall (don't ask).\n\nTo top it off: the dev is friendly, adds great new features and fixes many problems as soon as possible whenever they rear their ugly head. The game gets regular updates because of this and it really does enhance the experience knowing that someone cares about this game and what people want for this game.\n\nIn conclusion, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is in great condition for being an early access game. The smooth gameplay, nice graphics, wonderful soundtrack, great AI, single player and multiplayer have been concocted into one amazing game that I and many others love. I just can't wait to see what the dev has in store for it upon it's release.\n\nIn retrospect here are the pros and the cons;\n\nPros\n\nGameplay is smooth\nGraphics are nice\nGreat multiplayer online and on LAN\nSoundtrack has been picked almost perfectly\nAI is smart and works well\nThe whole premise of this game (playing as a robot) is amusing and fun\nCustomisation (moustaches :O)\nMany different maps to play on\nMany different game modes\nLevelling up system\nFriendly developer (yes... this is definitely a pro for the game)\nCons\n\nSome non game breaking bugs and glitches here and there.\nI kind've wish there were more songs (probably will be)\nIf you don't have friends to play with and if you're too afraid to play online with randoms, playing     single player can be a little tiresome after awhile.","December 22, 2014","true","6.7"," 70 of 81 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","70","81","13","3"

If that doesn't peak your interest, feel free to read on.\n\nIntro:\n\nThis game is special.  When I say "special" I don't mean mentally handicapped, I mean it's genuinely unique and a real diamond in the rough.  For the price, this may be the best value you can find on Steam.  It may be pretty simple in concept but trust me when I say that this game can entertain for hundreds of hours.  Did I mention it's one of the (very) few games that's done Early Access right and actually seen a solid release?\n\nVisuals:\n\nLet's start with the visuals.  Erik has done a fantastic job creating exactly what you'd expect from the game's tongue-twister of a title.  Beautiful futuristic Disco arenas that pulsate and flash to the incredible soundtrack.  Goofy-looking one-wheeled bots zoom around the arenas and explode in Michael Bay-esque fashion.  Not only is it beautiful to look at, but it runs well on just about any PC as you can see by the recommended system requirements.  The visual fidelity of this game is only matched by it's stellar gameplay.\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou know that feeling when you're playing a game and you make the perfect move or take the perfect shot and it feels like you're a god?  You can experience that feeling over and over in this game with it's fast-paced gameplay and tight mechanics.  RRDDD has a learning curve that allows new players to jump in and have a good time without being punished but takes time and effort to master.  The implementation of trick shots adds a whole new dimension to the gameplay.  Pulling off a "Godlike KO" for the first time feels... well, Godlike.  There's also an impressive variety of arenas, gamemodes, and unlockable gear to enjoy.  Disco Dodgeball is even better when you hop online and play with your friends!  This game can potentially be endless hours of fun.  My only current issue with the gameplay is that every now and then, there are some bugs regarding balls not being in the same place for different players during online play but hopefully this will be fixed in a future patch and isn't exactly "game-breaking".\n\nAudio:\n\nThe soundtrack in RRDDD is one of the best soundtracks to any game I've ever played.  It's the perfect audible theme for the setting.  If you enjoy electronic music, you'll surely appreciate the selection of tracks here.  Accompanied by the top-notch sound effects and the hilarious "monster truck announcer" that somehow doesn't ever get old or annoying, it's easy to enjoy the sound in Disco Dodgeball.\n\nConclusion:\n\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a real treat for anyone who likes over the top, fast-paced action and isn't afraid to take a few balls to the face.  Erik Asmussen has truly outdone himself and I'm excited to see what he comes up with next.  I can't recommend this game enough.\n\n10/10\n\nThis is my first review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesickboy/recommended/270450/","thesickboy","SickBoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesickboy/","483 products in account","This is a fast-paced first-person dodgeball game from the future complete with robots, an (amazing) voiced announcer, and synced visualizers for the music.\n\nAt its core this is a game I *highly* recommend for those that enjoy the FPS (especially instagib) genre, but want something a bit different... yet still familiar. I won't be so bold as to say a digital dodgeball game has never been made before, but this is the first I've ever played to really go all out with it. It's so brilliantly simple, yet took this long until someone decided to make it... AAA marketing departments: fire yourselves.\n\nNOTE: THIS GAME HAS A DEMO YOU CAN TRY! So... try it! (I don't know if it's up to date... but the gameplay is the same regardless)\n\nGraphics:\nI love them! The best way to describe them is "a minimalist TRON-themed rave". The music plays a big part as the level coloring/brightness/etc. is hooked up to a visualizer system. Different music will give you a different feel, but no matter what you listen to it's a pleasure to experience. And you can always turn off the visualizer completely (and individually configure most other aspects) if you're not a fan of the effects.\n\nSound:\nFantastic! The voice announcer is *amazing* and the default music is absolutely sublime if you're into electronica. Of course, if you don't like the music you can always add your own. The in-game visualizers will automatically adjust, and you'll be rocking out to your own tunes in no time. The only downside (which is a Unity limitation) is that you *have* to use OGG or WAV format. You can very easily use VLC or Audacity to convert your MP3s to OGG though, so it's not a big issue.\n\nControls:\nFor the most part they are your standard WASD+mouse. HOWEVER, the robot you are playing as is intentionally able to slide around as if on ice (though you can still quickly change directions or use "E" to stop completely). Also, jumping has no air-control and is based on a charge-up system. While some may see these as limitations, I absolutely love it! It makes jumping a risky move because your trajectory will be predictable, and big jumps will need planning because you may not be charged enough to make it.\n\nModes:\nLOTS of modes are included, and tons are planned. You have your standard DM/CTF-style modes, but plenty of others to keep you interested. One of my favorites is the "hoops" mode, where you are basically playing basketball *while* playing dodgeball. It's REALLY fun, frantic, and ripe for strategic play. There is also an Arcade mode to try and survive (where you go through pre-configured rounds with bosses, and can buy upgrades in between), as well as Challenges that are extremely fun. Both Arcade and Challenges have leaderboard support if you're into that.\n\nGameplay:\nFrom the plethora of modes and maps, to the good-sportsmanship-encouragement via the "kudos" system, everything about the gameplay is fantastic. There are all kinds of moves to pull off (which the game tracks and gives you a great voiced announcement upon success), an arbitrary leveling system for those that like to feel satisfaction in their progress, a silly and unique character customization system, and just generally a ton of things to enjoy!\n\nSingleplayer/Multiplayer:\nThis game has some pretty amazing bots for singleplayer, and those bots can be used as placeholders in multiplayer games (they'll be replaced by real players as they join and do *not* take up a player slot). Multiplayer is the only issue with this game as latency makes catching/blocking/dodging/etc. balls fairly unreliable. It is a known issue, and I have confidence it'll be fixed in the future. That said, the bots are good enough to give you a LOT of play time. Multiplayer can be a bit frustrating, but isn't unplayable... it just takes some getting used to.\n\n\nIn the end this is a fantastic game that I really enjoy. The developer (who is ONE person) is on top of everything when it comes to bugfixes, is receptive to suggestions, and even has a public Trello for transparent development. As with any game it isn't for everyone (and isn't playable for gamers with various disabilities due to its nature, see comments), but I HIGHLY recommend it.","April 7, 2015","true","124.7"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","32","36","6","9"

Regular updates, a very involved dev are what the game has going for it on the outside. Inside the game, you have maps and gameplay that may evoke a sense of nostalgia for fans of old arena FPS games.\n\nRRDDD sports a kickass soundtrack that brings with it both pumping beats to get you into a fugue of awareness and dodge ready, and softer tracks to wind you down when you need a breather. The Gameplay is fast and so are your armaments, dodgeballs. All hits are one hit kills, no health, no second winds. Catches, Long Distances, Flying Squirrel are just a few of the trick shots you can pull off. Perhaps you could even become God-like in the good variety of gamemodes.\n\nFor a low price you can have a lot of fun bashing in your fellow mustachioed robots's chasis in with discoball dodgeballs online.

The concept is so humorous alone that the game just oozes good vibes.  You can really see how much the developer loves both his game and the game's community in this one.  It's perfect for both casual play and competitive sport.  In fact I have not met or seen a person yet who has played this game and has not had a good time.\n\nThe graphics on this game are simple but they suit it.  The designs of the different arenas really compliment the fact that you're a robot with one wheel rolling around.  The pulsing and moving lights really sell the idea that you're a night-club arena and the soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard to a game.  Visually the game gives you what you need, and none of the fluff.  This is why Super Mario Bros. was so popular.  Visually it was nothing like we have today but it was fun to play!\n\nThe game does have an experience points system, but it's geared towards getting cosmetic upgrades, not towards making you more powerful.  I like this because it means new players have chances to improved without constantly getting slaughtered.  Also like many multiplayer games, there's sometimes lag, but with 4 to 12 people throwing dodgeballs around in every direction imaginable, it's so much fun and so chaotic that nobody really seems to mind!\n\nYou know a game is fun when you're laughing and yelling at your friends over voice chat, having a great time even when you're losing!  It's definitely one of my favorite games of all time; I highly recommend it for one of the best times you will have with your friends, ever, online.","February 1, 2015","true","15.7"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/270450/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This is another hidden gem on steam that would give Ricochet a run for it's money. Robot Roller Dodgeball is dodgeball that knows no boundaries and puts everyone playing at risk. Such an extremely simple "FPS" game made with care and precision.\n\nIn Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball, you control one robot whose face you can customize. The controls are relatively simple and require precision aiming more than anything. Think of CS : GO type of game-play movement and that's essentially what you get. The catch? Your robot is on one wheel always rolling around somewhere. There are primarily nine directions you can direct your robot in, all in which will move it at a constant speed. This clonky directional movement can be interrupted and perfected thanks to the mouse. To shake-up the game and to keep it away from being bland they added a jump feature (which you can hold down longer for a bigger jump) and a boost feature, in which both are extremely handy. The game has more game modes than I have fingers on one and possibly two hands. My favorite game feature is their incorporation of basketball or "hoops" as they call it. The player can hit other players with the dodge ball, but there is one golden ball that needs to be used to score a point. To do so, the player has to throw the ball on one side of a square floating in mid air by the other teams spawn point. There is also a free for all setting for the mode. Other game modes feature (team) deathmatch, score battle (first team/person/robot to x amount of points), elimination where one by one team members get knocked out and wait for the next round, super ball where players have to keep hold of a certain ball to accumulate points, grand prix where players have to race around a map, horde (single player) where you face up against one robot (then two, then three etc...), and finally training. Any game willing to add variation deserves some credit, and disco dodgeball definitely deserves a high five or two.\n\nBesides game modes, players can pick up random power-ups found spread out throughout the map. Some power ups include larger ball, fire/laser ball where it can't be stopped, jet pack to stay in the air longer, boomerang balls, and even a super boost that replenishes boost a lot quicker. How do you pick up a dodgeball? You'll find them laying around everywhere after people start throwing them. They are pretty hard to miss as white globes on the floor will glow brightly. They've also put in a feature where you can CATCH a dodgeball. It's a hard skill to master as you have to point at the ball but results in an opponents quick death. Throwing power can be modified the longer the mouse button is held down. This is useful if you'd like to ricochet your ball off a wall to hit someone on the other side of it.\n\nGraphics themselves are a nice twist and keep everything simplistic. There is nothing wrong with being simple as it keeps the focus towards the game. If you are sensitive to a bunch of different lights going on and off you might want to take some precaution. Sounds themselves are neat, subtle and sort of quiet, but neat. The music is what protrudes the most at all times. One thing I noticed graphically was when hitting an opponent with a ball, instead of the opponent blowing up or the ball stopping in it's tracks, there's a little recoil when hitting an opponent, then they blow up. This is a tiny feature that makes hitting an opponent with a ball that much more rewarding.\n\nThe price is a bit steep I must say but if a sale comes around, I'd say pick it up! Also, for the wary, the servers are sort of empty at times but there are bots to keep it interesting. You will find some stragglers once in a while playing.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.25/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	N/A	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	B-	Overall 	B-\n\nScreenShots :\n\nLuke bot always camps\n\nWhat hoops looks like\n\nCapture the flag mode with me holding a ball\n\nBetter view of what hoops looks like.

All the lights and effects seemed like goofy attempt at covering up the junk underneath.\n\nBut after getting the 4-pack during a sale and playing with some buddies, I came right back and bought a few more.  For those that enjoy arena shooters, this is an arena shooter done right.  Every shot that hits feels so satisfying, I crave to play more.\n\nThe only major downside is the steps it takes to actually set up a LAN party.  Due to the limited experience of the lonely dev, he resorted to 3rd party technology, thus the requirement to download a server program from an external website and a bit of tweaking before one can play with friends, even if everyone is on the same router.\n\nAfter having done so, I see it is relatively easy despite the daunting number of steps on the wiki, so don't be afraid to give it a shot.\n\nAlso surprisingly, playing solo with bots is actually pretty darn fun too.  Don't let the flashing lights blind you, this game delivers a very solid package.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys arena shooters.","July 2, 2015","true","8.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cappop/recommended/270450/","cappop","RION","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cappop/","215 products in account","Upon reading the title, three things can be learnt about this game.\n\n1) It has robots.\n2) It involves disco.\n3) It's about dodgeball.\n\nAnd if there's anything this game is guilty of, living up to expectations is not one of them. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a competitve primarily multiplayer first person shooter filling the fairly empty and unexplored niche of a dodgeball game, one I'm frankly suprised nobody thought of before.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nGameplay is easy to learn; find a dodgeball, hold the mouse to shoot ("Oh, but what about controllers?" you may ask. Take a moment and reread my description of the game. This is not a game you should use a controller for.). Left click to drift, left shift to boost, collect powerups to get powers. Satisfying callouts from the game announcer sound when you hit a certain killstreak value or perform a certain type of kill, such as a 'dunk' or 'helicopter'. Simple enough, right? However, it holds true to the adage, as even with a considerable amount of time in Disco Dodgeball I'm far from mastering it. For instance, I largely ignored the drifting mechanic until recently, and found that it is extremely effective for sharp turns and desperate speed boosts.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\nOne of the reasons I left out 'team based' in my intial summary of Disco Dodgeball is due to the massive amount of game mode customization extant. Even putting 'primarily multiplayer' was risky, as the game has a horde and arcade mode, which have you pitted against endless waves of bots or battling through a more structured, level-based gauntlet, complete with purchasable augments. However, multiplayer is the star, and the gameplay settings make it shine. Several different game modes, including Hoops, which is similar to basketball, or Elimination, which channels Counter-Strike's 'one death and you're out' mantra are side by side with the standard deathmatch. Free For All modes are availible for most modes, and you even have the ability to choose starting powerups. Along with these are the standard goofy options like 'Big Head' mode, which speaks for itself, and low gravity.\n\nSETTINGS\nDisco-Dodgeball suprised me with how deep it's settings are at launch. If anyone reading this played the very early versions of the game, then you'll remember the unchangable 60 FOV, as well as only having the standard 'Good-Fantastic' Unity drop down bar within the launcher. Now you can change pretty much everything, including AA, Vsync, FOV, and Alien FX, which from what I've heard makes your AlienWare PC light up in sync with the game''s pulsating lights. Speaking of which...\n\nAESTHETICS AND MUSIC\nThis is where I feel like the game defines itself in the gaming world, besides the unique concept. Launching the game, you're immediately hit with the game's energetic and pumed electronic music, as well as a display of it's neon glowing visuals. The enviroment interacts with the music, dimming when the volume or tempo drops and bursting with light when a piece hits it's apex. However, I imagine that the game could be problematic for those with certain medical issues due to the quick flashing lights.\n\nPROBLEMS\nThe only real problem I have with the game is the occasional physics quirk. Sometimes you'll get shot up into the air after a collision with another player of object, which, coupled with the slow fall speed, makes you a sitting duck.\n\nCOMMUNITY\nNot once have I heard an angry remark in the chat, even though I have been seething with frustration after getting Ninja'd by somebody for the 5th time. Disco Dodgeball has one of the nicest, healthiest communities I've ever encountered in a game, in part due to it's small player base, but also due to the built in kudos system, a way to quickly condone somebody if they've made a great hit on you.\n\nSUMMARY\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is what it says on the tin: fast paced, energetic, and fun. You would be hard pressed to find a community that's nicer, and the innumerable game modes and customizations will have you playing until 1:30 AM on a school night, which has just happened to me.","March 2, 2015","true","28.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","18","21","5","0"

I especially loved the fact that the track playing in the menu screen would continue as the in-game music (something that I really appreciate because I don't have to desynch to the music when a new track suddenly interrupts the one you had been initially listening to). You can customize your robot character's appearance a fair amount, with the option to unlock more pieces as you level up your account. The announcer's praise for unique moves you do (ex: air hits, bounce hits, denials, etc) adds to the intensity of the game, which is reminiscent of the fast-paced action typically experienced in games like the Unreal and Quake series'.\n\nThe controls are easy to grasp and helpful pop-up tutorials remind you of your keybindings for things like e-braking, boosting, etc. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with first-person combat. Even against easy bots in singleplayer, you will have a very fun and challenging time familiarizing yourself with the game. During combat, you truly need to appreciate battlefield awareness because it is extremely easy to be hit from behind by a dodgeball. Furthermore, carelessly throwing your ball at an opponent may result in a catch, with auto-kills you and (even worse) brings back a downed opponent. You cannot catch twice in a row (you must throw a ball to reset your catch allotment), and this helps ensure that people do not simply camp and wait for their opponents to throw the first ball.\n\nThere are a variety of different levels, each with their own distinct layout that may result in you changing up your strategy (for example, one level consists of many pillars, so weaving in and out to dodge/juke your opponents attacks is a much more viable strategy here than, say, a level with large, open ground.\n\nPickups also litter the battlefield, adding advantages like homing dodgeballs, a temporary jetpack, fast/tighter maneuverability, or even laser (straight) shots. The powerups are random (much like Mario Kart's mystery powerups), so you may have to pick several up before you end up acquiring your favorite one. My personal favorite is the jetpack, since it really helps you achieve those beautiful "death from above" hits.\n\nFor many players, the combination of fast, upbeat EDM and color/light-intensive maps may be a turn off, as it can be a lot of noise for people more used to average-paced games (or even just average-paced presentation of stimuli). If this does not bother you, however, you will be in for quite a treat. The color/lights in the maps will change periodically in timing with the music, and I see a lot of potential here for further optimization of game music with game aesthetics (visual). I am hoping for an option of playing your own music in the future (I'd love to listen to one of my EDM mixes while watching the levels give a great lightshow while playing dodgeball).\n\nThere are a multitude of game modes - like team elimination, score attack, hold the dodgeball - that help keep the game fresh and entertaining. The community, at least from what I have seen, is both very friendly and helpful to newcomers. If you are able to play this game with a few friends, you will have a lot of fun.\n\nOverall, if you are interested in fast-paced dodgeball with wonderful aesthetics, you must give this game a try. There is definitely a high amount of potential for this game to grow and develop, and I look forward to seeing the end product.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\n","October 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

This game has so much more to it than meets the eye. I began playing this game in beta, and it was amazing! It has easy mechanics, easy objectives, and unfathomable entertainment. There are so many things that I love about this game.\n\nFirst off, unlike most other fps games, it's balanced. All players are equal, and when you die, there's no excuses. The other player was either better than you, or was able to use the map and powerups better than you. It's straight forward hit or miss gameplay. Also, the powerups are balanced. The big balls will help you hit more robots, but they are so much easier to see, and unlike the homing and laser, you can't hide having the powerup. When you're holding a ball, it's always big and noticable. The homing is amazing against bots at long range, but is so much harder to use close up. Also, when you lose it, you're so used to seeing the tracker that it disorientates you for a moment. Laser is fast and great for ricochets, but it messes up the way you're used to playing, being the ball has no drop. Jetpack is great for capturing points or swooping in like an eagle, but you can lose vertical momentum, making yourself an easy target. Pogo is good for navigation, but if you fumble, you're an easy midair target. Super boost is great for hit and runs, but really hurts your finger pressing shift. I find that when you use superboost, you start going in a lap pattern, which makes you a predictable target. You also get disorientated in close combat. The balance in this game makes it such a more entertaining game because you're just as capable as the rest of your team to achieve the objectives.\n\nSecond, the soundtrack. Where do I even start. It's amazing, and really is. The game wouldn't be the same without it. Hell, I'm a person that doesn't even like dubstep, and I can't play this without the music. It just gets you in the mood to kick ♥♥♥, or just stop and listen to it. Best soundtrack of any game I've seen (or heard).\n\nThird, the simplicity. At first glance, you may think you'll just be getting into some futuristic, complicated sports shotter with a ton of exposition. The title alone is complicated! But when you start playing, you realize just how simple it is. There's some balls. Go get a ball. Take that ball and hit that jerk over there in the face with it. Oh, by the way, keep killing those guys so your team wins. Or be fancy about smashing their smug toaster of a head open, because you're getting points for that. It's easy to learn, easy to master. I've never played a multiplayer game like that before. THe only real thing that separates experts from beginners is knowing your keys and mouse.\n\nFinally, my favorite thing about this game is the development. It's ridiculous. Like I said, I started this in beta, and now it's ready for launch in a little under a year. Erik's the hardest working dev I think there is. Here's some new maps you can try out. Some more gamemodes. Here, a ton of more graphics options! Fixed some bugs that were reported 2 hours ago. Want singleplayer? Here's singleplayer! Hell, when 3.2 came out, I remember joking about 3.7 coming out. And it's now here! After a few short months, you've made 5 milestones in the development of Disco Dodgeball! Congratulations! Not only have you evolved, re-evolved, and revolutionized the game itself over and over again, but you've done something which is what all devs should do. You listen to your community. You actively engage with us to find what we want to see in your game. Is this causing lag? Fixed. Want more gamemodes? There you go. Catching too easy? No problem. You've even made a demo for players to try it out for free! I've gotta say, this wouldn't be nearly as fun of a game if Erik wasn't such a great developer.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Get the game! You will not regret it. It will probably make you a better person, and help with stress. Better hurry, friday's only once a week! In case you don't know, we have game nights and tournaments every week! You'll quickly get a good group of friends from the community. You'll meet new people, and have a ton of fun hitting them in the face with an exploding dodgeball! What's not to like? Doesn't matter, Erik will fix it!","January 6, 2015","true","164.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

Very fun, bots are fun to play against if you're having trouble finding online games, it has customizable game modes, simple mechanics, the physics based movement is fun to play with, and the game is aestheticelly pleasing. Definitely worth the money.\n\nI have very few minor complaints about it:\n- The UI could use a little polishing\n- The game is a bit stingy when it comes to customization unlocks. Drop rated for crafting parts is pretty low, but thankfully you can buy parts in the communnity market for cheap.\n- The sliding mechanic is a little weird; it doesn't seem to offer anything in terms of advanced movement outside of recharging your boost (whch is all I use it for)\n\npro/con - You can save replays, and they are directly saved as .gif files, which is really nice. The bad thing is, the gifs are short, so it's hard to capture cool moments perfectly. I reccommend binding the replay capture button to the 'q' key (Default F5)\n\nPlease don't let these few downsides turn you away from this game.

(No, really, every mood)\n\nCons- Can be buggy\n- Sticky terrain\n\nNeutral+/- Players with a poor connection can still play (but warp everywhere and can't be hit.)\n\n======================================\nYes. Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball. Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball is a game about robots rolling around dodging balls in a disco-rave environment. You will dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge until your parents yell at you to please just stop playing that epilepsy simulator. The game is a treat, aesthetically and otherwise, but especially aesthetically. Let me explain: The environment is beautiful, but also essentially a giant equalizer with pretty flashing colors. The music, of course, is not only in sync with said equalizenvironment, but very pleasing to the ears. It gets you going, and keeps the game going. The gameplay is gloriously colorful high octane fun! The controls have a momentum to them, and may take some adjustment. Shooting isn't per pixel where the crosshair is, which is good. The ball may bounce off the edge of a hoop or narrowly miss your opponent until you really learn to aim well. You'll also be pleased to hear you can catch and block the ball, not just dodge! There are CTF, king of the hill, and many other gamemodes to keep you occupied.\n\nNow, on the other hand, I did encounter some problems. But only some! Very very few even...but they should be mentioned. First off, in my first few times trying to play, I ran into a wealth of strange settings bugs. No steam overlay, couldn't get into gamemode. Then that worked, but the controller wouldn't look around. Restart again, controller works, but can only change the sensitivity with the mouse. The only other issue besides the ocassional bug (that I only ever had at the very beginning, all smooth now!) is the sticky terrain. You will get stuck on the corner of a ramp, or even on players, because the game kind of defaults to jumping you when you do. Probably because of that sweet momentum!\n\nSo keep on rollin', folks, and remember to dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 17, 2015","true","12.4"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","19","27","2","0"

I got it yesterday during on sale for 9 bucks. Right from the start I was having a blast with it. I was having so much fun in fact I had to buy my buddy a copy so he could jump in as well.\n\nThe game plays more like a classic arena FPS than a modern FPS but instead of turning other players into giblets you're throwing dodgeballs at them. There are many unusual mechanics that add to the game a lot. For instance sprinting is called 'boost' and after you use boost you have to let it recharge back to %100. Jumping doesn't just require taping the spacebar but also holding it. The longer you hold it the higher (or farther) you jump, it also has a 100% meter so you have to let it charge to use it again. Once you have a dodgeball in your hand you can throw it by holding and releasing the right mouse button. Charging it up to 100% makes the shot as strong as it can be. The left mouse button is used to power slide (think drifting). To power slide you hold forward, lmb, and turn towards a certain angle so you can't power slide just by moving forward. While power sliding your boost meter charges up quicker and you can even overcharge it giving you a faster boost. Besides throwing the dodgeball you can also catch, catching it automatically eliminates the person who threw it like in real dodgeball.\n\nMoving around is also quit different from other shooters. Since your not a bipedal human but a single wheel robot you can strafe as fast as you can walk forward and backwards but once you press w,s,a, or d you will move in that direction till you press another movement key or press the brakes button (e is default key). So basically if you press forward you will continue moving forward until you stop or move elsewhere.\n\nJust like a classic arena FPS you have an announcer announcing crazy kill combo you just had (double kill, multikill, ramapge). Besides getting extra points for racking up kills you also get extra points for doing trick shots and the announcer would say it as well. These include ricochet (hit a guy indirectly) dunk (hitting a guy underneath you midair) and long shot (the farther the range the more points you get) and plenty more.\n\nThere are self improving upgrades in the game that can help you out during a match. The power ups are placed around the levels so if you're quick enough you can get one at the very beginning of the match. You can't know what power up you're getting because its random so you can't always get what you want. Some of the power ups include fireball (a blazing dodgeball that can't be caught so its best to avoid it), pogostick (lets you jump higher than normal) and jet pack (lets you hover with the jump button until your jumping gauge is 0% or until all your fuel is depleted). There are many more that I can't name at the top of my head.\n\nThe electronic dance music also adds a lot to the game. Shooters these days try to present themselves as rough and serious since hearing your enemies footsteps is vital, I totally understand that this a valid reason but I miss the classic multiplayer soundtracks from past shooters (Foregone Destruction anyone?). Having EDM music in the background makes it more... I dunno... soothing? Like I haven't raged quit it this game even in matches where I go 3 and 15. I don't take it to so serious and its ok because I'm still having a blast. Sometimes I even bop to the beat and try to aim my shots when the bass drops or whatever lol but that's just weird ol' me.\nMultiplayer modes include:\n\nDeathmatch: Self explanatory. Score points by getting kills, the more kills the more points.\n\nScore Batte: Which ever team scores the most points wins. To get a lot of points its best to do trick shots.\n\nElimination: Just like in real dodgeball, once you're hit you're out. If your teammate catches a ball you can come back in.\n\nHoops: throw dodgeball through enemy hoops to score points, who ever scores the most wins.\n\nSuper Ball: Hold the "super ball" for as long as you can to score points for your team. If a teammate has it you have to defend him. If a enemy has it you have to take it away from them.\n\nGrand Prix: you have to race around an arena to get to checkpoints. Leaders earn double points so his effort is vital. Also boost+drifting is key here.\n\nIf you don't feel like playing multiplayer the single player aspect of the game is also super fun. Modes include:\n\nTraining: pretty self explanitory, if your a newbie definitely give it a try.\n\nArcade: Beat a group of bots (at the end of three waves or so you have to fight a boss), collect cash, buy upgrades with that cash, and keep playing till you hit game over. You start off with 4 lives but you can gain more later with upgrades. once you deplete all your lives you die.\n\nChallenge: Challenge isn't one mode but about 4-5 different modes. I haven't payed them yet but I'll check them out later.\n\nBot match: If you feel like playing an offline match with bots then you can.\n\nI haven't let this game go since I bought it yesterday and Its because I've been having so much damn fun with it. My go to FPS is still BF4 right now but unlike BF4 in RRDDD not every match has to be super focus, intense and/or strategic. I feel like a child playing this game because its just simple fast pace fun. I dunno if its nostalgia but playing this game recaptures that same feeling I had when playing UT99 for the very first time and I love it.\n\nTL;DR Super fun fast paced Arena FPS Dodgeball game with neon lights and catchy music. Definitely give it a try.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nSo I just bought the game and holy crap this is one of the most funnest FPS (if you would call it that) that I've ever played. Let me preface this by saying I play tons of shooters, my main one right now is BF4. Even though I love that game to death there are plenty of frustrating moments with it (getting sniped by some dedicated camper across the map, dying for stupid reasons, admins ruining the momentum of the game when they have to balance things out, etc). This game on the other hand no matter how pro the enemy players are I'm always having fun jumping around and trying to get some hits while at the same time avoid getting hit. Only reason I would put this game down its if I get tired after playing it for hours, I haven't rage quit at all and believe me I tend to rage quit often. I'm loving this game so much I bought one for my buddy as a gift so we can play together. Really if you want to have a super fun time try this game out you will love it!","May 1, 2015","true","10.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Limbless uni-wheeled telekinetic robots now dominate the fields of battle, which have been transformed into neon-colored dance clubs of death! The weapon of choice? Fast-pitched disco balls that explode targets on contact! THIS is Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball, the new futuristic sport of choice!\n\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a rare gem indeed. There are few titles in alpha/beta/Early Release that I can say have captivated me from the very start, and this title genuinely grabbed my attention with it's very first concept trailer. Simple in concept yet dastardly difficult to master, Disco Dodgeball is a wonderful throwback to first person shooters of the turn of the millenium.\n\nSimilar in style to Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament in terms of control, Disco Dodgeball at it's core is a twitch shooter with a funky and captivating aesthetic that is so unlike anything else available on any platform to date. It's also hands down the best and most authentic dodgeball simulator on the market.\n\nIf you're looking for an inexpensive and fresh title to add to your library, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is more than a safe bet; it's a must purchase.

The title is quite ridiculous. And so is its gameplay! Playing this, it makes you think, "Why hasn't this been done?" The whole concept is quite simple, and the execution is solid. With it's cartoony robots rolling around neon environments, it kind of gives the player a sense of what is really supposed to be had. Fun, and lots of it. The game has great singleplayer modes, such as arcade in which you are put up against multiple waves of enemies on each level, with only five lives to spare. After each level, you are given money to purchase powerups to get to the next, and trust me, you'll need em. Multiplayer is quite unique. With different modes, such as  Super Ball (similar to Oddball in Halo), Hoops (basically basketball), Elimination ("classic" Dodgeball), and plenty more, there is enough variety to keep a single player, or a group of friends entertained for hours. The community is small, but everyone I've seem to have met has been nothing but nice to me. Unlike hardcore shooters such as CS:GO, the atmosphere promotes kindness as odd as it may seem. I attribute it to the cutesy asthetic and lack of push to talk. As for the performance, there is A LOT of lighting effects. On my machine (just a Macbook Pro with some decent upgrades, nothing fancy AT ALL), I have to disable most of them, but any decent PC will be able to enable most if not all of the settings. Now, the only flaws I can find are in multiplayer, the biggest being netcode. Catches seem to work rarely, and hit registration can be iffy. I'm sure these may be ironed out in future updates, but for now, we just have to sit and bear it. Do I reccomend this game? Yes, absolutely. It is one of my definitive multiplayer experiences of 2014 and 2015, simply because there is nothing like it, and it is a whole lot of fun.","April 7, 2015","true","24.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

Very reminiscent of old school instagib in my opinion, just made much more accessible.  Being a "unicycle" with very limited boost and jump abilities really helps slow the game down to a very fun manageable pace.  I would imagine beginners would be able to scrap together a few kills and have a good time while veterans are busy slamming the ball off your face with style (mid-air 360s), and are rewarded for that.\n\nGreat soundtrack and super fun gameplay (even solo with bots, moreso with friends though).\n\nThe game is early access and beware, there are still some odd bugs like not actually picking up a ball when you may have thought you grabbed it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meibae/recommended/270450/","Meibae","Maylee Cuddletrousers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meibae/","167 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs of writin' this review, I've played this game for 2.3 hours, plus it's the 15:th of October, meanin' it's at the time this game is still in development. I've inspected the game throroughly through the sound aspects, graphics and general view of the game(I'm personally not the typical "strict critic" who only mentions the flaws). Anyways, let's get to it!\n\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball(I'll hereby refer to it as simply Disco Dodgeball for convenience) is a simple game based upon the classic school-activity most of us have experienced and loved, dodgeball. However, you are a roller-derby robot! If you haven't been part of it or played another version of it that isn't the typical american style, this is how it works...\n\nIF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT DODGEBALL IS: Two teams are pitched against each other in a battle to eliminate the opposin' team by picking up the balls on the field and throwin' it on an enemy. Players who are hit are eliminated from the game, however can be brought back in the game if a friendly team member catches the ball thrown from the same enemy that eliminated you. Catching a ball thrown from the enemy while it's still in the air will result in that same enemy player being eliminated. The last man standin' wins.\n\nIF YOU KNOW WHAT DODGEBALL IS:Okay, so now you know what dodgeball is(or already have known), the version in this game is slightly different. First of all, there's no border restriction as to where the players from both teams can be at, the entire arena is free for both teams to roam. Secondly, the ball thrown from a player can bounce off of one surface and still eliminate an enemy. Also, as with the usual rules, you can protect yourself if you are holding a ball.\n\nMODES\nOkay, so there's dodgeball. Is that everythin' to it? Actually, no, there are several creative and very competetive gamemodes bundled with the game! There's last-man-standing styled team deathmatch(basically team vs. team with no respawn), there's a "Super Ball" mode where one team member has to hold the golden ball for as long as possible and get to the required score to win the game. There's also several single-player challenge modes such as horde, where you are alone and facing endless enemies who are tryin' to eliminate you(the round ends when you are eliminated). There's also Juggernaut, which is a mode where you rack up as many eliminations as possible in a 2-minute duration while completely insincible to thrown enemy balls.\n\nGRAPHICS\nFor such a small game with a simple mechanic, the graphics are incredibly appealin'. Neon-robots, speakers and walls that pump in sync with the music in-game, strobelights and whatnot. As for the options for graphics, it has pretty much a general consumer would need, and a little bit more. You can change things like Vsync, resolution, fog, glow, the music visualizer, gibs and reflections. There's even an option for AlienFX that I presume syncs the light from your Alienware computer with the music from your game. If you have ever been at a night club with pumping loud music, you will definitely recognize that feelin' when playino' this game with all the options turned on(excluding AlienFX).\n\nSOUND & MUSIC\nThe sound and musical aspects of this game, just like the graphics, are extremely good! The sounds in itself are very good, you get the feeling that you are really there, what with the dodgeballs bouncing on the floor, the roller-derby tire on your robot body, and the epic announcer who mentions every kill you get like it's your biggest achievement! The music is very fittin' to the games setting as well, with pumpy and well-produced electro music, the kind you hear in clubs. The sound assets of the game can be changed in the options, which offers a slider for effects, voice and music sepparatly. You can also skip a song in the sound options and scroll through the songs available.\n\nGENERAL SETTINGS\nThe game offers customization for people who wants to be known on the battlefield, such as "the green wariostache guy". Finally people can go "That purple sleepy guy keeps killing me!" when you take em' down. You can customize your robot color, your face(things like multiple moustaches, cat whiskers etc) as well as glasses, and accordin' to the developer, more is to come!\nThere are rebindable control options for gamepad and keyboard+mouse users(However no secondary button for the same action). Now, somethin' this game offers that I have NEVER seen before is rebindable keys for BOTH xbox and Playstation controllers! This also means you can change the sensitivity, as well as invert the Y-axis.\nYou can also adjust your network settings for when you want to play with friends over a local network, or against other people publicly.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis game is absolutely fantastic! It is surprisin'ly competetive, and I believe real tournaments can be made for this game. The skillgap is certianly real, and there is very little "luck". The hitbox is precise and correct, the bots are well programmed and are certianly there to make gameplay a challenge. There are enough customization options, as well as custom game settings that's able to be made. I would certianly recommend that you and your friends grab a copy of this game(it's 9,99 euros. Can't go wrong with a purchase like that!), you'll have a lot of fun!\n\n~Melee","October 15, 2014","true","19.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

As a robot, you wheel around picking up the neon balls (pretty much everyhing is neon in this game) and throw them at people. Deathmatch and it's team based counterpart are not all this game has to offer however. Superball is a personal favorite of mine, where there is one yellow ball, and the holder gegts one point every second for his team, while his teamates protect him, and enemies try to hit him. The soundtrack is pretty good, and having played from early beta, the developement has come a long way, and I don't see it stopping any time soon. As for the price tag, mehhh. If you think the game looks great, go ahead and buy it, also if you have a couple extra bucks to throw around. But personally, for me, $10 is a little on the high side, I would wait for one of Steams fantastic sales. I got a key through my Humble Bundle page just for having the Beta. This isn't much of a sit down with your friends and play kinda game, so don't expect that either. Usually when I play this game I just log half an hour and then find something else, but it doesn't get boring in the log run, I just don't find it attention grabbing enough that I can sit through an hour long play session. And with 3-10 minute games (depends on the team stacking) I don't think thats too unreasonable. As of the writing of this review, I only have .8 hours on record, but don't be mislead, I got a key from the developer a couple months ago on reddit, so most of my hours are logged on there. Overall, yes it's good and I recommend it, but the price tag does seem a tad high.","March 28, 2014","true","5.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

That was when I realized RRDDD is my new favorite multiplayer game.\n\nProps:\n- Fast-paced, physics-based, arena "shooter" gameplay with surprising depth.\n- Great variety of game modes. Deathmatch, Elimination, and Capture the Cube are all solid stand-by modes. For me, though, the real gem is Hoops, which is basically basketball mixed with dodgeball. Really fun stuff.\n- Ridiculously fast load times. Joining a server takes a few seconds (!) on average.\n- Simple, but impressive, graphics. Neon lights flash and strobe along with the music.\n- Excellent music (and if it's not to your taste, you have the ability to import and play your own music in-game...and yes, the lights will strobe in time with your custom music too!)\n- Friendly, welcoming community.\n- Developer is active, involved on forums, and truly listens to feedback. A real mensch.\n- Robot mustaches.\n\nSlops:\n- Some latency issues to be resolved. Playing on a dedicated server should fix the issue, but dedicated servers are not publicly searchable at this time. Once they are, RRDDD could become a truly competitive game. But for now, the occasional rubber-banding/collision detection failures will remain a minor annoyance. I really don't want to overstate the issue, though. Most of the time lag/latency gives me little to no trouble.\n- I can't think of anything else to complain about.\n\nRRDDD is an astonishingly well-polished game given that it is the product of one developer. Erik has really hit on something genius here: gameplay that is immediately, viscerally, undeniably fun. Rarely do I play a game of RRDDD without someone commenting something along the lines of "this game is so much fun." It seems like an obvious thing -- most games are supposed to be "fun" -- but how often do people really feel the need to state it? Well, RRDDD is so much fun, that you will involuntarily cry out "THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN" every time you play it. There is nothing you can do to prevent it.\n\nIn summary, the only valid reason to not want to play this game is that you hate fun.

Almost all of them are intense and fun.\n+Play against real people or play against the bots, which I enjoy playing against as well.\n+Good laughs on some of the ridiculous plays you can make and that happen to you.\n+Dev is one guy and he seems to care a lot about the game.\n+The throws just feel right and it you can get lucky, but it requires quite a bit of skill.\n+Powerups help change things up and keep the game interesting.\n+There's quite a few "levels" to play on.\n+Graphics for me are lively and fit the game well.\n\nOn to the things that I believe could be improved:\n-The jumps feel a bit to floaty for me.  Too easy to get caught midair imo\n-There's not that many sound tracks.  You could mute and play your own music if you want though of course.\n-I don't see an option to customize the robot at this point.\n\nBONUS: The dev has plans to add a lot to the game.  I don't count it as a plus because you don't know if it will happen, but you can see in his post that he wants to add steam workshop to fix the robot customization problem, a level editor, more powerups, etc.\n\nAs the game is at this very moment, I already would wholeheartedly recommend the game at full price.  It's not a AAA release or really flashy, but it is a whole lot of fun, which is what I play games for.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/270450/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","I first saw Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball on the Steam store during Early Access. I was interested in this game because of the Disco Dodgeball part of the title, as I am a fan of the disco genre. I bought the game after it left Early Access. As I was introduced to this game, I was treated to a flashy arena filled with bright colors and entertaining disco music. This game has both single player and multiplayer, but it places more emphasis on multiplayer since it puts you, a rolling robot with one wheel, against other rolling robots. You are either with the red team or blue team. Your robot looks strikingly similar to Claptrap from the Borderlands series.\n\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball looks like a first-person shooter, but the weapon you use is a ball inside a futuristic looking arena with ramps, robots from your team, and robots from the opposing team. The game emphasizes combat with that ball and you can score one hit kills just like your opponents can do to you. There is never a dull moment in this game, as the music is always rocking and your robot is constantly running around the arena either trying to knock out your opposing robot or trying to avoid getting knocked out. It takes some time to master the skills of advanced movements such as blowing up a robot while in mid-air or blowing up a robot with a ricochet hit. So, this game is wildly different than traditional first-person shooters.\n\nThe main mode is deathmatch, which requires your team to reach a particular score before your opponent does by scoring knockouts with your ball. There are powerups scattered around the arena that can give you an edge, such as a boomerang, higher jumps, extra ricochets, bigger balls for easier knockouts, easier targeting, etc. There are many other modes that enhance replay value with the main objective of scoring team points that have nothing to do with scoring knockouts. For example, hoops is a basketball-like mode that requires your team to find a specific ball to shoot through a hoop for a point and the team that shoots the most hoops wins. This mode puts your movement skills to the test because shooting hoops is extremely difficult while constantly moving. You will have to learn to use the brake key in order to shoot accurately. Another interesting mode is capture the cube, a mode that requires you to steal a cube from your opponent and race with the cube to place in your domain for a point. While the main goal is to score points with the cube, you can use your balls to knock out opponents to increase your personal level. Increasing your personal level will allow you to buy certain upgrades for future matches such as gears and other equipment. Other than teams, you can opt for free for all (FFA) competition in each mode. FFA requires all robots to compete for themselves, meaning you score for yourself and not for a team.\n\nThose who are used to first-person shooters will feel right at home because the mouse/keyboard configuration is familiar. The mouse is very effective in moving your futuristic robot in all directions. You can learn to catch balls thrown at you so that you can throw them back at your opponent for quick knockouts/kills. Mastering your movements can help you score creative kills which will increase your personal/robot level. Creative kills include the aforementioned killing in mid-air, ricochet kills, and long distance kills.\n\nOne cool feature in this game is the ability to hit the F5 key to record the last four seconds of your gameplay. Recording the last 4 seconds of gameplay will be saved as a .gif file. You can place the .gif file in the artwork section of your Steam page to show off your sudden kills and talented moves. This type of recording is very rare for any video game.\n\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is an exciting game in terms of gaudy graphics and gameplay. I wish there were more music available, especially American disco. The music in the game sounds like European disco only, but it’s still very entertaining and will keep players upbeat. There are many levels of arenas with wildly different shapes and many modes that have different goals for scoring and winning matches.  I recommend this game for its looks, gameplay, and extremely high replay value. Kudos to Erik Asmussen for making a fine indie game.\n\nMy score: 8/10\n","June 18, 2015","true","10.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Everybody plays as a robot running around the arena, picking up balls, throwing them at each other, and getting power-ups.  It's the kind of hilarious chaotic fun that is fantastic for LAN get togethers or big groups of people.  The soundtrack is fantastic, the visuals are bright and the colors of the arena vibrate to the beat of the song that is playing.  It's a simple game with simple mechanics and it is very visually appealing and nicely polished.  There's a single player mode which pits you up against a number of special oppenents to really help you train so you can beat the snot out of your friends later.  It even has it's own steam inventory, so you can collect aesthetic items and trade them with your friends.  If anybody could know that this is a good dodgeball game, it would be me.\n-Patches O'Houlihan","February 7","true","4.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've always loved quick paced skill based shooters, like Fistful of Frags and Double Action, as opposed to more tactical shooters, so this game is perfect for me. The game also features a great soundtrack, and eye catching visuals that look like they belong in a disco club, but fit perfectly with this game. The game is updated regularly, and each update is a pleasant suprise. At the moment, there's a pretty big variety of multiplayer modes (conventional modes like TDM and elimination, but also some unique modes like demolition derby and super ball) and there's a fair share of single player modes to try as well. It's a simple concept, but the game does a great job of keeping things interesting and keeping you addicted for hundreds of hours. It's easy to pick up and get into, but takes a very long time to master.\n\nI'd recommend this game to pretty much anyone looking for a quality skill based FPS. The community would love to welcome some new members.","January 31, 2015","true","194.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It is exactly as the title states. You play dodgeball as robots on wheels, all in a disco setting. What more do you really want?\n\nIf you've played dodgeball when you were young, or perhaps playing it in gym class today, you'll be familiar with the rules. Take ball, throw at opponent, knock opponent out. If you catch an enemy ball the person who tossed it is out. Pretty simple but also really easy to get into and very fun. The game also mixes things up with tons of different maps and more play modes than I originally expected. Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball also features single play mode to keep you busy on lower population times.\n\nIndie multi-player games tend to have a hard time holding a consistent community, but Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball seem to almost always have a few players online at least. The only exception I saw was during the late late night on week days, which is understandable. But if you play during the day and you'll almost always find players. This is a great sign that the game is healthy, people are enjoying it, and has potential to grow.\n\nThe great thing about Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is that it has enough twitch gameplay to keep many "hardcore" gamers satisfied, while simple enough that even the most casual player can get the hang of after a single round. It's very accessible yet offers a reasonable skill ceiling to climb.\n\nThough there is plenty to like about Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball, there are some hic-ups along the way. Bugs can plague the game, and they are quite noticeable. They vary from being as severe as floating off to no where, to as minor as having to hit "esc" to start moving. It is in early access and I understand this, but since the game is asking for your hard earned money, I think it's justified mentioning these things at the very least.\n\nOverall Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball is a great little game that has some addictive qualities to it. It's accessible, it's twitchy, and it's a whole lot of fun! (Just make sure to swat those nasty bugs :P)\n\nPros:\n- Accessible\n- Twitchy for the seasonal gamer\n- Well themed\n- Healthy community\n\nCons:\n- Can be buggy at times","January 24, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Disco Dodgeball takes a simple idea and amps it up with sweet beats and colourful visual elements. Perfect as a party game to play with friends and equally fun alone, there are a bunch of game modes, neat power-ups and trickshots. I never thought I'd be as fond of this game as I've become, which to me is grounds for recommendation in itself. If I had to describe it in a word, it would definitely be FUN. Which sounds ambiguous, I know, but it's like every element of this game has been engineered to get you pumped up and excited to chuck balls at robots, which it totally does.\n\nI've watched this game grow and adapt for quite awhile now and it really has come a long way, especially visually. The developer really listens to the community's ideas and is always working to fix and improve the game, which really shows. For a beta, this game is extremely solid. The only real negative to comment on is the lack of players at this point in time, but I really hope that changes upon full release because this game really, really deserves a good fanbase.","December 11, 2014","true","109.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This game is everything you want in an early access. It has insanely fun multiplayer and the best community I've seen of any game on Steam. I ran some tournamants and everyone was nice and supportive. You are in various arenas and the object is to pick up dodgeballs and throw them at the other team. Simple. A nice twist on the fact you have to pick up the projectiles instead of having a gun. There are lots of gamemodes and Erik (the developer) is always adding new ones as well as maps. The only bad thing about this game is that more people don't play it :D. There are usually 2 or 3 people playing with 10 or so on weekends. BUY THIS GAME.

The music is freaking amazing. It fits the game perfectly and you cant help but get lost in the trance-y electronic beats.\n\nNext is the visual style. Simple neon graphics. Fits the game perfectly. Not to mention robots with moustaches.\n\nThe controls are perfect. Sensitivity can be adjusted and the movement is intuitive, although at first you may find yourself a little thrown off by the slidey nature of the robots. You find yourself effortlessly air striking opponent robots from 60m away or showing off with a 360 Helicopter dunk. (DUUUUUUNK!)\n\nThe game features many gamemodes, the most commonly played of which are probably the Deathmatch, Free for All, Score Battle and Team Elimination. There are some modes that really mix it up like hoops, horde or super cube.\n\nOf course there are the occasional frustrating situations where you *swear* you had hit the guy but the kill didn't register. This isn't really a problem that can be circumvented EXCEPT for the fact that there is a 'switch host' function, so you can change the host to the person with the best ping to minimise lag!\n\nThe community is really great and helpful and this is truly one of the best and funnest multiplayer experiences I have had in a long time. I hope to see the game grow and flourish as it progresses to completion.\n\nThe developer, Erik, is a great guy and he listens to feedback/suggestions.\n\nA must get.\n\n9.5/10\n","September 17, 2014","true","16.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

(duh!) The main difference between real-life and Disco dodgeball is how there is no barrier to spereate teams. Yeah, you can turn around and get mashed in the face with a bright, glowing orb of terror. ( I mean a dodgeball, not that guy from The Regular Show)\n\n[h]Pros[/h]\nVery original concept.

That reminds me...\nYou can add your own music. t might not be the most well known feature or even the best implemented but it's there and its real handy.\nArcade mode is a blast, expecially when you havve friends' scores to beat.\nVery simple online settings. I know that there are special tools to make fancy, dedicated servers but the in-game server list and "make an online game" tools are about all you'll ever need.\nEnough modifiers to crush a wooly mammoth with. Want to play a low-gravity, game of FFA while one half can shoot lazer balls and the other have jet-packs? Now you can!\n\n[h]Cons[/h]\nLaggy online.

They go from having the aim of a Stormtrooper to freaking Clint Eastwood depending on if they're "Medium" or "Easy"\nNon-existent servers. Good luck trying to find an online game.\nHaven't seen the developer in a while. Gone are the times of the weekly or even monthly updates. The last update was like 3 months before this reveiw was written. (Comment if this changes and I'll rewrite it)\n\nI can't recommend this game enough if you like fast-paced games or if you just have a few friends.

Just got out of playing around on this game with friends. We were all, "Hey this game looks pretty fun let's check it out". It is now 2 hours later. 2 hours of screaming and yelling and amazing trick shots that are pure luck. This game is so much fun in a multiplayer sense it astounds me how entertaining a game with robots throwing balls at each other can be. Just...wow. And not only that, there are different "scores" for getting kills. It features objective type gameplay aswell as your typical team deathmatch and free for all types. The game is INTENSE. The intensity level never dies.

It's a first-person shooter game of dodgeball in vibrant, flashy arenas with an amazing soundtrack to pump you up. Incredibly addictive (at least until after putting in about 40 hours of playtime)! The one downside I'd say is that you can't expect to be playing with a huge amount of people. On average each day, there are 20-30 people online, but it is early access so it makes sense. Even so, playing with bots is still really fun.\n\nI can't believe I forgot to mention this, but the developer, Erik, is always updating and is always talking with the community.

So far I've only played for about an hour and a half, but I can already tell it's amazing. The music playing in the background affects the colors flashing on the stage, which are brilliantly bright to the point where when it dims a bit, I can barely see where I'm going. Unlike FPS games like TF2 and CoD, this "FPS" game has no n00b level; after going through a short tutorial, I headed straight into a multiplayer game. Sure I wasn't that great at first, but after 30 minutes, I felt like a pro everytime I nailed someone. The controls are simple, there are multiple awesome stages, and dodgeballs everywhere. Despite only having played for a short period so far, this game is definitely up there in my favorites. I "own" this game through Family Share, but if you have ten bucks to spare, definitely buy this.","December 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Has many dodgeball elements such as blocking and deflecting oppenent's projectiles with a ball of your own. The robotic nature of the players makes movement very unique compared to traditional FPS where is it possible to instantly change direction. The momentum of the movement makes leading targets more strategic and less guesswork. I'm garbage at this game, but it's still very fun to play occassionally. The only bad thing about this game is the lack of online players. Sometimes you can find a full server, but in my experience bots seem to be the only way to go unless you can gather some mates.","January 31, 2015","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Leading the balls to hit a person feels very reminiscent of old skool shooters a la Quake.\nTheres a cool tricksystem in place and the game moves at a rapid speed through a nice variation of modes. Also the soundtrack is very catchy and fits the mood of the game.\n\nThis game comes best to it's right when you're playing multiplayer, but if you're more into singleplayer games than you can  play against bots in the arcade. This is a roundbased mode that puts you against one or more bots and eventually bosses. In between rounds , you can buy upgrades / modifiers with the money you earn from killing the bots in a stylish fashion.\n\nAll in all this is a super solid fragfest.

Holy Crow is this game fun! As you can see from the videos, the graphics won't knock your socks off, but in a game such as this graphics can and should take a back seat to playability. The playability of this game is FANTASTIC! Different game modes, game modifiers and an XP/leveling system. We played it for a couple of hours last night and I fell in love with it! One drawback at this time is the lack of players, which is fine because you can create a game with bots of whose playing level you can set yourself. As I suggestion I would like to see a minimap/radar included as an option on the HUD or in-game option as sometimes in larger maps it can be hard to find targets/opponents/objectives.","February 5, 2015","true","30.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game aesthetically has a lot going on as you can imagine but it also offers a quite in depth option menu despite coming out of early acces only recently of this post so you can tune the visuals as you see fit.\n\nThe dodgeballs are one hit kill but can be caught(which can be quite difficult) and you have the option of whether you want to play with power-ups or not, which can vary from uncatchable balls to increasing the hitbox size. The game offers  unique game modes along side those you typically find, these include hoops where a basketball element is thrown in, grand prix which adds a racing element and high score; where your score when eleminating someone is dictated by how stylish your shot was.\n\nPros\n\n-Great LAN game, can always pick it up and have a fun hour or two with friends\n-Diverse game modes\n-Suprisingly expansive options menu\n-Can import your own music and have the lights/lasers adapt to it!\n-New mechanical elements\n-Doesn't take up much hard drive space\n\nCons\n\n- Some of the settings may cause certain people headaches\n- Mostly multi-player centric (Has single player but it's strengths lie in multiplayer)","March 7, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's such a great online game, and the fact that it's based around using dodgeballs allows for it to feel incredibly unique. Since you're only allowed to carry one at a time, it becomes really exhilarating when you see a cluster of enemies, and have to decide whether you want to go for the easy kill when as soon as you release the ball, you KNOW you'll have to scramble for another one or do your best to evade whatever they can throw at you. The balls also move with momentum and a speed that seems highly appropriate, which works great with the way the robots control.\n\nOn top of just excellent feeling gameplay, you also have about 6 different game types, all which manage to feel unique, along with a training mode that allows you to get a feel for any of the environments you choose, and a single player horde mode. Speaking of single player, while there is no campaign or anything, the addition of playing offline with bots is a definite advantage, along with the ability to fill empty spots in online games with them as well to balance out the teams. In most games, bots tend to be completely useless, but there have been several games i've played with 6/8 human players where a bot manages to finish in the top three without the game feeling overwhelmingly cheap.\n\nEasily a recommended purchase in my book, especially for the price and amount of polish at such an early point in it's release. The soundtrack alone is probably worth this much, if not more.

Reminiscent of old-school arena shooters, Disco Dodgeball offers a rich and compelling multiplayer experience. It features a diverse list of game modes and power ups that make every match an adrenaline-inducing ride. Soaked in neon paint and powered by electronic dance music, the arenas react to you, the match and the soundtrack. Although still in early access, the game receives regular updates that improve on core systems and listen to feedback from the community.

I am not very good at this game because I am so used to the movement in other FPS games (ie QuakeLive), but I can still get my frags.   The disco maps are hilarious.  The only thing I do not understand is the 'shield' (spawn protection) when opponents first regenerate.   I wish there was a way to tell when they are protected from being fragged.   So many times I fired a dodgeball at an opponent - only to see on my screen that they were spawn protected.  I THINK it is for 3 seconds, but there is no way to tell - as far as I know.

I've discovered RRDDD way before it was on Steam via Nerd³'s video on it, and I can say it has come a long way since then. Reasons to buy this:\n\nAmazing visual and audio effects (the announcer is aweome)\nMany different game modes (e. g. Classic Deathmatch, Last Team Standing "Elimination", Capture the Cube, Hoops - and even possible in Free For All)\nPower-ups like super-jump, jetpack, huge balls (hey, I didn't name them, ok?), homing dodgeballs etc.\nGroovy soundtrack\nRegular updates by one-man team Erik (!)\n... and so much fun pretty much like in no other game. It's by far the most-played game I have on Steam.\nThere might be some lags (~150 ping from Europe to the US East Coast server), but this issue got resolved by implementing region servers a few updates ago. So, what are you waiting for? Time to flood the servers!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mungojojo/recommended/270450/","mungojojo","de_Pykii2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mungojojo/","179 products in account","Okay. First thing's first. I'm not going to say that this game is life-changing or breaks the boundaries between videogames and art, or that it is even an incredible game...but that's not a bad thing. Just because this game doesn't break any new ground or pose a philosophical question, doesn't make it a sh**ty game. Modern media has created this idea that for a game to be respected, it has to make people view the world in a new light. Well, guess what? This is Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball. It's a game about robots on roller skates, often with moustaches, zipping around a disco with flashing lights and electro music, throwing balls at eachother. It hasn't provoked any reaction in me to make me go; 'Dear God!!! My life has a new meaning!!!'. Instead, it made me say; 'Ohh I'm gonna kill this skate-riding robo-sunnuffab**ch' (this was actually a genuine reaction). I like this game. It's fun. It's quick. But the best part about this game's fun-ness, is the fact that it's stupid. Goat Simulator, is stupid. It's funny at first (the amount of time I found Goat Sim funny for can be measured in themtoseconds), but it's not fun. RR-DDD is impressive in the amount of pros it has, despite the strong overtones of stupidity. It's tight controls and fun visuals have given me some good times. It's a little pricey, and a price drop or a sale might be necessary before it's entirely worth investing your money in, but don't let the price stop you if you like an FPS which requires a decent level of tactical skill (I'm looking at you Call of Duty). If the price is too much for you personally, try it out with a friend who already owns it. It might not be your cup of tea. As I say, it requires some tactical practice which may not be something you want in your robot related disco-shooters. However, if you're not a fan of tactical strategy games and like some fast-paced fun, I recommend this game greatly, along with a few games like Awesomenauts (easier) or Ratz Instagib (much harder). In conclusion, I give this game an 8.5/10. It's cool, but is lacking in areas which I won't go into, because I really don't want to put you off. It's fun, and you should give it a go. Why the heck would you listen to me anyway? I'm a random dude off the internet.\nFinally, I don't think that this game is incredible or brilliant, but that's okay. You know why?\n\n\nBecause it's a game about roller-skating robots in a f**king disco.","October 18, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball has an amazing soundtrack. Not only does it fit what is going on in the game, it really pumps you up and gets you ready to crush nooblords in the ring of dodgeball. The controls are excellent when you get a hang of them, and you can really get sweet kills when you combine your jump and boost correctly.\nThis game also feels incredibly rewarding. Getting a kill feels awesome. Catching a ball feels awesome. Catching a ball and then getting a guy behind the person who threw the ball at you is awesome. Getting killed and then getting a mid-air kill on the person who killed you feels amazing. I've experienced this in bots alone.\n\nThis game is tons of fun. But the community is very small at the moment. This isn't really a bad thing though. You will recognise a lot of people if you play on public servers often. I haven't met a single person that has a negative attitude. But, sometimes you cannot find a server with people in it and have to play with bots.\n\nThe bots in this game aren't the average bots. The easy bots can be a challenge even after you play this game for a while. The bots are getting worked on often, and this has gave us the result of challenging bots. The bots actually use teamwork, like passing the ball to you or someone in need, or protecting somebody that is completing and objective in some game modes like Capture the Cube.\n\nThere are also a lot of game modes, with more going to be released. One of the ones I like is Score Battle. In this game mode you have to rack up a certain number of points for your team (or yourself if it's free-for-all) by getting points for killing other players. You get more points for doing crazier skill shots, such as a Helicopter, or a Dunk.\n\nThis game is just good. Real good. Before I said don't buy it until the community grows. Now I say support this game and Developer (https://twitter.com/82apps). They both deserve the support. This game is incredibly fun, and will only get better. As of now, I only have 3 hours played. This will definetely increase. Buy it, love it, and then finally remember it's full name.\n\nEDIT: Updating at the release of the Arcade mode. This game has done nothing but get better and better. Buy it now before it's price gets increased. If your friends get in on this game with you, it's INCREDIBLY fun. Powerups, maps, modes, and more have been added and I love it.","June 25, 2014","true","54.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In fact, I had only heard of it once it got out of Early Access and hit the Steam Store on the front page. When I saw it, I immediately purchased a 4-pack solely because of the trailer video.\n\nWhat's this game about? Dodgeball! You throw a ball at your target and they're out! Or, if they catch it, you're out. What does this mean in the game? You die. Plain and simple. Then you respawn and do it all over again. It's not that simple, however, because there's Trick Shots and a Brake key. Trick Shots net you more EXP for your unlocks and Points on Score Rush, while the Brake key stops you from moving. You should remember these to make the best of them.\n\nI have 46 hours on record from the time of this post. I have no regrets with buying the 4-pack even though my friends don't play it much anymore. This game is THAT good. I'm even far enough to say that this is my new favorite FPS game.\n\nI used to play TF2, but once this game showed its face, I quickly threw TF2 aside in favor of it. Not just because of the fact that hitscan doesn't exist (I'm terrible with hitscan), not because it's simple, but because at it's core it's FUN. TF2 stopped being fun, and this game filled the void TF2 had left me with.\n\nI beat Arcade Mode once, I can trump Horde Mode pretty well, I'm pretty good at playing pubs on multiplayer, but that doesn't mean I'm a master at it yet. The gameplay ability of some of the higher-leveled players are godly, so if you think this game's got a lack of options, you've got a lot to learn. However, this isn't to deter you. The community from what I've noticed is mostly friendly and willing to chat a bit during the match. You might even get some pointers if you ask.\n\nMultiplayer's not perfect, due to latency with the servers, but it's enjoyable if you're ping is good.\n\nI haven't done everything in this game yet, but for what it's worth, I'm having my fair share of fun. I fully recommend it.","May 2, 2015","true","168.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lacent/recommended/270450/","lacent","Lacent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lacent/","251 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI bought this game in support of games that are compatible with Linux. That being said, I didn't buy it on a whim. It seemed like a fun arena type game to kill some time with. Which it is. RR-DDD is a very simple but easy to pick up game that will have you hooked for quite a while.\n\nThere are different modes with team based play, and FFA options so the variety that is available makes things interesting. The core mechanics are nice too. If you've ever played dodgeball in real life, it's the same thing. There are also various power-ups to get, which change your strategy slightly. The bots in a match can be challenging, which is nice.\n\nAs for a couple of downsides: This game seems to be from a very small operation development-wise. So updates may come a bit slower than other games. Also, sometimes the ball doesn't register as a hit when you clearly see it bounce off the opponent on your screen. Lastly, servers are hosted by players on their local machine. This means that since there aren't a ton of people playing, there aren't many servers to play on. When there are, the quality of the connection varies based on the host's connection speed.\n\n\nAll in all a great game. I would definitely recommend buying it if it goes on sale for any amount.","October 17, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

IDK, but boy it sure feels like a completed flash game. Never have I had the amazing feeling of throwing balls and balls flying toward my face (not a joke). The games controls feel a little strange at first and when I say that I really mean you'll get used to the controls in under 5 minutes of gameplay. It actually feels smooth and responsive to your every input via keyboard. The colorful lights and AMAZING soundtrack or BGM is probably my favorite part of the game. it makes sence for a game about Robots and Dodgeball. The game offers a nice selection of game options allowing your dodgeball matches to go any which way. Normal Dodgeball, Score Attack, Basketball, Survival, Racing, etc. There are special kills you get for pulling off unique throws, such as the longshot kill, the helicopter kill, quick shot kill, a basic killing spree, aeriel kill, and most importantly: The Catch kill. The hardest things you will deal with in this game is the following:\n1) Trying to catch someones ball (like in real Dodgeball) You must click your mouse at the EXACT MOMENT its about to hit you, otherwise you die. Seems Legit.\n2) Jumping, you feel floaty but you eventually adapt to it.\n3) Seizures, yeah make sure you play at a safe distance from your moniter, and play with the lights on or turn off some of the video options, I nearly got one but no biggy.\n4) Music, Just listen, you will enjoy it, I'm 99.9% sure you will.\nTo conclude, Robots + Dodgeball + Pretty Colors + Awesome Music = Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball...

The simple answer is a game you'll love.\n\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball (RRDDD or just Disco Dodgeball) is a fast-paced high-flying game where the simple objective is to take a dodgeball and SLAM it into your oponent's face. Don't be fooled though, RRDDD isn't a game that you can jump into and instantly be bestowed the title "President of the Galaxy", it takes practice and time to improve your disco dodging skills. The AI can be adjusted to suit your experience making the game fun to play for players of all skill levels.\n\nDisco Dodgeball includes assorted gamemodes so gameplay never becomes stale and a few challenge modes for you to test your skills. What kind of game would this be if you weren't able to dominate your friends in multiplayer? Bots, despite their very human-like appearance, can sometimes be tiring, so just find a match on multiplayer jump right in!\nAmazing graphics, spectacular music, caring developer, Disco Dodgeball is a must and deffinitely worth your time","January 5, 2015","true","344.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Essentially a twitch shooter in the vein of Quake, Unreal, with a bit of RIchochet-y vibe thrown in (where's Richochet: Source GabeN??), this color drenched, electrictronic dance music stuffed masterpiece worth everyone's attention.\n\nI love dodgeball. Who doesn't? Maybe I'm in love with this game just because as a chubby child I was always picked last for the game in P.E. and this is a way for me to live out my childhood. Regardless, this game is about an intense, over the top dodgeball match involving robots skating around on weird unicyle wheels while bright colors and music pulse continously. The game even follows all the standard rules of dodgeball; you can catch balls, bounce balls back if you're holding a ball, and during elimination modes you even get your teamates back in by catching the ball. There are plenty of game modes, from standard FFA and team deathmatch modes, to capture the flag and a basketball-like hoop mode. Surprisingly enough for a multiplayer focused game, the single player is pretty fleshed out, including various challenges and boss modes to get you warmed up for the multiplayer.\n\nDodgeball fits into the twitch based shooter genre like a pair of well worn jeans. The balls travel at a pretty slow rate compared to projectiles in other video games, so there is definitely a large amount of skill involved on leading and hitting each target. In addition to this, the afore-mentioned unicyle wheels make it more difficult to maneuver around instead of the standard WASD. However, after some practice you'll learn to use the movement system to your own advantage, hoping around and out-juking your opponents. When you land a badass trickshot by jumping over your opponents head, avoiding his mis-aimed toss, and slamming your ball into his face. That's amazing. When you strafe sideways, catch an opponents ball and jump into the air, spinning around to nail his buddy in the side.That's really freaking amazing. The game is chock-full of moments like this.\n\nDon't take my word for it, try out the free demo in the store page. Within ten seconds you'll see what I'm talking about. My main fear is the viability of the long term multiplayer community, but so far, a game of this quality will have hardcore fans that will stick around for a long, long time. I will admit I was skeptical seeing the game's ridiculously overwhelmingly positive reviews on steam. But they were all correct.

It's one of those games that is amazing in small doses. Play a couple matches every once in a while, and it's great. Play it more often and it's kinda frustrating.\n\nIn the multiplayer mode, which I imagine would be the most popular, I end up in games where half the teams are bots. While I normally like this feature, the bots are just way too accurate, and can be frustrating. This is most noticeable in Hoops, where the bots will get the ball, and make insanely fast and accurate shots into the hoop the moment they're able. I've also gotten stuck a small number of times, but other than that, it's been bug-free for me.\n\nI feel this game is for fans of multiplayer first person shooters that grew tired of the immature crowd that ruined Halo, CoD, and Battlefield. Those games may be more polished, but it's not by much. And they take themselves too seriously, which is great for 14 year olds, but those of us with some gaming experience tend to enjoy the silliness factor of gaming a bit more.\n\nOverall, this game may not get as many hours played as other games like Skyrim or Cities: Skylines, but I'm glad I have this in my library. It's a blast to play a couple matches every now and then.\n\nHighly recommended","May 18, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehfuglyCanuck/recommended/270450/","TehfuglyCanuck","Big Papa Roller Derby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehfuglyCanuck/","125 products in account","This game is addictive. Like, really really addictive. Gameplay consists of controlling a robot that you can customize and going into a disco skate park and throwing dodgeballs at other robots or completing the objectives of the other game modes. The basic mechanics are just like dodgeball itself.\n-Go find a ball.\n-Catch one thrown at you.\n-Dude who throws it is out and/or(I dont play the team modes alot) a teammate comes back in.\n-Another ball thrown at you.\n-Block it.\n-Throw it at dude.\n-Miss because you keep thinking you have a gun instead.\n-Realize you play too much Doom.\n-Rinse, repeat.\n\nNormally when it comes to multiplayer only games like this I get bored very quickly. But a few things keep me coming back. Some of the levels have a great design with multiple levels allowing attacks from above or a well place shot from below. And with physics coming into play you can find yourself easily flying in the air and throwing a ball at a faraway target and scoring an awesome kill prompting the announcer to yell "mid-air" or "top-gun". Everytime you get a kill through a trick-shot, the announcer says the name and not gonna lie, picking up a ball then immediately throwing it at a guy with "quick-draw" popping up feels pretty badass. And to top it all off the music is just plain awesome, getting your adrenaline pumping for some awesome dodgeball action. However their are only around 10 tracks in the game so I recommend getting a few more from the workshop.\n\nTheir are about 10 multiplayer modes with most being able to switch from free for all to teams. There is also an arcade mode for singleplayer where you play increasingly difficult levels, buying upgrades and fighting bosses until you become president of the galaxy. If you lose all your lives however, you start all over. Along with that, their are 4 challenge modes that have tasks such as a basic survival mode and a mode where you are invincible and need to rack up as many points as possible. There are also offline bot matches to play which is where I've racked up a majority of my 10 hours playtime. Online is also pretty good. Even with my ♥♥♥♥ internet surprisingly. The netcode I had read about before must have been patched or something because I was able to pull off trick shots online just as well.\n\nPros\n-Fun Skill-based gameplay\n-Multi-leveled arenas are awesome\n-Awesome Quake inspired announcer\n-Trickshots feel awesome to do\n-Music\n-Music...again\n-Not a grey and brown shooter...or loadouts(sorry I had to rip on modern shooters)\n-Moustaches\n\nCons\n-I sometimes get caught for a second on walls or rails\n-A kill cam might be good to see some pro-strat kills\n-The flatter maps are a little meh. Their great at first but levels like Temple are awesome\n-The hats area of customization is empty at first...I really want a top hat and monacle\n\nMisc\n-There are modifiers. But I only use the big head mode. The rest I feel would just kinda ruin it. Like low grav. Don't do it. But meh they don't detract from the overall product\n\nConclusion: Buy it. Lose your life. Worried about purchasing without liking it? Get the demo. Review not funny enough? Well fuddle duddle look at my icon. Smile.\n\n\nMoustaches","May 27, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elhobo/recommended/270450/","elhobo","The Master Hobo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elhobo/","74 products in account","TLDR below\n\nRobot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball: a unique name for a unique game. I've played some good games, some bad games; I've played games for long periods of time, and I've played games for a few minutes before dropping them forever; and somehow, this game is a shining monument to what a game can be.\n\nThe game itself is pure arena-FPS bliss, with the fun new twists a dodgeball theme would bring. You can choose to weave through a storm of murderous projectiles, or you can drop your own and bring demise to your foes by catching. Various game modes bring on entirely new styles of play: care is required to not die in elimination, while throwing caution to the wind to make a spectacular kill is totally acceptable in score battle. Powerups can turn the tide of battle if you use them correctly and can get you killed if you don't. The rolling movement is slightly difficult to acclimate to but definitely works to help the flow of the game. And of course, it wouldn't be an arena shooter if you didn't have an announcer stating your helicopter kills and your killstreak.\n\nHowever, the community and dev are what make the game truly outstanding. The community, albeit small, is full of great people willing to help you on your quest to dodgeball greatness or just chat. Bitter rivalries and strong friendships amongst veteran players make the game almost feel like a sport. Erik, our fabulous dev, keeps the updates coming many months after the game's release, through having a kid and working on a new project. He posted a post-mortem of the game a year after release, outlining the development process, the games strengths and drawbacks, and his plans for the future (link at bottom if you want to read it). Shortly after this, he dropped the games base price from 15 USD to 8 as part of an ongoing attempt to fix one of the game's major problems: the lack of players. He's constantly in the forums answering questions, looking for bugs to patch, and just trying to make everyone have a great experience.\n\nAt this point I must implore you, reader who is considering this purchase: do the community, the dev, and most importantly, yourself a favor; buy this game.\n\nTLDR: great mechanics, great community, great dev, great purchase!\nLink to post-mortem: http://www.82apps.com/DiscoDodgeball/blog/disco-dodgeball-postmortem.html\n\nEdit: Totally forgot about robot customization. Robot customization and trading/market is good if you're into that sort of thing but is not necessary.","March 30","true","75.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simple dodgeball simulator, with robots.\n\nIt weights little, the gameplay is easy to get into: you pick a ball, load the shot, shoot it, if it hits, you get a frag.\nYou also can do a (small) jump, and a (small) sprint.\nHas powerups, such as returning ball (more useful than it sounds), jetpack, longer sprint, bigger ball, and similar. Not game changing, but can spice up the gameplay.\n\nAs far as I played, there was no situation of some player hogging up a cool powerup and winning the match this way: death is the great equalizer.\nEveryone gets destroyed and often, the respawn time is almost null, maps are tight. This provides for frenetic action.\n\nSmall hiccup would be the movement, it's not fluid, but clunky.\nYour jumps are really small, you can't run really fast, sometimes you keep going even though you're not pressing anything: for all intents and purposes you're controlling a vehicle.\nRobot on wheels to be exact, not an fps character, so forget bunnyjumping, crouching or covers, you've got a limited set of movements and you're expected to make the best out of them.\nFlaw or feature, that's for you to decide, but it's still something you'll have to get used to if you plan on plaiyng properly.\n\nThere's a leveling up system, and you get drops that you can use to craft better skins for your character, a way to keep interest going after you've played all the maps and tried all the modes.\nSpeaking of that, the game doesn't really offer lots of diversity: regardless of the variations, you're still throwing balls at robots in a symmetrical arena with colors flashing to disco music.\n\nI'd compare this game to ratz:instagib or rocket league, it's a fast arena game, that will prove really amusing for the 10 to 20 minutes you'll be playing it. But gets dry if you try to dedicate more to it. Not that you can't, and the game encourages you to, but you've already seen all it has to offer. "been there, done that".\n\n\nWhen it's on sale for 5$ or less, it's worth it, as a 5$ title.\n15$ wouldn't really recommend, unless you desperately have a vehicular dodgeball arena simulator itch you need to scratch.","January 6","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the FPS genre getting flooded with the same boring repetitive spray and pray gameplay, Disco Dodgeball comes around and completely took over my PC. Simply put, the amount of time and effort put into this game is enough to warrant at least downloading the free demo. It's a FPS with Robots on wheels, and they try to throw high powered dodgeballs at you, what more do you want? The gameplay is smooth, and the soundtrack is wicked awesome. I highly reccomend this game. It's the most fun I've ever had in a game by myself. And it's even better with friends.

It is a skill based dodgeball tournament style game which relies on physics and control to win. There are so many options for single player that is amazes me. You can mess around with physics and many other features. The difficulty of the bots is very balanced and it is easy to progress skill to a peak.\nI can go on for hours about this game, but I would rather be playing it for hours. The music selection is awesome. I recommend downloading the soundtrack. You can also play the game by uploading your own music to listen to as you venture the neon maps.\nAs I was saying before, there are so many options in this game as well as types of objectives. Think of 5th grade gym class. Then imagine each kid being a neon robot on a wheel. Then imagine this game of dodgeball is in a black room with lights and music as if you were in an amazing adults only disco club. That sums up the gameplay portion pretty well.\nThere are many options for lag. This game works well in a window and is easy to make adjust to your needs. Overall, definately get this game on sale. Even then, you should just get this game whenever. $10.00 or less is an excellent price because you will get a bang for your buck. It is one of those games you can play for a long time without getting bored because of all the options you could change as the player.\nThe only disadvantage is that is not being updated so often and community maps should also be an option. It also is a very small community so online mode is sort of annoying to have to wait so long. I love the attacks, achievements, and everything else. This is my example of a 10/10 game.\n~thedubmark","December 6, 2015","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's one of those games that is amazing in small doses. Play a couple matches every once in a while, and it's great. Play it more often and it's kinda frustrating.\n\nIn the multiplayer mode, which I imagine would be the most popular, I end up in games where half the teams are bots. While I normally like this feature, the bots are just way too accurate, and can be frustrating. This is most noticeable in Hoops, where the bots will get the ball, and make insanely fast and accurate shots into the hoop the moment they're able. I've also gotten stuck a small number of times, but other than that, it's been bug-free for me.\n\nI feel this game is for fans of multiplayer first person shooters that grew tired of the immature crowd that ruined Halo, CoD, and Battlefield. Those games may be more polished, but it's not by much. And they take themselves too seriously, which is great for 14 year olds, but those of us with some gaming experience tend to enjoy the silliness factor of gaming a bit more.\n\nOverall, this game may not get as many hours played as other games like Skyrim or Cities: Skylines, but I'm glad I have this in my library. It's a blast to play a couple matches every now and then.\n\nHighly recommended","May 18, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehfuglyCanuck/recommended/270450/","TehfuglyCanuck","Big Papa Roller Derby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehfuglyCanuck/","125 products in account","This game is addictive. Like, really really addictive. Gameplay consists of controlling a robot that you can customize and going into a disco skate park and throwing dodgeballs at other robots or completing the objectives of the other game modes. The basic mechanics are just like dodgeball itself.\n-Go find a ball.\n-Catch one thrown at you.\n-Dude who throws it is out and/or(I dont play the team modes alot) a teammate comes back in.\n-Another ball thrown at you.\n-Block it.\n-Throw it at dude.\n-Miss because you keep thinking you have a gun instead.\n-Realize you play too much Doom.\n-Rinse, repeat.\n\nNormally when it comes to multiplayer only games like this I get bored very quickly. But a few things keep me coming back. Some of the levels have a great design with multiple levels allowing attacks from above or a well place shot from below. And with physics coming into play you can find yourself easily flying in the air and throwing a ball at a faraway target and scoring an awesome kill prompting the announcer to yell "mid-air" or "top-gun". Everytime you get a kill through a trick-shot, the announcer says the name and not gonna lie, picking up a ball then immediately throwing it at a guy with "quick-draw" popping up feels pretty badass. And to top it all off the music is just plain awesome, getting your adrenaline pumping for some awesome dodgeball action. However their are only around 10 tracks in the game so I recommend getting a few more from the workshop.\n\nTheir are about 10 multiplayer modes with most being able to switch from free for all to teams. There is also an arcade mode for singleplayer where you play increasingly difficult levels, buying upgrades and fighting bosses until you become president of the galaxy. If you lose all your lives however, you start all over. Along with that, their are 4 challenge modes that have tasks such as a basic survival mode and a mode where you are invincible and need to rack up as many points as possible. There are also offline bot matches to play which is where I've racked up a majority of my 10 hours playtime. Online is also pretty good. Even with my ♥♥♥♥ internet surprisingly. The netcode I had read about before must have been patched or something because I was able to pull off trick shots online just as well.\n\nPros\n-Fun Skill-based gameplay\n-Multi-leveled arenas are awesome\n-Awesome Quake inspired announcer\n-Trickshots feel awesome to do\n-Music\n-Music...again\n-Not a grey and brown shooter...or loadouts(sorry I had to rip on modern shooters)\n-Moustaches\n\nCons\n-I sometimes get caught for a second on walls or rails\n-A kill cam might be good to see some pro-strat kills\n-The flatter maps are a little meh. Their great at first but levels like Temple are awesome\n-The hats area of customization is empty at first...I really want a top hat and monacle\n\nMisc\n-There are modifiers. But I only use the big head mode. The rest I feel would just kinda ruin it. Like low grav. Don't do it. But meh they don't detract from the overall product\n\nConclusion: Buy it. Lose your life. Worried about purchasing without liking it? Get the demo. Review not funny enough? Well fuddle duddle look at my icon. Smile.\n\n\nMoustaches","May 27, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

From the cover of this game, the name sounds a little wonky, the music only sounded good in the trailer, and it looked a little amusing. Little did I know that this $10.00 game was one of the best casual FPS games that I've ever bought. If you were ever the kid who really liked dodgeball in gym class, this is the game for you. I can't tell you that I've never felt so badass as I have playing this game (well, I can, but when you hear "MID-AIR CATCH" announced by the movie trailer guy, you get excited. And this happens ALOT, adding up to the most badass experience). This game deserves the good rating it has, and if the game doesn't make you want to buy this, the soundtrack will. Probably, next to VVVVVV and Hotline Miami, has one of the best soundtracks out there. The music really sets the tune in the game, and plays a huge factor in how easy it is to get lost in this game. If you have 10 dollars that you can spend, I'd highly reccomend this game!","January 14, 2015","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I'll try to keep this short there's one or two thing I feel I should cover for potential buyers so I'll split this into sections.\n\nAesthetics:\n\nEverything in this game takes a simplistic tron theme, I.e a large use of neon primary colours against various shades of grey. While everything in general does look nice, it seems currently that the text, levels, and GUI all seem a bit too blurry, but not so blurry that it becomes unplayable. While the game does have some video options, at this stage most importantly including resolution and an FOV slider, there is definitely room for improvement. I.e anti-aliasing, antistropic filtering.\n\nThe Player:\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. Initially I was put off by the character design not realising how it effects the gameplay. You play as a smiling unicycle robot with a moustache, and there is limited customization that in its current stage allows you to pick a colour and moustache type. It turns out the design does have a drastic effect on the gameplay, as you move around kind of like you were on a bicycle with a few extras. You can boost with shift which recharges over time and hold the jump key to jump higher, the faster you turn the slower you go, and acceleration over time is a factor, which will be slowed down when you pick up dodgeballs, even more so if you charge your shots. While I personally think the player should have some more air control this style of movement in an arena shooter is a lot of fun.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIn it's simplest form, this game plays like a typical deathmatch shooter with the twist of guns being replaced by instant kill dodgeballs, which can ricochet off of the environment and be charged for higher speed, although charging shots will slow you down and make you much easier to hit, dodgeballs also have drop off that varies depending on the speed that they are thrown. Dodgeballs can also be caught if you are lucky and passed to teammates in need. However (and while I have yet to play these) there is a surprising amount of game modes, including a horde mode, demolition derby, and a mode where you have to shoot through hoops to score points. There is a lot of variety for a day one early access game. For any UT fans out there, this game announces when you go on killing sprees, and will also commend you for airshots and long distance shots. While this game does emphasise multiplayer, if you can't find players, any empty slots will be filled with bots to play against while you wait for people to join.\n\nLevels:\n\nAt the time of writing there are 7 arenas to pick from, while they are all aesthetically similar, the variation comes from the geometry within the arena, i.e a level may emphasise the use of pillars, ramps, or simply open space like classic dodgeball. While the designs are simple, they facilitate the nature of the game perfectly. When you respawn which only takes a few seconds, you respawn in a room with a forcefield that will save you from any enemies, you will also recieve a few seconds of spawn protection to prevent the enemy camping your base.\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nAll in all im going to say so long as you are a fan of classic arena shooters, especially with a few twists, and so long as you can find players to compete against.

The premise is as a roller skating robot in an arena filled with disco music you must throw dodgeballs at each other.\n\nThis makes the game a one hit kill skill fest. There are a few powerups but I found when playing generally when going for the powerups this put you in a vulnerable position and they rarely helped instead the focus of getting a ball and lobbing it at your opponents was all that was needed.\n\nThe realy gratification in the game comes when pulling off some incredible piece of ball throwing that you wanted to happen but never ever though would work…. It’s that same feeling if you’ve ever thrown a basketball in real life from a massive distance and it’s against all odds and expectations landed in the hoop….. its an intoxicating feeling that doesn’t stop being powerful when you pull off one of these kind of shots.\n\nMost of the time you are frantically gathering balls and chucking them for all your life… a mixture of pure skill and throw and hope yet this never becomes about luck and when you arew hit you always know it was your fault.\n\nThe fact you are on roller-skates also makes movement fairly tricky which adds to both the difficulty to throw and evade. Bring able to catch and block balls also adds to the level on skill much like you would in a game of realy dodgeball…. In fact playing this has given me the want to grab some friends a bunch of rollerskates and dodgeballs and give it a go for real….\n\nDisco Dodgeball includes online multiplayer as well as AI-controlled bots plus a surprisingly deep single player arena mode for this kind of title.\n\nThere are quite a few different modes and having put in quite a few hours already I am still hungering for more. I cannot recommend this game enough and defiantly recommend picking it up on steam now. So remember the 5 Ds of dodge ball is  dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge.","March 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While I'll try to keep this short there's one or two thing I feel I should cover for potential buyers so I'll split this into sections.\n\nAesthetics:\n\nEverything in this game takes a simplistic tron theme, I.e a large use of neon primary colours against various shades of grey. While everything in general does look nice, it seems currently that the text, levels, and GUI all seem a bit too blurry, but not so blurry that it becomes unplayable. While the game does have some video options, at this stage most importantly including resolution and an FOV slider, there is definitely room for improvement. I.e anti-aliasing, antistropic filtering.\n\nThe Player:\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. Initially I was put off by the character design not realising how it effects the gameplay. You play as a smiling unicycle robot with a moustache, and there is limited customization that in its current stage allows you to pick a colour and moustache type. It turns out the design does have a drastic effect on the gameplay, as you move around kind of like you were on a bicycle with a few extras. You can boost with shift which recharges over time and hold the jump key to jump higher, the faster you turn the slower you go, and acceleration over time is a factor, which will be slowed down when you pick up dodgeballs, even more so if you charge your shots. While I personally think the player should have some more air control this style of movement in an arena shooter is a lot of fun.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIn it's simplest form, this game plays like a typical deathmatch shooter with the twist of guns being replaced by instant kill dodgeballs, which can ricochet off of the environment and be charged for higher speed, although charging shots will slow you down and make you much easier to hit, dodgeballs also have drop off that varies depending on the speed that they are thrown. Dodgeballs can also be caught if you are lucky and passed to teammates in need. However (and while I have yet to play these) there is a surprising amount of game modes, including a horde mode, demolition derby, and a mode where you have to shoot through hoops to score points. There is a lot of variety for a day one early access game. For any UT fans out there, this game announces when you go on killing sprees, and will also commend you for airshots and long distance shots. While this game does emphasise multiplayer, if you can't find players, any empty slots will be filled with bots to play against while you wait for people to join.\n\nLevels:\n\nAt the time of writing there are 7 arenas to pick from, while they are all aesthetically similar, the variation comes from the geometry within the arena, i.e a level may emphasise the use of pillars, ramps, or simply open space like classic dodgeball. While the designs are simple, they facilitate the nature of the game perfectly. When you respawn which only takes a few seconds, you respawn in a room with a forcefield that will save you from any enemies, you will also recieve a few seconds of spawn protection to prevent the enemy camping your base.\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nAll in all im going to say so long as you are a fan of classic arena shooters, especially with a few twists, and so long as you can find players to compete against. This is worth buying, especially with its discounted price. Although I would say that $10 would be about as high as I'd pay for a single copy and I will be waiting for bigger sales down the line to buy extra copies for friends.

I've played this game for awhole lot of time and to me it just never gets old. Game is worth the price and if you got three friends the four pack is also worth it, thats what I bought. Keep in mind this game is in early access and there are some latency bugs but thats about it.  These problems arn't game breaking at all and probobly will be fixed at some point in the future.\n\nThis game has the potential to grow into the next big game, the game that all the streamers play and the one thats always on the front page of steam. I met and spoke with the creator of this game at 2014's PAX East, although we didn't speak for awhile he seemed to be a very dedicated man who would do anything to see this game florish.\n\n10/10","April 14, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Keep in mind I have played call of duty, Halo, Destiny, Titanfall, Team Fortress 2,the Counter strike series, and garry's mod. This is one of the best fps games because it is easy to learn to play and you can easily play it with freinds, easily customize matches, no extra places to spend money, as well as different modes to suit your play style that is both fun with yourself, but even better with friends. The Powerups this game has will also boost the fun level to new hights if you so choose to use it.Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball has an amazing soundtrack that you can listen to for hours and best of all you can have a balls to the wall match that has all the powerups in the game on all at once, that combonation makes for some pretty epic games. In conclusion this game is super fun, and the more people play, the more fun it gets. The price for this game is amazing if you want a great Fps that you can play with your friends and also play by yourself. There are also constant updates that make the game get better and better, this combined with a great dev that listens is a killing blow to garbage broken overpriced fps's that are basicaly rinse and repeat every year. I would buy this game again if I had to, but since I don't I'm going to go play it now!","January 6, 2015","true","44.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It strikes a great balance between skill and chaos.  The disco part of this game gives it so much personality.  Music is used extremely well to keep the game exciting and fast paced.    Visuals keep improving, but the unique neon lights and dance club feeling are great.\n\nAs an Early Access game, it continually gets updates and improvements.  The dev is quite active in the game and any sites about the game.  You might even play him in a match!  I bought this much earlier and it has only improved from then.  However the only downside is that player base can be somewhat small.  This isn't a major problem because of AI but also because you're only in a room with 6-12 other people.  I recommend the 4-pack, or getting your friends to buy the game too.","January 8, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After many years of playing dogball since my elementary school age, I told myself, "No, my team and I will not lose another round of dodgeball."\n\nThe game started. Quickly, my team and I reached for the closest balls and charged toward the enemy team. I, using my next level strats, decided that I shall not charge with the others; I decided the best strategy would be to wait and  try to catch a ball coming towards me. As this strategy came into play, I saw my team fall before my very eyes. First George, the friend who carried me through thick and thin through my depressing childhood, blew up into a million pieces and his remaines were too small to recognize. Next Jeremy, The man who I never knew well enough. It was just me left.\nAs the enemy team came rolling towards me, I almost felt my last defeat that would cost me my life. but than, something happened. As the enemy threw a ball at me, I was able to do the semingly impossible. I left clicked. The enemy exploded into incomprehensable pieces at my feat. However, this would not spell victory for my team and me as there were still to enemy teammates charging for me. but than, As the ball  was about to be thrown at me, George, who I presumed to be dead beond comprehension hit the foe with the ball.

(I had problems with nvidia drivers 334.21, there's a patched version, 334.21-2 for most distros, that fixed the problems for me, although it might have been the latest game update as well)\n+ Developer communication is always appreciated!\n\nThe game:\nMuch in the same way that ID Software introduced the arena style with Q3A, this game follows and creates a competitive game where you... I guess you control robots on rollerskates. I'll just take for granted that you know how dodgeball works. The controls are a bit akward at first, I wouldn't say bad, but they definately add a challenge to the game. This game works perfect along side some cold beers during a LAN weekend. It's one of those games you play intensely for 30 minutes when you need a break from the seriousness of online, competitive gaming. If you like fast, team based gameplay you should check it out.\n\nScore:\n3/5","April 3, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

The multiplayer lag situation is totally out of control, and what's worse is that you can't even see ping in-game. At any given time there are maybe a couple hundred people online, and the consequent lag means the entire catching mechanic is worthless: You will never, without extraordinary luck, catch a ball, because their client will register a hit before you even see them throw.","February 23, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It's great for those who get an fps itch and just happen to want a light fast game to play when you're in a rush. Though you might get caught up in playing more than just a few rounds.\n\nThe soundtrack is great. It's not extreme into any of the electrical music genres so no one will be groaning over too much dub step or not enough of it.

I can go play TF2, POE, and any number of games with no problems) I feel the lag issue is possibly ineffecient software programming.\n\nIts a shame, cause the game idea was fun.","April 3","false","0.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","2"

Most of the time there are only 2 servers up in Europe, and no servers elsewhere (in my experience). Currently there are no servers up in Europe.\n\nThe single player mode is annoying. It reminds me of the worst bits of old school games that you have a limited amount of lives and you have to beat 10 levels with them. If you die you have to start from scratch. No saves, no level codes, no nothing. I thought that was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t already back in 1991, and I do not wish to see these features reintroduced in modern games.\n\nDisco Dodgeball is a decent distraction for a couple of hours, but I would not recommend it.","September 18, 2015","false","2.0"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","0"

I love the idea, the fun free-for-all smash 'em up bang around dodgeball havoc. I want to recommend this game. And perhaps in time, I can. That time has not come.\n\nI think its all about the controls. They need to be insta-intuitive, and they are not... Not on controller (which is how you should play this game), and they are not with k/m. And even the config to tweak the controls is buggy.\n\nThere is so much going on, it seems the bots are having a BLAST... i only wish I could jump in and join them. I got this on uber sale, cause I just saw the current asking price of $15... OMG! No way ever. Its not even a $5 value YET.\n\n**********\n\nUPDATED:\n\nSuddenly im getting all these salty comments on my honest review. I took the liberty of deleting them, but Im not sure the deleting of salt is local or global, so I shall respod in kind.\n\nIf these reviews of my review are ANY indication of the horrible community that plays this game, as other bad reviews suggest it is, good luck in life.\n\nOne claimed i lost "all credibility" due to my complaining abut the controller functions. Brotha.... dont you worry, been using the W,A,S,D / mouse since my Commodore 64 and 386... since before you were born. The game developers claim this game is compatible, it is not. Therefore it is a manipulation, and buyers deserve to know this.\n\nMy review was very honest. The game has tons of potential, and a week with Psyonix (who have been through this and finally worked out their game to play very very well) it could be there. But there is NO WAY it is close to the primetime $15.00 indie pricetag.\n\nAs proof of this, and as support for my fledgling "crediibility" (/s), either the developers, or slumping sales, have apparently agreed with me, and the permanant price has dropped nearly 45% to 7.99.\n\nCase closed...\n\n//Mic drops","February 15","false","1.2"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

I tried to complimant him every round. They were good. But this wasn't fun. I mean, not because they were better. Only because they were very unsportive and childish. They made this game even worst.\nLater on I realised they were almost the only pepole playing and there was no point of making any friends.\nAnd one more thing.\nTHE GAME IS REPEATIVE.\nDoesn't matter how many gamemodes there are it is all the same.\nThe only one thing I kinda feel needs to be pointed out as good\nis the amazing soundtrack.\nOkay maybe when in-game it feels like there is no difference if there was only one song.

I bought this game under the apparently misguided impression that there would be local multiplayer, but sadly I was disappointed because this could be a fun party game.\n\nVery twitchy controls when using a controller, and menu input is rather frustrating due to this fact. It's basically impossible to turn down the controller sensitivity because the game doesn't handle input from a controller very well.\n\nThis game also apparently does not like it when more than one controller is connected to the PC at once. It doesn't crash, but the game will only accept input from only the most-recently-connected controller.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun pick-up-and-play couch game you should probably skip this one. This is much more suited to being played online at a desk with a keyboard and mouse.","June 25, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 21 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","4","21","0","3"

If you're expecting a competitive game, this sadly isn't the best game due to that.\n\nBecause this is a Not Recommended review I'll be posting the negatives before the positives (but after going over the basics) as they are the biggest breakers of the game, and also the fact that most people looking for the negatives of the game will want to see them first. A lot of these issues will be less impactful for newbie players.\n\nI have a list of negatives and positives but it's too long to fit in a Steam review, so I've put it in a pastebin file. http://pastebin.com/r7TGpmS6\n\nThe basic gist of it is that there are 3 horrible mechanics in the game (block/shield/powerups), unbelievable lag, but also has a lot of other good things about the game that evens out the score. Here are the first 3 "worst negative" paragraphs:\n\nAn edit: There is a custom mode creator for the game where you can turn blocks, shields and powerups off. This is good!\n\n-- NEGATIVES --\n\nThe worst issue of the game is the Multiplayer. It's peer-to-peer, so you'll get blatant host advantage. This gets especially worse if the Host player has a high ping to the master server. The host will get uncatchable balls (because you die before you even get in catching range), balls that can get catched even after 2 bounces and maybe worse. However, due to P2P, the host is not the only problem.\n\nYou will also get more teleporting balls than usual, a longer delay between kills, every player teleports around the map[gfycat.com], and so on. This delay is incredibly bad and I play with 30-40 ping. I literally haven't found a worse experience since Contract Wars.\n\nBut even with a regular host ping, there are still aspects that make it a very infuriating experience. You will get a LOT of teleporting balls, and this is due to Unity physics being non-deterministic. While this may not be something the developer could fix easily, it is still part of the game and has to be mentioned. What this means for you is that every time a ball strikes a surface, it could bounce off to the left side of the arena for one person, and could bounce off to the right for another person.\n\n-- OVERALL --\nLatency and some mechanics will turn the competitive crowd away. The game is great for single experiences but frustrating for anything more.\n\n6 / 10","June 12, 2015","false","97.7"," 11 of 37 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","11","37","0","4"

That alone should show how fun this game can be.\nIf nothing else, this game is one of the best FPS-type games I've ever played with it putting most players on a comparatively even level from the beginning (skill in the game not withstanding), and you can keep it that way in your game if you want the power-ups and other options turned off (or if you want everyone to have some of them all the time). Additionally, it's one of the few FPS games I've played where part of the fight is over the ammunition you have and it is also one of the few that encourages trick shots.\nThe community for this game is also the nicest FPS community I've ever seen. And, if multiplayer isn't your thing, there are several single-player modes, including standard matches against bots (good for practice) and specialized endurance modes.","January 9, 2015","true","178.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are several game modes ranging from Deathmatches and dodgeball game Elimination to 'Super Ball', where one of you has to keep a golden dodgeball from the other team and keep it away from them as long as possible, whilst your teammates protect you.\n\nThere are numerous singleplayer modes as well, despite it being mutiplayer focused (as you would expect) and the bots are surprisingly good (or I just suck :P).\n\nIn terms of skill, the balls move quite slow as projectiles (relative to most twitch-reaction FPS games) and so there is a fair bit of skill leading shots. Not only that, in point-based games, extra points are given for ricochet shots, mid-air shots etc. etc. Also, it does take some getting use to the jump (hold down longer for bigger jump) and the fact you are uncontrollable, movementwise, when airborne (I hope you have decent momentum buddy!). But its not that bad to adjust, and the feeling you get when you do something awesome, intended or not, not matter how much it has happened before, is euphoric. And then you get the monstertruck guy massively hyping you up. Because he's awesome too.\n\nThere are also powerups, which do various things such as homing shots, jetpacks, fireballs (balls can't be blocked or caught) etc. Because the game wasn't exciting/silly enough already.\n\nIts truly is great. Its silly appeal (robot dodgeball robot rave) doesn't seem to wear off, and regardless, it is a well built FPS game. It can appeal to those who are casual or competitive, because everything is a 1-hit KO.\n\nAlso, robots have mustaches and glasses.\n\ntl:dr version: Robots. Dodgeball. Rave. Fun. Monstertruck Announcer. Hype. Awesomeness. Euphoria.\n\nI really really hope this game grows a good multiplayer scene, because it deserves it 100%. The dev recognises this and has already tried to help it along as much as possible, with easy to join multiplayer matches.\n\nRRDDD (Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball) everyone.\n\n(Side note: I have an Alienware laptop: So my laptop follows the colourscheme of the game.

The music is great, the stages are creative and really fun to play on, the power-ups add a zany twist to the gameplay that you can't find anywhere else.\n\nOn the surface this game seems like a big joke (which it kind of is), but once you actually start playing, you realise that it's an actually a really fun, viable game (RRDDD for eSports anyone?), in which you have to be able to predict your enemies every move, as you can only carry one ball at a time and have to scourge the map for a new one if you miss, and taking one blow kills you, no questions asked.\n\nNot to mention the community, which is great. You don't see the type of toxic people that show up in games like LOL and most FPS's, just a bunch of good guys having a good time with the game.

Right off the bat you've got the ridiculous premise with levels that remind me of being a kid and playing laser tag. The robots are surprisingly personable for being robots. Customizing their look is a lot of fun (for me).\n\nThis offers up a great game to just kill some time with friends, perhaps while drinking. But once you get past the humor and charm of the game there's a very deep and balanced system in play. The game really encourages and rewards skilled players who can do stuff in this game that's way over my head.","January 8, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What about robots monopedal robots? What about making your friends hate each other? Disco Dodgeball is the place for all of that and more (balls flying at your face). Really fun game to play with friends -- definitely voice chat so you can really capture all the rage. I would describe the game modes, but I am usually too caught up in the BALLS FLYING AT MY FACE to really know what's actually going on, but that's where the fun's at.","January 8, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I played it a ton before it came to steam for early access and it has come a long way! For starters my absolute favorite part of this game is the soundtrack. It's simply amazing. Gameplay is fairly straightforward but learning all the trick shots takes a bit of finesse. Its a fun game and done very well!","January 8, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It provides an entertaining and inviting gaming experience that's easy to learn and fun for everyone. However, despite it's simplistic style, it still manages to stay competitive and provide a heart pumping style of play that rivals games like Unreal Tournament. It's a simple idea that was executed perfectly, and it contains an amazing soundtrack. An extremely fun game that's perfect to play with friends. I'd recommend this to any fps lover.","January 8, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
