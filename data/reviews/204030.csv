She was a "OG gamer grill", so we played a lot of the same games. When ever Fable TLC came out she fell in love with it, so she made a pirated copy for my 12 yr old self. I installed the game on my dinky little pc and started playing it immediately. When I started out in Oakvale, the graphics where so demanding (for my POS rig at the time) that the ground looked like snow and the water was ♥♥♥♥ yellow, but I still played it anyways. I, too, fell in love with Albion's quirky humour.\n\nA few weeks later my dad bought me a graphics card so there would be no more ♥♥♥♥ oceans. I learned a few things about PCs because of it. So I played Fable for months and when I finally beat it, I was so happy. The story is so great and the gameplay is amazing! I then played the game two more times, leveling up different skills along the way. I had a good guy knight, a neutral rogue, and an evil wizard.\n\nThis game ment so much to me because my grandma gave it to me. She got upset when I told her I beat it before she did, so I teased her about it forever :)\n\nI bought this game for nostalgia reasons, and also because it reminds me of my awesome grandma.\n\nI miss her... <3","July 25, 2015","true","13.3"," 909 of 950 people (96%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","96","909","950","93","21"

Yo. The Lost Chapters.\nAlright where do I start?\nThis game was my CHILDHOOD.\nI PULLED MY FIRST ALL NIGHTER BY MYSELF PLAYING FABLE THE LOST CHAPTERS ON THE ORIGINAL XBOX. If that isn't love, then I really don't know what is.\nLet's get down to it.\nPros:\n-Fun combat. Sort of basic hack n' slash action rpg fare. Now I love to be rewarded for me kills. Typo was unintenional but I'll leave it there.\nSo you got SWORDS, BOWS & ARROWS, AND CROSSBOWS, and MAGIC! For each type of way you eradicate your enimies, you get experience for that category of killing. So, if you bash a hobbe's brains out with a hammer, you'll get melee experience, then stick in between the eyes with an arrow, you'll get ranged experience, and then finish him off by burning him to a crisp with a fireball, you'll get magic experience. And to put icing on the cake, whenever you finish off an enemie, or an innocent civillian, whatever, you'll get general experience. HOW EXCITING.\nMelee combat comes down to left clicking, blocking, dodging, and doing cool overpowered attacks with the right click when your weapon lights up. Ranged is holding down the left click to draw and charge your weapon then popping heads from afar. Magic is self explanatory even more so than the other categories. Do your thing, Harry. You are the chosen one.\n-There are a lot of spells. Lightning, teleporting, reviving the undead, being a jedi and unleashing the wrath of hell.\n-Obvious character evolution! Not only do you feel your character getting stronger but you can also see it. Upgrade your strength and become The Hulk. Upgrade your skills and become Shaq, because you get tall when you kill enemies with a crossbow or scam someone out of their money, because hormones work like that. Use magic and you'll turn into a super saiyan. No lie.\nAnother example of that character evolution would be your morality. I think morality systems in video games are dope. If you're nice, you'll get a pretty little halo will float above your head, butterflies will hoard you, and you'll grow angelicly. If you're evil and kill your sister lol, you'll grow horns and people will cower in fear.\n-Chicken helmet. 'Nuff said.\n-Story's a little cliched, but only really the beginning. You play some as some kid who's village gets burnt to the ground by bandits but a wizard saves and takes you to meet a short Hulk Hogan, who raises you to be a hero. The story then turns out to be a lot bigger than story of just vengeance will the balance of Albion hanging in your hands.\n-The game doesn't take itself TOO seriously. There are serious moments but the overall tone and atmosphere of most of the zones is all laid back and chill.\n-Soundtrack's pretty dope too.\n\nCons:\n-The game's ugly. "Oh, Levi, the game is ten years old," well, I DON'T CARE. The game has not aged well. It didn't look good ten years ago. Deal with it. Anniversary edition looks beautimous though.\n-Its pretty short. I don't have an exact estimate of how quickly I got EVERYTHING DONE in the game, but I got all the sidequests done, max'd skills, fully geared, ect and started a second playthrough in less than 30 hours.\n-Your morality and story choices don't have a huge impact on the world. Yes, there are consequences for killing an important character at some point in the story, but it all really boils down to that the life you took was expendable anyway and their death would've decided whether people would talk smack to you or applaud you. Other than that though, the story is basically the same regardless of choices and the two endings are very slightly different.\n-The game is really linear, zones are small and there a little opprotunities to go off the beaten path. However, if you can find a place to explore, you will most likely be rewarded.\n\nIn a nutshell, the game has a good but cliche story, fun combat, and you can get experience by eating meat. Buy it. Or the Anniversary edition for Xbox 360.","January 28, 2014","true","34.1"," 188 of 207 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","188","207","0","3"

For an old game its a good buy if you have never played it and want a decent linear action rpg.With a sweetfx mod the game looks even better. Get it 75% off on the cheap or get Fable Anniversary with all its new shiney looks.Either way worth that linear playthrough if you like rpgs.","September 9, 2014","true","52.3"," 102 of 106 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","102","106","0","3"

I'm not a hardcore gamer though.\nFirst things first, don't judge this game based from experience from Fable 2, Fable 3 or the journey.\nThe original Fable and the TLC edition are by far the best of the series and they started removing elements from the game such as the loss of a mana bar in Fable 2 and the health bar in Fable 3.\n\nWhy is this game awesome?\nThis game was one of the best of the Fable series thus far. It included the ability to slice your own destiny giving you the option to go full out evil with horns and flies buzzing around you or the choice of being good, being rewarded with a halo and popularity amongst the people of Albion. This game really emphasises the choice of your morality alignment, whether you wanted to have fun running around trying to take on guards or sacrificing people in order to receive a weapon; to just being able to stay clean and donating to the Temple.\n\nWhat is it like?\nThis game is a sick Action Role-play game where the player gets to control a character and goes around bashing things with a sword swell as casting spells and spamming expressions to random villagers. While the environments aren't massive like the newer games they are sufficient and they are good enough for a basic casual gamer (like myself, they are pretty big to roam). The best thing about this game is being able to see character development. You start as a weak puny character that is a stick compared to the beast you become after you finish the storyline. It's a lot of fun mucking around with abilities.\n\nApart from the main story line which has some really intense kicks and shakes the player can also buy out properties and steal stuff all the actions you make do change your morality which is probably the biggest aspect as I mentioned before.\n\nThis game is worth more than it's price on steam and I really do highly commender it. Either TLC or the original edition, they are both beast :)","December 21, 2013","true","9.9"," 82 of 84 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","82","84","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kahmu/recommended/204030/","kahmu","Kahmu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kahmu/","298 products in account","My thoughts on Fable - The lost Chapters:\n\nI've played this game a lot when I was younger and didn't have Steam yet, that's why it says I've not played it at all and I'm still writing this recommendation. I got this game during a sale just because of the nostalgic feeling and so that I could tell you what an awesome game this is.\n\nFable was released on PC back in 2005 and got a lot of attention back then because of the freedom it gives the player and the impacts those decisions can and will have on both your character and the environment, which was a pretty much unknown feature.\nYou start the game as a young boy who's given several tasks, during which you're already forced to decide wther you want to finish them on the good or the bad way. Then, after some events, another tutorial and lots of talking, you're a grown up man who's (amongst other things) trying to figure out why those events happened and who's responsible for your parents death.\nYou'll be given several quests, you may explore the world and fight numerous enemies, gain exp and gain access to bigger and better spells (which can be upgraded too), weapons (which can also be upgraded, giving them some awesome visual effects) and armor. Houses can be bought, women married (and f*cked, though the screen becomes black), chicked can be kicked around, and whole cities can be murdered.\n\nCool thing about this game is, it always gives the player a choice. You can play it as a good guy, where you always help the innocent, never steal anything and never kill anyone who didn't deserve it. The more good things you do, the more saint-like your hero becomes, until you have your own halo and literally fart butterflies.\nIf you do things the evil way, your character grows horns, becomes pale and scares the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone he encounters which makes getting a woman to marry you the most difficult task in the game (still a better love story than Twilight!). You can save a lot of money though by simply stealing the things that you need, and murdering an entire city is ♥♥♥♥ing funny!\nThe hero also adapts to the weapons you use - if you fight with spells most of the time, your arms start glowing, but if you use swords, you'll become a big beefy warrior. Eat much, and you'll become fat, but eat nothing and you'll be thin as a branch.\n\nFor a game that old the graphics and dialogues are still pretty good, the soundtrack is great and you'll be entertained for several hours. There may be lots of quests that are nothing special at all, but the freedom you enjoy in between is what makes this game one of the best I've played so far.\nThere aren't many bad things I can remember because it's been a while since I've last played it, but be sure not to be playing a perfect game. It has its flaws like any other game, but I can't remember anything that makes me want to say "♥♥♥♥ this game".\nThere seems to be a HD remake of this game on the way (no idea when though), but as someone commented below, only for the Xbox. Don't sue me if that's wrong.\n\nBuy it and enjoy!","July 31, 2013","true",""," 83 of 88 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","83","88","0","1"

Period.\n\nYes, I have no game time right now - but don't judge the review on that just yet.\n\nI remember back when I was younger, my brother had an Original Xbox, and Fable had just come out. He'd tell me how amazing it was and I always wanted to play it when he wasn't. After fighting to, I finally got to play and it was amazing. I'd spend all my free time on it when he wasn't using his xbox and it was just the best game I had ever played!\nAs an earlier birthday present one year, I got to choose between an Xbox or a Nintendo DS - Yes I chose the correct choice - I bought an Xbox Original for the sole reason of spending my days on Fable.\n\nFable is an amazing game, you make choices, buy and sell and collect items, weapons and armour. You have many expressions to make and learn, keys to find, chests to unlock and a lot of enemies to kill before killing the pfft..."Almighty" End-Game boss.\n\nFable as a whole was an amazing experience. Not so long after, Fable: The Lost Chapters was released, which I bought the day it came out. There weren't a lot of changes, flourishes were a different colour, Mini-map updates, some extra quests and optimisations, but of course, because it was Fable, it never stopped me spending countless hours playing it.\n\nFable: The Lost Chapters, - or Fable TLC as some refer as - was a great experience, especially a small 'DLC - like' continuation of the game where the original Fable finished off. It's great and adds some extra lore and beef to the existing story, some new armour and Demon Doors as well as new expressions.\n\nThe games in their entireties are amazing, and if you have never played either of them, then you should or we can't be friends.\n\nI have a lengthy review on Fable Anniversary, which in my opinion is also great. Especially since the Develiopers were kind enough to release a load of patches to improve on it where players were not happy.\n\n10/10. Best RPG of all time.","February 23, 2015","true","4.8"," 129 of 155 people (83%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","83","129","155","16","8"

It's somewhat short and quite linear, but there's enough interesting content in it to keep you busy for at least 20 hours. While a lot of the features are a tad superfluous. there is a good story, plenty of quests and a lot of interesting places to visit. The moral choices you have to make really add to the game. The only downside of the game is that the (melee) combat is just a lot of clicking. The training about blocking that you receive early in the game is rendered completely useless because you're (almost) always attacked by more than one enemy. Still it only lengthens the battles and doesn't really make them harder.\n\nRecommended for 10$ and a no-brainer for anybody who likes RPGs when it's on sale.","February 10, 2014","true","26.4"," 82 of 91 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","82","91","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gargoote/recommended/204030/","gargoote","Gargoote","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gargoote/","85 products in account","English Version:\nIt was given to me about a year ago and I was pretty skeptic at first, but after playing it I had to change my mind; this game is amazing.\n\nThe plot is simple but nice. It tells the story of a young hero after his village, Oakvale, is raided by bandits. He's rescued by a hero, Daedalus, who leads him to the Guild of Heroes, where he meets Whisper, his roommate. After years of training, he becomes a hero and goes out on his adventure.\n\nThe gameplay is varied and is mainly based on two main aspects; ''Experience'' and ''Personality''.\n\nRegarding experience we can choose, after the tutorial training, to specialize in "Strength", "Skill" and "Will". The first is related to health, strength and physique; we receive "Strength" experience points whenever we fight hand to hand, thus allowing us to improve it. The second is related to agility, precision and cunning; we will be awarded "Skill" experience points whenever we practice ranged combat, and as a result we will be able to improve ranged capabilities. The last is related to three different types of spells; attack (targeting the opponent), environmental (targeting surroundings, such as being able to slow or stop time) and physical (targeting ourselves, with powers such as healing spells or shields).\n\nRegarding personality there are four different factors: morality, fame, charm and scariness. Morality is linked to the choices that we make during the game, usually either good or bad. Fame is linked to the missions that we have to do: if we taking challenges, we will acquire more fame if we succeed, but we will lose money if we were to fail the challenge. The charm and scariness are related to the physical aspect that we will have in our character (tattoos, clothing, haircut) and are mostly opposites.\n\nIn addition, the gameplay is full of sidequests that improve immersion in the game's universe, and allow us to enjoy fantastic locations. Besides, the possibility of betting on the missions to acquire more fame and money makes it even more fun for me.\n\nThen let's talk about the possibility of getting married to an entire city. How's that? Overall it's a nice game and I recommend it fully!\n\nItalian Version:\nMi è stato regalato circa lo scorso anno ed ero abbastanza scettica inizialmente, ma dopo averlo giocato mi son dovuta ricredere; è un gioco a dir poco stupendo.\n\nLa trama è semplice ma carina. Racconta la storia di un giovane eroe rimasto solo dopo l'attacco al suo villaggio, Oakvale, da parte di banditi. Viene tratto in salvo da un eroe, Dedalo, e portato alla Gilda degli Eroi, dove conoscerà Sussurro, la sua compagna di stanza. Dopo anni di allenamento, diventa un eroe e parte per la sua avventura.\n\nIl gameplay è molto vario e si basa principalmente su due aspetti principali; ''Esperienza'' e ''Personalità''.\n\nRiguardo all'esperienza possiamo scegliere, dopo l'allenamento iniziale, di specializzarci tra ''Forza'', ''Abilità'' e ''Volontà''. La prima è mirata alla salute, alla resistenza ed al fisico; ci vengono dati punti esperienza ''forza'' ogni qualvolta utilizziamo un combattimento corpo a corpo, e quindi ci migliorerà sullo stesso. La seconda è formata da agilità, precisione ed astuzia; ci verranno assegnati punti 'abilità'' ogni qualvolta usiamo il combattimento a distanza, e di conseguenza ci aiuterà nello stesso. L'ultima invece è formata da tre tipi di incantesimo; d'attacco (ovvero mirato all'avversario), ambientale (mirato invece all'ambiente, come fermare il tempo) e fisici (che è mirato a noi stessi, come incantesimi di cura o di scudo).\n\nRiguardo alla personalità invece possiamo trovare quattro aspetti: personalità, fama, fascino e spavento. La personalità è legata alle azioni che compiano nel gioco, ovvero alla classica scelta ''buono'' o ''cattivo''. La fama è legata alle missioni che portiamo a termine, scommettendoci sopra ne acquisiremo di più, ma perderemo soldi nel caso dovessimo perdere la scommessa. Il fascino e lo spavento sono legate all'aspetto fisico che faremo avere al nostro personaggio (tatuaggi, vestiario, taglio di capelli) ed uno esclude l'altro, ovviamente!\n\nInoltre, il gameplay, è pieno di sidequest che aiutano l'esplorazione del gioco, e ci permettono di godere di ambientazioni fiabesche. Inoltre la possibilità di scommettere sopra le missioni, che siano principali o secondarie, per acquisir fama e soldi, rende tutto molto più divertente, secondo me.\n\nE poi vogliamo parlare della possibilità di sposarci un'intera città? Nel complesso è un gran bel gioco e quindi lo consiglio pienamente!","December 8, 2013","true","38.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomsflame/recommended/204030/","freedomsflame","Freedom's Flame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomsflame/","242 products in account","This is not a proper review of the game, but in its place I will tell a story. This story will include a few spoilers, but let's be honest- the game is from 2004, the story will most likely have been spoiled for you at some point.\n\nLet us begin. There once was a boy, brought into the great Guild of Heroes at a very young age, who trained hard night and day, dedicating his life to becoming a great Hero, seeking fame and glory. Even as a child the Hero was very boastful- proud of his physical and mental prowess and always seeking recognition for his accomplishments. But then one day the Hero took a boast that would later prove to humble him; the day had come that he enter the Arena, and the prideful Hero raised himself upon the podium outside the Guild's walls, looked down into the cheering crowd below.\n\nThis was, by this time, a familiar sight, for in his search for glory the Hero was not satisfied with merely completing a Quest. He would stand upon the platform and utter the most outrageous of boasts, at one time defeating an entire pack of Balverines stark naked without taking a single scratch as a personal test of his agility. His pride knew no bounds, and the Hero took upon himself the title of the divine Avatar, claiming that he would be the sword which the Gods wielded to drive back the darkness. However, this day the Hero saw an opportunity to forge a truly legendary tale within the Arena, one which could never possibly be surpassed: he would enter the Arena and slay all that came before him, be it man or beast, completely unprotected, and without a so much as a scratch to mar his rosy skin. The crowd cheering and his chest puffed with pride, the Hero set off to the Isle of Witchwood, and the Arena therein.\n\nThe Hero entered the Arena to the roaring of a crowd that could only brought on by the anticipation of imminent bloodshed. A veteran of the bloodied sands had just fallen, adding yet another entry in the long list of those who had died in pursuit of glory through combat. The Hero made short work of an entire nest of Wasps, then of a clan of Hobbes, all singlehandedly. From the third round on he would be joined by a fellow Hero to defeat the beasts that were released upon him. The gate lowered and from beyond came his greatest rival, a Heroine by the name of Whisper who had looked upon him with disdain ever since they had begun their training together many years ago. However, the Hero was satisfied with this, as it would only add to his legend, and so together they set about cutting down a pack of Balverines to pieces. By this time he had set into the familiar groove of combat, and with spell and sword his foes fell before him.\n\nThe Hero did not blink an eye as the remains of those who had died on the sands of the Arena tore themselves from the blood soaked earth and rose to reclaim their glory in death. After dispatching the Undead, a clan of Bandits, once feared throughout all of Albion and slated for execution within the Arena several years ago were next. Methodically he dodged their blows and cut them down one by one, Whisper his constant companion this a whirlwind of blood and blade. By this point it had become apparent that group tactics were no match for the Heroes' skill, and so the master of the Arena swiftly changed tactics and introduced a matched pair of trolls to the audience. The Heroes had already faced Trolls before, so as they saw the rumbling of the earth and the giant hands of stone emerge from the sod they knew what to expect. Cool and calm, they circled their prey, waiting for the opportune moment to strike and avoiding the attacks of the other troll. First a pair of Earth Trolls fell beneath their blades, then the even tougher Rock Trolls, chipped at repeatedly by their hit and run attacks.\n\nWith the defeat of the Trolls the Heroes stood tall, knowing they could take on anything. With the end near, the question of who the gold would go to should they win, as the Arena can only have one Champion,  arose, but this thought was quickly purged from minds as a massive creature the likes of which they had never seen before clawed its way out of the sands, stinger raised and claws snapping. The beast, a gigantic scorpion, was called Arachanox, and many a Champion candidate had fallen before her, their aspirations crushed along with their bodies under its massive stinger. This threat was novel, something the Heroes had never faced before, and it took a great amount of teamwork to learn its strengths and weaknesses. Carefully, they paced around it, dodging out of the way and poking at is when they could. The Hero had managed to maintain his boast of being untouched up until this point, as familiar foes had patterns which he could exploit. But in the face of the unknown his abilities remained sharp, but even the most skilled warrior eventually makes a mistake. Learning the patterns of the great beast the Hero hacked at it with his greatsword when it was stunned, retreating from the slashing of its pincers when it freed itself. They repeated this, but the long hours of combat had begun to wear on them, and the inevitable happened: the Hero made a mistake. Thinking the beast dead after an especially powerful blow, he raised his sword to the sky in celebration, to the delight of the crowd. But Arachanox was not yet defeated, and in its death throes it struck the Hero from behind, putting an end to his long line of successful boasts. Angered by the ruin of the legend he was trying to forge, he turned and struck it down, making sure it was dead, then turned to the cheering crowd.\n\nAbove them appeared none other than the legendary Jack of Blades to commend them for their valour. However, with his praise came a final, deadly, proposition: one final round. There could only be one Champion of the Arena, Unable to refuse this challenge or lose all they had just fought for, Whisper turned to the Hero and said that she could not kill him, not after all that they had been through in the Arena. The Hero then recalled his earlier boasting, declaring that he would cut down all he faced on the sands. He was a good man at heart, but he realized that his hubris had led him to this situation. Whisper's voice broke him from his thoughts, declaring that they should at the very least put on a good show. And so they crossed blades, once rivals, then allies, and now as reluctant foes on the field of battle. Whisper's skill proved to be no match for that of the Hero in the end, and as she kneeled in the sands, beaten, the Hero had a decision to make: would he sacrifice this woman who had caused him so much anger and betray the bond forged between them in battle to salvage at least some semblance of the legend he had hoped to create? As he looked down at her, he realized that he could not take the final blow and sheathed his blade, turning from the jeers of the disappointed crowd and the pleading eyes of Whisper to walk silently through the gates. With this he took an oath to never boast again, and became a true Champion of Righteousness, rather than a slave to the battlefield, going on to forge a legacy befitting the title of Avatar.","July 8, 2015","true","25.1"," 38 of 52 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","38","52","10","3"

If you grew up watching Hercules, Xena, and/or Highlander, Excalibur, Dragonheart, you'll love it. The gameplay isn't anything extraordinary but it can be fun thwacking hordes of bandits with your BFS spamming Enflame and Multi-Strike. The stealth is unnecessary. Fishing can be tedious, and escort quests suck but all you need is to make them wait, clear out enemies, follow. Magic is fun.\n\nWhat can you do? You can slaughter a village and buy up all the vacated buildings, or you can lead the inhabitants out to a different zone and buy their property if mass murder isn't your thing. You can collect silver keys, treasure clues, and goofy outfits. You can change your PC's hair, tattoos, and clothes. You can grow horns if you go full evil-and you get a halo for being fully good. You can sacrifice innocents for a sick bow, you can trade goods between shops for a limited profit, join Fight Club, show off trophies, shoplift, go fishing, figure out what the hell the demon doors want, and walk around in your Union Jack undies.\n\nIt's ludicrously easy to gain EXP once you fully understand how the combat multiplier works in conjunction to Physical Shield and how much EXP carrots, red meat, fish, and combat-oriented actions pay out. Hint: eat 150 red meats (3xp) with a x20 multiplier to equal 9000 Physique XP.\n\nI wish they hadn't changed Jack of Blades' voice for The Lost Chapters, the original was more menacing. It was like changing Frieza's voice in DBZ Kai. Sure it makes more sense but it's not as cool.\n\nFive stars.","March 10, 2015","true","73.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","14","16","5","0"

Nonetheless, I feel the need to represent this game as truthfully and realisticly as possible.)\nFirst of all, I played the original Fable on Xbox, so when I saw Lost Chapters on PC, my mind was blown. Lost Chapters is, in a sense, a "DLC" of the original Fable game, in that it adds more content, characters, events, and items. Unfortunately, most of these characters and items won't show up until you complete the first phase of the game.\n\nThe graphics in this game are admittedly not the greatest. Textures are blurry, people look blocky and pasty, and the landscape turns into this odd, melty blob when you look past mountains and town edges.\n\nThe characters in this game have a certain charm about them, every one is diverse and unique. From stubborn warriors like Thunder and mysterious people like Briar Rose around every corner, you'll never be short on enemies and friends to make-- by choice, of course. Voice acting quality isn't the best, but usually the actors know what they're doing and can get a point across to you.\n\nCombat is... alright, I suppose. If you don't mind taking out the time to redefine your keys in the menu, there's no real problem with it. Some weapons swing oddly, like heavy weapons that FEEL awkward when you use them for the first time, and crossbows that don't fire when you expect them to: zooming in is especially awkward. Boss fights aren't hard, if you just observe and manipulate their patterns, and most minor enemies will run at you, wait a second, and attack, giving you time to fight.\n\nAnd, finally, your character is what you make him into. The game uses the term "Hero" loosely; your character resembles your actions and personality, how you interact with and change the world around you. Those who help people in need and stop bandits and minions get halos and beams of light, while those who slay innocent people and side with thieves and criminals grow horns and walk with flames on their feet.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is great. It's not short on plot, characters, or choices for you to make. If you have spare time, grab this game, and you won't want to put it down.\n\n9/10","July 5, 2014","true","81.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There isn't a lot to say for the choices you make having much of an effect on the world around you. People like you different, your hair and eyes look different, and you're restricted from one or two spells; the only decisions that really matters are at the very end of the base game, and the expansion; which basically dictate one or two cinematics; in the expansion, you have three pairs of people you can kill one person each from, that's about it. The narrative however is quite good, and it appeals to the nature of a story that could quite go down as legend. You become a great hero in the span of years, and work to resolve your fate. The legendary items and gear make it feel more like an RPG, and the atmosphere is quite good. The only issue is, while great music, the lack of diversity in the music tracks makes some of the scenes rather... anticlimactic. When you're approaching the gates to armageddon basically, and the happy town music is playing.\n\nEnd result, for $10, and those qualities ascribed?\nDefinitely a passing experience.

Most quests also give you several choices during them which in turn make your status more evil or more good while twisting the means and/or the end result of quests.\n\nCharacter customization... is well done. You can add tatoos, change your hairstyle, wear different clothes, have battle scars, get older... and all these together decide how NPCs see you and react upon your arrival. You can also get married which usually requires your character to be more attractive and renown.\n\nCombat system... your combat skills don't advance along those lame "skill trees" you often see in RPG games. In Fable you can choose everything yourself. If you want to max out all possible skills, go on. If you want to specialize as a combat mage, archer or whatever, you can do it. Also your status will show your combat class depending on which skills you invested your experience into, and there are a lot of classes. Scout, rogue, spellwarrior, witch hunter, fighter, warrior. Just to name a few of them. It's even possible to choose never to train your skills and stay as an "apprentice" all the way to the end game, though this being an expert level challenge.\n\nAs an action RPG, the game allows you to fully decide how you move, use skills and take on enemy attacks during combat. Changing from spell to another, or from bow to your sword is very simple and doesn't require you to memorize dozens of different buttons for different commands. On a personal note, I've never encountered a combat system anywhere near as fun, exciting yet not too complicated as this one.\n\nWell over 20 hours to reach end game unless you rush only the main storyline quests without completing a single side quest along the way, messing with marriages or looking for some of the several legendary weapons hidden throughout the lands of Albion.\n\nOn a last note. I recommend this over the Anniversary version. Having played both, honestly all I see are a few tweaks to graphics which mainly just make your own character look ugly as hell.","March 1","true","238.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

You'll look fabulous!\n+ Aging system, you'll get older, only up to 65, otherwise you would die from aging before you could finish the game.\n\n- The choices you make doesn't seems to make a big difference, if you kill an "important" NPC, it will never appears again, if you don't, it will never appears anyways.\n- Sometimes being bad is hard, since killing some of the most common enemies is considered a good deed.\n- Fable's economic system is faulty and as the way it works, it can be easily exploited.\n- Only you age up, you start as a kid, ends with 65, but almost everybody is still the same.\n- It's hard to use multiple skills, you can only use two at a time and then switch to other pair of skills, it's up to you, to organize and manage this.","April 8","true","41.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

For example: the npc's, tattoos, hairstyles, aging, and just the way you look the more evil/good you do. It was a game I had to play more than once just because I wanted to see what happened.

Graphics may not be as good as other games but if you are like me and play older games you will not even glance at that. Enemies are real tough to beat even if you are max level. Even after you beat the story line you still get to continue! Buying this comes with a DLC pack that continues the adventure even more!\nOverall it is the best game/series of games I have ever seen.

The PC version looks great and has the same excellent gameplay but it is completely bogged down by the horrible mouse/keyboard layout.  The flow of action is often slowed down by the constant "which key am I supposed to be hitting" situation that often pops up.  It can be remedied a bit by downloading a decent gamepad program to map your keyboard but it is still a pain.  Sometimes you feel like you are going to have to hit a key with your nose or something since you are running out of fingers.  I still highly recommend this game however.

In retrospect, Fable is not the great game I remember, but a solid game nevertheless. Fable is an action RPG surrounding what starts out appearing nothing but a simple boy who had lost his family and his village, but the plot thickens instensely throughout the game to become much more.\n\nFable was based around the idea of "for every choice, a consequence", but don't let that motto fool you. There isn't a whole lot of choice besides "what's your combat preference" and "good or evil", but the quests, combat, and loot selection are unique enough to still feel fun.\n\nI've played enough of Fable to see through it (I have way more hours on xbox than here), but if you haven't picked it up yet and are considering it, $10 is more than fair for your time. I will say though, do purchase *this* version and *not* the anniversary edition; as much I would like to love the anniversary edition, the clunky GUI and un-updated animations make the game more of a crappy retelling than a welcomed overhaul. Fable TLC is still graphically fidelic to be appealing today as it was when it released.\n\nOverall, if you like action RPGs, visit the world of Albion is it's oldest (and arguably, best) incarnation of the series.","August 24, 2015","true","40.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's primarily an action RPG where you play as an epic hero as you quest through the lands.\n\nThe game is full of humor and riddled with sidequests.

Thankfully, the PC port is pretty solid and it features a completely extended part of the game after the original's ending.\n\nOverall it's worth the 10$ on Steam and keeps your attention, but it's not anything to break an appointment over.","September 19, 2012","true","29.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Fable The Lost Chapters has been my second favorite game since it was released as just "fable" back in 2004. Upon hearing about The Lost Chapters I got extremely excited. Hell, I played through the game again on the xbox just so I could play through the second part of the game. I feel that they could have included The Lost Chapters in the game itself and honestly it's stupid that they didn't. But nostalgia blinds me from being mad at that. So I feel that the game plays just as good if not better than the xbox version, but I still wish I could use a 360 controller on the pc port of the game. I prefer the comfort of a controller with games like this and other rpgs because I can relax and actually play the game.\n\nThe story in this game is a bit lacking and I could kind of tell even as a 14 year old how things were going to play out. I won't be covering the story because I recommend you play it yourself. But basically who you think is dead isn't and who you think is good isn't as well.\n\nFable wasn't exactly a well recieved series, Fable 2 never came to pc so I never really got the chance to play it through, and Fable 3... Well. I think it's trash to say the least.\n\nThey really hyped up the good and evil system in this game, and for good reason! They were pretty much the pioneers of alignment choices with Knights of the old republic just a year or so before. We have games like this to thank for the big aligment based games such as Mass Effect and Fallout, so next time you say the fable series is awful, it may be bad to you, but they did certainly try to do something different.\n\nGames like Final Fantasy don't really have good or evil choices, you're the chosen hero. This game lets you be the bad guy. Wether it's you killing traders, or your own family, it doesn't matter.\n\nAlso there's a brothel you can take over and  bang chicks for free. 19/10\n\nRest in peace Lionhead.","May 2","true","16.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

With the Console I obtained two free games, one of them was halo and the other one was this one.\nI hated the idea of halo (I was 8 ok) So I started playing Fable. It was the main reason why I grew up as a writer and I thank my creativity from this game.\n\nThis game means a lot to me, not only because it was the one that got me into writing and videogames, but also because I've basically been playing it since today. I take breaks, of course, I finish playing it then i take a 2 year break and focus on other things, but its a great game to come back to. I honestly never grow tired of it.\n\nThe OST is beautiful and fits the entire theme. You can be whoever you want to be in the game and the best thing is that you can kick a ♥♥♥♥ing chicken.\n\nIt's a typical old school rpg game, and one of the best back then if you ask me. The writing and lore are absolutely stunning, the npc's are great and have a lot of backstory and the enemies are cool.\nYou get a lot of choice within this game, something i've been missing from other fable games. Beside that, exploring is so much fun in this game. There is always something to do, and you always have quests. The main quest NEVER gets boring for me.\nThe graphics are OK for its time, really, Beside that, I've heard they made a HD version of it too.\n\nI may be speaking out of nostalgia and love, but i honestly want everyone who likes old school RPG's to try this out. It has a typical "Epic" Hero theme and its just loveable. You get this feeling that you've been sucked into the game because of the story and end up playing it at 3 AM.\n\n9/10 !","August 31, 2015","true","27.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It took me about 31hrs according to the statistics and I'm surprised it was only that long because I spent a lot of time just wandering around in the game, messing with charactersd, getting married, and things like that.  And I'm definitely going to play through it again and this time try to make different moral decisions.\n\nIt's really a good game with a lot of possibilities and definitely worth more than they're charging for it.","April 23, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/squints/recommended/204030/","squints","squints","http://steamcommunity.com/id/squints/","93 products in account","Let me start by saying this review's seriously biased: I had this game on the XBox OG and it blew my mind all over my poor mom's upholstery. Nostalgia may factor in here, but I'll try to maintain some sense of objectivity.\n\n\nThe good:\n\nThe gameplay of the original Fable was very unlike a lot of the RPGs in 2004. The mechanic utilized every decision you made to influence the story in some way or another. As enemies land hits on you, scars appear on your body. Do good deeds, the town loves you and a little halo appears on your head. Lay waste to all who stand in your way, and the potato-scrubbing plebians run in fear as little horns sprout out of your head. Your choices seriously affect your weapon stats, skill set, appearence, plot- every nuance of the game begins at day 1.\n\nAnd remember, this is back in 2004. The DS was hot off the factory when this came out. Outkast's "Hey Ya!" was not yet overplayed and annoying. Bush was still in office. That's impressive.\n\nThe music is also pretty impressive. Danny Elfman (yeah, THAT Danny Elfman) helped write the main score, while Russel Shaw, the compser for a majority of Molyneux's games, actually used a small orchestra to do the majority of the game. Not the first or the last time a group of live people was responsible for a VG score, but again, an impressive feat for an RPG of this scale considering we were still using Windows XP. It's atmospheric, and suits the naturally light-hearted nature of the game.\n\nThe game itself has bits and pieces of humor around. It's a game that tries to not take itself too seriously. The dry, snarky sort of humor only a crazy Brit could come up with. The animation and graphics, as well, are bright with just a touch of cartoony.\n\nStill, the selling point here is that Fable set the standard for all the open-world RPGs that follow. Some of Fable's mechanics were borrowed, sure, and some it invented, but I have to argue that it's really the first single player RPG that put it all together to make something that feels this open and massive in scale, where your decisions and style of gameplay seriously affect the game. Really, the closest relative I can think of is Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in 2006, a full two years after.\n\n(Maybe there's a hidden gem I missed, but I'm sure someone will point it out if I'm wrong about this.)\n\n\nThe ugly:\n\nOh, sweet jesus, the graphics have aged. It takes some getting used to. Even in 2004, she wasn't winning any pagents, but now, even with my GPU's antialiasing cranked up as far as she goes, it's pretty bad. Low poly, pre-HD res, and cheap modeling.\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker by any means, unless your idea of a good game rests solely on whether or not your dog's character model looks like a real dog. Like I said, it does take a bit getting used to, but the game is still so immersive, you'll ignore it after a few minutes of real gameplay.\n\nThe contols are a bit awkward, as well. Maybe it's just me, or maybe it's from playing some more modern RPGs, but, it feels like the red-headed stepchild: the controls are still reasonably well-laid (at least it's still using WASD), but there's just some modern conventions that are missing. You can remap the controls, though, which helps somewhat, but it's still a little clunky.\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe avatar-to-enviroment ratio isn't linear. At all. You can get some pretty powerful magic and weapons early on in the game. There's a couple of spells that are just straight up unfair- notibly the spell that slows down time, and the "Heavenly Whatever/Infernal Thing" spells. Even late in the game, it's way too powerful. Together, all you need to do is slow down time for a bit, and whack all the enemies in a 40-block radius with your Heavenly Thingamabob before they can land a single hit. Mix that with the fact that enemy strength barely goes up after 10 hours, and an open-world, well-designed RPG turns into a hack-and-slash. The game does offer a chance to tack on challenges to your quests, like no damage, fists only, no armour, but it doesn't actually add challenge to a quest itself- it's just a bet. If you take damage during a no damage run, you just lose a few gold, and the quest continues as normal.\n\nBasically, after a while, it becomes waaaaay too easy to just blast your way though a quest if you have the right upgrades. It's really a major oversight. It certainly doesn't ruin the game, but it is a nasty blemish that's hard to overlook.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nGo for it. It's ten bucks, and it's, well, not the grandpa of RPGs, more like the weird-uncle-your-mom-doesn't-like-to-talk-about of RPGs. Okay, so it's got some flaws, and aged like hell, but it's still a pretty solid game. Like most Molyneux projects, it feels planned and thought-out. It's smart, clever, and a lot of fun, and still has a few surprises left in her sleeve.\n\nMy rating:  7/10\nCost:         9.99 USD","May 26, 2014","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To put it simply: this game is awesome.\n\nWhen I watched the trailer I was like "Meh. Might aswell read the reviews." and the reviews made me wonder "If it's such a good game, why does the trailer suck?". So I decided to watch some gameplay. The best advice I can give you is: Watch the gameplay of the first mission. By then you'll problably know wether you'll like it or not.\n\nAs for me? I loved this game. I've spent too many months playing FPS games and this game made me remember why I love RPGs so much.\n\nAt this current time I finished the game as a good guy, and I have 26 hours of playing it. I haven't even gotten into the assassin aspect of the game, the thieving and all those stuff which cause you to be evil. I've still got to play the evil side of the coin and see what kind of stuff will happen differently. Also, there is much I haven't done yet, side quests and things of the sort.\n\nAlso, the combat is awesome. While you might choose to be the overpowered dude who beats everyone up, you also can choose to play not to your fullest power, but actually use one or two magics at a time. If you play the overpowered dude, combat gets boring too quickly, since no foe will stand up to your power. But if you decide to give your opponents a fair fight, the combat is really interesting. The enemies don't have much power by themselves, but they certainly beat you in numbers and I found myself dying a few times. But don't worry about it, the game is really fair and it gives you a nice ammount of revives with the ability of you being able to buy more revives really cheap once you get to the mid point of the game (before that they're there, but they aren't that cheap in comparison to the gold you have).\n\nTo sum up: This is a must-have. If it is in sale, you should buy it ASAP. If it's not, you should take a look at the cost and see if it's worth it. But even at it's full price, in my opinion it's worth it.","July 8, 2014","true","26.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fable is a RPG in which your decisions dictate where the story will go. You can be a Hero of purity and good or a Hero of deceit and evil. This was a groundbreaking feature when it first released because no other game on the market had that "I really control this character's life" feel to it. With a unique skill leveling system, you can make yourself a burly warrior, a gifted mage, a craft thief, or as I like to do, a "Jack-of-All-Trades" sort of build.\n\nWhen the game begins, you are still just a boy in the town of Oakvale. It's your sister's birthday and you need to find her a present. Your choices start at a young age, as you decide where you want to do good or bad deeds to make the few gold needed to get the gift. Shortly after you get the gift, bandits raid your little town and slaughter everyone. You're saved by a member of The Heroes Guild and taken there where you'll grow up and learn to be a Hero. Will you be The Hero of Avo or a Servant of Skorn. The choice is yours.","February 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because of certain circumstances I haven't had the chance to play lost chapters. But last chrismas I saw it on sale and being a fable nutcase I just had to get it. With the visuals overly improved due to more computing power from home pc's, I finally got to emerse myself in this amazing world once more, with new quests and other features that the original fable did not possess. Lost chapters how ever let me 1 or half a night to complete even though you could play it for hours on end, and not get bored with its charms. If you're one for this genre of game then I recommend it you, Because I know this game will ensnare and capture you're heart within minutes. For being released around 2005'ish it still competes with over titles as one of the best RPgs of its time. But the choice is yours. For will you become the hero and saviour of Albion? or  dark warrior whose live consists of un-heard of and merciless deads of  evil? that I leave to you, Farm boy.","February 27, 2014","true","36.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I actually played Fable 2 first (which remains my favorite) and it was nice to see that good aspects got carried over in the series and the bad were left out or modified.

However, since this game, Fable, was the first and the best in the series, I would have to recommend those to play this game. Whether you enjoyed it years ago on the orginal xbox or computer or not, this game is a beautiful, addicting, single-player game. It wont take up too much of your time, you'll enjoy the story, and most of all, you can ♥♥♥♥ with people so hard. In my first play-through, I chose the path of light and justice. The game was amazing. Then I realized that being an evil mother ♥♥♥♥er makes this game about 10 times better. In most games, I have a hard time being evil; I just feel bad for these NPCs and ♥♥♥♥ing with their "lives". Then I grew some god damn balls and chose to ♥♥♥♥ with everything these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s hold dear. It's really easy to be evil if your real-life morals don't come into play. And one of the best parts is that in the beginning, when you're a child, you can't get in trouble for evil deeds. You can be a ♥♥♥♥ing bully and mess with everyone, beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of the random kid who wants his teddy bear back, and still be back in time to give your younger sister her present.\nJust ♥♥♥♥ing drink or get stoned, and play this game for a night or two.

That doens't matter in my opinion, in this way you dont waste your time on random exploring. There's always somthing at the end of your journey.\nYou can choose to be a hero, but you can also be a villain.

Fable is a RPG in which your decisions dictate where the story will go. You can be a Hero of purity and good or a Hero of deceit and evil. This was a groundbreaking feature when it first released because no other game on the market had that "I really control this character's life" feel to it. With a unique skill leveling system, you can make yourself a burly warrior, a gifted mage, a craft thief, or as I like to do, a "Jack-of-All-Trades" sort of build.\n\nWhen the game begins, you are still just a boy in the town of Oakvale. It's your sister's birthday and you need to find her a present. Your choices start at a young age, as you decide where you want to do good or bad deeds to make the few gold needed to get the gift. Shortly after you get the gift, bandits raid your little town and slaughter everyone. You're saved by a member of The Heroes Guild and taken there where you'll grow up and learn to be a Hero. Will you be The Hero of Avo or a Servant of Skorn. The choice is yours.","February 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If grown up with it. I played this game for the aight time now, and it´s still outstanding.\nThe game has a lot of humor and looks (for the time it was made ) beautiful. You have the options to do whatever you like, but it's not a such a free game as Skyrim, GTA, ect. The places you explore are linear. That doens't matter in my opinion, in this way you dont waste your time on random exploring. There's always somthing at the end of your journey.\nYou can choose to be a hero, but you can also be a villain. But if you have played the game a couple of times, you know that the evil way is much more rewarding.

I remember playing the original Fable on the Xbox, and then playing The Lost chapters later on the Xbox as well. I also feel that the first Fable was the best out of the series, I felt the physics of the game were tighter and some of the animations weren't so "loose" like in the following games. But more importantly, having this game on Steam is also much better than when it was on the Xbox, it runs smoother, the loading is faster, and there is no loss of the original fun. Anyone who is of age, (Or not because I was about twelve when this game first came out) will have a fantastic time creating their character and choosing whether to be good or evil.

We have mostly played it before. I picked this up simply to scratch a nostalgia itch. On the whole I found that it was good... still! Yes there are a couple of issues as it's an older game so the port hasn't aged particuly well, no controller support and as the magic system relied on three buttons on the xbox version it now relies on 2 (left and right mouse) which can make it a little difficult with all the scrolling to find the apropriate spell. you could of course get very wow style and have a million hotkeys buuut meh, its not really designed around it.\n\nAnyway back on track, the port is actually good, 1080 supported (which looks quite lovely!)  AA is supported as well as some basic visual sliders and such. The only thing i found didnt work properly was the refresh rate, is seem to stick at 60fps, not terrible at all but i have a 120hz monitor sooo, well it would have been nice.\n\nOn to gameplay! Yes the game is flawed... it does feel a little like "babby's first RPG"  but it has bags of character and you will remember your time with it. i found on my recent playthrough some more annoyances... such as indestructible barrels, having to run MILES to pick up rent and a slightly janky inventory. Seriously when you pick up a book you cant find it in your inventory.... its in your hero's logbook UNLESS it is a note/letter given by a non main story NPC and then it turns up in the "other" section of you inventory.  Yes the attack cycles will get repetative you will get bores of the 4 or 5 different unblockable "flourish" moves, ranged combat feels slow and you become super powerful very quickly. and then you feel like all the experience you have aquired is useless (it is) But with all that being said, Albion is a fantastic world to inhabit, a lot of thought went in to contextualising the world, everybody has a life that you can see being lead, they will react accordingly... if you raid Oakvale, and murder people (even as a good guy) you will find that for some time the inhabitants will cower and run away from you... even though you have a halo....\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE.....\nFlawed, but fun and a relatively well done and useable port\n\n\n\n","January 3, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fable was a great game, back in the day I borrowed my friend's XBOX just so that I could play this. While the sequels did take a few steps in the right direction, they also took a bunch of massive steps back.\n\nIf you've not played any Fable games, get this and give it a go. It's not the best RPG around, but it's certainly a good one. If you enjoy it, grab a friend and the sequel (which I notice isn't on Steam, but the third one is) for some good old co-op action.","December 11, 2012","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's because it absolutely is.\nI grew up playing this game on my old Xbox. My mom would tell me "[redacted], you can play this game, but only if you're a good guy". I would run around, only killing evil things, eventually becoming a shining beacon of happiness and hope throughout Albion.\nThen I turned 10. Things got a bit crazy. May or may not have "accidently" slaughtered a couple villages and grew a set of horns.\n\nAnyway.\nThat was in the past.\n\nI hadn't played this game in at least 7 years (which is crazy to think about) and for some reason, never checked on Steam for it. When I saw it at the Summer Sale, I froze. Oh my god. It's my game.\nI picked it up without thinking about it, and am 100% happy with my decision.\nThe game is great. The voice acting is horrible. The faces and lip movements are really bad. The Guildmaster is annoying as hell. But the game is a rare gem from the past that I don't think anyone should miss playing.\n\nThis is the Lost Chapters. It adds much, much more to the base game. It no longer ends when you beat the main villain the first time. Instead, you find yourself with another HALF A GAME to go. More weapons, more enemies, more armor, more quests, and more fun.\n\nIt also runs really, really well on my laptop. I still haven't felt it get hot, even after a 5-hour gaming session. Camera is a bit wonky, and I had to rebind a few keys (who would want to block with the middle mouse?). Once I got used to it, I've done very well with it.\n\nOne thing I love about this game, is that it can give you a sense of being overpowered, but only if you play it well. If you mess up, you can easily be overwhelmed by enemies and lose half your health. Play it right, and the only damage you'll take is from a few stray crossbow bolts.\n\nIf you like rpg games, this game is one of the best out there, even today. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting it and trying it out. After you endure the first hour or so of not-so-great "gameplay", you'll come to love this game as much as I do.\nWell, not as much.\nNot nearly.\n\n","June 24, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It may not have the size and content of Skyrim, but the impacts you make on the world really add to the immersion. People actually chanting your name and either cowering from you or praising you, and actually knowing when or when not to oppose you is something that even Skyrim fails to achieve. The combat may seem just like a button masher but if you know what your doing, you can turn it into a fun game of mind tricks with your opponents. The story is the cherry on top of this brilliant cake, and contrary to what many people say, the game can get pretty difficult.","May 11, 2013","true","43.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is very reminiscent of a hack-and-slash if you choose to play it so, but the magic gives you quite the variety.

In Fable you get loads of moral choices which affect your character and the way other people in the world views you. Fable enjoys really enjoyable combat including a huge variety of spells. The variation of  weapons may be lacking, but there's a good variation of armour, clothes, tattoos and hairstyles. But the main part of the game is the amazing story and the great side-quests and the choices you have to make, there's load of things to do! (Unless you just rush the main quest which I don't suggest) Only problem I have is that the difficulty is really easy, and completing the game without ever dying isn't hard.\n\nThis game is an absolutely buy!

An amazing game, it has great RPG and action elements, great story telling and loads of interesting mechanics. If you've never heard of the Fable franchise then I advise you to get it as you will have hours of unguided fun. The game shapes around you, if you're evil, then your character will grow horns and turn more and more demonic with every evil action you commit. If you're good, then your character will glow with the essence of goodness. If you eat too much you become fat. This game is an awesome storytelling wonder, some may even consider it as the father of Action-RPG's. If you're still skeptical, look up some gameplay on Youtube, and decide then, you're missing out if you don't play this game.","July 2, 2013","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember playing the original Fable on the Xbox, and then playing The Lost chapters later on the Xbox as well. I also feel that the first Fable was the best out of the series, I felt the physics of the game were tighter and some of the animations weren't so "loose" like in the following games. But more importantly, having this game on Steam is also much better than when it was on the Xbox, it runs smoother, the loading is faster, and there is no loss of the original fun. Anyone who is of age, (Or not because I was about twelve when this game first came out) will have a fantastic time creating their character and choosing whether to be good or evil.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cockworthington/recommended/204030/","Cockworthington","Let the Erin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cockworthington/","50 products in account","It's quite fitting that the first serious recommendation I do for a game would be Fable: The Lost Chapters.\n\nYou know how some people tend to play Deus Ex whenever it's mentioned because of how much they love it? In this case, Fable is my Deus Ex. Ever since I played it on the Xbox in 2004. I was hooked.\n\nThe game truly gives you a feeling of connection with your character, as you play as him from a small child to an elderly, war-torn man. Although some characters are rather dull, most are well-done and well-written for the context of the game. Even when I was an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who slayed every villager in his sight, I still couldn't bring myself to killing certain characters.\n\nThe story itself is excellent, dropping you in the mystical land of Albion where beasts of all sorts roam. The main villain is revealed rather late in the game, giving you a chance to explore and understand the environment you were put into without being forced to fight a singular individual. I, personally, enjoy the setting of the game, pitting you in a medieval-esque surrounding.\n\nThe game gives you a nice sense of freedom when choosing your playstyle. You can be a stealthy archer, a brutish barbarian, a wise spellcaster, or a combination of them. I did a run using only fire spells, and another as a spell-archer. The possibilities aren't endless, but you have quite a bit of freedom in choosing how you want to play.\n\nAnd to top all that off, the music is absolutely brilliant. Have a listen: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUWEZ47-elQ\n\nOn some bad notes, though, the morality system seems rather extreme. The game sets every quest for you to become either some sort of saint, or a completely evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. To put it into an analogy, you're either giving candy to an orphan, or you're kicking said orphan in the teeth.\n\nAlmost all cutscenes use canned animations, which can be a bit of an eyesore later in the game, and of course there are graphical errors and glitches that might scare some people away; It's understandable, seeing as you can SEE UNDER THE CHARACTERS' EYELIDS.\n\nThe game is also a bit too easy. As long as you have a steady supply of potions that you can buy with gold that's easy to obtain, you can't die. If you really wanted to have a feeling of difficulty, you would need to throw out all of your resurrection vials and try to limit your potions. That's pretty much the only way to make this game harder than it is.\n\nAll bad points aside, I truly enjoy this game; even enough to call it my favourite game ever. I sincerely recommend this game to anyone reading this. It may not be the most immersive RPG in existence, nor could it stand up to the likes of Kingdoms of Amalur in gameplay, I still say you should give it a try by any means possible.\n\nThat being said, though, stay away from the sequels to this game.","November 16, 2012","true","60.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Fable is a RPG in which your decisions dictate where the story will go. You can be a Hero of purity and good or a Hero of deceit and evil. This was a groundbreaking feature when it first released because no other game on the market had that "I really control this character's life" feel to it. With a unique skill leveling system, you can make yourself a burly warrior, a gifted mage, a craft thief, or as I like to do, a "Jack-of-All-Trades" sort of build.\n\nWhen the game begins, you are still just a boy in the town of Oakvale. It's your sister's birthday and you need to find her a present. Your choices start at a young age, as you decide where you want to do good or bad deeds to make the few gold needed to get the gift. Shortly after you get the gift, bandits raid your little town and slaughter everyone. You're saved by a member of The Heroes Guild and taken there where you'll grow up and learn to be a Hero. Will you be The Hero of Avo or a Servant of Skorn. The choice is yours.","February 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite its age, the game holds up pretty well by today's standards. You can play as Evil or Good by making moral choices. The combat hasn't aged too well, but the combo system is still very fun. The game is mostly linear; however in-between main quests, you can choose to do side quests, explore around for treasures, or buy a house and marry someone. Visually colorful with a unique art direction. Musics are great and memorable. The story is simple and straightforward, but there is a lot of lore if you care to read the books and pay attention to what NPCs say. Overall a good RPG.

If you haven't yet, do so. It's a great fantasy roleplaying game that might be a little easy. However, it oozes charm, and has a fun, action-packed combat system. While Fable II is the best in the series, this is a great game, too. And the best part is that this version has the true ending, extra quests and weapons, and a ton of stuff added to the base game. At this price, you can't lose. So check it out!","March 2, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite its age, the game holds up pretty well by today's standards. You can play as Evil or Good by making moral choices. The combat hasn't aged too well, but the combo system is still very fun. The game is mostly linear; however in-between main quests, you can choose to do side quests, explore around for treasures, or buy a house and marry someone. Visually colorful with a unique art direction. Musics are great and memorable. The story is simple and straightforward, but there is a lot of lore if you care to read the books and pay attention to what NPCs say. Overall a good RPG. It's humorous world, fun combo system, and exploration will give you a good 20 hours of Fable.","March 10, 2014","true","34.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Have a warrior that uses the most important magic abilities (etheral swords, slow time, heal etc) they greatly help in combat and can be used quickly.\nthere is also one thing i love very much, the level up system.

The soundtrack is incredible, and the voice acting is all quite enjoyable.

Didn't limit my experience.\nI actually enjoyed the more confined setting as a nice change of pace.\nThe graphics may not hold up today to some, but to me they are above passable.\nThe combat I would say is the weakest link in this game.\nI was put in to situations where NPCs would spam stun techniques which would lead me getting multi-hit and multi-stunned with out me even being able to give a simple movement command in response. Allowing a very frustrating experience.\nAside from this, which seemed to only happen against the Rock Trolls or larger enemies that used AoE the coimbat though limited and repetitive managed to keep my interest.\nI am a huge fan of stories in games, and this story seemed a bit sterotypical and generic for a RPG.\nYet it kept my interest with the townsfolk around me commenting on my recent quests I have achieved/completed.\n\nI would say this is for any RPG fan for a quick play through, or if you want another average to above average RPG to dive in to. I will say this is worth the 10$ price tag, but I would wait for a sale for a extra pick up, rather than a main purchase. If you were to do that, as I did.

The player (You) follows the life story of a little boy who loses everything and is taken in as a student of a Hero school then you can choose to live his childhood or not and that's all i'm giving out! Not gonna spoil the fun :)\n\nThe world itself is responsive to what you do and the Npc's react to what you have done, if you have been good they will be warm towards you, and you'l get a circle above your head like if you were an Angel, If you have been doing bad deeds ( like me) such as hiting people with sticks, kicking chickens etc XD, you'l grow horns and people will fear you and be cold towards you. But that can also be influenced by what type of armor you are wearing, some types of armor have an "evil look" to them  causing people to be repulsed by it.\n\nAnother fact about the world is that it is not fully open world it's region locked, little areas where you can explore and that's a minus in the game, but considering it's age it's not something the developers could do about it. There is fast travel areas in the hero school where you will receive numerous quests and where you can upgrade your character.\n\nYou can also buy titles such as "The Chicken chaser!", "Sabre" and many others that I can't remember right now hehe.You can customize your character by finding cards of tatoos, beards or haircuts in chests you find in the world.\n\nThere are doors guarded by Old men faces that provide the player challenges some are to get a kill streak or getting fat, and as you complete the challenge you will be able to enter the big doors and a chest will be found with loot inside it. There are tons of things to do in this amazing world.\n\nThe Ending is one that will stick with you, the way it ends is choosen by you, I found the Good ending more satisfying than the evil ending. It is a great game and if you don't have it yet or have money left over during steam sales give it a go. You won't regret it :)\n\nI give this game an 8/10 Very good game!!","April 7, 2014","true","13.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

The player (You) follows the life story of a little boy who loses everything and is taken in as a student of a Hero school then you can choose to live his childhood or not and that's all i'm giving out! Not gonna spoil the fun :)\n\nThe world itself is responsive to what you do and the Npc's react to what you have done, if you have been good they will be warm towards you, and you'l get a circle above your head like if you were an Angel, If you have been doing bad deeds ( like me) such as hiting people with sticks, kicking chickens etc XD, you'l grow horns and people will fear you and be cold towards you. But that can also be influenced by what type of armor you are wearing, some types of armor have an "evil look" to them  causing people to be repulsed by it.\n\nAnother fact about the world is that it is not fully open world it's region locked, little areas where you can explore and that's a minus in the game, but considering it's age it's not something the developers could do about it. There is fast travel areas in the hero school where you will receive numerous quests and where you can upgrade your character.\n\nYou can also buy titles such as "The Chicken chaser!", "Sabre" and many others that I can't remember right now hehe.You can customize your character by finding cards of tatoos, beards or haircuts in chests you find in the world.\n\nThere are doors guarded by Old men faces that provide the player challenges some are to get a kill streak or getting fat, and as you complete the challenge you will be able to enter the big doors and a chest will be found with loot inside it. There are tons of things to do in this amazing world.\n\nThe Ending is one that will stick with you, the way it ends is choosen by you, I found the Good ending more satisfying than the evil ending. It is a great game and if you don't have it yet or have money left over during steam sales give it a go. You won't regret it :)\n\nI give this game an 8/10 Very good game!!","April 7, 2014","true","13.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

A must play for anyone searching for a fresh fruit from a familiar tree. Fable covers the basics anyone would expect from an RPG and adds comical and quaint ideas of its own. Gameplay is smooth and intuitive and the graphics are charming and timeless. The voice acting is superb, only adding more charm to the game. Don't listen to the hype on forums, anyone who has anything negative to say about this game ruined it for themselves by anticipating something this game wasn't meant to be.

Blegh\n\n\nOverall: 7.0/10\nFable is a hard beast to understand at some points, you'll be going through the game and always feeling like you're getting ♥♥♥♥ done, but whether you're getting ♥♥♥♥ done for yourself, or just for the game's sakes is up for debate. This doesn't mean that you feel empty during it, killing the big figurehead and not killing the big figurehead makes me reflect upon it, and the game will at some points too.\nThe "forces" of the game suffer as well, much like an issue I had with Fallout, being that you killed bandits or Ceaser's Legion, the pure fact that all that I did was just coincidental to trying to survive, I now pay the price by having forced upon me good karma, in this game, good luck achieving neutral status anywhere in the game, it'll take some work.\n\nThe game is short, way too short considering The Lost Chapters was an update of the old game to make it longer, you can beat it in a few sittings if you're determined, and that's with consideration of secondary quests and ♥♥♥♥. Personal pet peeves always ranging along with the Demon Door's as well, perhaps that was their point but trying to unlock all of them just makes you feel like a tool.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a super cool game, I'd expect nothing less from Lionhead - the gods of Karma Games. But it can certainly feel pushed onto you sometimes.","July 10, 2013","true","21.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It covers and AMAZING story, alongside a bunch of really nice side-quests.

Step by step you grow to be stronger, faster, smarter, and also older. Either you choose to be a mage, a warrior, or a rogue, you will end up to be the greatest hero of all, a Legend.\n\nNow, the game has nice graphics (even though it was released in 2005 for PC), an AMAZING soundtrack, and one of the best, and most memorable voice actings ever.

Lots of memorable songs that help to describe the tension or calmness of a situation that the game places you in.\n\nGameplay 7/10- I got this game on the original Xbox, I loved the game then and I still do now, BUT there isn't much of a challenge to some of the major fights in the game. It might be that certain character builds are just TOO strong for the game or mabey I just played the game too much to even remember if it ever was difficult.\n\nStory 9/10- The original game had a great story, one that starts off simple and slowly builds to the main character finding out about his family and it's secrets. This game also gives you the choice to either be a hero or a villian and decide the fate of Albion and its people.\n\nOverall - Great game, if you're a fan of adventure rpgs then this game is a must buy. The game isn't too long but it is a fun game. However be warned that this game does have some minor bugs, for example on the final boss there is a choice you can make and it doesnt display the options, or in some parts the subtitles are shown but no dialoge is heard from the voice actors.","December 28, 2015","true","16.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I played a lot of this when it came out for the original Xbox and I can say that the overall story is still enjoyable to play after some time. You play as a newly trained hero who investigates about the whereabouts of his family after he is saved from his burning village. Thoughout adulthood, you learn magic and combat and have the choice to be good or evil. I would say the graphics are pretty good and orchestral soundtrack is great. However, I should mention that the game is pretty linear (there are sidequests though) and the game seemed a little easy since it was mostly hacking and slashing enemies.\n\nTo sum it up: great game with a good story.

But regardless, whether you're playing Fable correctly or not this game is a classic. Fable deserves all the recognition it was given. It aspired to be like the Elder Scrolls franchise but fell short only slightly. Thinking of it's some-what tragic downfall over the years I let loose a tear of sadness thinking of what could have been, and how I wish I could give merit of equal value to the sequels... If only this game could have lived to its full potential, but hey I still enjoyed it, and few games have a soundtrack so original and memorable. Not to mention to voice samples...

My only faults are: that it was made in the dark ages of gaming when nearly all games had male protagonists, so there isn't any female option to play as; and that the people are fairly boring (none of the NPCs have as much character background as those in Fable 2 and 3, and you've no dog as a companion). The NPCs also follow you around with simple interactions and have hearts over their heads to indicate romanceable or not. It's not Fable 3 bad, but it's certainly not as good as Fable 2. Finally, clothing is fairly limited in this game unlike its successors, as the outfits of Knight, bandit, etc, do not have dye options. Plus, it also seems like a carry-on in the series; you're required to attain a bandit outfit from boxes in order to gain entry into the bandits' camp, which is very similar to Fable 3. However, to be fair, in Fable 3 you have the options of dying the outfit and changing your hairstyle more. Plus, you never actually meet any Knights in this game, or in the others for that matter, so that outfit is made practically meaningless. Basically, Fable 1 therefore mostly just has showy outfits for the player.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan and want to find out how it began (I played 3, 2, and then 1), then this would be a good choice. The story-line is interesting, if a tad cliche, with the main character's family being separated by a bandit attack; you still have moral choices (good or bad actions, skinny or tubby, etc); there is certainly more information in Fable 1, as on the menu you can find how many houses you own to whether you're defined as hetro/homosexual through your interactions (information that isn't present in Fable 2 and 3!); you're more likely to gain scars and die during the battles in this one, as the gameplay is more difficult; and the graphics are quite good for a game this old.\n\nFurther, with the release of Fable 1 Anniversary on xbox360, the graphics are even further improved if you're more inclined to spend a little more and play on the console. The pixels are more noticeably defined on the console, but there are known glitches and the developers didn't add anything to the series. You would literally be spending your money on just lighter graphics. This PC version is just as good. In fact, it's better because it has more of a history.\n\nSo, all in all, the PC Fable 1: Lost chapters is a good game if you're looking for an intro into playing the later series or you're in want of playing a humorous game (the quests certainly do fit that bill).","January 31, 2013","true","23.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I completed the game in around 10 hours including the lost chapters section, if you loved or enjoyed the original fable back on Xbox then Im sure you would enjoy this just as much if not more but dont be sad if you complete the game within 2 seconds.\n\nGraphics - Good (for its age)\nStory - Epic (Best one out of all the Fables)\nGameplay - Does The Job (for its age)\nMechanics - Does The Job (for its age)\nMemories - Brought Back\nOverall - For the games age I'd give it a solid 8/10","September 26, 2014","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is really fun however it is exetremely short so if your looking for a game with more then 12 hours of gameplay then this game isn't for you. Also, a lot of music is reused in later parts of the game, which despite Fable's amazing sound track, does get annoying. Also the game is pretty easy considering the fact I can complete it without dying once throughout the playthrough. I still recommend this game, however. This is one of the only games besides GTA where you can randomly kill villagers for no reason, and you do get more gameplay if you try to find all the secrets without looking them up on the internet.","April 23","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is dated as hell since its an Xbox game so you're bound to have weird compatibility issues if your PC and operating system aren't ancient. It's pretty fun though for a single playthrough. Every once in a while I give this another playthrough but I enjoy it that much. It's a very simple game though. The skills you can unlock don't really do much other than look flashy and you're honestly better off just upgrading your stats until you can slash every enemy until it dies.\nIf you haven't played a Fable game, don't go in expecting much because expectations are what killed this game.","May 21","true","19.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","3"

It's so damn good in my opinion that at least every 2 years I find myself playing it again, just to re-experience it and all of its stellar contents. In my opinion it's way up there in what I'd consider one of the best RPG's - if not one of the best games - of all time. If you haven't played it before, buy it and find the time to. You won't regret it if you're interested in good video games. I'll preface in saying that I've played this game far more outside of Steam, on both PC & Xbox, so I've more hours played this than what my profile suggests.\n\nThe amount of dynamic freedom Fable offers you is unprecedented anywhere else even now. 10 years on, I'm still surprised by how much I'm allowed to do. Infiltrating a bandit camp? You can either shoot the guards to pass, or sneak in-between them. Further in, you then need to retrieve a uniform; which then allows you access to the base camp. But how do you proceed to the Boss's location? You can choose to kill all the bandits in sight, drawing out the elites, opening your passageway. How about you release captive slaves as a diversion, hire a group of assassins to do the work for you, OR acquire a pass from a shady bandit hiding in a dark corner for 1000 gold pieces. Which you can then kill him to retrieve your money. Or just skip giving the part where you pay him. And it doesn't indicate to you these options - it leaves it for you to find them.\n\nYou've got all of the game's tight mechanics, and then on top of that it shoves this titanic amount of meta-content. Visit bars to play games like Blackjack, Pairs and a table-top golf-esque game called Coin Flick. Assist traders with their passage through the woods, seek out silver keys to open locked chests or pursue a treasure trail. Go fishing. Dig up some loot. ♥♥♥♥ some ♥♥♥♥♥es that you pick up from your nearby Inn. Oh, and CHICKEN KICKING, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThere's just so much to love. The sense of culture is hilarious; the attention to detail, consuming. The story, soundtrack and characters are memorable ones, too, and after finishing The Lost Chapters - the game's rather large and only expansion, from which this edition gets its namesake - for my first time this weekend, I can easily say Jack of Blades is certainly one of the most appealing antagonists I've seen in a video game.\n\nI could write about this game for ages. One of the highest recommendations I could give for any video game out.\n\nTL;DR: If you are one of the few that haven't played Fable, go out and buy it. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome game.","June 20, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","2"

In Fable, it is simply astounding to the amount of interactions you can have with people. Sneer at them, scare the crap out of them, and children will run in terror at your approach. Or, become the saint that all love and respect, and give everyone a gift or two. Or, give 'em the middle finger and tell 'em to ♥♥♥♥ off. Then say sorry. Then ask a gay man to marry you. Reputation is everything in this game, be you good or evil, a good reputation for being good or evil is still a necessity. Or, live between the lines, but there are times that playing around with your alignment is not the way to go, and only one choice can be made. That choice, however, is entirely up to you.\nWhile the game does not entirely match up to some of the graphics of today, this game looks very beautyful and full of life, or death, especialy for it's time. The gameplay is very simple as well, and combat against multiple enemies can be fun, easy, very action packed once you get used to it. The replay value is actualy suprisingly high for the kind of game it is, and I'll tell you, I played this game on the XBOX dozens of times, each time telling myself I would become a different person, and each time, I found out something new about the game.\nI will say that if there is anyone out there who wishes to test their fantasy of a Hero or Villian, come along and experience the game that changed the way games were made.\n\n9.5/10","May 8, 2014","true","33.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoulDestroy/recommended/204030/","SoulDestroy","SoulDestroy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoulDestroy/","385 products in account","It's taken me about 8 years to get around to it, but I've finally mustered up the desire to beat Fable: The Lost Chapters - and it's taken me around 10 years to beat EITHER version of Fable. It was my first (quasi-)RPG on my first game console; so yes, I do have quite a few fond memories of this game in my youth. Does that mean that this game gets a rose-tinted reccomendation, free from the burden of actual critique? Far from it.\n\nIn terms of tone and presentation, Fable: The Lost Chapters is unique. It's one of the few fantasy settings in a video game I can think of that doesn't take much influence from Tolken: while some of the more tropey fantasy creatures such as Trolls and Nymphs are present, there are quite a few original creations, too. The artstyle and general world design echoes more traditional fantasy, giving the impression that one is, yes, in a fable. Top that off with tounge-in-cheek writing, a fantastic soundtrack by Russel Shaw, and vocal talent that is evidently from creator company Lionhead Studio's home town of Guildford, England, and Fable feels extremely fresh more than 10 years later.\n\nHowever, the mirror-sheen production values can't hide a game that is, for lack of a better word, pretentious. Every mechanic, encounter, and story element is played up to be grandiose and epic in scale, but after the first few hours, the game clearly is clearly struggling to swim to the deep end of the pool.\n\nThe game's most notable feature, the morality system, is represented by "good boy" and "bad boy" scale (note: may not actually be what they are called in-game), and the extent of how much the game changes boils down to horns or a halo on your characters head, and wether or not townsfolk run away screaming or endlessly clap their hands above their hands yelling "AAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY" (no, seriously). Most good boy points are aquired by saving people from attackers; most bad boy points are acquired by killing every non-combatant in sight. Even during major, story-influencing events, the choices are presented to you in a yes-or-no question asked by the game; the only remnants of what you did afterwards are an entry in your character's journal and villagers straight up telling you exactly what you did a few quests ago. The system is so arbitrary and easily-manipulated that you can go from villian to hero in a couple binary choices' time. Worried about a hard choice? Don't worry, the game will compansate you equally either way, so even if you choose not to do something that would be rewarding, you'll still get an alternative item or money for participating.\n\nThe combat and leveling don't leave much room for role-playing. You can level up your hero's abilities ad infinitum; sure, you'll specialize at first, but what will you do when you've leveled up your specialities' abilties nearly all the way and have spare expirience to spend on less-leveled abilites? As a result, the game's combat becomes all too easy and boring very quickly, and never compensates for your higher level. The game at least tracks how you play, so it gives you a nice illusion of having your own playstyle by giving you a title based on magic, bow, and sword use. By the game's end, your character will end up the same mary-sue every playthrough save for how many good or bad boy points you've earned and what clothing from the game's extremely limited wardrobe you've chosen to adorn your character with.\n\nAnd the rest of the game is just fluff. You can get married! Except there is very little reason to unless you want to get underpowered weapons gifted to you from time to time. Prices vary between shops, so you can be a buisnessman and buy low and sell high! Except that the price range doesn't change all that much, and by the time you're buying and selling really expensive items you'll be rolling in too much dough for it to matter. You can buy houses and shops and rent them out! Except you make tons more money for completing quests anyway, and you don't have to go out of you way to pick up your reward that way.\n\nMaybie my nostalgia goggles are broken, but even after understanding that Fable: The Lost Chapters didn't live up to the hype all those years ago, it still managed to dissapoint me. The whole game felt like it was one big lie that someone was trying desperately to show that it was true. Given the precendence of Lionhead Studios and it's rather hyperbole-prone founder, I guess I shouldn't be too suprised. Well played, Peter.","December 12, 2015","false","30.2"," 31 of 68 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","31","68","2","1"

WTF MICROSOFT?! COULDN'T YOU PORT YOUR CONSOL GAME TO THE PC WITH GAMEPAD MAPPING?!?!?!?\nI have yet to play the pc version, but after finding this out, I am turned off to play Fable: The Lost Chapters for the pc.\n\n*EDIT 3/26/2014*\n\nSo I decided to give Fable a chance and so far playing with a mouse and keyboard is not so bad. Keep in mind though that I just started playing so I have yet to have any combat. I just wanted to say that Key  and Mouse isn't as bad as I thought.\n\n*EDIT 3/29/2014\n\nSo I have been playing Fable: The Lost Chapters for a while and I feel like I must note that the game is great ALTHOUGH I do run into some difficulties due to where the actions are mapped. You might have two actions mapped to the same key, so you end up doing things that would didn't want to do. I thought that it was just me not being used the Keyboard and Mouse, but I still notice that I am getting actions twisted. I just want to make one thing clear thought, this is not game breaking. The game is still as wonderful as i remember. With added content waiting for me to explore, I am anticipating what I am going to encounter next!\n\n*EDIT 4/4/2014\n\nThis will be my final edit for Fable: The Lost Chapters.\nAfter playing Fable for like the millionth time (probably 5th time), I have to say that i did enjoy the new content. The Lost Chapters added more to the mythos behind the game and I did feel like I wanted to know more. Something else that The Lost Chapters (TLC in short) gives you is a somewhat better conclusion than the original. Although I feel like they could have done a lot more with this expansion. In a way, it feels like its what the original game SHOULD have been rather than purchasing TLC again in stores.\nI know than when people first played this game, one of the main complaints was that it was a really short game, but I dont know, I clocked in with my 5th play through at around 18 hours, and im typing this right after I finished the game, no back tracking.\nFable has a world that has SO MUCH potential, but the way it presents itself in the game seems as if it was half ♥♥♥♥♥, almost as if it was a blast talking about it, but the effort wasn't put into it. The way I see Fable is just a greeting to the world of Albion.\nGame play on the computer was difficult at fist. I had a lot of trouble getting my character to do what I wanted since some keys are mapped along with other actions, but the issue was resolved when I mapped the magic activation and exp orb gathering to the mouse thumb keys. Remaping my keys made the gameplay a lot better.\nFable is a game that is a must play, wether you are new to the series or played the sequels. I recommend when playing this that you take your time, listen to what everyone (with a green glow) has to say. and explore the world.","March 26, 2014","true","24.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

Nowadays I don't like it mostly because of it's combat system. You have to score as many consecutive hits as possible without getting hit yourself, to get the combat multiplier up. Unfortunately when I see anyone attack it's far too late to get a block up/dodge. You can kill things this way, but it feels like button smashing to me. The flying nymphs who constantly summon melee fighters to attack you are incredibly annoying, as you can only hit them with your bow with the target lock on system, which i could not get to lock on to the enemy i wanted to attack but instead the nearest enemy, which was not the nymph but all the summoned melees.\nThe good/evil choice system is interesting, i just couldn't find a motivation to do anything evil. I thought the hero suffered enough evil in his youth and got rescued by good ones to feel that good is the only path for him and there are no great rewards for being evil. BUT it's still better than Fable III which i could only stand for 2 hours before deleting it.","April 19","false","13.6"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

I'm reviewing this game as it is, for what it was to me playing it in 2016.\n\nTL;DR: I wanted to like this game a lot but overrall I couldn't get over how clumsy it is. I personally cannot recommend it to anyone. I'm sure it was more worth playing at its time, but in 2016 you have so many better RPGs at hand and this is not one of those timeless classics, which I truly thought it would be.\n\nTo start, the save system is an absolute disaster. You can manually save the game while you play, but when you're in a quest you can "hero save" which saves your items and stats but not your quest progress. In any case, both of them are extremely problematic. It's not actually consistent what saves and what doesn't, and the game is in no way smart about making sure it saves properly. For example, at some point the game forgot that I had completed a side quest, but it remembered that I had used the items required in the quest.... so basically, it made the quest impossible to complete. On a later save, a bunch of my money disappeared but it remembered the things I had bought during that same session. It just picks and chooses what it remembers and what it doesn't, occasionally breaking an entire storyline altogether. This alone is a game breaker.\n\nNow to combat. Fighting against one enemy, combat is sort of fun. You lock on to your target, you can hack and roll and block to be a formidable fighter. As soon as 2+ enemies come at you, it all falls apart. Blocking becomes useless (actually, blocking performs inconsistently to begin with). The target system is supposed to let you switch between targets but doesn't realistically let you do that in a helpful way. Most players invest in a physical shield that uses mana as a defense and doesn't allow you to use your block; this to me is a screaming flaw. So to get through a wave of baddies without being seriously hurt, you need to use an overpowered spell and consume 10 mana potions? That sounds like a cheap exploit, not like enjoyable combat. In many ways, this game rewards you for overpowering easy spells and punishes you for trying to take part in actual melee or ranged combat.\n\nThe enemies seem to be very inconsistent. You will face an enemy and find it easy to mow down, then moments later you'll come across another one and it seems to have infinite health. I don't know what the basis is, exactly. When you run into some bandits on the way to a destination and it takes 5 minutes to get rid of them in the same repetitive chop chop chop get knocked over drink mana put up shield chop chop chop sequence, it just becomes tedius. You can recruit some expensive mercenaries to help you, but in my experience the auto target likes to aim at them during battle. So I'll have ten generic looking bandits, each with a totally random mystery amount of health, swarming me while my auto-target aims at my mercenary or the person I'm supposed to be escorting to safety. What? How does that help me in any way?\n\nThere are two cosmetic mechanics in the game that are really cool to a point but become rather irritating. First of all, your character ages each time you level up skills. This is an interesting mechanic, except that nothing else ages in the same way and it is way too drastic. By time you finish leveling, you look old and withered (you are 65). Meanwhile, everone else looks EXACTLY THE SAME. The children in the game are still children. This makes aging utterly meaningless; it just ruins your toon if you care about how he looks. The other mechanic is scarring: As you get damaged in battle, you develop scars over time. This is actually really cool, until you realize that your face gets cut up like butter. Given the awful combat system I mentioned, you are GOING to get attacked and after only a few hits you will get a new cut or your old cuts will become more prominent. In the end, it's just scratching up your character for no reason. The only thing that can stop it is the afforementioned mana shield which basically strips combat of any actual skill and devolves it into hacking at your opponent as fast as you can so as to avoid being hit, and gulping down mana potions if you do get hit.\n\nThe characters in this game are f***ing irritating. There were a few funny moments that genuinely made me laugh, but for each of those there are dozens of nerve grating lines of dialogue. For a game that's so cartoonish and silly, there isn't really any heart to it because the storyline is entirely cliché and there isn't a single likeable or relateable character in the game\n\nThere are a lot of small features in the game like the chance to buy and sell for profit, marriage, owning a house, etc. Unfortunately, all of them are mere distractions and offer no real depth whatsoever. Since none of the characters are actually likeable, and marrying one just involves pressing "laugh" "flirt" "show off muscles" and giving gifts, it is entirely purposeless. You buy a house so that they can live in it, or so you can rent it out for gold. Let's talk about gold: There is a memory game you can play in the tavern that is extremely easy to win and on which you can bet thousands of gold pieces. You can win all the money you need from it, making everything to do with currency in the game entirely meaningless. Why should I do quests boasts (an interestnig feature where you bet money on accomplishing quests with special limitations) if I can just make all that money from a game of memory? Why wouldn't I just buy all the best armor there is if I can get all the money I need at any time? Any progression pertaining to the spending of money is undermined. I think the best example of how this game tacks in random features to make it seem better than it is is the experience orbs: When you defeat an enemy, it leaves experience orbs which you collect for experience. Well, why the hell are they little orbs which I can miss? Why wouldn't the game just allow me to have the experience? That exemplifies how the game sort of makes "features" out of non features. Why would I choose to be evil when it'll literally be like "save this person or brutally murder them?" Why would I buy and sell for money when I can gamble for it easily? Why would I choose to be a swordsman or archer when I can just acquire some overpowered spells?\n\nThe sad thing is, for all the roleplaying features the game boasts, there is actually no real variety in how you play. Things are pretty much predetermined for you, and the choices are an illusion or a gimmick.\n\nI dare anyone who thinks I'm not being fair to this game to look up a strategy forum. Pretty much any serious player used loopholes, exploits, or overpowered spells in order to play the game and do well. If you want to actually play the game in the way it presents itself and that has meaning to it, you will probably find it isn't worth the trouble.\n\nAltogether, I'm glad I finally got around to playing a game from the Fable series just so I could check it out, but I don't plan to actually finish the game as there is no reason to do so.","March 12","false","10.4"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

The fact that ALL guards EVERYWHERE look and sound EXACTLY the same also killed any immersion and sense of exploration. It's like the kingdom got its guards from Kamino.\n\nI ended up skipping most of the sidequests and unlockables, and I look back on the game as somewhat of a waste.\n\nIt probably held up better at the time, but it's no Bioshock. It's not even Skyrim's little brother in terms of story (and Skyrim only had a decent main storyline).\n\nGameplay is surprisingly good for a game this old though (lightning!) and it has a blend of action and tab-targeting combat, so there's that.  I still can't recommend it though.

Fable is essentially an action RPG, so I'm going to hold it to my standards of an action RPG, I feel that is only fair.\n\nSince Fable is an action RPG I guess I'd be best to start with its RPG elements. My biggest complaint is how shallow they actually are, they make Pokemon (the single player aspect that is, so the fanboys stop ripping my head off) look super in depth and complex. No thought needs to be put into leveling your character to make sure he can face the challenges ahead. The fun of RPG elements is having to make a tough call on what needs to be leveled to keep your character ready for the fights ahead. The thing is you can essentially max out the levels in every skill tree in one playthrough, this lowers replay value significantly, and eliminates the decision making aspect that makes RPG elements so enjoyable. Other action RPGs like Fallout New Vegas have max levels, so you have to making a decision as to what you're actually going to level up, this ensures the player isn't mindlessly filling all the bars on the stats screen, keeps the game interesting. All of the RPG elements are basically tacked on, and have little to do with your success in combat in any way more than how much damage you do, and how much defense you have\n\nSo if the RPG elements are rather shallow, the game must fall back on its action, or combat. The combat in Fable is rather uninteresting to be quite honest. It has little depth to it as well, as it ends up being constantly clicking to keep hitting the enemy in the face, shooting the enemy or blasting an enemy wth some spell. *Correction* Enemies do have weaknesses, but I went the whole game without noticing a real difficulty jump from ignoring these weaknesses, rendering them pointless, since they failed to add complexity to the way I played the game. Enemies don't have stats that effect the damage you do to them, like if they wear armor or are immune to certain spells or elements or weapons. So little thought is required from the player to be successful in combat. The combat is so simple that it grew quite repetitive and monotonous very quickly. An in depth RPG system and nuanced combat would give players something to dig into, invest time in and master, but this game plays more like a really uexciting beat 'em up than an RPG.\n\nOf course there is player choice and morality, which has become a near industry standard in action RPGs. Just like the combat and level system, the element of choice is just as simplistic. Most situations have very black and white morality involved, which holds back a players freedom to construct a character that is anything other than a saint or a demon. While you are given choices, you never face serious consequences for these choices, so why should they matter to the player? One choice bothers me in particular, where *SPOILERS* you can choose to put on the mask or not at the end of the game. Instead of using some kind of prompt or better yet presenting this choice to me through the gameplay, the choice happens during a cutscene, and the way they handle it baffles me to no end. Why would you click the mouse to NOT put on the mask? Wouldn't you NOT click the mouse to NOT put on the mask? How is a player supposed to know it isn't just a regular old cutscene, this isn't conveyed to the player on any level.\n\nFable highlights my problem with morality systems in general. Fable tells the player what is right and what is wrong, so the player doesn't have to think about this morality for themselves. The morality system should have been a hidden aspect of the game, working behind the scenes, so the player doesn't know they are being judged on a moral scale. If the player was making morality choices throughout the game without being told which options are good or bad, their actual moral alignment would come to light, and the game would make people think about the decisions they made. But since this game tells you immediately the good and evil options, people will choose what the game tells them is good or bad rather than what they actually believe, this morality system reveals nothing about the player, and has little bearing on the direction the story actually goes. People's true moral standing comes most to light when morality isn't in their thoughts at all. Since the morality system doesn't make me question my moral alignment, or have any serious consequences story wise, why should I care about making these decisions? I make decisions in the real world because I am concerned with their consequences.\n\nThis game gets a lot of recognition for its charm, I'd credit the game's tone. While the story, characters and setting are not exactly super compelling, especially on RPG standards, the tone is handled quite well. The tone of this game lends Fable a pretty memorable atmosphere. The most prominent example of the game's use of tone is right from the beginning when a light hearted intro is suddenly cast aside by a quite jarring, uncomfortable and expectation flipping tonal shift as tragedy strikes the main character. This intro is a nice kick-off to the game's plot, and gets the player ready to start the game. Unfortunately charm alone can't hold up a game.\n\nI feel Fable, while not as offensively simplistic as its sequels, is still too lacking in sophistication on a gameplay standpoint for me to consider it a solid action RPG, and I cannot recommend it to anyone.","March 21, 2014","false","25.1"," 84 of 192 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","84","192","2","17"

The morality mechanics, feel dated, heavy handed, and ultimately pointless, and the story isn't anything particularly special. This is by no means a bad game, the gameplay still holds up fairly well, particularly the character building, but if you don't have any nostalgic attachment and are looking for a variable RPG experience, you'd be better off picking up Skyrim, Mass Effect, or KOTOR instead.","January 28, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","5","23","3","0"

Unfortunately, the user interface is very poorly designed. To add insult to injury, the save system is probably the most idiotic that I have ever seen. You can save only very rarely in predetermined points (that you don't always know about). If any mission is a failure, the only option is to redo it until it succeeds. Ignoring failures is not even an option. The silliness of the "moral" system is not better either. There are no moral quandaries: just choices between "saving the kitten" and "crushing the kitten with your boots". Stupid.

You run around killing monsters, following a moderately good RPG story and do other stuff as well. Such as collecting, playing mini games and choosing wheter to be a good or bad guy. Most games do what it does better and just to name one around the time that this game out was Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The Knights of the Old republic game also  was better on the rpg aspect and really letting you feel like you're making good choices or bad choices.

I've played through this game three times, two to completion; and the third time is why I don't recommend getting this game. My first time I played a warrior, the game was a piece of cake. I had like two points in mage and so when I got to the point where you had to used ranged -- it was slow and I went through a ton of healing potions but doable.\n\nThe same thing with playing a mage. If anything after a few levels it was beyond easy to run around and basically wipe the floor with anything that came close. There's lots of threads that talk about how OP mage is for good reason, the game is a cake walk with it.\n\nBut the third playthough I wanted to do a pure archer. Only turns out you can't. There are certain quests where you will get mobbed even trying to be extremely sneaky and one shot people with max range -- certain quests essentially require close combat.\n\nI don't mind when a certain combat style or class, is overpowered and much easier to play through. In fact that's sometimes a plus; but to have a whole class be nearly impossible to win with does bother me. I don't actually think you can complete the final boss battle as an archer -- it's again structured to give an advantage to mages and warriors who can take damage close combat style.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something, because there's certainly gear and setups for all three combat styles, but it just feels like range is really underpowered throughout.\n\nOverall, you really do become insanely powerful proportionally quickly. The later levels were honestly overly easy, even with the additional content added, I still breezed through it all. Wearing plate as a warrior you're essentially invulnerable; and you can get several swords that can single shot almost everything. There's no real challenge to the game.\n\nThat all being said -- I consider it "adventure game lite" in that it's short enough to beat in an afternoon and have seen all the content and feel satisfied that you played a whole game. Excluding silver key and demon door hunting there's about 7 hours of content per playthrough, which makes in a nice fix for wanting to play a RPG but not wanting to invest 100+ hours in an elder scrolls game.\n\nI would say it was kiddie -- but there's enough sexual innuendoes, and a brothel outright at one point, that make it rated-M and so it just falls into a category where it feels like something I would let a kid play as introduction to the genre but it has moments of being a little to edgy for that.\n\nPros\n+ Easy difficulty\n+ Good length\n\nCons\n- Unmemorable story\n- poorly balanced combat triangle\n","December 7, 2014","false","24.3"," 6 of 26 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","6","26","0","1"

Unlike most RPGs, there were immense amounts of choices on how to build, and essentially, how to play as well. There is a main storyline, of course, and a presecribed path to take, but the game does sell on its promised choose your destiny format.\n\nThat said, gameplay is quite broken in general, and takes adjustment if you wish to scrape by without the broken aspects. For instance, you can make money simply buy buying and selling stuff to the same shopowner, as his stocks of items fluctuate the cost. Additionally, the most broken skill in the game is Physical Shield, as it not only keeps you from taking any damage at all, but you don't get thrown around, and you never lose your precious combat multiplier, so long as you chug mana potions, and that helps break the game wide open for you. But, in general, any character can grind to the point of being all-powerful, with some time invested, of course, as any build path is open for any character, as even though "Being good" or "Being bad" does influence your skill pool minimally, it's even more minute because fluctuating between good and bad is not difficult (especially for being bad...).\n\nAll that aside, the game was pretty much the first game to give a hero any type of plotline choices that I saw, and I must commend them for that. However, the game has a poor look for being released on Steam nowadays, and only diehard plot enthusiasts or general gamers who want to experience it all will enjoy this. I had to buy it for old time's sake, and while it has managed to accrue a bit of playtime, I don't see many out there enjoying this for what it's worth in this age of gaming. I really don't know of anything like Fable still, and I enjoyed it more than Fable III (haven't played the others...), but getting through the early game will be hard to weather through to get to the better parts of the plotline and become strong enough to feel less than some shrimpy character at times. In my opinion, casters are very underpowered, partly because Physical Shield is so overpowered, and will sap your mana if you don't kill things fast enough as a caster. The other paths get so much more powerful, and I don't see why you'd even bother. Still a huge step in the right direction for a choose-your-own-path type adventure, but there is still a clearly prescribed path, like any adventure with an adversary. It just has good areas you can stray from the path a bit, and they will effect your destiny in various ways.\n\nI checked... I played it on Steam for 2nd most hours compared to any reviewer, and that's not all that much... I don't know what that could mean for certain, but I'd guess that the majority of reviewers who upvoted it are in it for the nostalgia. It was a good game in its heyday, but I believe that the strengths of this game would be overshadowed too much by its weaknesses in today's gaming environment, even at its lower price. There are a number of games that deserve being carried over into today, but while this one is on the fence for me, I'm leaving my opinion where it was; This game doesn't hold enough appeal to stand out amongst today's games.","January 7, 2014","false","95.7"," 29 of 78 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","29","78","0","1"

For a game that's really suppoused to immerse you in a fantasy world, the voice acting just throws you off. Aside from that, though, the game's good.

Not just in graphics, but in plotline. Maybe the voice acting and side quest mechanics were interesting at the time, but now? Meh. Specific points:\n\nMarketed as a game where you could have influence in the world, but....\n-You can be mayor. What does it mean to be mayor? Nothing. You don't do anything, noone reacts.\n-You can own property. What does it mean to own property? Not much. You can upgrade the furnishings, hang trophies on the wall, and collect rent. And then never go back, because why would you?\n-You can get married. Find one of the many nameless NPCs and stand in front of them to show off your manly pectorals. Then throw a ring at them. You now have access to the sex scene, which is a fade to black with suggestive voice acting. Never interact with your wife again.\n-You can be good or evil. What's the difference? Halos or demon horns. You could slaughter the innocent one day, vanquish the wicked the next, and that's totally fine.\n\nThe running theme is that none of these decisions impact the story greatly. You can occasionally choose: "kill this dude" or "don't kill this dude." That'll affect 2 or 3 scenes. Basically doesn't matter.\n\nNot sure what to say about the core gameplay. I found it very easy, but YMMV.\n\n======================================================\nResponse to first comment:\n\nI am skeptical of your rebuttal, and examined faqs and forum posts to investigate.\n\nAre you sure about that mayor thing? Everything indicates that it does nothing. I did learn that I COULD purchase and rent out buildings and businesses other than the marital homes in each town, but you have to kill the tenant to do so. Which...geez. Talk about a hostile takeover. *rimshot*\n\nAnyway, nobody reacted to me as mayor. And no new properties became available for rent. All signs point to violent death being the only way other property becomes available.\n\nStill not sure what the point of renting things out is. It'd take an awful lot of time just making the rounds accumulating rent to earn the money back, and what is there to spend the money on? There's some legendary sword you can buy with it I guess, but there's dozens of legendary weapons sitting around everywhere anyways. You can pour it into the temple of Avo to shift alignment over to good. That's something I guess, but getting good alignment just happened as a natural result of going through the main quest, since every monster or bandit killed gave some good alignment points.\n\nDidn't realize the spouse would give gifts. So that's something.\n\nAll indications also point to never having a child of one's own, that was added in Fable 2.  If you marry the right person in Bowerstone, and they happen to be a single parent of one of the children in the school, then the child may be brought along. No sign that the child would eventually act like you. The aging mechanic gets weird here too, since you might get married at age 30, get married, meet your stepchild, then advance levels to age 65 and the stepchild is still the same age.\n\nGood and evil have more result than most of these other effects, but...eh. Complaining that I'm not locked in? Hm. Perhaps I would like to be locked in a little bit. Redemption and corruption stories are interesting, and I don't want to always have to be the stupendously good-aligned butterfly-attracting goodly hero of goodness just because I ate some Tofu one time, but yeah. When I decided to try the other alignment, it was unsatisfying. Swapping the extremes is just too easy, and too without consequence. It doesn't seem the game particularly cares. Townsfolk alternately run away from me or come around to applaud me, and both are kind of annoying. Big clusters of sound files all being played at once either way.\n\nI don't know what your last comment is supposed to imply. Do you mean I shouldn't have needed to spend that much time to complete the main storyline? I could have dropped the sidequests and paid even less attention to the economy, I guess. Do you mean I should have realized that I could kill townspeople and buy their houses? I was definitely surprised to learn that, but I don't see why I would.","June 19, 2014","false","23.8"," 26 of 73 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","26","73","0","4"

"Oh, trees and other plants will grow as you progress in a realistic manner! Your choices matter! raiding a village can have a big effect on the world, a forest can probably grow in its place or it will become the new base for bandits! Your choices matter! The people of Albion's look on you will change depending on your morals! YOUR CHOICES, ♥♥♥♥ING, MATTER. What we got in truth was a mediocre, ridiculously easy, and downright boring excuse for an RPG, where your choices have absolutely no effect on ANYTHING.\n\nSo, on to the review, my time with Fable started off with excitement, I enjoyed the game in the beginning until I noticed the flaws. The first and one of my biggest problems, healing items were absurdley common, I found them at literally every turn I made, not to mention: Resurrection phials, something that keeps you from actually dying and lose your progress, were also needlessyly common, not that I ever needed them, I had over 99 health potion on me at all times, not to mention I had well over 500 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things of red meat, which resulted in me ALWAYS having max resurrection phials.\n\nNext awful part, the story, Now what makes an RPG good besides the feeling of growing stronger and feeling like a hero? A non-generic, non-cliché, interesting and well thought out story. Does Fable the lost chapters include this, not in the least bit, it has a boring story with an overused theme that has been in every fable game to this date, "Oh I'm a Hero looking to seek revenge on the stupid butts that killed a certain member of my family, erp a derp a dur!" Characters are uninteresting and have no soul (well more soul than Fable 2 I guess, what a ♥♥♥♥ing mess).\n\nOn to combat, role a mage/melee build, use berserk and physical and divine fury or infernal wrath, repeatedly click using whatever overpowered as hell weapon you own, assign both mana and health potion to 1 and 2 on your keyboard and spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of those, win the game.\n\nFinally, what makes Fable completely fall apart, the overhyped theme of your choices effecting the world. Peter Molyneux originally would constantly brag about how every morale choice you make in Fable ompletely effect those around you, when I played through the whole game, at no point did I think that my choices were effecting ANYTHING, I actually played through sections twice to see the difference between my choices, did anything change? Barely, except for my devil horns (oh no I'm slightly more ugly than I was before.)\n\nOverally Fable the lost chapters is really not a too good of a game, it can hold your attention for roughly 30 hours or so but has no real replayability, luckily it is only $10 on steam, so it isn't really stealing your money.","July 9, 2014","false","53.9"," 6 of 28 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","6","28","0","0"

The combat is the same as the other games (I guess they found a good system and kept with it). The only problem I have with this game is its story and graphics... now don't get mad and say games aren't all about the graphics because I agree but I admit it helps make the game appealing to the eye making for a better experience.  On the story side its the same as 2 and I haven't played it but probally the same as 3. The story goes you lose your family and join a guild to become a hero to fight evil yada yada... ugh it just annoys me and makes me bored thats why I never completed this game and I did complete 2. It's because the story for 2 was new to me but then it became boring as I had to revisit it in Lost Chapters.","August 14, 2014","false","11.2"," 1 of 17 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","17","0","1"

Just does not work. Might be a compat issue with win8.1 who the fk knows.\n\nAnd Microsoft is, of course, no help on this game. Their help pages for this game, and all of their games for that matter, are so vaguely generalized that it might as well just say "make sure you PC is plugged in and turned on and make sure you are sitting in front of it and not in another room". In a day and age where companies are striving harder for more customer satisfaction with improvements like live chat tech help, 24/7 phone support, and answering emails within 1 business day, companies like Microsoft are still bottom of the barrel customer haters and GFWL proves just how much they care about the consumer. Good riddance to GFWL. There is a very good reason that Valve hates Microsoft and Windows 8 and wants nothing to do with them and made their own Steam Machines with a linux-based operating system. And that reason is that Microsoft is in the PC business for many reasons, games being the dead last reason. They are more interested in buying out small companies then shutting them down to eliminate competition and increase their net worth and making future operating systems dumbed down for a broader dumber audience. Most people have their heads up their asses, watching garbage like duck dynasty and listening to Miley Cyrus. Microsoft wants to cater to the dumbest common denominator. If that is the case they should cater to DayZ players lol.","March 26, 2014","false","0.3"," 11 of 41 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","11","41","0","7"

This game feels pretty restrictive by today's standards in terms of what you can do and where you can roam. Also the good/evil mechanic is very simplistic compared to other games, even ones that are older than Fable (being evil just means helping out bandits, other games allow you to join assassin's guilds or criminal syndicates, or even to join a despotic tryannical government over a democratic people's revolt). The characters lack complexity or depth, your main "rival" Willow for instance seems to despise you for no other reason than to give you an opportunity to have a rival. I did enjoy the ability to be an entrepreneur and invest in properties, trade goods for profit etc. and the character customisation, I guess I just expected a lot more though considering the hype around this game. 5/10 from me.","February 26, 2014","false","18.2"," 10 of 39 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","10","39","0","0"

Originally it was only for the XBOX.  Years later it was on Steam and I got it cheap.  I have played it for 20 hours, but I did not finish it.  I finished the main quest, but once I got to the expansion part, I just couldn't make myself play it any more.  The people who made this game sure had some strange Ideas such as the color of your clothes causing NPC reactions, what kind of mustache actually matters, etc...\n\nAnyway the UI is horrid.  The mechanics are somewhat simplistic.  I do not care about any of the NPCs in the game.   Perhaps at the time it was revolutionary, but it has not aged well.   It did spawn 2 sequals.  I am not sure why.  I can't reccomend it, however if you are bored and this is very cheap and you go in with low expectations, you might be pleasntly surprised.","January 12, 2013","false","20.1"," 0 of 18 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","18","0","1"

I was young and stupid, and ended up selling all of my clothing to the Guild shop vendor then wondering why I was running around naked. I quickly became better at this game, and learnt everything there is to know about it, and it's been keeping me entertained for years. All together I've probbaly played this game for about 1000 hours.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly smooth, and the controlls aren't hard to get used to, although I personally enjoyed them a lot more on console. But if you're looking for a challenge, then this game might not be for you, although that can depend on how hard you make it for yourself. If you regularly level up and get the best weapons you can (which can be found pretty early) you'll blast through this game no problem, but if you stick with an iron sword and rarely level up, you'll have a bit of a tough time. You could always try and play through this game on the unnoficial "hardcore" mode and never level your character.\n\nThe graphics are part of this game's charm. The textures are well done, well detailed, and the lighting is pretty nice to look at as well. The music is decent, but I found it's stuck with me over the years, while the actual game sounds are nicely done as well. No low quality, and they sound like they actaully fit with each action.\n\nThis game is pretty short, if you do just one playthrough. You'd be lucky if you got more than 17 hours out of it, but there are tons of choices to make throughout the game, so there's a bit of replayability. There's a few easter eggs around as well, which are always nice to see.\n\nThat's my review for Fable: The Lost Chapters. Hope you like it and hope you enjoy Fable as much as I do! :)","November 18, 2014","true","124.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lost chapters is extremly awesome because of the bonus boss fight at the end! The only con I can say is there really is no point to being good since you can slaughter towns after you leave the guild and become evil enough to get willows pickaxe and have one of the most powerful weapons in the game early on.\n\nI have played this game and passed it over 50 times, evil, good, strength focus/ magic focus / skill focus and such, and only recent purchased it for pc.\nThis is the best fable game, fable 2 and 3 are a joke and i was heart broken when i played them.\nNO other fable game has bosses and a variety of inventory like this one.\nOn top of that, the British humor is always a plus since it can be dry at times, and i love dry humor.\nI really wish there were more games like this, unfortunately this is the only one of its caliber. I'd play it again and again, and the silent protaganist makes it feel like  you are the hero/villain.\n\n\ntldr;\nYou can own a brothel,\nbeat people to death with a stick\nfart on people/air guitar\nGet shopkeepers drunk and rob their store blind\nKill someone and buy their house for cheap\nMake people fall in love with you and follow you to the chapel of skorm where you can hilariously sacrifice them\neating chicken is considered an evil act\n\n10/10 would eat chicken again\n\n","February 10, 2015","true","37.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/methrael/recommended/204030/","methrael","Methrael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/methrael/","279 products in account","Fable is a game about one thing - beating the snot out of everything in sight.  Many will say that it is supposed to be about choice, but in reality the choices don't matter aside from giving you specific weapons (or constantly having the village guards on you about simply existing).  Beat up enemies, search for relics to increase your power, do quests to increase your influence, follow the storyline.  Rinse, repeat.\n\nIn terms of environment I'd prefer a game similar to Dragon Quest 8 or The Elder Scrolls for this type of gameplay.  The world is segregated by zones and paths between them rather than an open world you are able to get lost in, quickly quashing any feeling of freedom in exploration you would otherwise have in the game.\n\nFreedom in building your character, on the other hand, is much closer to the other end of the spectrum.  You can play as a melee weapon strength user, a ranged weapon skill user, or a physics-bending will user.  Or, if you want to put another 100 or so hours into the game, you can do all three and make yourself nearly untouchable.  Tons of melee weapons, ranged weapons, and spells make any of the three viable - but ultimately you'll be building these up by beating the snot out of everything in sight.","November 30, 2014","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you perhaps choose to get married and retire your life of heroics for the life of a familyman, nothing's to stop you! Almost anything is imaginable in the world of Albion as you can choose to become a heroic warrior or an evil warlord as you set upon a path that will affect everything around you in one way or another.

The actual story is also really deep and governed by the characters personal choises. Even the choices the character takes define how others see him, physicaly and individualy. The only negatives could be that there are set paths to follow with a sizeable movement area, and that there is no character creation at the beginning. The character is a boy that grows into a man over the course of the game. The player can dress in whatever they so choose as to also have as many tatoo's or whatever hair style they want.

It's great. It's user friendly for its age, the camera controls aren't as weird as the second game and everytime I play it I don't stop for hours. The graphics aren't as great as the second or third but there's just something about this game that makes me return to it. In this particular Fable you age as you play the game until you become an old man. I love that concept and I wish the newer ones integrated it. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't be a female. If you have the money and like a game with rich lore and nostalgia play it.

The gameplay is (in my opninion) a little bit harder using a key board but the UI is also easier than a controller. The choice to become good or evil definitely adds immersion, especially how the NPCs react to your presence depending on your moral standing.\nThis game's replayability level is very high, because different playthroughs can lead to different experiences.\nFor an old game it's still a good game! and the HD remake was one of the smartest things that Lionhead has done. Making fable 3, however, was not (nor was the introduction of guns).","August 18, 2014","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must say, this is the only good one, now shut up about its graphics and somewhat poor combat, the storyline and all that has made up for that, you start out as a poor little boy and later into the game you can be a really Powerful Wizard or a Overpowered Knight, there are many weapons (Not with the greatest names..) but there is a LOT of weapons to choose from, the Armor in this game is outstanding! First you start as a lil' lamb on the hill, then you become an Evil King sent to destroy either whoever gets in your way or just to belch in a traders face! Great game! i would easily give this game a 10/10!!! This game has not only invited me into Chicken-kicking but has also made me find the liking of... Hmm, well playing air Guitar while fighting Towns-guard... Don't mind me im just killing a loop of guards for evil points. Ah yes, Evil and Good. Most of your Killing effects your allignment of the world, you can play a butterfly wizard or be a revolting demon archer, not only do the horns look fantasticly cool, but actually kind of scary, the Halo and butterflys that are above your head when you play good, is quite conforting and sets the "Im a Good Guy" to the players face. The villagers make funny remarks to you during your somewhat linear gameplay, but don't let that get to you, there are plenty of areas to go around. Forest, City, Snow, Island. Its atmosphere is quite amazing, you can spot Sparrows around the Guild (Starting Area) - Over all of the Fables, This is the only good one and i have spent a decent amount of hours into it, Fighting Scorpions, Krakens, Bandits, and well, i don't want to spoil anything *cough* FIRE *cough* that should hint enough, there are no guns, sadface, don't worry, just buy the damn game and lik-love it!","February 4, 2013","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Leveling up your character is kind of like the system in Elder Scrolls, the more you use some kind of attack the better you get at it and can get new skills. The game puts you in a position to chose how you can do a quest and in the end if you did it in a bad way you will get some bad points or a good way to get good points. You can become good, evil or in between and every choice you make has consequences on the world. Dialogues are very witty.

Although with wifes there's not much point, fable was good at avoiding the question why? when it came to that. Also sucks you can only be a man but i guess they added that in Fable 2. The combat felt very smooth although sometimes unbalanced with the ridicoulous mage AoE spell. I personally just loved sneaking around and shooting peoples heads off with my bow.

I was one of the poor fools waiting years for it to come out, and event hen I was kinda late to the party.\n\nAll you really need to know is that this game -should- be awful. It failed the hype more than any other game in the history of ever (except maaaybe Duke Nukem Forever, because that one is awful), the graphics were not what they could have been, the combat shouldn't be fun, the voice acting is painful, the story is simplistic, and a few of the design decisions for models still hurt my brain.\n\nBut the game is wonderful. For all that is 'missing', your mind is happy to fill it in, for all that combat should be a boring slog, every player will try a handful of weird rules and challenges, or, just goof off entirely, and get their fun. Collectibles are at once plentiful, and achievable without aid. Marriage is utterly pointless and unfulfilling. . .that's it, marriage is just pointless and unfulfilling. >.> Meta humor >.>\n\nPoint is, there is no reason this game should be so awesome, and that's why it stands out as the shining beacon of "See here! This is what matters!" - Aesthetics. Every individual piece seems mismatched, disjointed, and frankly lacklustre on its own. Put them together and. . .you know the rest. Personally, I find this games sits with precious few others on that point of pure aesthetic gold, and among western-produced RPGs? It almost stands alone.\n\nBacking away from cartoonishness severely damaged the franchise, and I really do place 90% of the blame on that alone. I'm serious. If they remade Fable III, the exact game, but with Fable's graphics (and more important, use of graphics)? It'd be fine. Tho the ♥♥♥♥♥ map, weird hero retreat thing, and those damned guild seals to unlock chests vs. the old xp system would still be huge marrs, I think we could forgive a lot more if the game had just been charming.\n\nI'm buying Anniversary because I have to see it first hand. . . but looking at the screenshots honestly reminds me of when I heard the interview about how they finally had the tech to render lifelike creations in Phantom Menace, and used that to make Jar Jar Binks. . . . . What you do with what you got matters a helluva lot more . .tho I never liked Star Wars as a franchise because it's aesthetic has never appealed to me (too much metal >.>), and all it has to offer is the EXACT Hero's Journey, in space, with Buddhism.

If you're reading this, you're looking for a review on Fable: TLC, and i aim to please you with such.\n\nFable - The Lost Chapters ( Fable:TLC for short) is the PC-Port of the game Fable 1 with added content & storyline, which also got released on the Xbox slightly after, the game focuses on being an action third player person view game which allows you to roleplay and costumize your character(hero) whether it be through skill, personality or appearance in various different ways.\n\nThroughout the entire game, you'll be given choices of which are categorized by beither either "good" or "evil", and by doing said actions, you gain points for each one, being evil will modify your character's visual look and make him look visibly like a demon, otherwise, by doing good, you'll have a halo on your head, and your hair will turn white alongside having butterflies fly around you.\n\nDo these actions actually matter towards the storyline? Yes, they do, you're given different cutscenes depending on what path you take and certain things change in the game as well as having different spells you can master.\n\nI'll be appointing each section a numerical value between 1 and 10 to make it easier and to allow quick TL;DR for those who don't really care for the in-depth review.\n\n-- Graphics --  (7/10)\n\nThe game was originally released in 2004, then had it's expansion released in the later year of 2005, i'd state the graphics are very good for it's age and that they do not look bad at all, even if you think that way, the game is quite customizable and you can use mods to enchance your gameplay performance. ( There's also Fable:TLC Anniversary on Xbox now.)\n\nAre there any bugs regarding the graphics? Very little, you may experience some errors occasionally regarding character glows or weapon glows or entering a new area and the loading being awkward, but nothing out of the extraordinary.The game brings widescreen support so you also don't have to worry yourself about any of the screens bigger than 4:3 ratio.\n\nSome may be annoyed by the character's textures, but i think they look fine for the age of which the game was produced.\n\n-- Gameplay -- (7/10)\n\nThe initial parts of the game hold very little action as it is showing you the storyplot, but as soon as you're done with the "Wasp Queen" quest, you'll start to frequently experience more and more action.\n\nThe gameplay is very action-based and revolves around you as a hero focusing on the utilization of three main powerpoints, Strength, Skill(Speed, accuracy and stealth) and Will( Magical prowess), you spend points on these throughout the gmae in order to improve your character's statistics.\n\nSimilarily to an MMO, the way to gain those points is by killing enemies, or doing quests, which will gain you "experience points", points that can be used to tap in all three of the major areas, or you can utilize specific points to each one.\n\nIngame, you're given the option of going in full melee, sitting back with a bow or utilizing magic to enchance yourself, or a mixture of all of them, i believe that they did the variation very well and that there's no real downsides here, at times the characters may be able to hit you through awkward hitboxes, but that doesn't happen frequently.\n\nYou may experience annoyance at the GuildMaster's constant bickering if you do not heal your Will/HP energy points up by either eating/utilizing a potion.\n\nNPC spawns are predictable and very rarely change with area when it comes to the enemy AI, they mostly repeat the same process over and over, HOWEVER, the AI is not to be underestimated as it is quite random and at times it will DECIDE to hit you when you least expect it, or block attacks and counter-attack you back, so it does increase the difficulty and i say kudos on this.\n\nFor some, the game will be considered quite easy, and you will most likely not die a single time, the replay value in the gameplay is very high, so you can consider re-doing the game and even imposing challenges on yourself, or doing the "boasting" challenges that they grant you for each quest after the starter ones, allowing you to effectively increase the skill-cap required. ( Begins at the Orchard Farm quest).\n\nWeapon variety is high, from a numerous amount of 1handed weapons, 2 handed, and allowing you to even change between crossbows and bows for ranged endeavors, the modding is also well open and allows the modification of weapons to create new custom-content or even apply other character weapons into your own.\n\nSame applies for customization, you can customize your character in any way you'd like, ranging from tatoos, different titles, armor, mixing armor parts( boots, shirt, etc) and all sorts of fun stuff.\n\nIE: You CAN get drunk in this game or become fat, and there are various mini-games, easter eggs,jokes & Demon doors along the way so that the gameplay is not constantly filling your face with action, same for the side-quests which allow you to take a small break from the main one.\n\nYou can abuse certain points of the game to get your character stronger than it should be at the current time or grab items that you otherwise would have difficulty having through the "Hero Save" option, or by utilizing a trader glitch that allows you to gain more everytime you buy and resell specific items at the early stages of the game allowing you to rack up a large amount of gold. But these do not necessarily break the game for me, and you can choose not to utilize them in the first place as they were player-created.\n\nMore on the "Hero Saving", you have two types of save, a "World" save in which it saves your current position and everything you hold, and a "Hero Save" which saves your items currently held and puts you at the initial scene of the quest, you MAY not save your location ingame during an ongoing quest which may annoy some.\n\nA trait that may be annoying for some is the aging system which is based on your skill progress.(age increases as you level skills)\nOthers may get bored out of the action-combat due to having too much experience with the game, however the replay value is great even then.\n\n-- Performance -- (8/10)\n\nThe game's performance is great, it works even on older PCS with outdated graphic cards, and it has many numerous options in order to tone down the graphics, i did not feel at any time any moment of which i had a drop of FPS.\n\nThe game is compatible with different types of OS so you do not need to worry about having Vista, XP or Windows 7, as they all work.\n\nThere is a slight problem in that the game will SOMETIMES CRASH unexpectely and for unknown reasons, or simply NOT play Audio clips at times it should, however it does have a safe-mode itself and you can usually run that if you run into any performance issues.\n\n-- Audio -- (6/10)\n\nThe OST is decent, i feel as though it could've been better and it is lacking in a lot of fighting scenes / cutcenes, the ones that do have it are fitting though, nothing majorly special.\n\n-- General -- (7/10)\n\nI believe the game is quite legendary for it's time, even if you dislike it or hate it, it has created a giant fanbase and was one of the best prequels imagineable for the Fable series, many people to this day still prefer Fable:TLC over Fable II &  Fable III.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who wants a game with a lot of fighting & magic, but at the same time wants to roleplay, enjoy himself and fascinate himself with the good story plot that it provides, making full use of the unique story-dialogue cutscenes given to you.( they may be boring for some but i for one love them)\n\nIt is a must-buy for any RPG-lover and if it's on sale i would definitely say get it as it's worth every penny unless you are not into the genre.\n\nThanks for reading this review, and i hope that gave you a good idea of what the game is like, allowing you to reconsider and ponder your opinion on whether to get it.","August 11, 2014","true","30.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most likely you won't see the plot twists coming, the twists and turns of the story are amazing.\nOne downside, that isn't really a downside just side you can abuse greatly, is the economics. By realising that everything works in a supply and demand way, and that traders have infinite money, you can easily make over a million gold before even going through darkwood.\n\nAll in all, I think the game is wonderful and would gladly recommend it!","August 1, 2014","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is just so outdated, I can't play for five minutes straight without rolling my eyes.\n\nThe biggest issue I had was with the combat system. I built a warrior/rogue character because I wanted to enjoy some skill-based combat. However, I found that I was locked onto an enemy, it was difficult to switch between multiple targets with accuracy. This made it hard to block incoming attacks from the flanks or focus on different enemies. So I stopped locking onto enemies, but this made it extremely difficult to use the Assassin Rush skill as it required me to lock on to a target (which is almost random), use the skill, and then stop locking on. Destroys my groove.\n\nAlso, the stealth mission at the beginning of the game is terrible.\n\nNeedless to say, this was an amazing game for its time. However, I think replaying this game has made me realize and appreciate how much game design has advanced in the years since its release.\n\nSo if you remember this being a great game, I suggest that you just hold on to those memories and spend your money on something else. I recommend something more recent.","September 25, 2014","false","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
