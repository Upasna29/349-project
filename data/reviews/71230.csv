"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElBaha/recommended/71230/","ElBaha","バ-ハBaha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElBaha/","543 products in account","-NOTE: As of September 15th, 2014, this review has been updated. Addendum at the bottom.-\n\nThis game is everything a bad PC port could ever hope to be. A quick break-down:\n\n+Increased draw distance from other versions. Very nice!\n+No HD textures, but improved filtering on PC helps a lot.\n+Runs well, no more slowdown as is present in console versions\n\n-No analog support. Acceleration and steering are either on or off, even with an analog stick.\n-The digital steering isn't very good, either. Crazy drift is practically broken on a keyboard.\n-The configuration menu only saves half of the specified settings\n-Need to make registry modifications to get controller/resolution settings to work\n-Doesn't work in full screen mode, regardless\n-There are only 4 supported resolutions, topping out at 720p\n-Severe audio mixing problems -- SFX volumes are all over the place.\n-Original soundtrack was replaced with some REALLY UNFITTING music.\n-Different voice actors! Somehow even less enthused than the originals.\n-Sound clips for all voice actors and announcer are EXTREMELY low quality\n-Audio clips are now spammed like crazy. Expect to hear "Taxi!" until your ears bleed.\n-UI elements are very blatantly untouched. Extremely grainy/low-res, even at 720p.\n-All identifiable buildings, such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and Tower records, have been removed.\n\nSo, in a game that's positively regarded for well-done arcade-style gameplay and control, a fantastic soundtrack, and a slick visual style, this port managed to achieve...well, almost one of them. The UI looks very bad, but the actual game behind it holds up fairly decently. Also, a quick search for 'Crazy Taxi PC Soundtrack Mod' will give you a way to restore the original soundtrack. The terrible audio mixing will still hamper your ability to enjoy it, though.\n\nThis really isn't worth your time for anything more than a dollar or two. Pick up a dreamcast emulator and play it that way. It's a pain to configure, but at least you'll get analog steering. How SEGA thought it would be okay to release a game that revolves around weaving a taxi in and out of traffic at top speeds without any fine degree of control is beyond me.\n\nSeptember 14th 2014 Update:\nI've left the original text in place to keep track of any improvements this game receives in the future. I'm actually quite pleased it was updated at all, and a few of the initial problems were fixed! Namely, the following:\n\n+The game now has an FXAA option! Not exactly the best AA, but hey.\n+No longer need to tweak registry settings to adjust options!\n+The game's configuration menu was completely replaced, and supports 1080p+ resolutions, including nonstandard ones. It now works on my 1200p monitor, and fullscreen at that!\n+Sound clips were normalized to all be at a reasonable volume level!\n+The interface has been updated, and will reflect keyboard bindings!\n+Keyboard controls have been reworked a bit, and are now just about playable!\n\nCombined with the fact that you can mod the original soundtrack into the game, the biggest complaints are that the analog steering/acceleration still suck (still digital input), and the crazy drift is still far too touchy with keyboard controls to actually complete any of the challenges easily. There are still minor quibbles like UI resolution, announcer/driver sound quality, the lack of branding, and so on and so forth, but none of them are nearly as game-breaking was what has been fixed.\n\nIf this game continues to be updated, pretty soon that thumbs down will turn to a thumbs up. As it stands, the game doesn't control well enough to justify purchasing it. Here's to hoping for one more patch!","July 22, 2014","false","0.7"," 109 of 129 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","109","129","0","4"

This game is criticized by a lots of players because this is the XBox Live Arcade Version. It can be considered as Crazy Taxi 1.1. The differences that players seems to disapprove is the soundtrack that is a complete new one and the fact that the Kentuchy Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut trademarks were switched to Fried Chicken Shack and Pizza Parlor.\n\nSo, here start the personal opinion, I really enjoyed that game. You're constantly having fun without raging every five seconds. The new songs list is good, the controls still really good (a way to show your arcade skills) and the new patch Sega released for all Sega Dreamcast Collection games gives you the possibility to use your own buttons and add a FXAA to your graphism. The new achievements are very easy, you can do them in a single evening if you understand the engine (If you don't you can decrease the time difficulty.) Plus, the four characters are still really cool. My personal best is Gus (ಠ‿ಠ).\n\nTL;DR : You like great american cars like a Cadiallac Eldorado 1959 or a 1949 Mercury ? You wish to ride it with arcade controls ? There you go, buddy. It's Crazy Taxi! Anyway, you like having fun and you disregard online-raging, you should try this one to take a break.\n\n→ 80/100","October 6, 2014","true","80.2"," 60 of 74 people (81%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","81","60","74","28","5"

I realize this was probably due to licensing issues, but still a bit of a disappointment.\n- The game runs up to 1080p, but the 2D elements (eg menus and the in-game hud) look extremely un-optimized and pixelated.

The smooth graphics and framerate really make this game shine. If you play on a computer that has less then the required specs, don't go for it.

Though Crazy Taxi limits your doses to one, three, five, or ten minute exposures at a time, it’s easy to develop a habit of hitting the replay button for one more shot at earning a class-S license\n\nThe goal of Crazy Taxi is to pick up passengers and drop them off at their destination, but it’s everything in-between that earns this game its fitting name. From the moment your passenger enters the cab, you’ll be off like a shot, narrowly missing other cars and taking extreme jumps to earn a little extra scratch. And by scratch, we mean money, not damage– your car is completely indestructible, so don’t worry about the paint job.\n\n\nAs you try to beat the clock, you’ll plow through outdoor furniture and other vehicles, causing mass chaos. You can’t run over the pedestrians, though, which separates Crazy Taxi from more violent vehicular simulators like Grand Theft Auto 3 and Carmageddon. Crazy Taxi is all in good fun, but don’t expect these insane driving skills to translate harmlessly in the real world.\n\nIn addition to the highly addictive main modes, you can easily spend an extra hour or two on the Crazy Box mini-missions. Nine are available to start, with seven more that can be unlocked as you play. My favorite minigame is bowling, where you have to knock down seven sets of bowling pins with your car, but i also enjoyed the obstacle courses, and a highly challenging four-minute race that doesn’t even give you a directional arrow to follow.\n\nI also appreciate the level of feedback you’ll get after completing each mission. In arcade mode, you’ll watch your rank rise from 99th place as you pick up and drop off passengers, and then you’ll receive a class license ranking.\n\n(IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION)\nAs you drive, you’ll have a very limited musical selection. Two bands, The Offspring and Bad Religion, provide the soundtrack to the game, and you’ll hear their same few songs many, many times until you decide to play your own mp3s. While the punk songs are energetic, at least a few of them have unusual themes for a driving game, like global overpopulation (“Ten in 2010”) or the cycle of abuse (“Way Down The Line”).\n\nWhatever man play  this only when you really want to have some insane fun.\nI mean it.\n","May 1","true","3.2"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","25","26","6","5"

That alone somewhat ruins the experience for me, but there's a lot more than that for sure. Nearly all the game's sounds have been changed, and in a bad way. Many of the songs play a bit too loud in game and then a couple are too quiet. There's a near constant horn that automatically plays for some reason when you nearly hit something (I think) that is really annoying and then when you do hit something, the car makes a really loud collision noise. The voices of the people you pick up and the player are also WAY too quiet. It's nearly impossible to hear them.\n\nVideo:\n\nThis could be good with a patch, but is a problem as is. The config launcher doesn't actually work and you're stuck playing at 720p the whole time. Another issue with the video is it's very stuttery. There are moments when it smooths out, but for most of the game it looks really choppy for some reason.\n\nControls:\n\nThe lack of analog controls absolutely kill this game. When using a controller if you move the stick slightly, it will register it as the same input as moving the stick fully in that direction. This results in not being able to drive around with any precision at all (I guess sort of the point of the game, but still).\n\nVerdict:\n\nGo download a Dreamcast or Gamecube emulator and play the game on there.","November 26, 2014","false","0.6"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","35","44","0","1"

Is it worth your money? Well.... Maybe, maybe not.\n\nCrazy Taxi was originally released in the arcades and later on the SEGA Dreamcast. The Dreamcast entry saw a new city added, as well as new challenge modes. This version gets all of that. But something is missing. I can't quite put my finger on it yet. Maybe I'll remember later.\n\nIn Crazy Taxi you play as 1 of 4 different cab drivers, who drive around the city picking up people and dropping them off at their destination as quickily as possible. You can drive against traffic, off road, over ramps for huge air...and even underwater. It's all a little, i don't know. Crazy! The maps are unnamed but seem to resemble the types of communities you may see in places like California. Sunny, and full of hills. A lot like San Francisco.\n\nSo the game has really 2 modes of play. The arcade mode, which is split into the original arcade setting of beating the clock and adding time with each successful fare, or an overall timed session where you just pick up as many passengers as possible in a set amount of time. The other mode being the crazy box, which is just a challenge mode with different challenges, like a long jump, combo scoring, timed courses, and more. It's a apretty simple package, but it works. It's not a weekend game, but its a good game to kill an hour or so of boredom.\n\nBut what went wrong? Why would I possibly not recommend this title? It's simple. Something is missing. Something that made the game a blast even more so to play back in the day. The soundtrack! Yeah. Licensing ran out I guess. And the once great soundtrack was replaced. But hey, this is not a big deal right? Well, when they replace some adrenaline pumping music with.....garbage (and, no, not the band Garbage), it kind of kills the overall mood of the game for some. It did for me at least.  I don't mind replacing music, but at least replace it with something more fitting! This is like watching your favorite action sequence in a movie, with music on the scene replaced and performed by.....Avril Lavigne? Yeah. It just does not work.\n\nLastly, I know there is a huge hatred for product placement in games. But for Crazy Taxi, the product placement just seemed to fit. And it gave the world a bit of charm. But that too like the great soundtrack, is gone.\n\nCrazy Taxi is a great game guys, don't get me wrong. But when it's done in perfection on other systems like the Dreamcast, I can not possibly give this an honest recommendation.\n","January 8, 2014","false","0.5"," 52 of 82 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","52","82","0","7"

The game enforces strict morals upon the player to abide by the rules of cab driving. The game features 4 cab drivers who are mentally challenged and the player must assist them in learning how to drive. The player is punished when he or she arrives too late to a destination, teaching punctuation and driving skills. The player is given money for crashing into cars, but this only goes to show that the love of money is the root of all evil.

Pick up tricky customers against the clock and race across the city to deposit them (on time) and collect their fare, then race off for the next.  Collect as much money as you can and try to earn your Class A license.\n\nGreat - except, on PC, forget it.  :(\n\nThere are inexplicable lags and frame-dropouts.  The game will have momentary freezes throughout.  I should mention that I have an overclocked i7-4930K (12 logical cores), 6Gb Titan Black and 16Gb DDR but the performance is as reported in the forums - strangely poor).  It doesn't make a lot of sense.  However, this would be tolerable if it wasn't for the wrecked controls...\n\nSega have mapped the controller to digital keys for this (bad) PC port.  There is no analogue control via gamepad, so touching the control stick lurches the car sharply full left or right (no gradual or easy turns), making it impossible to weave through traffic.  There is NO gain in using a gamepad for this game whatsoever, and on/off digital controls merely give full 90-degree turn or no turn.  Horrible.\n\nIt's a shame because this game has always been one of those entertaining lightweight games that was pretty flawless on console, but there is no joy to be found in this PC port.  Avoid if you have the game on any other format (console and Android versions are much better).","February 16, 2015","false","0.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Loads of fun.\n\nWord of Caution:\nThis game does not have proper analog stick or trigger support. It's all or nothing, so turning is always abrupt, etc.\nAlso, the original soundtrack has been replaced. I like the new songs fine, but it is not the original soundtrack.\n\nSolution: Check out the community page for it and you will see mods to correct these things.\nControls work great with a mod that is found on the community page.\nThe music can be altered and there is a guide for that as well. Or just do a google search and you will find a patch or someone who can send you a link to it.\n\nThe negative reviews are because of the above issues, but they can both be solved in about 5 minutes total, which is worth it. The graphics on this game are much better than the dreamcast version (just watch a video to see the difference). You can play full HD (models are low polygons but clear, not fuzzy at all). Give this game a go if you liked it on console, or you want to play one of the best repeatable play-against-your-best-score type games there are. 10/10.\n\nAdvice: play the tutorials (crazy box). It really helps for getting good at the game.

Being a SEGA title, the usual quirkness is abundant such as bizarre, brightly coloured character design choices & it's decade long attempt at trying to be edgy & cool without being offensive. To be fair, this was the prominent popular entertainment media attitude at the time, but it dates all SEGA's output significantly.\n\nThe PC port has the original soundtrack removed, location names changed (due to licensing issues) & analogue controls removed which makes it verge on unplayable. There is a analogue fix you can find in the steam forums, but even this still leaves playing with a 360 controller 'squirrely' & largely unenjoyable. For a game dependant on twitch controls to stack up combos from weaving between traffic, not having precise control on this version severely dampens the experience.\nEven for a SEGA game, the driving controls were far more responsive on earlier titles such as Daytona USA & SEGA Rally & as such, if you're expecting a similar level of fidelity you might be disappointed.\n\nHow much you'll get from this game depends mostly on how much nostalgia you have for the original Dreamcast or Arcade release. In which case  plenty other emulations are available to give a more authentic experience.\n\nAs a history lesson you can see more modern games that have been inspired from this such as the Kudos system in PGR, the traffic weaving combos in Burnout Paradise, or perhaps most annoyingly, the core taxi pickup gameplay appearing in every GTA-esque sandbox game. It's still interesting to think that this entire game would now be considered a throw-away side activity in a larger game to be ignored & shows how far video games have evolved.\n\nIs it worth the full price? Not at all. Wait for it to be in a bundle or on sale if you really want to have a nostalgia moment & remember what people were playing in 1999-2000. If you have no reverance for either the title or for SEGA's late 90s period, then avoid & pick up a more modern title for probably the same amount of money.\n","July 5, 2015","false","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

So I don't have anything to say on the actual previous version before this latest update.\n\nI own this on XBLA, and have on Dreamcast as well. Obviously there were some major changes to the game for the modern HD re-release. The glaringly obvious ones would be the original Offspring soundtrack is now replaced with some generic music as well as the original voice actors have been replaced and the quality of the audio for them is low, and the KFC, Tower Records, Pizza Hut and Levis brands are no longer a part of the game.\n\nFortunately you can mod in the original soundtrack and voice actors with higher quality files from the original PC port.\n\nIf you would like to grab those before you buy this, then please do so here.\n\nOriginal Dreamcast Soundtrack\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=313173183\n\nOriginal Dreamcast Voices\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218024555\n\nIf you use these simply mods, it goes a long way to replicating the feel of the original Arcade/Dreamcast version of the game.\n\nIn closing, I give the game a 9 out of 10, simply because you have to mod the game to make it like it should actually be.

If you are here anyway, you have already played Crazy Taxi or at the very least know what it is. It's still Crazy Taxi, but the game doesn't support analog support, which means that the joystick goes from nothing to ALL THE WAYYYY.  This also makes CRITICAL moves like Crazy Dash ball-bustingly hard if not impossible. So, I guess it's not really Crazy Taxi anymore. Also they removed most/all of the licensed tracks, so no more YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH\n(that can be modded in tho)\n\nI'm putting this under recommend, as to say go buy Crazy Taxi, but on another system.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waifupatronsaint/recommended/71230/","waifupatronsaint","mwm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waifupatronsaint/","220 products in account","Edit: Sega has released some updates to this game since I wrote my review. Crazy Taxi now has working Steam achievements and can run at resolutions beyond 720p. These are improvements, but I still wouldn't recommend buying the game at full price. The updates are certainly welcome, but they don't change the limited gameplay gameplay and the lack of the original soundtrack.\n\nI have played a lot of Crazy Taxi, and although it's fun, this version is not worth buying. This release is exactly like the arcade version, the Dreamcast version, and the numerous ports that have been released over the past ten or fifteen years. In terms of gameplay, it brings nothing new to the table. The two main game modes are Arcade Mode and Original Mode. In these modes, you pick up passengers and bring them to their destinations as quickly as possible while performing stunts along the way. From what I can tell, the only difference between the two modes is where you spawn at the beginning of the game. The gameplay is enjoyable, but it gets repetitive. Once you're bored with those, all that's left is Crazy Box, a collection of challenges. Crazy Box doesn't really add any depth to the game; once you complete it, you won't play it again.\n\nYou might be tempted to buy this because of some sense of nostalgia. Unfortunately, you won't be able to drift into the parking lot of KFC while blasting All I Want. Due to licensing issues, this version of Crazy Taxi does not have the soundtrack and branding that the original did. I know that you can restore the original soundtrack by doing some modding, but I do not think that it's possible to do the same for the branding.\n\nLooking beyond the licensing issues, this is a very crappy port of the game. It cannot run at resolutions higher than 720p, and the textures still look blurry at that resolution. They definitely have not been retouched in any way, and I almost think they look worse than they do on the Dreamcast. The in-game voices are incredibly compressed and sound terrible, but they can be fixed by replacing the files with rips from the Dreamcast version. Additionally, I'm surprised that a score-oriented game does not have online leaderboards.\n\nFor some bizarre reason, Sega has recently started updating the game. They added placeholder Steam achievements a couple of weeks ago, but you cannot unlock them yet. While I'm impressed that they are updating a game that is several years old, I doubt that they will make any substantial improvements.\n\nCrazy Taxi is a solid, entertaining arcade game. However, I don't think you should spend $8 on this version when you can get a way better experience at an arcade for a few quarters.","August 25, 2014","false","48.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you get to drive in it, I'll give it a shot.\n\nBut you know what all of those games released after, oh, 1997 have in common? Analog steering.  It was kind of a big deal, way back when, to be able to tell your little car on screen to only turn *slightly* left or *slightly* right; it revolutionized track design, allowing for much more gradual turns in circuits, and for games to just be more nuanced and fun.\n\nAnd for some reason Sega decided in their Arcade -> Dreamcast -> Steam port chain to break that long-standing tradition, to remove all analog steering and replace it with good old-fashioned digital! Just like it used to be back on the Genesis!\n\nThing is, in the previous two versions of this game, analog steering WAS a thing, and the maps, challenges, difficulty... everything, really, was designed around the understanding that the player would have the ability to carefully steer their Crazy Taxi.\n\nWithout that ability the entire game is simply... broken.","December 8, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Crazy Taxi is a race against the clock driving game where you play as one of the only liveries in a town with no police. Why do I mention this? Because you'll be the one almost sideswiping traffic for tips, drifting for tips and of course catching bodacious air for you guessed it, tips. I think its nostalgia and style that will overpower players into enjoying this brief arcade game.\n\nIts all about that quick arcade fun rather than realism. Ramming other vehicles makes no difference, they'll fly backward or flip over in comical fashion. Land in water? That's fine just keep right on driving. Nothing can stop you except buildings. Pedestrians will leap out of the way, boxes and hot dog vendors will tumble in front of you.\n\nThere are several different areas rich neighborhoods, parking garage shortcuts, beaches, parks and even highways that are a mistake to turn on. The two cities feel alive with plenty of pedestrians. You'll see other vehicles, trolly cars and even passenger trains as you're driving, but none as cool as your selection of four vehicles to start with. The other motorists are abundant, and overtaking them without hitting them grants you a bigger tip when you drop off your fare. It takes far more skill to dodge than than it does to hit them.\n\nCrazy Taxi takes what used to be a typical arcade driving game where you drive on several courses from point A to point B and made the checkpoints dynamic rather than static finish lines.Instead of having a blonde in your passenger seat like Outrun, you have a variety of passengers. Funky ladies, men with pink Mohawks and even mundane passengers such as priests and people that blend in with a crowd. The cabs are all convertibles so you'll get to see how animated they get when they cheer on your insanity. Wrong lane? Yeah woo hoo! Flying over big semmi trucks? Do it!\n\nThe game is beautiful with bright colors and big sounds. They have an announcer to lure you in to play, well that is if you were in an arcade. He is available in the menus saying things like "car-ay-zy Taxi," "give it another go," and "maybe next time."\n\nRather than selecting a cab based on its stats, you see the driver. You have a green haired Axel, a big smiling B.D. Joe, a leopard print top Gena and a more typical cab driver in a Hawaiian shirt named Gus. Do they play any different? The game never lets you know, but in the challenge box, you can see their stats. No not the vehicle stats, the driver stats such as age, height, weight and blood type. Maybe its all a subtle way of saying the lightest driver is faster, the heaviest driver has the best turning and the alphabetically first blood type can drift the best..Its a game that oozes style, fun, flair and attitude over substance and depth.\n\nWhile Crazy Taxi is a game born in the arcade, its one of the games in Sega's Dreamcast collection on several other consoles. This version comes with the arcade city, the original city, which was unique to Dreamcast and the crazy box challenges.\n\nEven with a home version, it seems like a game better suited for the arcades. There's just not much here. The two cities might be large, but your play time isn't. You play in small chunks of time across a city, either arcade rules that grant you additional time or a flat three, five or ten minutes. Even the nine challenge boxes are over in a flash. I prefer a game to have more meat to it, but yes this is an arcade game, but its on a platform with deeper driving games and racers.\n\nIn the main game, your goal is simple, pick up passengers that have an icon over their head and follow the arrow to their destination. When you get close enough, you'll see a bright green drop point that illuminates a large section of sidewalk, allowing you to drift and skid to a stop.\n\nEach passenger has a different colored icon. Green means you'll need to go a long distance and get a lot of time to do it. Orange and yellow mean less distance and less time, while red means the shortest distance and time. There is an art to stopping close to them, because you'll have to wait for them to run to your cab before they hop in. The passengers also have rings around them, but you can still stop outside the ring to activate them.\n\nWhen a passenger gets in, he or she will tell you their destination, which shows up as a photo. In true late 90s fashion, you get a giant arrow at the top of your screen, but there is no easy to use GPS. Part of the challenge is finding your own path and memorizing the city layouts.\n\nWith a passenger in your car, you see how much their fare is. Well that's if you make it on time. If time expires, they'll jump out of your cab, but they'll do it with style. Even when they leave your cab and pay you, they do some sort of funky dismount followed with a hand slap to give you the cash. Of course they need to give you the cash to give you extra time in arcade rules. I've had a few times where they jump out of my cab, but before they give me the money and time, my time expires.\n\nAs for the controls, Crazy Taxi uses a keyboard and works quite well with a 360 controller. The driving takes some getting used to, but its more realistic than other games. You have an accelerator and a brake, but you also have drive and reverse. So to drive backward, you need throw it in reverse rather than hitting the brake until you stop and the backing up. The Crazy Taxi way seems needlessly complicated, why use four buttons when all you need are two? The reverse and drive system come into play with the game's main two tricks, drifting and dashing.\n\nIn the crazy box, the game gives you vague advice on how to perform both of them. Crazy drift's advice is to shift into reverse, then shift into drive, but how you really do it is hold drive and reverse while making a sharp turn. This will skid your car sideways. The crazy dash continues to elude me, because the game's advice is to let off the accelerator, shift into drive and then hit the accelerator again. I've played for two hours and if I've done the crazy dash, I haven't noticed.\n\nAs for the crazy box challenges themselves, its just quick fluff to let you know there are driving tricks. You'll be racing down a ramp, then crazy dashing off of it. You'll do other things like ram twenty balloons to pop them. Use ramps to jump across gaps to deliver your passenger before time runs out.\n\nThe game lets you keep profile information for up to four people, that way you already have your initials registered. There are no online leader boards, just your own personal bests.\n\nSince it has support for 360 controllers it could have made use of camera controls. There are plenty of times when I've rammed a vehicle, when going up or downhill because my own cab obscured my vision. This is one of the few driving games with no ability to change camera angles.\n\nAt the end of each session, you're graded and ranked. Another pet peeve of mine is after every game, it kicks you back to the main menu rather than asking if you'd like to play again. Perhaps the developers felt you'd want to quit the game after a quick joy ride. The menu also forces you to hit D rather than enter to confirm a menu item. Well that is if you're using a keyboard. While that might be a nitpick, its difficult to find faults in such a bare bones game.\n\nWith the review over, Crazy Taxi is just a quick game. On paper, it all seems fantastic. There's nothing wrong with the game, I need something more than trying to get a high score. The taxi mini game in Grand Theft Auto games are much deeper than this and I'd rather go play that instead. If you're in an arcade, this is still a gem among shallow, fun driving games.","September 9, 2015","false","2.4"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","23","47","4","0"

They aren't "OMFG IT LOOKS LIKE IMAX 3D HOLY CRAP" or "HD" as you'd say but the graphics look really good for the time.\n8/10\n\nControls:\nThe controls are a bit weird and there's a ton of tricks you can pull off (I haven't exactly "Mastered" them but they're there). You press A and B to switch between forward and reverse. LT is breaks and RT is Accel. Left and Right to Drive. X?(forgot) brings up destination and how far you are from it and Y? honkls your horn. Not the best but playable.\n6/10\n\nFinal Score:\n7.25/10 - A good game but don't expect to be playing it a lot. (Which is good as the game goes very fast.)\nDo I think it's worth the $10? NO. I think it's worth $5 at the max. I got the 4 games along with Nights into Dreams for $1.","November 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Tomo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TomoSenpie/","76 products in account","Crazy Taxi is one hell of a nostalgic game for me. I recall playing it years ago on the Dreamcast and playing it recently here on Steam and at a local Dave & Busters. This game is apart of the Dreamcast COllection which was realesed on many consoles and includes Sonic Adventure DX, Space Channel 5, SEGA Bass Fising, and Crazy Taxi.\n\nThis game involves you going to different people in a unnamed town, picking them up, and driving them to their destination in a short amount of time. Trust me, this game gets insanely fun. Rampaging through the city, driving your customers to their location in alomst thirty seconds his always a joy.\n\nThis game also has a mode called Crazy Box, which is a set of challeneges you must complete. These challenges really test your ability and even teaches you some tricks that will help you reach that S Rank in Arcade or Original Mode.\n\nOverall, this game's content isn't much. Only really having the normal modes and Crazy Box, but once you complete everything, you will find yourself always returning to the Arcade/Orginal modes, trying to improve your score each time. Also, the IRL Companies aren't in this verison (KFC, Levi, Pizza Hut, etc.).\n\nFinal Score: 9/10\n\n- ♦TomoSenpie♦","December 8, 2014","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First of all, these taxis are advertised as ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. This could not be more misleading. Not only is the taxi acting like every other taxi I have driven (both in other video games and real life),  but the taxis are not kooky or nuts either! And you'd THINK the drivers would be a bit insane themselves, but NO. They are just as sane as the rest of us taxi drivers. And the money. Calling the money deranged is a real laugh. There is absolutely zero difference between the pennies you make in real life and the work you do within this GAME, and is nothing more than shekels. SHEKELS! I was told the taxis would be manual transmission style too, but they are in fact AUTOMATIC transmission style. If I could, I would ask for a refund promptly as that just ruins the whole experience for me. And if that wasn't enough, I had to pay for my own gas.\nAs a taxi driver wanting a break off from REAL taxi driving, I am sorely dissapointed with the amount of lunacy in these so called 'Craxy Taxis'. I don't know how I'm going to break the news to my goldentipped taupe parrot shiner or my blue ringed shunt fire guppy, they were looking forward to hours of me driving around in demented taxis, but I guess that's not gonna happen now.

On one hand, all the gameplay of the original home version of the game is intact. You can play the original arcade locale or the one made just for the home version. You can play as all four of the original drivers and play by arcade rules (where you earn bonus time with each faire) or a set amount of time. And the gameplay itself is just as fun as it always was. Playing a taxi driver dodging through traffic at top speed and performing tricks to get the most out of your tip is always fun.\n\nAnd then there's the bad. The arcade version of Crazy Taxi along with the ports for Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and GameCube featured a soundtrack of songs by The Offspring and Bad Religion along with product placement in the form of locations like Pizza Hut, Levi's store and Tower Records which served as fare destinations. To this day, I still associate the song "All I Want" with this game. This version for the PC omits both the original soundtrack and the product placement which I feel detracts from the overall experience. And the music they got to replace The Offspring and Bad Religion's music ... quite frankly isn't that good.\n\nGranted, this is a PC game and as such the game music can be modded/restored through the use of adding/removing adx files, but it's not how this game comes. Would I recommend this game? Yes, it's still a solid game. And if you don't mind messing with adx files, it can be quite enjoyable. Would I recommend this version over the GCN version? No!

The physics haven't aged well either; one minute you'll be driving sensibly, and the next you'll be pinged off into nowhere.\n\nBecause licencing deals and product placement from the original has long since expired, all the copyrighted assets have been replaced by terrible looking bland, uninspiring signs. I think this is the first time in a game where the lack of product placement has actually made it worse.\n\nOh, but they added AA and shaders! Doesn't improve the game's overall shoddiness. The game is even less consistent. Surely someone playtesting this thought "this game doesn't work probably", but obviously forgot to mention it.\n\nHaving said that though, if all these issues were resolved (maybe not the bland signs, as that doesn't really break the camel's back like everything else), it would probably be alright.

After hearing so much about it, for so long, I expected... more\n\nPretty much everything you do in the game is pick up passengers in your taxi and drive them to their destination, with your goal being to get as much cash from them until the time runs out, which it does very quickly. You increase the cash gained by doing some "crazy" stunts. And that's all there is to it. There is only one map and I got bored of it very quickly.\n\nCrazy Taxi on PC also has some horrible flaws.\nThis game is basically unplayable with a keyboard, the car turns very quickly and there is very little precision control with a digital input method. So a controller is a must for this game if you even want to think about enjoying it.\nThe soundtrack for the game is all generic late 90s rock and as far as I can understand from other people, there were originally some great songs present in the game, however they took out all those songs for this port. So you are stuck listening to music that was already bad in the nineties.\nThe physics engine is basically nonexistent. Whenever you crash into another car or a wall you simply change your direction at full speed. If you encounter a low obstacle the game will pretend it isn't even there and will simply shift you a bit into the air when you go over it. You also go uphill pretty much as fast as you go downhill.\n\nI do believe that this game was great when it came out on the Dreamcast, however this port to the PC is not worth playing.\n\n2½ / 10","November 29, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a pick up and play sort of arcade game good for when you have a spare five minutes to play. It's adicitive and crazyly fun with hard to execute speed increasing stunts for more advance players. Players get paid to take people from A to B getting money bonuses for narowly dodging cars, drifting and going over jumps as well as time bonusses for geting their as quick as possible. The player can choose to play on the Arcade or Original Map or help improve their skills on Crazy Box - the in game challenge mode.

You find a customer, they give you a destination and a strict time limit, and it's your job to get them there no matter what. Try to make as much money as you can before your shift is up. Use the insane physics and game mechanics to you advantage; It's made to not be realistic but for enjoyment and efficency (most of the time).\n\nI'm kinda disappointed that the blantent branding and stuff like that have been removed. Wether this is a good thing or a bad thing is debatable and depends on how much of a hipster you are. They did also replace the soundtrack (I'm guessing all of these changes were due to legal issues) but at least the new songs are still fitting. I wish there was more added to this version like more graphical options and even online leaderboards. A missed opertunity.\n\nIt may not show it, but it does have controller support. It feels like a cardinal sin to use anything else (except for and actual steeringwheel controller). The biggest problem with the controller is the analog support is crad. The slightest touch will jerk your car. Since I have never played in any other format besides in arcades, I was able to overlook this and adapt easily. Sadly, I can't speak the same for every one.\n\nWill probably still pump out a quarter for it if I see one in a arcade despite owning\nYes, arcades still exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis series NEEDS a revival.","April 10, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I say mostly because one of the aspects that people love the most, the soundtrack, is not the same. In this version of the game, you will no longer hear the songs that were in the original game by the Offspring or Bad Religion, which is a shame as listening to those songs make it feel a lot more like playing Crazy Taxi. However knowing how these things go, the people who re-released this game probably wanted to keep the original music, but due to liscencing agreements, they were unable to secure the rights to those songs, as well as KFC's branding (the KFC in the arcade mode is now Fried Chicken Barn or something like that). While the missing original songs are a fault, the gameplay elements are still the same as the original game, so I feel comfortable recommending this game to people who the lack of the music is not that big of a deal, or having the original songs play in the background while you play. However if having the original music with the game is a big deal to you, then I suggest that you go and find a copy for your early 2000s console of choice (I personally like the PS2 version for those who can't get a Dreamcast version and a Dreamcast).","November 25, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It ran well on GeForce 6600 and a Pentium 4, it contained fitting music, there was nothing terribly wrong with it. I also play the Dreamcast original version, and i really think ancient that port was a success, well done. Both ran at about 50/60fps full speed pretty much throughout. The negatives of the Strangelight PC port were lack of widescreen support and lack of analog trigger support, and some gamepads will have deadzone issues in menus. but it was consistent with hardware available at the time, and it still runs great.\n\nThis port however is terrible. The framerate is all over the place. regardless of resolution. Car shadows are missing randomly (lack of depth bias?), and the colour is less vibrant, i think specular highlight is too narrow, among other things. And the worst of all: CONTROL IS TERRIBLE. Even after recent patch introducing gamepad support, the analog stick is only mapped to keyboard control, making lane changing on purpose or waving between traffic nearly impossible. The keyboard support could have been done better too.\n\nThe music has also been replaced, and badly. I understand that original music might have been no longer possible, but replacement music doesn't match the tempo or the mood of original. Crazy Taxi needs really fast paced music to feel right. Strangelight port also replaced music, but it fits better, more similar to original.\n\nNative widescren support in this port is OK, menu/overlay is stretched but 3D rendering is properly widescreen adjusted. I would have appreciated more effort with some overlays, but it's fine by me. But that's really the only good thing i could potentially say about this port.","August 7, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, in this PC port most of what makes crazy taxi still a unique and fun experience is quickly lost, and sometimes broken. I own a dreamcast. I've played crazy taxi for countless hours. I know this game inside and out.\n\nThe lack of the original soundtrack is the least of this port's offenses. In no particular order, here are my biggest issues with this port:\n\n- Bad controls. The lack of analog steering is a disaster. The support for an Xbox 360/One controller is great, but the lack of analog steering means that your little touches to weave in and out of traffic are now hairpin lefts and rights. This makes the game, and its basic mechanics on the road unplayable. In essense, these mechanics is what makes Crazy Taxi what it is. And it's gone here.\n\n- Poor graphical optimization. Upon startup you'll have the option to tweak graphical settings from resolution, to v-sync, but that's about it. The framerate sits somewhere around 20-30, and I'm currently on a GTX 770 MSI TF-N770. Inexcusable.\n\n-Audio Issues abound. Many crash effects sound as if they're peaking in my headphones. Just very poor quality.\n\nIf you're a hardcore dreamcast fan, find a dreamcast system and get a disc copy of Crazy Taxi.

Easy to learn hard to master - classic golden era Sega goodness. Still as fun as it was back on the dreamcast and PS2. The port is solid, as there is not that much you could possibly upscale with the very cartoony look of Crazy Taxi and the controls work just fine once you get used to it. Nothing you play for hours on end but a surprisingly influential title you will come back to again and again.\n\nThe major negative is the exclusion of the original soundtrack which has rightfully gained somewhat of a cult following of its own. It's not that the new songs are awful, they do their job somewhat alright-ish, but they are so staggeringly bland and generic it's almost fascinating. A baffling achievement that had me scratching my head with all four limbs. The older PC port had the advantage of custom soundtracks which alleviates this problem, the steam version however uses a strange audio format that even as a sound designer I have never encountered before. Truely a shame.\n\nAnother distraction from this fun little title is the price at this point. Even as part of the dreamcast collection it is totally overpriced.
