"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightcall/recommended/339340/","Nightcall","Nightcall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nightcall/","234 products in account","Remember the nights you played Resident Evil Zero on Gamecube? No? I do.\n\nThis game is right for you ...\n\n... when you walk through a dark corridor and you do not know what to expect around the next corner ...\n... when you see a shadow and you do not know if its just furniture or the monster you don't want to meet ...\n... when you suddenly hear a creepy moan behind the next wall and you're to scared to move forward ...\n\nFirst of all here are some simple steps to make sure you get the whole creepy experience out of this game:\n\n- Use a controller (although you can use the keyboard, which is not really recommendable - atleast for me. I don't like it, you could)\n\n- Play at night (or darken your room), you will feel very uncomfortable, trust me\n\n- Don't rush the game like hell. Take your time, explore everything and feel yourself into the world.\n\n- forget everything about Resident Evil 5, 6, RC:O and similiar games. This is clearly not the same. This is real horror.\n\nSo what is Resident Evil 0?\n\nResident Evil Zero is the prequel to all the beginning of Resident Evil 1 and the following games.\nIts the 07.23.1998, the day before the deadly virus was released in Raccoon City.\nThis game is full of interesting puzzles, a good story and an oppressive atmosphere.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+++ Scary game that will make you feel very lonely and lost\n+++ A good background story about what happened before Resident Evil 1\n+++ hours of fun playing this game\n++ you can play 2 characters\n++ a lot of puzzles\n+ you can choose the difficulty\n+ the new HD graphics\n+ controls\n+ cheap price, for 20 ‚Ç¨ really worth it\n\nneutral (i like these stuff, but there are many people who actually hate this old fashioned gameplay):\n\n+- this game can be really challenging and frustrating, especially when you're new to this kind of a game\n+- characters move very slowly, that is not up to date for a modern game\n+- camera angles\n\nCons:\n\n- unfortunately no new improvement\n- you have to pay for costumes\n- some bugs like sometimes audio crashing in cut scenes\n- if you don't have a good pc this game may run in a slow motion which just feels not smooth\n- it may cause a heart attack\n\nWhat is special about this game?\n\nThis Oldschool-Horror Survival Game comes first time with 2 Characters that you can control. (Yes, Resident 5 and so on had also multiple characters). The special thing about these two characters is both of them have their special skills. Rebecca can't take a lot of damage, but she can mix herbs, which can be very useful. Billy got a lighter, which can be helpful for some things. In addition he can take a lot more damage before he will die. In the most time you are playing together, while you can decide with whom you move. You can also decide if your partner will support you in the fight or if he will even follow you or rather stay on his position. This gameplay with both characters CAN make you feel a bit more safe, but don't lean back that much because there will be several situations where you both are lost and on your own, trying to find each other of you. In this case you will feel very lost and desperate. This makes this game so special. You have to keep an eye on both characters, make them survive this game. If one of your characters dies, the game is over.\n\nHow good is the new HD graphic?\n\nWhile the original Resident Evil Zero on Gamecube was very old fashioned and mushy, this new remastered version comes with some new effects. The game overall looks way better than the old version but you can still see some ugly details which doesn't look that great. Just dont expect too much. It looks just fine, but there is nothing sensational about it. It can be kinda compared with Resident Evil 1 Remastered.\n\nMy final words:\n\nThis lets me conclude that this game is really good and it is a REAL Resident Evil. Its not a shooter like the newer games. This game is hard, can be frustrating and brings a lot of fun. You will feel like you felt in Resident Evil 1-3, i will guarantee you. If you never played Resident Evil, but you're a fan of horror-games, then i can also recommend this game for you. For people who want a modern game with a GREAT graphics and a lot of shooting, i really can't recommend this to you, because you might be disapppointed.","January 19","true","6.8"," 286 of 334 people (86%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","86","286","334","31","31"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198169311898/recommended/339340/","76561198169311898","The Fragnostic","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198169311898/","1217 products in account","Resident Evil 0 was the ninth game in the titanically influential series and arguably the last to showcase a style that modern gaming was fast leaving behind. The pre-drawn environments, the fixed camera angles, the creaky door cinematics that covered the loading times between areas, having to stand in exactly the right bloody spot to pick up an item... they would all disappear quickly after Zero, leaving the radically different masterpiece that was Resident Evil 4 to pick up the pieces.\n\nEven so, Capcom had already begun to change their gameplan here, introducing a buddy system in which the player freely shared control of the game's two main characters: S.T.A.R.S medic Rebecca Chambers (who you might remember from RE1 as the mostly useless pianist who rescued Chris Redfield's cack-fingered attempts to play Moonlight Sonata) and convicted ex-soldier Billy Coen. Although control of multiple characters was nothing new in the franchise, here it was the centerpiece of the game as most of the puzzles and combat scenarios are engineered to require each character's strengths and to prey on their weaknesses.\n\nI played Resident Evil 0 to death when it originally made its appearance on the Gamecube back in 2002 and, although it did truly rock some ingenuous design, the controls were an absolute horror show especially in any combat scenario. If you've spent any time with the original version, you'll immediately notice how far improved they are in this remaster along with some truly stunning visuals. I'm a sucker for the pre-drawn background art style and it has never looked better than it does here. Also added for a bonus playthrough is Wesker Mode which really does what it says on the tin: blaze through the game as Johnny Bravo's evil twin, sneering and shadow-punching zombies into twitching mulch.\n\nRemaining unchanged, however, is the game's notorious inventory system which truly is the most unforgiving in the entire series. You will often find yourself having to leave useful items behind for sheer lack of carrying space which can mostly be blamed on the Hookshot; a vital piece of equipment that has to be dragged through much of the game while occupying a gluttonous two squares of inventory room. The sheer amount of micromanagement between characters, especially with only Rebecca being able to create healing items, was a pain in ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• then and it's a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• now.\n\nWith that said, whatever faults Resident Evil 0 might suffer are relatively minor. It's one of the weaker titles in the franchise but it's certainly far better than the catastrophe that was RE6 and when you consider that it's only really weak in comparison to the mighty original trilogy, the excellent Code Veronica and REMake and the near-flawless Resident Evil 4, well... that's barely a criticism at all really.\n\nI'll take you up to the first boss below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WE3IhFZ-bAQ","January 20","true","4.8"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","67","77","10","0"

Capcom is on the right track.\n\nUpdate: For those concerning with more detail in this review, simply put the fact that it places Resident Evil right back in its roots; actual survival horror and not a third-person shooter in which enemies drop ammo. Nope, there is none of that here. It plays just like Resident Evil 1 Remake HD Remaster. You either conserve ammo and play it smart, or you can go guns blazing and suffer your imminent death whilst fighting with a knife as a last resort. The new mechanic of two character switching is easy to master and you can opt for either going into areas solo or together, though there are certain events in which you are required to go alone.\n\nGraphics wise this game looks absolutely stunning especially for an HD remaster and, unlike the previous one, the background textures for this game is in very clear detail and doesn't look washed out which is a huge improvement. I have no problems playing it on max settings at 60 fps save for a few drops during the door transitions for some reason (?). However, I am having problems with getting it to play on full screen for now as it seems to crash almost constantly. Not sure if I'm the only one but for now I'm playing it windowed and hopefully Capcom fixes this with a patch soon, unless I'm the one being daft. I won't say much about the story other than the fact that it is classic Resident Evil cheesiness all over again, but hey that's what Resident Evil does best.\n\nOverall it's a damn good Resident Evil game and if the Resident Evil 2 Remake heads in this direction with its own new gameplay mechanics and seamless integration for both scenarios A and B, Capcom will surely rise once again.

I played this extensively on GameCube, finished it on all difficulties, and even went through again using just the rocket launcher. As the gameplay itself hasn‚Äôt really changed, this should not be an issue in terms of time spent in-game.\n\nResident Evil 0 is both good and bad in so many ways, and some of them aren‚Äôt even related to this HD remaster. I‚Äôm a Resident Evil junkie, and I have been since I got hooked on the PSX original back in 1996, after reading a review of it in Game Informer, one of those things called magazines that you had to buy at stores or wait for it to arrive by mail.\n\nResident Evil 0 was the last ‚Äúreal‚Äù Resident Evil, a slow and methodical game, before Capcom decided the non-stop action and set pieces were the way to go. Not a knock against Resident Evil 4, though. RE4 was a terrific game, it just wasn‚Äôt a terrific Resident Evil game.\n\nThat said, Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster is a fantastic remaster. It shines on PC. The enhanced graphics bring the backgrounds to life, you can read signs and notices that were blurry on the GameCube version, the story (while not the best in the series) does an excellent job of providing more background on Umbrella, and while it introduced a couple of new things to the series (character switching, ability to drop items), it also removed some (such as item boxes).\n\nProsGraphics are very well done, and Capcom has done an excellent job of bringing the backgrounds to life; both Rebecca and Billy look better than ever\nLots of story to uncover, which gives further insight into the minds of Umbrella‚Äôs execs\nPuzzles are fun (but haven‚Äôt changed), and switching between both characters to solve them feels natural as opposed to a ‚Äújust because‚Äù mechanic\nMusic is fantastic and sets the mood perfectly\nSound effects are excellent\nEnemies are greatly detailed\nDecent length\nThe story, while not the greatest, is still entertaining\nTank controls have been retained (I‚Äôm a fan)\nVoice acting is as bad as before, but seeing as how it‚Äôs a Resident Evil game, that‚Äôs fineConsNothing has changed gameplay wise; if you beat this on GameCube way back, you‚Äôll know exactly what to do\nCutscenes appear to be original, and therefore look very low-def compared to the in-game scenes\nNot much replaybility, unless you‚Äôre looking to catch up on achievements you‚Äôve missed\nMicro management is more prevalent, as item boxes are no longer a thingSummaryIt‚Äôs Resident Evil, you either love it or hate it. It‚Äôs great because it‚Äôs the slow paced explorative gameplay that Resident Evil was, but it‚Äôs sad because it truly is the last of its kind (Resident Evil 4, 5, 6, forthcoming Umbrella Chronicles, etc).\n\nRegardless of your view on the game, it‚Äôs well worth the time. It is a great revisit for old fogies like me, and it‚Äôs a great survival horror game for newcomers. As long as you don‚Äôt compare this to the current crop of horror games, you‚Äôll enjoy yourself.","January 22","true","9.8"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","37","43","3","2"

Spoiler-free.\nThe entire game is one huge eyecandy, every background has been re-rendered, they're at way more higher resolution and do not have obvious compression artifacts. Moving parts of the backgrounds, lighting, shadows, item icons, some 3D objects and bloom were drastically improved along with some character model and font tweaks. The only semi-original things that are left in are the FMV cutscenes which were also cropped accordingly. Just like in RE1HD you can rebind KB&M controls to your liking (with the exception of mouse, it seems, as it's used for aiming and shooting by default).\n\nThe game itself is mostly left unchanged, but it has a couple of extra bonuses added like the Wesker mode where you use RE5 Wesker's special abilities to battle BOWs. This mode is unlocked when you finish the game at least once. There are also extra purchasable DLC costumes if you're into that sorta thing. Worth mentioning that this game supports achievements some of which are rather creative.\n\nAs for port itself it's the superior version among the platforms offering you variable framerate refresh rate, 4K resolution, but for whatever reason lacks DoF (blur in distance) which is currently present on PS4. For some with weak/machines with compatibility issues the game might run in slow motion (if you had this issue with RE4UHD, RE1HD then you'll likely have it here). Also currently there's bug with doors stuttering a bit when opened, likely a cache issue (not present on newer graphics cards).\n\nIf you care about Survival Horror in this industry and/or oldschool RE then you should pick this up.\n\nLet me know in the comments if I missed something or something needs a correction.","January 20","true","11.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","1"

To expand on that you'll find a pretty atmospheric and challenging survival horror experience with familiar puzzles, quite a few items to carry back and forth to solve them, very limited inventory space and a good amount of bioweapons that'll try to kill you.\n\nThe whole item management aspect is part of the old-school charm but can also feel unnecessary fiddly at times, especially when you find out there's a limit to how many items you can leave in each room or have to make a few trips to ensure you have all the items you need in the next area. Story and characters are also pretty shallow and don't really add too many interesting elements to the overarching narrative.\n\nAll things considered RE0 is still a worthwhile purchase if you're looking for more old-style survival horror and even more so if you missed it when it came out on Gamecube: it's not the strongest entry of the series but it's decent enough to warrant a playthrough.","February 25","true","6.2"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

I am now hooked and was already a fan of the films.\n\nI believe this game is more in the style of the first biohazard remake, although you control two characters at once (Rebecca and Billy), which are needed for some puzzles and combat support.\n\nThe story line is typical of the franchise. With Wesker being a pain in the butt as usual. Although the big bad is a bit different. You need to be conservative with ammo and healing on normal in order to survive adding a challenge and cranking up the playtime.\n\nAlso upon completion you get a new game mode collecting leeches, a bit like the revelations extra modes. There is also a Wesker mode, where you play though the game again, but Billy looks and sounds like Wesker. A bit odd but enough to make you playthrough again, especially as there are added achievements. I will probably leave the game mostly after my first completion though, as I have plenty of other games to finish or even start.\n\nI think this is a great addition to the franchise and adds enough to the story and variety of gameplay to make it a worthy addition for all the RE veterans collections.","February 2","true","13.1"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","34","46","5","0"

They completely remastered every background this time because they had access to the original game files so that's a plus. Everything from the original is carried over along with a few extras made exclusively for the remaster itself.\n\nNew stuff included in the Remaster include:\n- Wesker Mode (Beat the game once on any difficulty to unlock)\n- Full HD Backgrounds\n- Gallery Mode (Includes all the game FMV's, Unlocked from the start and progresses as you do)\n- 60 fps (PC Exclusive) consoles are locked to 30, variable frame rate is included.\n- New control scheme similar to the action games, various layouts to choose from\n- Exclusives costumes, were shown as in game but are actually paid DLC which is typical Capcom\n- 5 fan made t-shirts for free if you voted during the campaign\n\nAlready played through the entire campaign and Leech Mode and I had no issues with the gameplay itself. Mechanic/story wise nothing was changed from the original 2002 release which isn't a bad thing. Capcom attempted to bring co-op to the game but it didn't work, pretty obvious why it wouldn't work.\n\nItem Management is very different from other RE games, this one elimates the need for Item Boxes completely from the start. Newcomers will probably hate the constant backtracking to find items they dropped but old school players will feel right at home. If you are having issues locating items go into your Map and turn on the UI, for some reason reviewers didn't mention this and people are having issues finding it.\n\nGraphic options are pretty much the game as Remake Remastered from last year, according to most people the backgrounds are locked to 1440 resolution again. Running the game on max settings I was able to play through the entire game without slowdown except the area where you meet your first leech, I think there's a bug here with the flame effects. Other than that I had a constant 60fps experience, also tried variable which for some reason locked the game to 45 fps, tried 30fps for the hell of it and it was too slow for me lol.\n\nOverall, if you're a hardcore RE fan from the early days you should pick it up. If you're newcomer and have patience I'd reccommend trying the game out, just don't expect an action experience this one is a bit slower than the original game but it offers solid gameplay if you give it a chance. Only thing I feel needs work is the control scheme, I dunno who's idea it was to map the run button to X but that needs to be changed. They should have just given the option of using the original gamecube layout.\n\n-Settings Used In Game-\nResolution - 1920x1080\nWindow Settings - Full Screen\nVsync - On\nRefresh Rate - 60.00Hz\nFrame Rate - 60fps\nAnti-Aliasing - FX-AA3HQ\nShadow Quality - High\nTexture Quality - High\n\nComputer Specs:\n\nIntel Core i5 2320 CPU @ 3.00 GHz\nRam: 8 Gigs\nGraphics Card: XFX Amd Radeon 7750 1 Gig","January 20","true","17.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","0"

I never played either of those versions, which means I can't really comment on how faithful this HD remake is, so I will simply judge this version on its own merits. On the whole I enjoyed playing the game, although it does have some problems.\n\nAs the name suggests, Zero is a prequel to RE1. There are two playable characters, STARS member Rebecca, and convicted criminal Billy. The player can switch between them at will, with the AI controlling the other character, or you can explore with one character on their own. Billy has more health, is strong enough to move heavy objects, and has a cigarette lighter, whilst Rebecca can mix herbs and other chemicals.\n\nGameplay contains both the good and the bad of old school survival horror. Combat is a slower pace, there are a small number of monsters, but each one is dangerous. Resource management is key, because ammo and healing items are scarce, so you can't afford to waste any. Puzzles are intelligently designed to require both characters working together.\n\nUnfortunately the fixed camera angles are far more annoying than I remember in RE1. There is a ridiculous number of combat encounters where the monster is off screen, my character is looking at the monster, but I can't see what they see, because I'm forced to look at my character, which makes aiming more difficult than it should be. Thankfully the partner AI is pretty useful, although I'm not sure if "standing still while the AI shoots the monsters" qualifies as playing the game. I'm so glad later games in the franchise dropped the fixed camera angles.\n\nMost of the boss fights are frustrating, because they always disable one character during a cutscene, meaning you can't access their inventory. I always died on the first attempt just because I ran out of ammo, having split my ammo between the two characters. On my second attempt, armed with advanced knowledge of what is about to happen, I gave all my weapons/ammo to the character who wouldn't be disabled and got an easy kill. I don't mind dying in games if I make a mistake, but this felt "cheap".\n\nThis game has the same mouse pointer bug that the RE1 HD remake had. If you play with mouse and keyboard, the mouse pointer will constantly be visible on screen. The only solution is to play with a gamepad and push the mouse pointer off screen. Fortunately the controls work well with a gamepad, but I don't understand why Capcom are having so much difficulty figuring out how a mouse works.\n\nUltimately I think you need to be an existing fan of the Resident Evil franchise, and be willing to overlook some problems, to enjoy RE Zero. If you've never played Resident Evil before, I would recommend starting with better games such as RE1, or RE Revelations 1 &2, and then grab Zero if you find yourself wanting more.","February 9","true","14.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","3"

While I think it did most things really well, there were some others that I didn't like as much, but I'll get to that later.\n\nLet's start off with the technical stuff. Oh man, this game is a wonderful remaster. The graphics are unbelieveable good, considering that this is originally a game from 2002. The backgrounds, although pre-rendered, have never been so dynamic, it's often hard to distinguish between pre-rendered and actual rendered models because they are both so detailed, pre-rendered backgrounds have never looked so good.\nForce Feedback/Controller vibration is also a thing, even during the cutscenes, and it underlines some intense moments very well.\nThe controls also received an overhaul. In my review of the HD REmaster I complained about the new control scheme, feeling out of place by making character movement look unnatural and that you need to adjust your stick when the camera changes. While the latter problem presists, the movement feels much more natural now. Definitely an improvement.\nYou can now also set the refresh rate to up to 144 Hz, while the HD REmaster only allowed 60 Hz.\n\nSPOILERS FROM HERE ON IN:\n\nNext up is the game itself. The gameplay is solid, it might feel strange controlling 2 characters at first, but you'll get used to it. You can switch between the characters almost anytime, and they both have different strenghts and weaknesses.\nA weaker point of the game is, in my opinion, the plot. While I love the RE storyline, this one had a few elements that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I know Resident Evil isn't know for it's perfect writing, but this one seemed a bit weaker compared to the other games. First off, Marcus in his young/leech/whatever form. The way he looks is just ridiculous, and that chorus like singing...just no. Another point I didn't like so much was Billy's backstory. The guerilla village thing just seemed too forced and didn't fit into the story at all. The message "war is bad" dosen't fit into Resident Evil, we have other game series like Metal Gear for that.\nWhere this game really shines is level design. It's so good I could talk about it the whole day, but I'll try to keep it short.\nFirst off is are the settings. The train is awesome, the atmosphere of it driving during rain, all the moving objects on the tables...just perfect. The training facility is probably the longest part of the game. One might say it's basically a cheap version of the mansion from RE1, but I would have to disagree. My favoriten part however is the factory. In this part you are seperated from Billy, so you are alone and can only play as Rebecca. Here you will revisit some places from Resident Evil 2, and I would have to lie to say that it didn't make me feel a bit nostalgic.\nThen there are also the treatment facility and laboratory, which also have great level design. The way you have to interact with your partner over different rooms is just amazingly thought through, no argument there.\n\ntl;dr\n+amazing level design and atmosphere\n+slow paced gameplay, with an overall good character switch system\n+excellent soundtrack\n\n-plot has it's weakpoints\n\nOverall: 8.0/10\n\nWhile this REmaster is better from a technical standpoint, I just prefer the core game of the remake/first REmaster.","January 20","true","26.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AvatarTT/recommended/339340/","AvatarTT","AvatarTT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AvatarTT/","357 products in account","As you may already know, Resident Evil Zero (RE0) is a prequel to the very first Resident Evil (RE) game. If you remember the opening scene of the first RE, a Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) team consisting of Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker, Chris Redfield and Barry Burton (Alpha Team) are sent to find out what happened to Bravo Team, with whom they‚Äôve lost contact. The mission of both teams was to investigate mysterious murders that have been happening on the outskirts of Raccoon City. They discover Bravo Team‚Äôs downed helicopter in the Racoon Forest, but no sign of survivors. Their search eventually leads them to the legendary mansion from the first game. In RE0, we get to find out what happened to Bravo Team as well as story elements that ties this game to future games. RE0 begins with an Umbrella owned train traveling en-route through the Raccoon Forest. It comes under attack by scary‚Ä¶‚Äùleeches‚Äù. These leeches seem to be under the control of an androgynous Final Fantasy-esque character who, for some reason, is accompanied by majestic opera music whenever he is on screen. We then cut to the Bravo Team helicopter which is en-route to the outskirts. For reasons unknown, their helicopter is damaged and they are forced to make an emergency landing in the forest. What happens next is for you to find out. I will say this - don‚Äôt set your expectations too high story wise. This is honestly B-grade SyFy channel plot material here. However it‚Äôs all about the good ol‚Äô survival horror at the end of the day.\n\nRE0 is a very polished remaster. The game runs buttery smooth in 1080p at 60fps (in 16:9 widescreen). Not only that but the game now has added support for 5.1 surround sound, which really amplifies the creepy ambiance. Also added are several new control schemes, so pick one that best suits you. Keep in mind though - this is the same GameCube game from back in the day, just with updated graphics (and sound). If you were hoping that Capcom went the extra mile to remove those tedious loading animations, you are going to be disappointed. Every single time that you open a door (or climb stairs and ladders) you will be treated to a "movie" that shows the door opening (or the stairs being climbed etc). Mentally prepare yourself for this.\n\nYou control two main characters in the game - S.T.A.R.S. Rookie Rebecca Chambers and alleged criminal Billy Coen. These characters each have their unique traits. For example, Rebecca has the alchemist ability to mix herbs and Billy has the factory-man ability to move heavy boxes. Naturally, the game will present situations in which you need to determine the best character to use at a given time. The character that you choose to take control of is the ‚ÄúMain‚Äù character and the other becomes the ‚ÄúPartner‚Äù character (and CPU controlled). You can switch who you want as your Main and Partner at any time. You can give orders to your Partner character - such as to follow you, stay put and attack/don‚Äôt attack. Learn this mechanic. Also, I should warn you about Rebecca. Be very careful with her as she‚Äôs quite a fragile woman. If she even smells the bad breath of a zombie, her health is going to go down. Billy, on the other hand, being a former marine and all, is a tough guy and can take quite a beating before his health drops.\n\nHaving two characters to control means that you have two inventories to manage. Sadly, both characters‚Äô inventories are very small and non-upgradeable. Therefore, a huge aspect of the game is item management. You will have to get used to abandoning items in order to make room for higher priority items, then backtracking for the items you left behind at a later time. Here‚Äôs a tip. In the mansion area, there‚Äôs a save point at the bottom of the stairs when you first get there (the main hall). You will be spending a considerable amount of time running in and out of this area. So you can use this area as a ‚Äúhub‚Äù. A convenient place to leave items you don‚Äôt need at the moment. Speaking of save points, here‚Äôs an aspect of the game that will surely add to the tension - limited saves! You save by collecting ink ribbons and using them at Typewriters. If you save too much, you might run out of ribbons! So, save wisely.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs talk about actually playing the game. All of the game‚Äôs locations are pre-rendered, with pre-assigned camera angles. Nothing new if you're an old school veteran but if experiencing this for the first time, get ready for some awkward situations in which you are shooting at things and you can‚Äôt even see the things you‚Äôre shooting at because they are off-screen. Also, if you‚Äôre accustomed to modern RE games, you might have the mindset that headshots are the way to go. This is not the case here. All you need to do is pump bullets into the enemy until they curl up dead on the floor. An exception to this is the shotgun. It is very simple and quite satisfying to obliterate zombie heads with the shotgun. Simply aim up, wait for your victim to walk within range and pull the trigger.\n\nNow it would not be a RE game without special enemies and bosses. The theme of RE0 seems to be - wildlife. You‚Äôve got Frogs, Scorpions, Rabid Dogs, Monkeys, Birds, Bats, Centipedes, Spiders and some weird Leech controlled zombies. Some of these wildlife are boss fights. You can‚Äôt avoid them. The rest of them are annoying as hell. Instead of fighting these things, your best bet is to probably avoid them and run the hell away. That‚Äôs another decision you will be making a lot - when to fight and when to run. Sometimes the Coward‚Äôs route is best.\n\nSo how are the boss fights? Well some are more fun than others. Also, almost all of them just happen at random, for no apparent reason. Sometimes you‚Äôre going your merry way and all of a sudden, there‚Äôs a boss. Oh well. That‚Äôs life. The good thing about this is that it adds an element of unpredictability that will keep you on your toes, which I like in a horror game. There is one in particular that annoyed the hell out of me though. The Bat fight. You see, the way the targeting system works in this game is you press the target button and it targets an enemy. Then you press it again and it switches to another. You can‚Äôt command the thing to target the enemy you want, as it just cycles through enemies until it gets to the one you want. So, this is the Bat fight. It starts off all well and good because it‚Äôs just me and Bat. However when the Bat gets hurt enough, it calls in some minion bats to help it out. So at this point, I‚Äôm really irritated because I‚Äôm trying to line up a shot on the main Bat but the minions keep getting in the way and my targeting system keeps targeting them instead of the main Bat. Then while that‚Äôs going on the main Bat swoops in casually, picks me up and flings me around the room. Thankfully, the other boss fights weren‚Äôt as frustrating as that one.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about game length. I completed the game between 6-7hrs on Normal difficulty and was awarded a B-rank for my troubles. There is a bonus "Wesker Mode" that you unlock once you beat the game that allows you play as the man himself. Plus there‚Äôs a ton of replayabiliy if you want to get all of the achievements or a better rank. However looking at some of those achievements (going through the game without healing or saving?) I have a feeling only crazy people will attempt those. They are surely not for me. At the end of it all I did have a good time with this game. Once I got into the groove of things I enjoyed all the strategy involved with managing items & switching between characters to solve puzzles. The story as I mentioned before isn't stellar but RE games aren't known for having stellar plots anyway. I liked it for what it is and if you're a fan, you'll more than likely find it to be a worthy prequel. Whether all of that is worth the $20 asking price is up to you.\n\nMy score - 7/10","January 23","true","14.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Of course, like everyone else, I had to adjust to the new item management system, which felt  a bit odd at first. But after an hour or so into the game I realized that it‚Äôs actually an improvement over the old design. Let me explain:\n\n1) Let‚Äôs face it: The old item crate system was extremely unrealistic. Now you can drop your stuff wherever you please and will find it exactly where you dropped it ‚Äì for me that‚Äôs a clear improvement.\n\n2) Anyway: If you pick up stuff and drop it near typewriters, the game almost plays and feels like RE1 ‚Äúreal survival‚Äù mode, where item boxes aren‚Äôt linked.\n\n3) The map has a mode that shows you exactly where all your items are. So even if you‚Äôre ‚Äúuntidy‚Äù, you will never have to roam around aimlessly searching for your grenade launcher!\n\n4) Except the very first area, all areas are linked so you will also never have to leave an item behind for good (even if it may seem that way at first). Just bring the most important items when entering a new area and you won‚Äôt ever have to do any extensive backtracking.\n\nSome people feel that six item slots are too few, especially as some items take two slots. I never had a problem with this ‚Äì let me explain again:\n\n1) You are most often in partner mode, that is you actually got 12 slots.\n\n2) Even if every character carries a handgun and a big two-slot weapon (which you don‚Äôt have to do all the time), you will still have 2*3=6 free slots for other items! Now, if you let it sink in that the whole game area is basically a big item box, you‚Äôll find that you really don‚Äôt have to constantly haul a lot of stuff around. Exceptions aside, I never actually carried health items with me and the same goes for extra ammo. 15 bullets in your handgun and 7 rounds in your shotgun will easily suffice for most excursions from your preferred typewriter area ‚Äì finish your foray, then go back to heal, reload (and maybe save).\n\nI'd now like to point out a few things in RE0 which are better than in RE1:\n\n1) Graphics are even more detailed and atmospheric, in places they are absolutely stunning. The visual upgrade from RE1 to RE0  becomes especially apparent if you play both games in parallel.\n\n2) The new partner system is refreshing: At times you run with your partner, which is then AI controlled, like in RE5/6, orders for general behaviour included. At other times you two go separate ways ‚Äì which makes for a few nice puzzles where you have to ‚Äúzapp‚Äù between them.  At still other times one partner gets ‚Äúlost‚Äù and you have to go it alone until you eventually meet again. I feel this makes for a whole lot of additional variety over the "lone wolf only" system of RE1.\n\n3) There were way too many health items in RE1 HD Remake, even in hard mode - my item crate used to look like a drugstore! I really like that there are much fewer herbs/sprays in RE0, which greatly contributes to the survival horror feel. (However, as a downside, RE0  has too much ammo. The ‚Äúdancing around‚Äù zombies from RE1 to conserve ammo is never needed here, at least not on ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Ink ribbon count is okay, though ‚Äì I had about ten ink ribbons left on my first run. Edit: Playing on "hard" now, there's just enough ammo to get by - perfect!)\n\n4) The endboss gauntlet in RE0 is much better and strategy-wise more satisfying than the tyrant fight of RE HD remake.\n\nNow I made it sound like RE0 is actually the better game. But of course this is not true: RE1 will always be first choice on every list simply because it got the special "magic" that only the game which started it all can have. RE1 also has the better "mansion" and (all in all) better puzzles (though there are some memorable puzzles in RE0 too). RE1 has also a stronger story and better characters, but still: RE0 rounds out the backstory of RE1 quite nicely, and: you *will* get attached to Rebecca!\n\nBecause of the gameplay and the tied-together stories I feel that RE1 and RE0 belong together - I will now make it a habit of playing those two "back to back". Anyway, to make a long story short: For all fans of RE1 HD Remake, RE0 is a must ‚Äì especially as nothing else out there will help us shorten the long wait for RE2 Remake.","March 25","true","37.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

But why, oh why did Capcom see the need to remove the chest boxes, instead of placing your unused items in a chest box, you now just dump them on the floor. These can be collected again at any point but means on some occasions you'll be doing a fair bit of backtracing to collect them again. Hopefully for the RE2 Remake (which has been confirmed) they will not forget to include these again.\n\nThe game has been running flawlessly on my setup (Win 10, 960 GTX, i7 3.4Ghz) with no hiccups and at a smooth 60fps throughout, although having read the forum it does appear some are having a problem with the game running with a slow motion effect.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game on the Gamecube and I'm having a blast playing it again with a new lick of paint.\n\n8/10\n\n+ Nice graphical upgrade\n+ Good optimization\n+ Great atmosphere\n+ Controlling two characters is fun\n\n- No Chest boxes\n- No original control sceme for the 360 controller (X would be to run in the original, this is not available on RE Zero)\n- Stupid pricing for the DLC which in essence is just costumes for the characters","January 19","true","4.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

Classic survival horror in many respects.\n\nWhile I agree that it's strange for the devs to have removed the item crate tradition, items can be easily stored in a location central to the area the player is in. Complaints that this removal ruins the game are greatly exaggerated. That said, it's not an easy game, so first time players should consider easy mode at first. Very cool also that players can select either classic controls (woot!), or more modern controls for players unfamiliar with old survival horror.\n\nThe on-the-fly character swapping gameplay was a bold move when the game first came out, and offers a number of interesting scenarios throughout. Classic Resident Evil creepiness is intact in RE0, and the series had yet to become overly combat-heavy.\n\nHighly recommended!","March 7","true","8.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Another big betrayel get be lighted. I dont want to talk to much, but this game has so many flair, the bosses are rarely but you cant avoid most easily like in 1 and they are great, thats why this game on hard mode is really not easy. The puzzles are nothing very hard but come very good in the game. Graphics are fine enough for the good atmosphere. As one of my most loved games i give this game 97 % but its a 89-90 normally worth. So buy it and hopefully you can enjoy many hours the game on all difficulties and all extras/ modes for 20 euros its really worth to enjoy some hours, even if the game could have more rooms, more enemys (leeches and elimators are great) more weapons, more secrets and more skip options but i am fine with it.

If you like the old Resident Evil, gotta get this one. Played it on gamecube back in the days, was fun then and is fun now. Graphics are crisper than in Resi 1 Remaster in my opinion. Finished this one and started the first one right away, so my comparison is up to date.\nInventory system is a little different and can be annoying at times. You dont have a chest to put your items in. You can drop everything on the ground, wherever you stand. I like this system, dont have to run back to the chest to put something in when i want to pick up a new item. Just drop it and get it later. Your map shows you where you put your items. I recommend making main item rooms, so you dont find yourself searching for that magnum ammo. One downside to this inventory system is, that you can encounter bossbattles while youre totally unequipped. This could happen in the first one too, but in this one, due to the 2 playable characters, it might happen that the important stuff is on your other character, which isnt always available. So youll need to live with what you got or load a savegame, to reequip.\nAs i mentioned before, i started the first one after finishing Zero and i kinda missed the ability to drop items where i want. But i guess this is totally up to personal liking.\n\nThis is one of the classic RE games, many say it is the weakest, i loved all of them.

However, the superficial improvements that successfully update this old school Resident Evil game‚Äôs look and feel can‚Äôt cover up its deeper underlying problems: predictable pacing, weak story, and forgettable enemies.

This is the only Resident Evil I didn't beat multiple times as a kid. Why? Well I actually didn't know until I played it on here. So port wise Capcom did a great job! It looks even better than REmake though the CG cutscenes are kinda pixalated. Nevertheless, the game looks good and plays awesome with a controller. Now as for the game itself? Well you have a sort of buddy system with the two characters. You can switch between them at will but something about this always felt weird to me. Even on Gamecube. Is it good or bad? I don't know. The story is meh... You don't miss out on much other than a little bit of neat backstory. The thing that really annoys me about RE0 and was the main reason I played it ONCE on gamecube was because of the layout. The Train is fine. The Training Facility is fine. The Church thing is a bit confusing. The Factory is too small. And the Water Plant is TOO big! At the end of this game you have to find some items and bring them all together to make an item to get another item to unlock the door to the last boss. Finding these three items can be a pain as the last area has 8+ floors! I often asked myself "Where the *&%$ am I?!"\n\nThis game is okay.

Besides the abysmal default mapping, the game does not input movement controls fast enough. The RE1 HD Remake was fine and did not share this problem.\n\nFor example, it's impossible to back up then move foward immediately, for some reason there is a deadzone before the game recognizes that you input to move foward.\n\nThis makes dodging extremely difficult to borderline impossible when in narrow areas with many enemies. It forces you to empy your clip in every room because of how staggeringly hard it is to bait zombies and run past them, which is an RE staple skill\n\nStill going to recommend because it's playable and captures the classic, but the port suffers, which to me makes no sense because the RE1HD port to PC was perfect....","January 19","true","13.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

On one hand its commendable that it stands out from any other Resident Evil game, but on the other, the execution could have been better handled. There are some neat puzzle solving moments using the two separate characters, but overall the game feels a bit underwhelming despite some great promise early on. There‚Äôs perhaps too much of an over-familiar feeling due to a reliance on similar locations from the original game. That said, the increased resolution and 60 frames per second make for smooth gameplay experience which is most welcome. So whilst this is perhaps one of the weaker games in the series it‚Äôs still worth picking up to play considering its low price point. If you‚Äôre a Resident Evil enthusiast who doesn‚Äôt want to dust off the old Gamecube then this is a neat game to play for an afternoon and relive some memories in HD.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/339340/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1598 products in account","Resident Evil 0 made its original debut on the Gamecube back in late 2002. The installment set out to clarify the start of the outbreak in Raccoon City in a somewhat "origin story" fashion. The game features two main characters, ex-US Marine Lieutenant Billy Coen, who makes his debut appearance, and S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team Medic Rebecca Chambers, who appeared in the first Resident Evil game.\n\nMost importantly, let's discuss the HD remaster aspect of this title. Resident Evil 0 runs flawlessly, it's an outstanding port that doesn't suffer from any crashes, bugs, glitches, or framerate drops. I had my framerate set to 85 for the duration of my two playthroughs, and I never saw the rate drop below 83. The optimization is both incredible and commendable. Furthermore, the work that Capcom put into revamping the textures and character models really shines here. Sure, the cutscenes are still old and have not been updated whatsoever; that's nothing new for HD remasters, but everything else has the same sharpness and gleam to it that the Resident Evil HD remaster has. Even the windows have dynamic and clear reflections. The 5.1 audio upgrade really stands out if you have a gaming headset capable of rendering either 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound, and it really helps to tell which direction enemies are going to come from. The subtle ambiance of the game has also been severely upgraded.\n\nSo the port and HD upgrades are great, but what about the game itself? Well, RE0 is definitely no RE4, but it's still a decent game and also a highly important one for those who care about the plot of the franchise. Seeing as I never have owned a Gamecube, I never got the chance to play this particular title until now. Throughout the game, you will learn about the origin of the infamous T-Virus and who created it, along with the origins of the Umbrella Corporation, how Albert Wesker got his start, various prototypes and early stages for certain key monsters such as the Lickers, and other tidbits of information that you'll be able to use to piece together information from later games if you have played them.\n\nYou start off playing as Rebecca Chambers, on a mission to find criminal Billy Coen who is rumored to have killed 25 people. Your search soon leads you into a train, where all hell breaks loose. Soon you meet up with Billy, who becomes your co-op partner for the remainder of the game. You're able to control both characters both at the same time, and independently. Many times, the characters will have to split up and go separate ways in order to solve puzzles or to get each other out of sticky situations. The main game leads you from the train through the vast Umbrella Training Facility, which is where you will spend about 90% of your time. Although the map of the game isn't incredibly large or varying in comparison to later titles, since RE0 is a prequel the smallness of the world is justifiable.\n\nA huge pain point for Resident Evil 0 is the abysmal lack of storage boxes. Sure, any fan of the franchise has gotten used to dealing with cramped inventory space; it's a staple to the gameplay. Though to my best recollection, every other title in the series has had some form of storage. In RE0, you're left to scattering your items on the floor and then taking on the painstaking task to move every item as you progress into new sections of the game. This might not sound awful, but when coupled with the slow door-opening animations, it really is quite time consuming. It's also extra annoying when the save room (any room with a typewriter) that you're attempting to dump your precious cargo in says that you cannot leave any more items in the room. This leaves you with the option to either forget about the item, or dump it in a different nearby room.\n\nOnce you beat the game, you will open up two new modes; Wesker Mode and Leech Hunter. Let me begin by saying that Wesker Mode is just so lazy and tacky that it is painful. This mode simply reskins Billy as Wesker, and gives him two new abilities; Death Stare and Shadow Dash. The cutscenes remain the same, featuring Billy, and Capcom didn't even take the time or put in the effort to change the audio. When playing as Wesker, you will still hear Billy's voice, and people will still refer to him as Billy. However, Wesker is extremely powerful and his Death Stare can kill many enemies in a single hit; zombies, hunters, monkeys, plague crawlers, etc. As well, many bosses are made significantly easier and take only 3-4 hits before they're toast. This is a perfect mode for speed running or grabbing hard to get achievements. However, this mode isn't anything to scream about. Leech Hunter is even more mundane, as you take Billy and Rebecca back into the Training Facility to collect blue and green leech charms; there are 50 of each, you're under no time limit, there are enemies to take care of, and the game is over once you either leave the Facility or die.\n\nThe main story of Resident Evil 0 will run you anywhere from 8-15 hours, depending on what difficulty you play on and if you use a guide. After that, there's really not a whole lot to do other than try for some achievements or check out the two modes that are unlocked upon completion; however those may not hold the interest of many. I wouldn't say that this installment is a must play by any means, but it's definitely a worthwhile origin story and those who are major Resident Evil fans should check it out.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 3","true","25.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The "Secrets" are worth to find and for 100% completition this game has a good replaybillity. Only a few scenes and bossfights can be a bit frustrating for beginners but with a little bit use of a brain u can do it all.\n\nSo after all its a good game and in my opinion its a game of the old school class and earned the title resident evil pretty well.

The character models look fantastically animated and the zombies/monsters can be seen in wonderful gory detail. As far as gameplay goes, it' vintage resident evil : Finding key items, solving puzzles, avoiding monsters and managing your ammunition, all coupled with the typical cheesy plot.\n\nAs much as I liked the game back then, this game doesn't quite match up to it's sister game, Resident Evil HD Remaster. In that game, you got to play as two different characters, both with their own little variations in gameplay, story, and endings, which made the game quite replayable. Zero on the other hand, has no such variation, which makes the game kinda a bore the second time around. The newly added Wesker Mode is nothing special honestly, as it basically makes the game even more boring since you now have powers that easily overpower your weaponry( I had to limit Wesker to only using a Handgun to make the playthrough atleast somewhat interesting.)\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game to anyone who wants some more old school horror.

Controlling two characters can put a damper on the game for some, but to me it just increases the tension. Another character to look out for means another weapon to keep loaded and another person to keep healthy.\n\nItem management is a bigger thing here, and there are no item boxes. However you can drop items wherever you like and use some items when picking them up, even if your inventory is full. Both characters have their own item slots (making 12 slots in total), however there are items and weapons that take up more than one slot. Not going to lie, item management can get a little sloppy at times.\n\nGraphical enhancements are the same as what you would expect after playing the first REmaster, with some character models and pictures being redone. I have run into a couple hiccups with the audio during cutscenes, but it's not even for a second, so it isn't really that bad. 1080p, 60fps goodness is here as well. No 4k resolution support that I am aware of.\n\nControls, like the first REmaster, are completely customizable for keyboard and mouse, while controller gets five different preset controls. I recommended keyboard and mouse for the first REmaster, but I may have to recommend a controller this time. Main reason being is that you can control the other character with the other stick without having to switch to the other character. You can still control the other character with the arrow keys (or whatever keys you wish to bind them as). Also, you cannot control one character with the new control scheme (non-tank controls) and then control the other character with classic tank controls. You have to control both characters with the same control scheme.\n\nThe game still keeps the non-hand holding and throwing you into a maze type of game, well if you can really call being on a train a maze. If the game doesn't do it for you right away, get past the train at least. The game pick ups after that and gets a lot better. The environment will feel a lot more "Resident Evil" then. Plus leech men are probably the freakiest thing you'll encounter.\n\n88 leeches/leech men\n\n\nP.S.

But faces some new challenges.\n\nFirst of all, Let's make this clear. This is the exact same game from 2002. Only with 60FPS gameplay, New controls and higher resolution Textures. If you was expecting a "Remake". That's not what this is, this is a more modern version of the already amazingly beautiful, crisp and solid GameCube game from 2002 (And Wii during the later years). So you should treat it as such.\n\nSomehow, Capcom managed to make this game look even better than Resident Evil 1 HD. I can't place my finger on it but it overall looks crisper. Almost as if they've done more effort than before. The details in the environments make the GameCube version, even though it's still a spectacular visual experience, look way outdated.\n\nThere is a problem however, the game looks so good, that the CG Movie clips looks outrageously bad. It's ripped straight from the GameCube and you can see this clearly in the credits as it uses the old Logo. The CG Videos looks extremely compressed and honestly worse than the actual game. Some moving objects in the background seems to be running at a lower FPS than the rest of the game, which is fine but may look odd in some situations. Yet the intro movie when you start up the game is done very well for some reason. Odd.\n\nInterestingly enough, This game doesn't include any strange "Remixed" or "Remastered" sound tracks like in Resident Evil 1 HD. Even more strange it doesn't include the Soundtrack. Pre-order bonus or not. Not a huge deal just a tad odd.\n\nIt definitely shows that Capcom put in some more effort into this one. There's actual DLC Costume packs, which while Resident Evil 1 HD does add 1 extra outfit for Chris and Jill. Here you have 5 Packs for Bill and Rebecca. Plus a new game mode to boot. What gives Capcom? Give RE1HD the same treatment!\n\nSince it's the same game as the 2002 Gamecube original. It suffers from the same problems. It's a very slow, sometimes very tedious Survival Horror game. With fixed Camera angles and even though it has a more modern "Better" control Scheme. The long animations of the characters make the action extremely slow paced and sometimes frustrating. However, That's how Resident Evil was loved before. That's how we remember it. And it's a love or hate argument. Simply put, if you only play Resident Evil 4 and above. Stay away from this one or any of the classic ones unless you're ready for a much slower game.\n\nNow for this versions biggest flaw. Controls. Firstly, the Inventory and Sprint keys for the tank controllers are flipped. None of the Control options can change this. At all, you can't even map manual actions like in RE1HD. How did Capcom screw this up is beyond me.\n\nIt may not seem like an issue. But oh goodness is it a problem. The "Y" button on a X360 controller switches characters. You can see how that is already a problem. If you played RE1HD a lot. That same button should be inventory. Instead, it's the "X" button, Which should be Run if you're playing in Tank control mode. This is unacceptable. Even in the GameCube version and I dare say the Wii. The Control buttons made sense. Here it's setup in some absorb rubbish. I don't care if it's "Japanese" style or whatever. It doesn't change the fact that in the first game it was set to it's normal controls. And this is the PC version, which is Internationally the same with a simple Language change.\n\nThat doesn't seem like a horrible issue. But it's quite the annoyance, especially since it got me killed a few times.\n\nAll in all. This is a fantastic Remaster. And I'm happy, because this is one of my favorite Resident Evil games. If the Controls could be mapped, the CG Videos redone in a higher resolution and less compression. Possibly add the soundtrack for consistency? Then I'd say this is a perfect remaster. And it still is a great ride.","January 21","true","22.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's more of the campy, gory, spooky good time we enjoy from the RE series and it offers a robust challenge. Lots of dying in this game. This is the last in the series that is essentially an action packed point-and-click adventure game and I appreciate the opportunity to play RE0 once again. Sure the puzzles are not necessarily realistic, but the whole series is always bordering on parody as it is. The level design isn't as strong as in previous titles of the series and some of the environments gave a strong sense of deja vu. The very worst thing about this game, though, is the inventory management. Holy f.ck! Each character can only hold six items and there was always a constant need to switch items between characters, leave items in a room and then have to hike all the way back for them once there was enough room in the inventory. Some items even took up two spots in the inventory. I understand this was a necessary feature for how some of the puzzles were designed, but... how dare they! There is a lot of back tracking in game simply because of the terrible inventory system. The main villain was laughably awful too. Everything he said was re-tarded and he looked like some androgynous NPC from a Final Fantasy game. Don't get me wrong, the puzzle solving, exploration, and blowing away monsters were a grand time and most of the game is spent doing these things. It took around 15 hours to finish the game for the first time. There's definitely incentive to re-play it too; and not just because it's a fun game in general either. After finishing the game for the first time, the ability to play as Wesker is unlocked. This is essentially easy mode. He has an attack that can clear a room faster than grandma's chili. It was a thrill to see groups of enemies all instantly drop dead in unison from a single blast. Boss battles became a breeze. Most only took around 3 blasts from Wesker to kill. There's another mode that wasn't as interesting to me where Rebecca and Billy need to find leech charms scattered throughout the mansion. RE0 still looks pretty good after all these years. Kudos to Capcom for the job they did polishing this game up, getting it ready for this HD release. The water animations stand out as the most impressive part of the presentation. Slime oozes from leeches, water from a filled sink splashes around dripping to the floor, and the rain beats down on top of the train all in convincing fashion, to give a few examples. Even a very simple cut-scene of water flowing from a pipe was impressive to watch. From a technical standpoint, the game ran flawlessly. The frame rate was consistently a rock solid 60fps and the game never crashed. RE0 won't win any converts to the series, but it's still a really good game that I highly recommend, even if it doesn't reach as high levels the series has previously reached.","January 30","true","31.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Overall, it's a good game, now with new infected monkey primates and leeches to fend off, but inferior to RE1 due to an awkward item management system. This port also suffers from an occasional drop in frame rate. After the tense & claustrophobic settings of the early Train stage, this game lacks any new ideas and just retreads the same old ground as the original involving yet another mansion hiding an Umbrella facility.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/339340/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Resident Evil 0 is probably the most polarizing game in the series, only beating out 6 because it's harder to find a person who genuinely enjoys 6 as a Resident Evil game than it is to find Wesker without sunglasses. Some people will tell you it's the worst non-6 game in the main series, others will tell you it's one of their favorites. I had never played it until now, so I had no idea what to think going in, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst off, for those who are just here to see the port changes, it's pretty well-done overall. The HD Remaster of REmake was put down a bit due to the developers not having original sources for most of the backdrops, so a lot of scenes looked grainy or artifacted, especially if you were playing in HD, and it made 3D geometry like items or puzzle objects stand out awkwardly. In RE0 HD this has been completely fixed, and whether you choose to play in widescreen or in the original aspect ratio everything except the cutscenes looks fantastic. The game still has the same problem with mouse and keyboard play as REmake HD did in that the cursor never goes off screen, so I did play it with a gamepad, but if you can ignore the cursor it controls fine either way. The main new addition aside from the DLC costumes is Wesker Mode, which is an amusing little extra mode where you replay the game replacing Billy with Wesker, complete with a couple of superpowered attacks.\n\nAs far as the game in general, I thought it was great. The new mechanic introduced lets you swap between two different characters, which is mainly used to add some spice to the classic Resident Evil puzzles. This means you have a larger combined inventory, but this is offset by what seems to be the most polarizing change - unlike most RE games, there is no magical transporting item box in RE0. Anything you can't carry with you has to be left on the ground somewhere, encouraging you to make caches in certain rooms. Some people will hate this change, and I can understand that, but I thought it added a lot of pressure to manage your inventory and choose carefully what to keep and what to leave behind. Any items that you've interacted with show up on your map, so it isn't a hassle to figure out where you've left something. The game is somewhat faster paced in that you start facing BOWs and acquiring weapons (though not necessarily ammo) to fight them earlier than you probably would in REmake on your first try, but it's still a more resource-scarce and survival-like game than others like Code Veronica. It is shorter than REmake by nature of only having one campaign instead of two like RE1 had, but I found 0's campaign to be a little longer than one of 1's campaigns and on your first playthrough it should serve you a fair amount of time.\n\nIn many ways it feels similar to REmake, and some locations will definitely feel familiar, but it keeps things fresh enough to feel more like an encore than a retread. My only real complaint about it is that the train portion of the game is actually fairly short and only makes up a small portion of the game, which disappointed me because I loved the look and atmosphere of it. But overall, if you're a fan of REmake, I can't see any reason not to try this as well, assuming you already haven't in the past decade or so.","January 20","true","14.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I guess they just figured a lot of people with i3 laptops would be running this p.o.s. so they didn't want their systems to crash.\n\nI'm recommending this game because as shallow and redundant of an addition to the original franchise as it was, it's still a classic Resident Evil style game.... Is it better than say Resident Evil Code Veronica? Mmmmmm, maybe on par... it definitely doesn't hold a candle to REmake or RE2.... maybe 3 even... that might be a stretch though.\n\nSo basically the original gamecube version of the game is still intact. You can't skip the useless door animations unless you're running a mod or script. Why they still chose to leave the crappy door animations with no option in game to turn them off is beyond me... I mean at this point they're just a special effect meant to draw you in to the world and create atmosphere... but highly unnecessary from a technical stand point.\n\nChanges from the original GC version\nBuy DLC costumes, with real money, that cost more than the game does, that only YOU can see.\nThe Closet key and closet are now disabled, you can change your costumes on the fly from the inventory.\nEmo mode (A Wesker mod where Billy is now Wesker and he's OP as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• headshotting groups of zombies with his eyeballs and sprinting past enemies)\nHD Facelift so the game actually looks decent, cutscenes are still really bad looking though.\nStandarized controls are back and defaulted just like in the REmake HD RE-release... So no more moving like a tank unless you really want to... the option is there.\nOther than that, all the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• mechanics are still intact, poor aim mechanics, poor item detection mechanics, limited item placement in rooms because the game can't handle it, slow character swapping and clunky menus.\n\nLeech Mode is still there for your cheating pleasure... Unlock infinite ammo and stuff playing that mind numbing frustrating mess of a mini game... because Capcom had to tack on some kind of B.S. mode to this tripe.\n\nAll in all, if you've been here done this before, you know what to expect... I could drone on and on as to why this game is terrible but no one is going to listen... It's a bad game, has a terrible plot, terrible puzzles, weak ending and doesn't fit in well with the canon story but it took Crapcom like 7 or 8 years to develop it, so hey, appreciate it.\n\nIt always bugged me how this game felt like it was made after the fact... like Wesker and Berkin's exchanges felt forced and stupid and the god awful interactions you have with Enrico that just constantly foreshadow his demise, not to mention he looks like he killed Barry and stole his outfit... it's just so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing bad. Billy Coen was an interesting concept of a character, too bad we'll never see him again...EVER... along with our main protagonist Rebecca... I mean wtf was Capcom thinking with this game?\n\nTo those of you who haven't played this, make sure you've familiarized yourself with the REmake and at least one other original RE game before you attempt to play this because it's bat ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• hard due to crappy mechanics. The A.I. partner is useless and will only eat up your ammo, they respond slowly to any kind of danger and will waste precious ammo shooting crows / bats and zombies with magnum bullets, you've been warned.... Unequip the other player when not in use.\n\nHeavy memorization is required to complete this game with an S rank as well, it's almost impossible without having ran through the game 3 or 4 times back to back... Having aspergers syndrome probably helps a lot too. Either way, those are my thoughts. Sure buy it because it's a mainstream title and will keep you busy for a while... I'm already done with it, I have to run through the game again in Wesker mode but it all just seems rather redundant and stupid... I mean he blows ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up with his eyeballs... this mode was made for casuals and it's not even that creative.","January 23","true","8.1"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","12","21","4","0"

So I tried mouse & keyboard and it's total garbage. You MUST keep the cursor in the center of the screen the entire time you play for your controls to work. It's baffling how they set this up. But anyway, I'm getting used to the new alternate controls now.\n\nThe game is fantastic. It's the classic Resident Evil horror experience. It's just like REmake but with a wonky new inventory management system. I'm sure plenty complain about it, but it's part of the game. That's how RE has always been and I love it.\n\nIt's weird since I'm a grown man but I'm scared playing this game. I don't remember much from playing it on GameCube so all the scary mystery men take me by surprise. Just hearing that music sends my heart into palpitations. Another thing people complain about is the saving system, but again, that's always been part of this game and it's essential to the horror element. The thought that you could lose progress is what makes it so scary. I'm okay with dying and doing sections over again because you can do them better. But the idea of not knowing what you're walking into is frightening. I love it.","January 25","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, except when it comes to the remastering. This remaster is superior in almost every way to the first one: almost everything is crisp and hi-res. Did they find more of the original 3d models and textures for this one, or did they just spend more on recreating stuff? Actually I would pay again for a Resident Evil 1 remastered to this level.\n\nAs an aside, it is very obvious that the translator didn't see the actual images in the game, let alone play it. It calls a mirror a suit of armor and says that "You've never seen anything like it" of something that looks exactly like something seen a couple of rooms earlier.

Those who are not familiar with these kind of RE games may not like this, but I suggest you give it a try. its not that expensive.\n\nThe graphics are remastered and they look pretty good. The great thing about these old RE games is the athmosphere which comes from great music and gameplay that require puzzle solving and many situations where you have to think about whether to run or use your limited ammo to kill enemies.\n\nYou play as two characters, but you move only one character at a time. Each one has their own personal item and special ability, such as strenght to move heavy objects or to crawl from small holes. Sometimes you need to move together, sometimes you cant, and sometimes its just not necessary or smart. Ammo and healtpacks are limited, and you have to decide which one takes them, You can swap and leave items, and if you move to next section of the game the items oddly follow you, which is a good thing. There are several different enemies and also bosses. Some drain your health pretty fast so you have to act and think fast. There are three difficulty settings. I personaly think the easiest setting is too easy, so you should start with normal.\n\nTurn off your lights and put volume to max, I quarantee this game offers some good scares!","January 26","true","24.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It first appeared in 2002, well after all but the most ardent of fans were tired of the survival horror formula and ready for something new. Despite a few minor additions, Resident Evil 0 didn't offer that.\n\nBut that's precisely why this Resident Evil 0 HD re-release from Capcom is so useful. With distance from the atmosphere surrounding its release, it's a lot easier to view Resident Evil 0 for exactly what it is: a flawed but generally satisfying and, more importantly, smart take on Capcom's approach to horror.\n\n\nAnd yet, aside from the very last area, I found Resident Evil 0's locales interesting enough to alleviate any frustration from backtracking. These are tightly-designed settings, paced perfectly to emphasize tension. I was rarely sent running in a direction I'd already been in without the area suddenly being invaded by a new nightmare creature, or without finding myself unexpectedly stalked by a returning foe. Even as the game advanced and I built up a healthy backpack of ammunition for my guns, I always felt just one or two bad rooms away from losing everything.\n\nFor as much as Resident Evil 0 embraces the series' classic gameplay, it also adopts the goofy, heavy-handed and poorly voice-acted storytelling of the franchise's earliest entries. If you're expecting serious drama from Rebecca and Billy, you're in for a disappointment, and don't even get me started on the game's hilariously ineffective villain. But if you love the cornier approach to survival horror, before everything took itself so seriously, it's a blast.\n\nRemoved from the moment in time when it debuted, Resident Evil 0 is just a really good classic RE game. It didn't set the standards for this style of game the way Resident Evil 1 did; it's not as ambitious or unblemished as Resident Evil 2. But it's far from the mess that history made it out to be. Whether you're a veteran who's played it before or a new fan who never tried out Resident Evil 0, it's good enough to deserve this second chance.","January 27","true","21.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Until I played it for myself I had watched my father play it, but when I did, oh boy was I glad I decided to play it myself. This is mostly due to the fact that my dad never beat the game and I wanted to see the ending.\n\nNow as for the Remastered HD port here on PC, it is glorious. Runs 1080p 60fps everywhere except for 2 instances. Cutscenes which are capped at 30 fps, and room transitions, which I have had drop to as low as 19fps, but only for a split second. It isn't too big of an issue, but the fact it does it on my system is bothersome. That is with the game maxed out on a PC running an FX-8350 CPU and a GTX 980 graphics card. As you can see my PC blows the Recommended, and probably Max settings requirement out of the water. Like I said it isn't too big an issue to dock any points off, but the fact it happens is a little bothersome.\n\nMy rating for this game, is as it was for the GCN version, 10/10\n\nEdit: So I should mention as well that the controls are vastly different than REmastered. Coming from Resident Evil to Zero took a little getting used to, at least for controller, I think Keyboard can be remapped to exactly REmastered. Also... holding B is how you run in Zero with a controller... X is the Status screen... they really should've switched those.","January 29","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yes and No. If you are new to the RE franchise i strongly recommend to try the first RE HD game which is also available on Steam. The two character play which is in RE 0 can be a little bit confusing and to the dislike of unfamiliar players. However if you do not mind that and the simpler puzzles do not annoy you this game is something for you.

My memories of it were that the item management was a bit tedious. So, going into this many years later with almost no other memories of it I must say I'm far more impressed than I expected to be. After playing it over 4 times, and completing leech mode twice, this game has become one of my top 3 Resident Evil games.\n\nWhy do I love this game? Well, I started off by playing it on hard (can't recommend enough for RE vets), and this game on hard was easily the most challenging Resident Evil experience I have delt with, but in my opinion the perfect kind of fun challenge that is extremely rewarding. This game has it all, plenty of classic Resident Evil puzzles that are even more complex due to the 2 characters, extremely limited ammo which requires you to plan you play through, and incrediably great settings.\n\nIf you're looking for classic RE with a challenge this game is for you. If you don't like item management you may not like this game, however for an old school RE fan I think that it actually is one of its biggest strengths since it actually adds a ton of depth to the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashmaestro/recommended/339340/","smashmaestro","Smash!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashmaestro/","62 products in account","When considering what it is that distinguishes a survival horror game from an action or any other genre, things that come to mind for survival horror fans are usually locked camera angles which can often put the player at a viewing disadvantage, weak or limited combat abilities, low ammo supplies and adventure game exploration in a environment filled with dangerous enemies. What makes a survival horror game different from other genres is that while most games give the player great agency and power over the world, survival horror puts the player at a disadvantage and in a position of weakness. Under those parameters, Resident Evil Zero is undoubtedly a survival horror game.\n\nIf inconveniencing the player is part of what makes a game a survival horror game, then Resident Evil Zero may at times have too much of a good thing. While it is a staple of the classic Resident Evil franchise to give the player limited inventory and to juggle items, Zero goes a step further by flooding the player with a multitude of items while also providing no system of storage. The idea was to make item management more organic by forcing the player to pick up and put down items in the game world as necessary rather than being confined to chests. But the management of resources frequently crosses the line from being a source of tension to a source of tedium, and first time players can add whole hours to their play time as they trial and error which items they needed to take and which to leave behind.\n\nDespite the two character co-op mechanic, this game brings nothing substantially new to the Resident Evil franchise or the survival horror genre. Many of the familiar enemies and settings seen in other games come back here and none of the features makes this game stand out compared to the other entries.  What it does bring is a solid entry into the genre and another hearty full length adventure for fans to sink their teeth into. One quality which stands out in this game versus the other classic Resident Evils is that while they have often been called survival horror, they usually ended up playing more like action games by the end. As early as Resident Evil 2 the games have been empowering the player more than the game advertises and even in the remake there is more bullets than there are enemies to kill by the end of the game. In Resident Evil Zero, especially on hard difficulty, there are truly more threats than there are resources to spare. Perhaps in trying to be how people remembered the classic Resident Evils were like rather than being how they really are, Resident Evil Zero is more survival horror than most of the other Resident Evils.\n\nPlaying Zero on hard, I was constantly on the verge of running out of ammo and I was truly worried that I might run out of supplies before I needed them. Zero will still empower the player in time for the end of the game, but first time players will be holding their breath for quite a while before that part arrives. Resident Evil Zero is not an accommodating game. Although released in 2002, this is a game with the design philosophy of 3D playstation 1 games. Many of the features and character control standards of modern AAA games are missing from this title, and it is a very real possibility to get permanently stuck. If you don't mind early 3D game mechanics however, and want to experience a survival horror challenge in what is clearly still a AAA game for its time, then I recommend Resident Evil Zero.\n\nIf you decide to play this game, I recommend that you play it on hard on your first playthrough. A big part of the survival horror experience is entering the unknown, and having to do the cost benefit analysis of risking using supplies versus future need for those supplies. This experience cannot be replicated on repeat playthroughs, and contributes greatly to the horror experience. Here is some spoiler free advice for newer players who might want to take on the challenge of playing this game for the first time on hard which will ensure a more smooth playing experience:\n\nCreate multiple savesHaving 20 save slots means that you can create backups to go back to in case you trap yourself in a corner. Going back 3 or even 4 saves is not as dreadful as it might seem since a great deal of play time is trial and error solution finding. A part that might have took you an hour to get through might take 20 minutes or less when you know what items you need and can save time on backtracking. Never put all your saves in one file or you might get irreversibly stuck.\n\nUse handgun bullets on zombies whenever possible, save the better stuff for the bigger threatsZombies are the low level mooks of this game, and despite what I said earlier, there are usually more handgun bullets than you need. The problem isn't just having ammo, its having the right ammo for the right enemies. Its usually not worth wasting a grenade on a zombie, there are bigger and badder things around the corner that will demand that firepower. A way to make handgun bullets more effective is to bring your partner character with you and have both of them equipped with handguns. Let Billy be the supporting AI since he has more health and shoots more agressively.\n\nThere is more gas than there are bottles to turn into molotovs, don't bother lugging gas cans around. Molotovs are also nearly useless, and don't make that much of a difference This is another flaw of this game. The game leads you to believe that gas is important enough to carry around with you, but it can only create molotovs and there is more of it than you need, which is usually placed around empty bottles in the first place. Any gas you don't immediately use you can almost always ditch. Another thing is that the molotovs are very poor weapons. The attack animation is too slow, the throw range is inconsistent and they don't do very much damage. They are most useful when you encounter leech monsters for the first time, who will often go through a transformation sequence. This gives you a window of time to throw 3-4 molotovs on them guaranteeing their death, but even then they might still get a good hit on you. It might be better to just avoid the leech monsters entirely if you can.\n\nKeep the hookshot nearby after the train section, it will be needed again later. After the lab is complete, you can safely leave it behind, opening up two whole slots in your characters inventory This always gets people. There is a weird gap after the first section of the game where you use the hookshot once, and then never need it again for the next map. You will need it multiple times in the next map following that one though and people will often leave it all the way back at the beginning of the previous map. Once that section is done though you can ditch it for good, unlike other key items it does not disappear after it no longer serves any use.\n\nGood luck, have fun, and enjoy true survival horror!","May 5","true","20.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For the RE-1 remastered on Steam I used the "Type B" control scheme since it emulated best the old GC controller.\n\nWhat is frustrating to me is that Type B on tank (original) controls you ran with X and inventory was with B.  In RE-0 the functions of X and B flip and confuse me to no end.\n\nAlso, Type B had you aiming with RT (right trigger) and firing with A, which is sort of the staple for the default one on this game (except on RE0 Type A you aim with RB).  Type A on RE1 had aiming with LT and firing with RT (as far as I can remember)\n\nI really wish CAPCOM included a little bit of controller consistency on these two titles, they did so well in with the GC versions.\n\nOther than that no complaints  9.3/10\n\nAs an old RE fan this game is awesome, I absolutely love it, the story connects points, dont miss out.","January 21","true","34.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RipperSU/recommended/339340/","RipperSU","NeutronFlow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RipperSU/","342 products in account","I've had an amazing time with this game. Being a massive fan of the RE series, especially  the more 'classic' style games, this was the best thing I've played since, well, REmake HD to be honest. The partner mechanic mixed with the limited inventory system makes for some interesting tactical choices. I found myself unequipping the useless AI and using them as a pack mule, using my armed character to scout ahead and my then bringing in the unequipped character as a pack mule. Unfortunately when buddied up, the partner AI is prone to wasting ammo and running straight into the enemies arms and is one of the few cons i have against the game.\n\nIn regards to the inventory management, the ability to drop items is a mixed blessing. While I didnt suffer too much backtracking, I did have to cart myself all the way to an area I visited hours ago as I hadn't been able to bring my grenade launcher with me. With it being just before the final boss, it killed my momentum a little. That said, it does add more depth to the gameplay than the 'magic box' system favoured by the other classic titles and goes a long way to underlining the survival aspect of Survival Horror.\n\nMy playthrough took me 6 in game hours (according to my ranking at the end) or around 8-9 actual hours with deaths and reloads. I found that Normal was actually quite challening, more so than REmake HD. In fact Zero is up there with Code Veronica as personally what I believe to be the most challenging games in the series. With that in mind though the tougher than average difficulty really helped keep me invested in the game. If like me, its your first time playing this since the Gamecube days, then you arent going to have a lot of surplus ammo or healing items even by the end boss. I appreciated this personally, as I find with most RE games, the difficulty drops off sharply after the first half, by which point the 'magic box' has enough ammo and herbs in to last for another full playthough.\n\nGraphically, I can't fault the presentation at all. While being less atmospheric that REmake, the environments still sing with the HD makeover. Character models, lighting and shadows are all very immersive too. With everything maxed my mid range PC never struggled to keep a 60hz refresh rate.\n\nIn terms of story, its probably one of the weaker of the series to be honest. It perhaps takes itself too seriously compared to the more 'B-Movie' values of the earlier installments. The story is serviceable but in all honesty, as a prequel it fails to tell us anything that would be integral to the understanding of the plot of the subsequent games. Dialog and cutscenes are actually quite sparse and it would have probably benefitted the game to have more interaction between the 2 playable characters. As it stands, they barely say a word to each other once their characters have been established.\n\nThere's plenty more I could say but the most important thing is I strongly reccomend the game. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I did around 10+ years ago when I first played it. If you have the determination and the patience this is a great title thats more than worth the budget price.","January 29","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Back in the day, 0 introduced the concept of the leeches that could not only work together very intelligently, but also come together to form a new enemy with extra endurance and reach than the others. The hook shot was also another interesting addition, which offered new and more realistic ways to deal with problems in the environment, caused by the enemies, or due to the need to climb to higher surfaces to unlock places that either Rebecca or Billy cannot go. The ability to place items in random places when inventory space is needed are more realistic and intuitive features that would have made previous resident evil games a  little easier to handle.\n\nThe story  is well written, albeit brief and very confined to the most essential details. Expanded, they could have made a better narrative. As it is, the tale is well told and gives adventurers items of interest, if only a few. The voices for Rebecca and Billy are well cast and the main villain is pleasingly sinister, albeit underused.\n\n0 is, overall, an atmospheric game that will entertain fans and newcomers alike, but it may seem a little too short. If you want a longer, more in depth experience, seek out Resident Evil 4 or 6.

I got excited, mostly because the newer games are way too action oriented and have strayed so far away from what most of the original fans want.... true survival horror, which is what made the originals so great. I say originals, this means 0-3. Don't get me wrong, this one has it's issues. IGN gave the original an 8.2, now they say it's trash. First, I wouldn't trust what IGN says negatively about any game(even if they reviewed a game about nyan cat)they would probably give it a 10/10. They used to be a go-to informative magaize... that was about 10 years ago. So, what I'm saying is, don't read their review and assume this game is trash... It's not. Second, the HD update looks and plays great. I've seen a few complaints about controls, I haven't run in to any issues yet, but I am playing using the new controls Type C. The one issue i have ran into with controls is that after cutscenes, the Xbox One controller seems to disconnect and the game wants me to use KB&M again. Not sure if it's something with the game or not, as I have had the same issue with one other game... I will update my review further after playing through more, as i just got to the part  where the train crashes and you end up in the Umbrella Research Facility.\n\n\nPros So Far\n`Graphics Look Amazing\n`Controls Work For Me\n`Gameplay Is Tight and Engaging\n`Story Is Great For Those who Prefer The Original Titles\n\nCons So Far\n`Controller Disconnect(not really horrible, mostly annoying)\n`Inventory Management(again, not really too bad, just having to swap items gets repetitive)\n\n\nUpdate So, I have figured out what the issue was with the controller, device manager has two sets of controller updates, one for xbox 360 controller the other for xbox one controller. I uninstalled the drivers for the xbox 360 controller and itis doing great afterwards.","January 19","true","7.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's similar to the first Resident Evil game where you solve puzzles in a huge building, this time it's a facility instead of a mansion. It's good to have two characters that following each other everywhere and solve puzzles together but it's not a new feature for people who played modern titles like RE5 and RE6.\n\nAI of the other character is VERY VERY DUMB. You cannot rely on your partner at all when it comes to combat. They aren't even smart enough to use a gun in their hands. They might help you shoot at enemies once in awhile though.\n\nUnlike RE1-4, there's no storage chest in this game. Really? Yes! the game forces to to throw away items to the floor. You have 6 item slots on each character and most of the heavy weapons required 2 slots to carry, so... another slot for bullets and you have one free slot to carry something else. Have fun running back and forth to pick up items.\n\nThe good thing is, it's a very good port. No problem at all on my system, with highest settings. Maybe you'll have a little trouble with the control schemes because the game doesn't allow you to remap buttons manually. It has 5-6 types of control for you to choose but none of them are close to the PS1 version of RE1-3 so if you prefer to control the characters like those games you'll be disappointed. Of course you can solve this issue by using some 3rd party controller mapper.\n\nShould you buy this game? If you like RE1-3, you'll like it, but if you hate RE1-3, you'll hate it.\n\nI give it a 6/10. It's worth playing to complete the story of the Resident Evil series but if you're not a hardcore RE fan it doesn't really mean anything.","January 21","true","23.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

It's lived up to that hype.  However its still not the best RE game out there.  Probably this is the weakest and hardest out of the main canon due to some interesting mechanics introduced into a game keeping the genre fresh back in 2003.\n\nPositives:\n\nBoth Characters have nice variations about them,  Health, physical strengthl, weapon handling.\nNo more item boxes - (if you know the optimal route after your playthroughs getting the S Rank feels less of a chore)\nItems can be swapped and dropped on the ground.  This feature is excellent to be honest.\nCo-Op (Single Player) Now you can team up fighting the horde that awaits you!\nBreaking the norm from the previous 3 titles at the time.\nRequires actual thought to play the game.  No hand holding like the negative reviews.\nWesker Mode - Nice to go about murdering everything with an overpowered character!\nLeech Hunter - Skillful minigame to unlock extra goodies.\nAdditional Costumes which the original only had 1 for Billy and Rebecca.\n\nNegatives:\n\nWeakest story in the series.\nInventory system will annoy newcomers but thats what its supposed to do otherwise it wouldnt be fun if it takes less than 2 hours to complete.\nHuge arsenal of weapons\nLurker (Frog) can ruin a no save game near the end!\nHard Mode Final boss can be an absolute bullet sponge if you dont take enough ammo with you which will result you to replay an early save just so you have enough ammo to kill it.\nMediocre final boss.\nExtremely narrow corrodors compared to RE1HDR - Difficult to do a knife run.\nKnife is absolute pants in the game due to character animations - alot of speedrunners complain about this.\nRequires some knowledge of RE franchise as theres alot of spoilers in the game.  Its Reccommended you play this game after completing RE1,2,3.\nTeam AI can be stupid during combat.  Shoots when you fire first. No initative to assist if grabbed.\n\nOverall Capcom did an excellent job optimising this game.  Not perfect but still alot of fun.\n\n8/10","January 22","true","30.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd much rather they had enhanced RE2 and 3 and bring those back isntead.  Regardless, at least RE0 has puzzle solving elements and tries to tell a story as compared to the button-mashing piece of sh!t that RE6 is.\n\nThe HD upgrade looks pretty good for a game originally designed for the Gamecube, and the graphics overall are fine.  The train level looks the best, and I wish that had been longer.  However, the initial levels in the Research Lab are just a convoluted mess in terms of layout and some of the most blah looking textures I've seen in awhile.\n\nFor some reason the game does not seem to flow well on the PC. The partner character is pretty useless in combat unless you are in a room with slow lurching zombies and picking them off from a distance.  Don't expect them to come rushing to your aid if you get caught in a bind.\n\nTime apparently heals all wounds because I forgot how painfully stiff this game is to play.  The keyboard controls suck, Inventory management and character switching sucks, leaving items on the floor instead of using the chests sucks, and the combat feels rather stiff (which, hey, that also sucks too).\n\nSo why am I recommending it?  Play it to understand the backstory before the Mansion events in RE1, but don't expect anything revolutionary in terms of gaming.","January 23","true","5.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One of the beauties of this genre and franchise originally was the highly detailed static environments of the original mansion and subsequent environs. When given the level of time, adding on top of that would seem like a rare success but in this case CAPCOM's team emphasized this perfectly. From the train to the training facility and everything thereafter, the player is inundated with shadowplay, detail and an overall enjoyable atmospheric experience. There are some elements that actually look pixelated such as the fireplace in the training facility off the balcony, but they are so rare that they needn't be mentioned.\n\nThe sound mastery and soundtrack itself are, yet again, another original that was simply touched up and gained greater eminence because of it. The theme to the training facility might be my favorite track from all of the Resident Evils. It encapsulates that feeling of being trapped in a large, eery place with such perfection. You can hear it 100 times and it still retains, if builds upon, it's original quality. And like many of the franchises' best from pre-RE5, the rest of the soundtrack holds a similar quality that helps create the sensory immersion and atmosphere that made the original so great.\n\nGameplay wise, it is just as the original which really means not complicated in the least. Very straightforward, and for some, a little sluggish. But not too much so to where it isn't enjoyable even for those who are used to variations on the modern FPS.\n\nThe negative aspects of the game really only come from a previous memory of the game. For instance, the faces of Rebecca and Billy have been touched up in certain areas and definitely seem different from the game I remember as a kid. Same can be said with the in-menu faces above the item slots. Also, the FMVs during cutscenes do look slightly dated, but not to the point where it detracts from the story or the game itself.\n\n\nWhile I may be a little biased I still give it a solid 8/10 for being shrewdly touched-up version of the original, which supplanted itself in my mind as a child as one of the best horror games ever created.","January 30","true","88.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Since this is my first time playing it, I can't say much about how good the remastering is, but the game looks good, so that's not a problem.\n\nFirstly, the game isn't too bad, there are a lot of returning elements and joys from the old-school Resident Evils with a few new ideas.\nWhat I liked: removing item boxes from the game was a weird move, but it adds to the survival aspect, you can't carry everything around, you must leave items behind and come back for them etc. The only problem with this is that you can only move your items one by one which is very annoying. In that aspect the item box wins. Outside of that the game sometimes nails how a survival horror game should play out and you can have a great time playing it.\nAnd they actually made the alternate controlls feel better than the RE 1 Remaster, I liked that a lot.\n\nNow the bad: The partner system was interesting at the first glance, I'm not against new mechanics, I think RE has proved with RE 4 that a franchise can bring in a lot of stuff in a new game and make something great while staying true to the franchise. But the partner system is one hell of a mess. Let's put it this way: your partner is close to useless. Sometimes you can shoot zombies together and it's working out, but they are too dumb and robotic. It's worse than RE 5 even, but in RE 5 you can at least play in co-op to eliminate the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• AI. The biggest problem: It just can't dodge anything. I mean I don't expect it to do anything when it's cornered, but when it's open space and all it has to do is follow me back in the room to create some space and it still gets grabbed by a zombie it's just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t. When you bring it to a small room with multiple enemies (which isn't too rare) it's useless. I found myself just using it as a pack-horse and not bringing it to any fights.\n\nSo, the partner system is a great failure, the other thing is: enemies. Now don't get me wrong, the enemies are well-designed (except the monkeys, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• those) and the game has good variety. The problem is there are too many of them. Almost every room has at least 2-3 enemies, and with your partner being a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• multiple enemy encounters are a nightmare. I get that they wanted more enemies since you're not alone anymore, but when your other half is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and can't do anything by itself it feels like getting a tumour.\n\nAlso, the main characters have no chemistry between them, and one of them is as complex as making a toast, they were just threw together for the sake of it. Same as RE 5, shame.\n\nThese things together ruin the whole game, they just couldn't make the partner system work, while the game tries to compliment it. I'm honestly surprised this game sits at the same score as RE 1 on Steam, and that the negative reviews are just pummeled to the ground votewise. Overall, you may enjoy this, as it's not the most horrible game, but I can't recommend this.","April 3","false","7.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","2"

The game is set in 1998, hours before Alpha Team (where Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield in the first Resident Evil) reached the Arklay mountains, in this case took control Rebecca Chambers, a rookie in STARS and member of the team Bravo, who is sent to investigate a series of mysterious murders in the suburbs of Raccoon City, during the arrival to the forest the helicopter suffered a breakdown and is forced to an emergency landing, Rebecca and his companions then divide to search track on a fugitive Billy Cohen and the game begins when Rebecca arrives at Heliptic Express, a mysterious train nearby and investigate what happened and get hints of what is happening.\n\nCore of the game: The game mechanics is similar to its version SD, ie have the original controls Gamecube (remapped to new controls such as the Xbox) or other controls pc and alternative controls that are designed to give more dynamic movement (which is a hassle for veterans as our character and the terrible management of cameras can be very annoying during the course of the game), we have the implementation of Widescreen (16: 9) and classic Letterbox (4: 3 ), the basic mechanics remains intact, the game allows us to save a limited amount of time as in the original version (even easy) and we must do in the game determines points for this purpose (using ink ribbon MACHINES write), the handling of the camera is isometric (perspective is on the player in angular format, from above and focus on cinematic angles) which gives an excellent experience for a horror game but quickly becomes annoying when running (eg when you are short bullets and you must escape the zombies). In this case most of the time we control both characters (Billy and Rebecca) by pressing a button and both need to use throughout the game to solve puzzles and fight our way to travez of the different stages of the game.\n\nGraphics: It's really remarkable the upgrade graphics that the game had, with a precedent excellent as was playing Resident Evil 1 HD, the textures, shadows, lighting effects, particles etc, was enhanced to a much definitido appearance and lived to play, while maintaining its constant 60 fps (with option for 30 pc's oldest) always bringing the same game with a much more clear and warm to the eye, this question receives a 10/10 game on my part, they knew polish the details, keep the fps and play compatibility while maintaining the fps. The video options are few but enough to play the game at the highest quality, auque older computers have the option of receiving something a bit smaller for not sacrificing performance.\n\nConclusion: Despite having played this game on GameCube in his time, I have finished and I have enjoyed it a lot, the Steam version brings a refreshing touch to the sequel that deviated from the path after RE 6 opting for action and leaving side roots of the genre, RE 0 recalls those early games of the franchise were so funny and made us more frightening when we were kids, in my experience I had high expectations for this game were met and was very pleased with what Capcom did I hope to continue making games like this.\n\nPros:\n\nCharacter level detail is better than before, both Rebecca and Billy look better\nLots of story to uncover, which gives further insight into the minds of Umbrella‚Äôs execs\nPuzzles are fun (but haven‚Äôt changed), and switching between both characters to solve them feels natural as opposed to a ‚Äújust because‚Äù mechanic\nMusic is fantastic and sets the mood perfectly\nRemapped controlls\nEnhanced Visuals\nSupport for 4k resolutions (going further than 1080p cropple the game tho)\nThe story, while not the greatest, is still entertaining\nDynamic Lights and background\nWesker Mode\n\nCons\n\nNothing has changed gameplay wise; if you beat this on GameCube way back, you‚Äôll know exactly what to do\nCutscenes appear to be original, and therefore look very low-def compared to the in-game scenes\nNot much replaybility, unless you‚Äôre looking to catch up on achievements you‚Äôve missed\nMicro management is more prevalent, as item boxes are no longer a thing\n\nMetascore: 82/100 - is the issue of the DLC, I do not like at all to change the classical with exclusive pre-purchase (Artwork and Soundtrack) for 2.99 DLC that could buy later with other skins that are also for sale individually.","January 19","true","28.6"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitSkreig/recommended/339340/","bitSkreig","bitSkreig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bitSkreig/","149 products in account","This one is tricky.\n\nAs Zero is not my favorite [old] RE game, that will forever fall on RE2, I find myself loving and then ... not so much at times. I haven't played this particular game since 2003 or so, so the old RE play style takes some getting used to again. It's survival horror / puzzle / jump scare / etc and thats what made me love the older RE titles. That is intact, and upgraded, and the modern control scheme makes on hell of a difference. Though all of the old gripes are still there. As an 'HD Remaster' it looks fatastic, even if the cut sceens are just upscaled versions of the original, the game itself is pretty as pie. It doesnt feel like a cheap reskin like a lot of other 'HD' re-releases.\n\nBeing that most of the puzzles after the first 10 minutes require you to switch back and forth between the two main characters, is not only frustrating at times, but utimately begs for a mutiplayer / co-op mechanic. There is none, there never was. Thankfully there is no real need for partner AI, other than 'Don't waste all the damn ammo' which you have control over. Another annoying, though expected of the series, some of the puzzles are not nearly as self explainitory as you would think. Sometimes they require you to be literally in two places at once, and after learning that you have to backtrack a character.\n\nThe inventory in this particular game, is well, horid. You have 6 slots for each character, 12 in total, and at minimum 2 from each are for a weapon, and applicable ammo. To say nothing of health items and puzzle items, which you will be endlessly juggling back and forth when you absolutely need all of the things, then backtrack to pick up whatever you had to leave behind. Old gripe, but could have used some tweaking.\n\nTechnically speaking, the game need a little work. My machine meets / exceeds the recommended specs, and there are some sections, mainly around smokey / foggy areas, where it slows to a crawl. I dropped the resoltion to 1280, and the visuals to medium to compensate. Which still looks good, but is NOT why I re-bought a game that I owned over a decade ago.\n\nAll things considered, I still favor this entry to the series over literally ANY of the later games, as they have long forgotten there survival-horror roots, which is ltteraly the only reason I liked the older games to begin with. Omg ... 5 was f**king terrible. I am happy that they are making a return in these 'Remake' versions, and I look forward to playing RE1:HD after I complete this one. And RE2:HD if it's not just a rumor (fingers crossed).\n\nIf your an old fan of the series, I'd say buy it. Even if it isn't as great as the others, it's still a solid pass. If you like the later, more 'action-y' entries, this probably isn't for you.","January 19","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also Leech Hunter. I love them!\n- Many types of new enemies like infected Frogs or apes\n- Many variety of zomies: not like in RE1 (different skins)\n- Auto aiming on HARD difficulty (RE1 didn't had this feature)\n\nThe bad:\n- Mimicrys are a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. More in HARD difficulty. So u must avoid them\n- For me (for me) the enemies are to much OP on HARD.

I honestly didnt think parts of the story when your characters have to separate would become my favorite.\n\nBossesBoss fights in RE franchise are usually very thrilling and although quite simple for a player to figure out require at least some basic strategy to beat.Here they are only bullet sponges and not very good ones.You should check out the centipede one,that was hillarious!\n\nThere are a couple of other things that a person unfamiliar with the franchise might find bad like cheesy dialogues (they might have taken it to a whole new level this time but it might be just me) and a plot that makes you feel like you were forced to watch a bad anime that you never otherwise would, but nobody actually expects much in those departaments in RE series anymore so i'll let it slide.\n\nGraphics look good but i dont think they picked the right style for a survival horror game with all the anime-ish flair that characters have.That being said the game lacks in the horror departament.\n\n4/10 : buy it only if you feel like you must play every RE game!\nPS : who f*ucking names one of the main characters Billy?","May 4","false","16.4"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","0"

First of all: Resident Evil HD Remaster was the first time I played the first Resident Evil game, and I was never a huge fan of the new ones, but I liked RE4, RE5 and Revelations 2. Resident Evil HD Remaster is a masterpiece if you ask me, so why don't I recommend RE Zero? Because they made TONS of MORONIC decisions.\nFirst the puzzles. In RE1 the puzzles were unrealistic, but they made sense, you understood them and they fit the setting. In RE Zero the puzzles feel completely random, don't make any sense. It's like every time one of the developer said "we need a puzzle here" someone else took out his puzzlebook and just chose a random puzzle out of that.\nThen whos ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing idea was to have 2 playable characters? Not only are both characters extremely boring, bland, and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing cliche times 100, it also makes the gameplay extremely annoying. Inventory can be annoying in RE1, but it was fine. In RE Zero you have to manage two inventories now with the extremely clonky menus and long animations inbetween every action you do. And in gun fights your AI partner is a complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, which means you have to sometimes control both characters at the same time which can become really frustrating. Also if you don't pay attention for a second, your AI partner could waste your precious ammo for totally unneccessary reason.\nOne of the great things about RE1 was that combat wasn't a big challenge, it was always a decision if you want to do combat or try to dodge enemies, both approaches had benefits. In RE Zero you can't do that because of your AI partner, you have to kill almost every enemy you see. As you can see from my playtime, I didn't play for too long though, so maybe later in the game the level design gets better.\nAnother huge problem is that there are no item crates anymore, so you have to drop items on the floor and backtrack to pick them up again. Especially painful with the ink ribbons, which you have to always drop at the save point, next time drop another item to have space, pick the ink ribbon up, save, drop the ink ribbon, pick up the other dropped item.\nThis was also a bit of a problem in RE1, but this whole process was much faster with item crates and because of that it wasn't so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing annoying. Every time you pick up an item there is a small animation and the game asks you if you want to pick it up first. Opening inventory and closing it always has a small delays, lots of small things like that make it extremely annoying.\n\nRE1 is a 9.5/10 for me, I ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing love it. But this game is just annoying and a waste of time.","February 17","false","2.5"," 11 of 36 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","11","36","0","0"

I cannot, however, endorse this port. The very little I've played of it has given me a headache. Yeah, it's pretty, and it's got a whole new control option, but the new option actually manages to be worse than the classic controls. Yeah, you can turn around and move a bitfaster and don't have to continually hold down a run button, which occasionally comes in handy, but moving in a straight line is awkward and when the camera shifts it completely screws up your orientation. You also automatically go through doors, whether you want to or not. So you could be running down a hallway and then go through a door without wanting to, so you have to watch that crappy door cutscene, and then watch it again to go back to the area where you originally were. They use the same thing for stairs. I know, it was in the original, but they managed to take out the stairway cutscenes for REmake HD, so why couldn't they do it here? Also, aside from RE4, RE0 is among the weakest of all RE games. The story makes little to no sense (and that's saying something for a Resident Evil game) and despite a release date of 2002, it plays like it was released in 1996.","January 22","false","0.6"," 13 of 56 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","13","56","0","5"

I was expecting this "HD REMASTER" to be a proper PC port, with decent mouse controls. Instead it lovingly recreates the old console controller experience. Playing this with the keyboard is awkward at best.\n\nThe slavishness of the console port is obvious at every turn, from it constantly reminding you not to turn off your computer while it's saving (as if people do that), to the clunky menu interactions. You can use the mouse for most things, but sometimes you can't, just to keep things nicely inconsistent.\n\nAlso recreated are the pointlessly long scene intercuts,  sluggish transition to and from character inventory and so on.,. I love to spend my time watching a door on a black background, just like it was 1997, back when some rubbish Capcom programmer found a way to pull data off the Playstation CD so ineptly that you could fill the entire console's RAM off the disc ten times over in the time they spent loading one backdrop. Why recreate a defect of an antique console on a modern PC with a perfectly good hard-drive? It's not cute, it's absurd. It's not suspenseful, it's boring.\n\nThe worst thing of all is the inability to stop playing the game whenever I want, without losing progress.\n\nThe lack of an ability to quit out and then simply resume at will is unacceptable in this era. Sure, the ribbons should still control actual saves (ability to reload after death or at will) but not being able to stop when I want and resume when I want just don't fit with the time I have to devote to this game.\n\nThe graphics are spruced up nicely, but this only highlights the archaic gameplay. Compared to the Wii port of RE4, which did a lot to make the controls enjoyable, this is awful. The only reason to play it is nostalgia.","January 28","false","2.4"," 6 of 40 people (15%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","15","6","40","3","0"

That probably goes without saying if you've seen any screenshots... But this game wasn't nearly as popular as the remake of the first one for a reason; It kinda sucks. Why? Because of quite a large number of reasons, but mainly because you have to control/take care of 2 characters at once. Sound familiar?\n\nIn Resi Evil 5, it was pretty damn irritating. Sheva was an annoying dork that ran zigzags when she just had to run a straight line (JUST GIMME THAT F*CKING ROCKET ALREADY! WHESKER IS SO UP IN MAH GRILL!). However, after playing this, I realise how far things had advanced since this installment. Not only is their a factor of micro-management (While not being so bad in some games, is a pain in this one), but you have to also look out for this other character & even solve puzzles with them seperately. The existence of this part of the game... No. The concept of it is a good thing & an inventive approach. But when Capcom puts in into practice?... Oh-hohohoooo get ready for a bad time. It doesn't work. If some people have gotten used to this approach, good for you. I'm not you.\n\nSo there's a whole bunch of other things to mention (Over the top baddie straight out of an anime, The whole 'Why hasn't this other character appeared in anything else?' problem & a few other things), here's the run down; If you played this on Gamecube & enjoyed it, you'll love it on here. It looks hella shiny. But as a point for being introduced to the older games of this series? Oh hell no. Go with the HD remake of the first. Some might hold this one in high regard, but for me it just served as a reminder for why I didn't enjoy it to begin with, only in higher resolution. Avoid if you're a newcomer/looking to see how it used to be done.\n\nOh & uhm... ¬£8 for a costume? Are you f*cking kidding me, Capcom?\n\nEDIT: Any further comments along the lines of "Waaaaah leave Capcom alooooone!" will be deleted. Simple as that.

Originally when this was released on the crapcube it had poor sales and the game didnt get good reviews back then. It promised answers to previous resident evil games yet instead left people more confused than anything else. The train section at the start of the game was amazingly well done yet the minute you leave that train the game starts to become boring and a fetch-this-fetch-that mission.\n\nPlaying this game is kind of like whats happened to the resident evil games themselves - you see it slowly dying in front of you and becoming what it is today........RE6................. - let me explain better - RE0is perhaps the last RE game which was made by its creator Shinji were he had full control over his own creation. RE4 this was taken away from him and we ended up shooting mexicans (As how most americans described them) as the blonde haired last action hero leon....who now works for the president....in the secert service......when originally in RE2 he was a rookie cop who hadnt even started his first proper shift yet......\n\nAfter this Re5 came along........steroid fulled chris in africa shooting blacks............without any explaination from crapcom as to WTF they were thinking. Many people just think this was a scumbag move by crapcom to SHOCK people into noticing the game and buying it. Shinji didnt really have any control in this game and it seriously shows. Weskers character basically goes out like a B----h with perhaps the most stupid plot since the simpsons movie\n\nThe RE6 comes along............and then thanks to RE6 we look at RE0 which didnt sell well and we now call that a masterpiece even when the game hasnt aged well and is still the same game from 15+ years ago which got low scores even then.\n\nHeres the problems with the game itself\n1) extremely poor aim - its almost none exsistent - i understand this for a game back then but by todays standards the lack of actual aiming control is awful. Its basically no better than the terrible controls of the original silent hill game\n2) The characters appearance - TOO asian with too many asian stereotypes. Yes this was done by crapcom japan but the characters are meant to be western and speak english....yet rebecca looks chinese.....you then have a stereotype asain bad guy with long anime/manga hair  and a long coat/cape (think One Piece) you then have billy whos mouth looks as if he is sucking on a lemon while rubbing salt on his tounge.\n3) The controls - really really bad controls...........really bad........... ffs crapcom why no option to map the buttons to what we want them to be?\n4) Day 1 DLC - nice crapcom nice......over priced stupid costumes for day 1 dlc - is this the new street fighter 4?\n5) Graphics - crapcom CLAIM this is a remaster and that they spent hours taking stuff and remaking it to make the game more beautiful..............so why is everything in low-res? the characters are not even 1k are they?? ladders/doors/objects are perhaps the most low-res textures i have seen in over 5 years and yet crapcom claim they remade everything\n\nI was not expecting something amazing as i had originally played this game when it originally came out on the crapcube and knew it to be something of a disapointment. Yet after the utter mess that was RE6 i was expecting this to be like watching an old moie i love like Aliens/Predator were i would go through it all again and love it and remember how happy i was when i was younger............instead its made me realise just how far we have come gaming wise today. RE6 may have a crap story mode but No Mercy mode will last me much MUCH longer than RE0 will and i will enjoy that much more than this\n\nI can ONLY and i mean ONLY recommend this IF your paying no less than ¬£8 for it.\nSteams current asking price is a middle finger to the customer and these days steam seems to like giving its customers the middle finger (thanks for those ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• poor steam sales at xmas)  so dont buy this game unless your getting it for ¬£8 or under. There is nothing to make you want to replay the game completed.............oh wow.....wesker mode.............re rev2 wesker model but using billys mesh.......and emo rebecca with red eyes.........plz replay whole story again......\n\nI keep wondering if there s going to be an ULTIMATE-super-hyper-mega-special edition of this in afew months time with an asking price of ¬£39.99 and its basically the same game again but with the crappy costume dlc included and 1 new gun.

It had mixed reviews and fans didnt like it that much. The "RE formula" already had become repetitive and boring, and the co-op simply didnt work. This game was the mayor reason to change the formula to a more action centred gameplay in RE4.\n\nThe Port: Unlike REmake HD, ALL the backgrounds had the HD treatment. But the good things ends there. RE0 HD has exactly the same problem REmake HD had; the backgrounds are locked at 1440p, so the game runs in slowmotion unless you have the recomended requeriments. Capcom NEVER fixed this issue in REmake, and fans had to do it with a 500kb patch. For some reason, the new controls are taken from RE6, so to aim you need to hold the left trigger, and shoot with the right trigger, unlike the rest of the series (except RE6) where you hold the right trigger to aim, and pres A or X to shoot. And now X is the menu option, and not the dash button. What was the point of this? The characters faces were remade, that might sound good, but now Billy and Rebecca look like they had a bad case of botox. This is really annoying with Rebecca, a character that is suppoused to be really "kawai", and now looks like 2016 Meg Ryan. And finally, all the extra costumes that Capcom teased in these months, and that were FREE in REmade HD, are paid DLC. So, if you wanna have the full game, you need to pay $30 dollars. This price is an insult considering this is a port of a not so good 14 years old game.\n\nTo sum it up, I cant recomend this game until they fix the slow-mo issue, and not for $30 bucks.","January 19","false","19.0"," 37 of 174 people (21%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","21","37","174","5","23"

It's gorgeous and I ran into 0 (ha) problems. Seriously when does that ever happen (looking at you Silent Hill collection...)\n+ Fixed camera means they can frame it just right and make it look great constantly. I'm ok with moving to free roam cameras but damn these had great use back in the day.\n+ Guns have good feel\n+ Ammo and meds definitely make you feel like you have to watch how you play. It's great playing an actual survival horror again.\n+ Fun costumes and a Wesker mode I never knew I needed\n+ Billy is surprisingly not annoying. Of all the new characters he's one of the better and more memorable. Good Clint Eastwood visage.\n.............................................................................\n~ the partner zapping system and subsequently the new item management system is not great. The six slots per character might have been a bit more tolerable if some of the more powerful weapons didn't take up two slots. Moreso throwing crap on the ground. Wow that's bad. I had to do so much backtracking to gather some things up, especially right before the final boss fights which required me to backtrack the entire way and return. No idea why they swapped it for the item box system. Good try doing something new I guess but it was pretty dang bad.\n.............................................................................\n\nI had a lot of fun with this. As a remaster they nailed the game. It's kind of sad to see the survival horror line of Resident Evils but I'm hoping they can incorporate all the good changes that 4 and so brought into a proper RE survival game. Revelations 2 was an ok starting point but woof well maybe not sentence it to a budget title would help.","March 15","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though for my personal liking I enjoyed the story, a S.T.A.R.S Member and a Convict forced to work together to survive, and on their journey they become closer...become good friends that watch each other backs.\n\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of Resident Evil 1 Remaster/Hd Remaster aswell. Though this time you get the chance to have a partner in your journey, and you are able to swap between both characters to be able to control both when desired. It can become a hassle handling two characters at times, but once you get the hang of it you will be okay. The game is not as challenging as Resident Evil 1, as Puzzles and your journey aren't that difficult, you will probably know where to go next by easily accessing the map and discovering doors you have unlocked.\n\nThere are new enemies within Resident Evil 0, and some reacurring ones also. Some new creatures being the "Zombie Monkeys" (Which by the way are a big pain in the rear), Plague Crawlers, Lurkers & some reacurring creatures such as Hunters, there are also new enemy bosses of course.\n\nAs strange as it sounds, the inventory system at times can be a hassle with two characters. Having to split up ammo, choose weapons and constantly swapping items is something that you are going to do. But thankfully this game provides a "leave" option where you can drop an item and it will stay on the floor and you can come back to it later (The Map also indicates items you have left behind).\n\nSave yourself the trouble, leave your A.I (Not Controlled) partner behind. You have the option to tell them to stay put and you can head out on your own to explore, as having the A.I come with you can be a burden as they will probably get hurt and waste ammo (If not Idle), I would recommend to only set your A.I Partner to "Attack" when in a Boss Fight if you are both together.\n\nBoth Rebecca & Billy have their own perks, Rebecca having less health but the ability to combine herbs, and Billy the tank who has alot more health than Rebecca, Billiy cannot combine herbs on his own which forces you to get Rebecca to do all the herb work if you want extra health and  than passing it over to Billy of course, and choosing Billy for fighting tough enemies to be able to handle the punch.\n\nOverall the game is enjoyable and was quite Nastolgic (For Me). It was entertaining playing Resident Evil 0 again, and new comers will probably enjoy it too.\n\nIn the end I would Recommend Resident Evil 0 HD, It is enjoyable, has a decent story, entertaining gameplay and has further playibility if you like to unlock more items.\n\nA must have for any Resident Evil fan.","February 5","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a RE fan, I'm glad there's some RE to play; but there's nothing outstanding here. It does look great in HD and 60fps. The background remains at 30 fps though.\n\nThe two party system makes for some new puzzle solutions but introduces a bigger problem. The item boxes have been removed while enabling to leave items in the environment. Once a room is "Full" it gets very frustrating to manage your items. Having the item boxes would've been nice. The companion AI is good for trash zombies; but with specials/bosses it's terrible.\n\nRE0 dropped the ball by not including some gameplay in the RE1 mansion. Experiencing the Mansion as Bravo team would've been great. I never finished this on GC, and always hoped that there was some gameplay in the Mansion. Experiencing how everyone got into trouble before Alpha arrived would've been fresh. But we get Billy "Cool Guy Leon" Coen and the lamest antagonist ever. Why does he need to wear a white robe? All these events take place in some copy paste mansion that doesn't come close to the old Mansion, RCPD, or RC. The game ends with no new insight to the RE lore. New  to RE? Skip and go play RE1 HD. Veteran? Play for some filler action till RE2 HD.","February 4","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Riding the coattails of REmake in 2002, this title should have been just as amazing but is hampered by poor design choices and a lame story (even by RE standards). The classic gameplay is there, but there is too much item management and backtracking that tarnishes the experience. Recommended ONLY for those who played RE1-RE2-RE3-RECV-REmake and are looking for more classic gameplay. Those who are new to the series and looking for a place to start should go straight to REmake or RE2.\n\nREmaster 0 thoughts:\nThe game is GORGEOUS. The pre-rendered backgrounds look amazing and the 3D models look pretty nice too. The REmake Remaster looked a little half-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in spots due to Capcom not having several of the original assets available. I guess this wasn't the case for RE0, because everything looks like it was upscaled from original assets and looks brilliant.

This game..\n\nIt certainly needs no introduction, everyone knows the resident evil saga, and the most appreciate its early titles more than the last ones. I honestly like both (my most played game on steam is RE: Revelations 2 and I played... a lot of RE: Revelations not on steam) for different reason.\n\nI really liked this Resident Evil 0 a lot, I don't care if it's a remastered version of an old game (that's one of the reason i bought it, since i've never had a Gamecube, like most of the people i guess).\nThe thing about this game, or the first RE, is that is difficoult.. very very difficoult, but not like Dark Souls; it is difficoult in a better way (i like Dark Souls too btw). There are no monster that oneshots you and you can't die by falling from somewhere high, the reason this game is difficoult are the same of some other RE games: you are a human (which means that you actually die pretty fast if a zombie eats your face), there's an extremely lack of ammo of any type and the puzzles are great.\n\nSo why this game is so good? Because it's extremely challenging, which means that when you succeed in doing something, like finish a puzzle, or go through a zone with a lot of enemy without using any bullet, you feel litteraly amazing! This game gives you a sense of satisfaction like I've rarely seen in other games. I've litteraly found myself cheering after beating a boss or something like that.\n\nBy saying this I'm also saying that this game is extremely immersive, I really felt thrilled for almost the entire duration of the game, and this is just awesome, and i also think that this helps a lot since it's a survival horror game.\nIn my opinion a good survival horror needs to be this way, it needs to keep you attached to the monitor, it needs to scare you without jumpscare, and this is important. This game scares you, without any jumpscare, but thanks to the atmosphere, the settings, the music and the sounds in general. Everything is exactly where it's supposed to be.\n\nAnd last but not the least, it's a RE game.. so even the files and the documents you find during the game are very interesting for the sake of the entire RE history, especially if , like me, you've never played RE zero before.\n\nSo probably the fact that I'm a huge fan of the saga helped me a lot enjoying this game, but still I think it's a great game, which everyone who like a genuine survival horror should definetely try out.\n","February 9","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atisz2/recommended/339340/","atisz2","Atisz2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atisz2/","53 products in account","When I heard Capcom is going to release Resident Evil 0, I immediately knew this game is going to be a must have for me, because - among many other things - I always wanted to know and experience what happened before the original Resident Evil. Since I've never owned a video game console, I envied those who had the opportunity to play amazing titles that were exclusive to consoles, such as Dead Space 2: Severed, Drakan: The Ancients' Gates and Condemned 2. And of course Resident Evil 0.\n\nAfter playing it through, I can now understand what an experience it must have been for those who had a Gamecube (the original console it came out to first in 2002) back then. In 2016 it still is incredibly enjoyable. Everything is in place: spooky atmosphere, beautiful underground locations, logical, but sometimes unrealistic puzzles, naive but loveable characters, the herbs, and everything the Resident Evil series is known of.\n\nThe game follows the old school Resident Evil scheme from RE 1, 2 and 3. That being said, there are semi-fixed camera positions (there are locations where it follows the character) from a perspective of a monster, which adds to the horror sensation (introduced by the great Alone in the Dark from 1992) and console based controls (good advice: if you want to enjoy the game, get a controller and make sure it's heavy).\n\nThe protagonist of the game is Rebecca Chambers, a young medical officer, the girl trapped in one of the rooms from the original Resident Evil. I dare to say she is one of the most loveable characters in gaming history, even though she is a pretty standard Japanese-made female character. Her naiveness and surprised looks can charm even female gamers who would otherwise find her irritating. Not long after the beginning she is joined by an ex-marine, Billy, who had apparently been sentenced to death for murder. After a thrilling zombie infested train ride, the duo begins to investigate an abandoned facility (very similar to the manor from Resident Evil) and of course to escape with their lives.\n\nThe story as far as the Resident Evil series go, is very good and we can finally discover how it all started: who was the creator of the T-virus, what species it was tested on originally, how did famous characters, such as Wesker come into play and so on. We get a pretty detailed background in Resident Evil lore.\n\nThe greatest improvement of the game is the partner system. Almost through the entire game the player gets to control both Rebecca and Billy. Of course only one at a time, but switching between the two is almost immediate. Switching and using them separately is sometimes vital for solving puzzles (pushing two buttons at the same time, etc.). In combat having a partner is also useful, even though in some places it is advised to leave the other one behind, because having two characters also means taking double damage. The attributes of Rebecca and Billy are also different (altough only slightly): Rebecca can mix things (in the other RE games everyone was capable of doing this) and can fit into smaller places, while Billy takes less damage from attacks and can push heavier objects (the latter is used only once throughout the entire game).\nThe other thing to point out is that you can leave things anywhere (ther are no chests as in RE 1-3), which is a good and a bad thing. Good because with the very limited inventory you can't carry much and you can leave stuff whereever you want to, but it also means that you can't access it later from a storage chest and all you can do is backtrack (even though the items appear on the map). There are also things you have to keep for a long time, the hookshot for example, a tool that takes up 1/3 of your inventory space (you should only throw it away when you find the Magnum in the tram).\n\nThe creators came up with quite a lot of new enemies, the leeches above all. As seen in the intro, these little infected creatures are going to stir up a lot of trouble. Besides the good old RE enemies (zombie dobermans, hunters, crows) there are plenty or arch enemies as well, that are all creative enough, but I still liked the ones from the original better. In point of weapons the only new thing here is the molotov cocktail (Billy can also mix this) made of gasoline and empty bottles (so if you find any, mix them immediately) and it's useful against a certain type of enemy (one that is very hard to kill otherwise ;)).\n\nGraphically the game is astonishing. The contrast between the 3d character models and the background is gone, the pin-sharp textures are good to look at and the realistic lighting and shadows also work well. The environment in the train segment is stunning. Rebecca's character is also beautiful, but this can't be said about the others, in Billy's case it looks a bit dated, but overall the characters are well animated, lively and their movement is fluid as it can be.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614339403\n\nI can also praise the sound effects and the tunes, which are both great and add their shares to the atmosphere. Some old sound effects are also known from previous RE games (door creaking, footsteps on metal stairs) which successfully add some nostalgia. The dialogues are a bit childish and may appear they were taken straight out of a B-movie, but hey, it's Japanese after all and still, they are much better than your ordinary RE lines ("That was too close, you were almost a Jill sandwich!" :P)\n\nResident Evil 0 HD REMASTER is a perfect prelude to the original Resident Evil and to the whole series. Also it's a perfect example how a remastered version or a remake should be made. It's beautiful and successfully meets today's standards without giving up the nostalgia and the gameplay elements of the original Resident Evil that made the series memorable.\nIf you are a Resident Evil fan, this game is essential. If you've never heard of Resident Evil before, try it, because this is how it all started.\n\nPROS\n+ rich, high detailed environments\n+ excellent RE atmosphere\n+ Rebecca is a lovely character\n+ good jumpscares\n+ partner system\n\nCONS\n- trial and error inventory management = backtracking\n- Wesker mode is disappointing\n- get a controller\n\nRATING\n8.5/10","February 9","true","55.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Burdo/recommended/339340/","Burdo","Roberto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Burdo/","175 products in account","Time to Review Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster...\n\nResident Evil HD Remaster is the Remaster of the Original Gamecube version, having beaten the original and being a Resident Evil Fan I enjoyed coming back and playing as Rebecca & Billy, onto the review!.\n\nThis game is a prequel to Resident Evil 1, following the events of Rebecca Chambers & Billy Coen as they struggle to fight and survive the Run-away train & Spencer Mansion, I won't be getting into the story much. Though for my personal liking I enjoyed the story, a S.T.A.R.S Member and a Convict forced to work together to survive, and on their journey they become closer...become good friends that watch each other backs.\n\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of Resident Evil 1 Remaster/Hd Remaster aswell. Though this time you get the chance to have a partner in your journey, and you are able to swap between both characters to be able to control both when desired. It can become a hassle handling two characters at times, but once you get the hang of it you will be okay. The game is not as challenging as Resident Evil 1, as Puzzles and your journey aren't that difficult, you will probably know where to go next by easily accessing the map and discovering doors you have unlocked.\n\nThere are new enemies within Resident Evil 0, and some reacurring ones also. Some new creatures being the "Zombie Monkeys" (Which by the way are a big pain in the rear), Plague Crawlers, Lurkers & some reacurring creatures such as Hunters, there are also new enemy bosses of course.\n\nAs strange as it sounds, the inventory system at times can be a hassle with two characters. Having to split up ammo, choose weapons and constantly swapping items is something that you are going to do. But thankfully this game provides a "leave" option where you can drop an item and it will stay on the floor and you can come back to it later (The Map also indicates items you have left behind).\n\nSave yourself the trouble, leave your A.I (Not Controlled) partner behind. You have the option to tell them to stay put and you can head out on your own to explore, as having the A.I come with you can be a burden as they will probably get hurt and waste ammo (If not Idle), I would recommend to only set your A.I Partner to "Attack" when in a Boss Fight if you are both together.\n\nBoth Rebecca & Billy have their own perks, Rebecca having less health but the ability to combine herbs, and Billy the tank who has alot more health than Rebecca, Billiy cannot combine herbs on his own which forces you to get Rebecca to do all the herb work if you want extra health and  than passing it over to Billy of course, and choosing Billy for fighting tough enemies to be able to handle the punch.\n\nOverall the game is enjoyable and was quite Nastolgic (For Me). It was entertaining playing Resident Evil 0 again, and new comers will probably enjoy it too.\n\nIn the end I would Recommend Resident Evil 0 HD, It is enjoyable, has a decent story, entertaining gameplay and has further playibility if you like to unlock more items.\n\nA must have for any Resident Evil fan.","February 5","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are a little weird to get used to but with keyboard or controller its not too bad after playing for a little bit. Game overall seems to be optimized well enough with the same wide arrange of graphic options.\n\n2) This game is kinda tough to put an opinionated view of its integrity to the Resident Evil series. To anyone that loved the old RE1 RE2 RE3 Nemesis games then this one is definitely for you, it has the same camera angles and somewhat indirect targeting system that the old problem solving RE games we're made popular for so definitely grab this and the Resident Evil 1 Remastered. Although Resident Evil 0 holds true to its classic RE game style the story line to it is kinda off, i mean Rebecca is in the right place at the right time but when most of the classic RE fans remember playing RE1 on playstation they recall a weak, scared, rookie Rebecca Chambers from Chris's story, so when RE0 came out everyone though to themselves how the F is this chick that kicks @$$ with Billy the same Rebecca that never used a fire arm in RE1 ? so it kinda poked holes in the original mansion storyline as well as where did she find the time to do all the stuff in RE0 and regroup with the rest of her S.T.A.R.S team to proceed in the mansion?\n\n-All in all id personally have to say that this game may be a little lacking in the relation to the original Resident Evil storys but its still got that good old RE gameplay so its a must get for any original RE fan, or anyone looking for a slow paced, thought out and dramatic horror game with a dash of action thrown in.","January 24","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a RE fan, I'm glad there's some RE to play; but there's nothing outstanding here. It does look great in HD and 60fps. The background remains at 30 fps though.\n\nThe two party system makes for some new puzzle solutions but introduces a bigger problem. The item boxes have been removed while enabling to leave items in the environment. Once a room is "Full" it gets very frustrating to manage your items. Having the item boxes would've been nice. The companion AI is good for trash zombies; but with specials/bosses it's terrible.\n\nRE0 dropped the ball by not including some gameplay in the RE1 mansion. Experiencing the Mansion as Bravo team would've been great. I never finished this on GC, and always hoped that there was some gameplay in the Mansion. Experiencing how everyone got into trouble before Alpha arrived would've been fresh. But we get Billy "Cool Guy Leon" Coen and the lamest antagonist ever. Why does he need to wear a white robe? All these events take place in some copy paste mansion that doesn't come close to the old Mansion, RCPD, or RC. The game ends with no new insight to the RE lore. New  to RE? Skip and go play RE1 HD.

But, I sure am having a hard way of things with this remaster. Even though I more than meet the recommended specs, I am getting very very poor FPS. I understand that this is happening for a minority of players and hopefully a fix will come soon. Right now Im getting a frustrating 15 FPS during normal play but if there are any burning enemies on screen this drops to about 5 FPS. The audio/video during cut scenes are completely out of sync. The only spot in the game where I am getting a solid 60 FPS is the opening scene.\n\nAgain, this really is a good game and the problems I'm running into seem to happen to only a small percentage of players. I'm going to recommend it because most people will be able to play it fine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/339340/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","One of the weakest of the best is still good, right? Resident Evil 0 is a rather mediocre entry among the absolute best classic Resident Evil titles, which means, it's still way above a lot of classic survival horror wannabes. And in its HD Remake version the game got better. Not just visually, like it mostly was with REmaster (not like it was a bad thing, mind you) - RE0 HD is actually more fun to play than the original GC (and later Wii) release.\n\nResident Evil 0 itself is a game with a long history of development. Prequel idea started being R&D'ed before RE1 was even released, game was finally shown in some playable state on N64 in 2000, but it seems like a lot of post-train story and gameplay was still not 100% set. After that the development was completely restarted for GC alongside REmake with slight story adjustments for both for continuity. And I think for a lot of people the concept of the "Resident Evil on a train" was something that stuck with them - it sounded interesting and new. And it actually is. Sadly, the Train is only about 1/5 of the entire game.\n\nThe game has a lot of intersting concepts - two playable characters at once, change from item boxes to "put item on the ground anywhere", a bit more emphasis on unique abilities of playable characters - something RE1 introduced and since hasn't really been used again in the series. But it's the implementation that makes it all go average instead of great. Playing as two characters is not as fun as it could be, item management is more forced and boring and unique abilities of characters apart from gameplay differences (Billy deals with recoil better and gets hurt less), are very rarely used despite the possibilities. Even the ideas from other games in the series up to that point, are either unused or underused - zombies travel across rooms only once, Crimson Heads are not here, there's no dodging or self-defence items, no creepy pursuing enemies (just an annoying, but often easily skippable, leech-monster), no real scenario variety.\n\nBut the main downer is the levels and the overall feel of the game. Story is all over the place, never sticking to any particular tone, with jRPG fabulous-looking evil guy being the main bad, game opening with documentary style narration (but never going back to it), character suddenly referencing the future (because it's prequel, you see?). And yes, it's storytelling in Resident Evil, who cares, right? Well, thing is - no matter how silly a lot of RE stories went, they usually did it with style and in a memorable cool way. RE0 is just "eh, it happened, I guess". And the levels are just... boring. So are the bosses. They all feel like a collection of discarded classic RE ideas put together in one game. It also cannot really choose between the more colorful and stylish look of classic PS1-era REs and the "creepy old" look of REmake, something that was improved a lot in the HD Remaster (original was very gray/yellow-ish), but still feels not as good as other games.\n\nBut HD Remaster fixes not just visual issues and makes the game look very good. In addition, it adds several welcome changes in the controls (realtime reload button is a cool thing), most notable of which is the alternative control scheme. Now it was also present in REmaster, however REmake worked perfectly fine with classic tank controls - all the animations felt right, moving and shooting and evading was fun to master and use. In RE0 original tank controls have a slight delay due to additional animation frames for a lot of actions which are simply removed in alt. control scheme, making it a much better option, especially when controlling the partner character, even despite few places, where camera changes to screw up your movement. In addition to that, game also gets a silly and fun to play Wesker mode, where Billy is changed into RE5-style Wesker, who can run at super speed and explode enemies with his aura at will. It's a ridiculous mode, that gets even sillier when you complete it once, as sadly there is no Wesker Leech Hunter, but all the rewards in the game are just unlocked for the second playthrough. It's funny, it's fun, it's a nice way to relax after Leech Hunter or hard mode playthrough, and it's always fun to explode zombie heads with your thoughts.\n\nSo, is it a good game to get? Well, if you like classic survival horror and this is the game you've missed before - definitely. If you're a fan of RE series - yep. If you want to get into classic survival horrors - only after you try out better options. REmaster is a better option, but I would've suggested checking RE Director's Cut (just not dual shock ver., if you value your ears), 2 and 3 as well, if possible. And same goes for people who are just checking this out without knowledge of the genre and the series - this is a rather good way, but there are better options to start with.","January 22","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's unbelievable, how nice it looks and how good it holds up.\n\nThis game is super solid, practically flawless.\n\nOne thing that bugs me about other "oldschool" RE titles is that your items conveniently teleport from one box to another, this is gone here, there are no boxes, if you drop an item it remains there until you pick it up again, and fortunately almost always there's a way to get back to where you dropped it, so well designed.\n\nThe teamwork aspect of the game is GREAT, so well implemented in puzzles, exploration and combat, the non selected character will never feel a burden, he/she will be helpful during combat saving your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• more than once.\n\nThe cutscenes look amazing and are very well placed.\n\nIt has new features compared with the CG version and the price is fair.\n\nGood graphics, cool and likable characters, alright plot, good puzzles and GREAT gameplay.\n\nNow I'll say what I didn't like compared with RE Remake (which is the most similar in the series, made by the same ppl during the same period and with the same style): Here enemies won't wake up powered up, there aren't crisom head zombies, if you kill one, it's gone forever, so you just kill him and never fear that it could come back, it takes away some of the challenge. (spoiler) And the bosses, most of them are buffed animals (giant bug, giant bat, etc.), it fits with the plot but still, not that cool. That's all that I have to complain about. And that it's too short (like most old survival horroe games). Overall I prefer RE Remake, but only because it has 2 campaigns and the mansion is scarier, plus it's more challenging with the zombies coming back, but on the paper and objectively, you can't say one is better than the other.\n\nBuy it!\n\nP.S: Don't be a scrub and use the original controls.","January 24","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also cannot really choose between the more colorful and stylish look of classic PS1-era REs and the "creepy old" look of REmake, something that was improved a lot in the HD Remaster (original was very gray/yellow-ish), but still feels not as good as other games.\n\nBut HD Remaster fixes not just visual issues and makes the game look very good. In addition, it adds several welcome changes in the controls (realtime reload button is a cool thing), most notable of which is the alternative control scheme. Now it was also present in REmaster, however REmake worked perfectly fine with classic tank controls - all the animations felt right, moving and shooting and evading was fun to master and use. In RE0 original tank controls have a slight delay due to additional animation frames for a lot of actions which are simply removed in alt. control scheme, making it a much better option, especially when controlling the partner character, even despite few places, where camera changes to screw up your movement. In addition to that, game also gets a silly and fun to play Wesker mode, where Billy is changed into RE5-style Wesker, who can run at super speed and explode enemies with his aura at will. It's a ridiculous mode, that gets even sillier when you complete it once, as sadly there is no Wesker Leech Hunter, but all the rewards in the game are just unlocked for the second playthrough. It's funny, it's fun, it's a nice way to relax after Leech Hunter or hard mode playthrough, and it's always fun to explode zombie heads with your thoughts.\n\nSo, is it a good game to get? Well, if you like classic survival horror and this is the game you've missed before - definitely. If you're a fan of RE series - yep. If you want to get into classic survival horrors - only after you try out better options. REmaster is a better option, but I would've suggested checking RE Director's Cut (just not dual shock ver., if you value your ears), 2 and 3 as well, if possible. And same goes for people who are just checking this out without knowledge of the genre and the series - this is a rather good way, but there are better options to start with.","January 22","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only say decent, because It drops back down to 30 fps or sometimes lower 99% of the time I go into a new room, then goes back up. Capcom needs to patch this since I didn't have this problem in the other Resident Evil Remake. I would also like another AA option besides FXAA.\n\nIn my opinion also, Wesker mode is kind of broken.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuckshooter/recommended/339340/","cuckshooter","dangerous faggot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cuckshooter/","104 products in account","Until the day of writing this, Resident Evil: 0 was the one Resident Evil title I'd never played. After delving into this blind, I can safely give off several first impressions. To preface this, however, if you love survival horror or the Resident Evil series, then buy this right away. That said, to add more incentive here are the following pros:\n\n+Better item management than the entire series. This game does away with item boxes and allows you to leave items in a location, handily marked on your map, and retrieve it at any time. There's also your partner's inventory, which you can trade items with back and forth at your leisure.\n\n+Bosses. Within the first ten minutes the game will have thrown its first boss at you. My opponent was a giant scorpion made of leeches, and due to my blind foray into the game, I had no weapons on me. What followed was a breathtaking, heart-pumping fight for survival where my knife held me through adversity. A feeling I haven't felt since the original 2002 release of last year's Resident Evil: REmake.\n\n+Characters. Billy Coen, hands down is the best male protagonist in the Resident Evil series. His past a mystery, the true nature of his placement as a prisoner on the ecliptic express reveals a backstory of melancholy and betrayal. Capcom nailed it with his motivations, and his portrayal. Rebecca is a much loved character from Resident Evil 1, and if you loved her in that, her stepping into the spotlight in this game will satisfy you.\n\n+Enemy design. With a much more diverse sideshow of enemies to battle and run from than its predecessor game, Zero offfers an abundance of grisly and challenging foes that are sure to plague your nightmares. Giant scorpions, leech men, to the cerberus that's become iconic in itself. Each room offers a challenge and an opportunity to encounter only the most fearsome of Umbrella's dark experiments.\n\n+Controls. The initial control system was rather iffy, but only because it was different to REmake. To my joy, there are three control configurations as well as the default, and control type D plays just like last year's REmake remaster. This game has done away with tank controls, and it feels good.\n\n+Set pieces. Can't go into detail much, but if you ever thought you wouldn't have a countdown to an explosion early into an RE game, this game changes everything.\n\nCons:\n\n- Same audio as the original release: It's quite jarring that in such a pretty, upscaled and retouched environment the sounds are still as weathered and old as the game's age itself. This is particularly telling in monster cutscenes, where a door being smacked off of its hinges sounds like several boxes falling off of a shelf.\n\n- Cutscenes haven't been remade. Due to their FMV nature, it's understandable they couldn't be edited. That said, Capcom could at least have upscaled them from 4:3 to 16:9/10 for the sake of visual consistency. Seeing two black boxes at the sides is quite the immersion killer.\n\nOverall, this game gets a 9/10 from me. It's almost as good as REmake, although I will forever maintain that REmake and Resident Evil 3 are the kings of the series. If you're hungry for more Resident Evil, or want a particularly challenging horror game with mechanics ahead of its time, then this is for you.\n\nThanks for reading, feel free to add me on Steam.\n","January 20","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EchoOfHorror/recommended/339340/","EchoOfHorror","EchoOfHorror","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EchoOfHorror/","55 products in account","Horror, quite possibly one of the most fun and difficult genres of gaming.  Originating back in the early 1990's on the Playstation One, the Resident Evil One (RE) in the series instantly became the icon for suspense, horror and mystery.  Like all great mysteries, answers to questions get overlooked leaving the player with a thirst un-quenched.  Resident Evil: Zero is that quintessential thirst quencher.  With it's complete fun integrated explanation of game play balanced with all the elements of the series storytelling.  The mystery uncloaked here is a prime example of a prequel meant to be played after having played thru RE:1 first, thus allowing for a  mystery, mystery then answer experience rather than a mystery, answer and mystery solved experience.\n\nWarning: From here on out there are *SPOILERS* so read at your peril. XP\n\nThe mystery unveiled by the use of yet more mystery.  Lets quickly run through a brief overview of events to give us some feel for the game and story.  Starting out on  a train of the dead, that being a loose and relative thing, our heroine Rebecca Chambers after a lovely intro cut scene investigates.  Just like the first Resident Evil the player is left with a little to go on except micro-sandbox exploration.  Through the use of occasional scripted scenes a team member of STARS ( the police force Rebecca is on) dies from bites and loss of blood from super leeches and a new character/partner Billy Coen (the so called criminal) is introduced as well as the partner system.  Rebecca is attacked by a person made of leeches whom Billy heroically kills, saving Rebecca.  They team up exploring more of the train, while doing so Rebecca gets trapped after fixing a damaged circuit board on the roof of the train and Billy goes to find a tool to get her out.  On the search he gets attacked by a scorpion the size of a Buick, a mass of leech eggs hatch and our heroes have to stop a now run away train.  Managing to do so only to crash into an underground tunnel in a hillside, they somehow manage to survive.  After taking a minute to recover they proceed, only to discover they are in a mansion of the dead, note this one is different than the one in RE:1.  After several puzzles, zombies and a few new enemies we begin to paint a picture on how this whole chain of events came to be as well as reveal the Men behind the scenes and the role they played leading up to RE:1.  Prior to RE:1, and subsequently RE:0, a scientist discovered a means to immortality in the Progenitor virus and proceeded to experiment on how to make it viable.  Leeches where the key.  He the scientist is revealed to be alive, surprisingly because the two men mentioned earlier killed him.  Rebecca and Billy learn how all three villains got started, their dark experiments and after discovering the underground facility by way of a zip-line car and the Doctors revived form and world destructive plans.  They take on the doctor  kill him escape the self-destruction of the facility that then leads to Rebecca's Role in RE:1.  So, overall the game feels adequate to be a stand alone and also very satisfying as a prequel.  Note the partner system allows some choice on who plays what role in some sequences, while in other sequences it is character specific allowing for character development thru personal experiences thus shaping the story.  Flashbacks also play a small role enriching the experience to fill in any of the gaps literature found thru out the game failed to reveal or simply was missed while playing, for the player.\n\nNew and then kept for future games of the RE series was the partner system.  Though other games in the series had points when two characters would be together for short periods of time, they made both playable but never together.  Important to note also is that a player can switch between characters, single character to allow more complex puzzle solving and save time by switching between characters or have the second character (your choice) follow you, select how aggressive you want them to play burning thru ammo or being defensive and save it along with each respective inventory allows a great deal of freedom and customizablility, all showing the care, detail and standards to which this game was made.  In addition by having a secondary character carry a specific weapon you directly select what kind of weapon and ammo they use.  This intuitive function allows characters to be played with together or separately depending on how easy, challenging  the player wants to make it.   Having properly crafted this partner system the game also manages a decent blend of survival horror with it limited but numerous undead, finite ammo, payoffs of close quarters kills along with puzzles that really require as much as attention to detail as curiosity to truly discover all the secrets often with a worth while payoff.   The detective work to uncover the truth gives a rich lore and is a great driving force if not a the challenge of beating the game in general.   Overall, it's the blending of these elements, their timing and placement that keeps the game fresh and the player coming back for more.\n\nGame play is just as good as the original if not slightly more spot on.  Combat is kept honest to the original, basically a 3 level system of up, middle and down attacks with a radial direction and again 3 levels of distance far, medium and close range.  The payoff of range and levels allows for a tactile application of selecting not just targets but relative parts of target Eg. a head shot at close range aimed squarely  and up at the target for max damage/kill shot or medium range with a grenade launcher for a multi kill and no self damage.   General movement controls give that traditional game play of the first RE through a bit wonky/clunky it serves to first add to the terror and suspense in any combat as well as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• off the unexperienced furthering the horror experience.\n\nThe re-release of this game brought with it updated graphics.  This is always a little bittersweet as it changes the visual feel of the game, though in this case it feels like someone cleaned off the screen allowing a more crisp view.   Hilariously though is that there are 3 levels of graphics in this game, game play graphics in HD, low res graphics of most of the cut scenes and one cut scene which they forgot to update at all making it the most entertaining.  Overall though it feels like a healthy mix of old and updated giving its own unique experience.\nThe music is identically the same.  Ambient eerie tonal tracks through out the environment help to create the horror without detracting from the immersion with out of place music.  The contrast of the safe rooms' tune emulates a breath of fresh air or a sigh of relief and acts as a synergistic amplifier between rest and tension outside the safe room.\n\nBonus or extra content considering the premise of the game seems a little out of place, primarily the costumes, which were earned/unlock in previous version of the game.  Rebecca's cheerleader costume in particular is one such case,  the is fully functional and moves relative to her movements, however.  The major drawbacks to every costume is it's absence in movie cut scene's losing some of its appeal.  The new Wesker mode makes Rebecca totally Smoken' hot and pay homage to RE 5's Jill mind control.  In addition Billy is now Wesker and comes with 2 unique abilities Death Vision a chargeable AOE with head shot ability and Super Speed. Yup no more walking or casual jogging, you can dash across rooms with ease, amazingly helpful for speed runs. There is more but I'm out of space\n\nSimply, its a solid game made in an era when games had less graphics and were pushed to be engaging and with lasting depth that will always be memorable.","May 4","true","42.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They were all very hard on Normal and this one is no exception. You will need every survival aspect you have developed from horror games (especially if you've played an old Resident Evil game). You need too know when to run away, you need to know when its okay to use your gun on an enemy. Only this time, you need to know how to not get one of your two characters killed. Which is a hard task in itself when you're given one F. Aid Spray and you're both in dangerous condition. Pick your favorite of the two, and load them up with an arsenal of your finest weapons and pray to whatever entity you pray to and enter through that door while your less favorite waits on the safe side of the door awaiting your blood covered return as you limp your way through the door and weakly say it's safe. Of course, you can always scream at them through the other side of the door after you dealt with the suddenly cannibalistic, T-Virus testers or these giant bugs straight out of Fallout that kill you for fun.\n\nIf you haven't played the GameCube version (which I barely did). Its not too different. The graphics look more polished, and when the blood of your favorite or least favorite gets thrown across the room, you will say to yourself, "son of a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, I died!" Following: "But damn did it look good."\n\nOverall, if you liked the old school style of old Resident Evil games you'll probably like this one. I am only halfway through and having a blast... if by having a blast, I mean, determining when I should use the precious amount of Ink Ribbons that I have and figuring out if saving the game right now is a good time and wondering if my next death is gonna be started by a former cheerleader gnawing on my delicious head (hint: its not the one you want her to gnaw on) while stuck in a expensive mansion that was designed and built by a sadistic architect that predicted that in the future, we will have to solve these puzzles that the previous ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s that came through had happily reset before leaving.\n\nAlso, why all the people? Did I stumble into Hugh Heffner's house during a party before all the ladies came home to give free lap dances? I mean geez, if I died by a T-Virus holder, can it at least be a sexy secretary so that I have a pleasant sight as I become her midnight snack? I mean, hell, Billy's gotta look at something while Rebecca is get munched on and watches in horror because he abandoned the knife for more space and ran out of bullets quicker than a Beach Boy's song.\n\nOne last thing, this game is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. I have recorded, 4...count it 4 times I had to Old Yeller dogs so far because they ran out of Dog food and was just looking for food, which I qualified for apparently. They are so skinny, their skin was ripping apart, I close my eyes and waste my almost non-existent bullets as they lay dead on the floor with no visable bullet holes. After a ten minute crying session, I finished the other dog off. Geez Capcom, I didn't know this was I Am Legend.\n\nAlso, do yourself a favor, don't play with a keyboard unless you want a challenge. The keyboard controls are not good.","February 8","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
