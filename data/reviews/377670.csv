For information pertaining to this specific release, see below the line.\n\nThis novel game is a mystery-thriller with an unreliable narrator--the combination of which is unbelievably engrossing. The title is actually a reference to Goethe's/Schubert's "Erlkoenig" (called Maou = devil in Japan) and Bach's "Air on the G-String"--no funny business, don't get the wrong idea. Obviously, classical music plays a major role in both the musical and story motifs revisited throughout the game.\n\nEvery chapter, there is a pending crime of escalating severity that the protagonists attempt to prevent, but the antagonist stays two steps ahead of them all along the way.\n----------------------\nThis game is near and dear to my heart, as you might garner from my screen name--I was the editor of the English fan translation. This is what I think about the Sekai Project update, cut down to bullets so you can spend more time reading the game itself.\n\n-Everything's at significantly higher resolution. There's a 2000 pixel tall Gonzou sprite, for crying out loud. 2K Gonzou. Think about it. "Marche Slave" never looked and sounded more menacing. The music is still a high point, but the richly colored, HD visuals are now a fitting complement.\n\n-Because of the new aspect ratio and higher resolution, you see a bit more of the sprites (they're actually full-body, though you could never tell in the original release) and a lot more of the backgrounds. The event cgs are cropped just a little bit, but I went through every last one, and they all still look great--better, actually, at the higher resolution.\n\n-The new UI is much sleeker and more modern.\n\n-The translation is awesome, duh.\n\n-The spirit of the game isn't "censored" by any means. Literally the only parts taken out of the adults-only source material are the adults-only bits. Anything that would be rated "R" in a modern theater is still in there, last I saw... expect the gritty and dark world the 2008 Japanese release had, and nothing less.\n\nThis is exactly the build I would release as an "Editor's Cut" if I had the balls and resources of Sekai Project. Well, except I might add an Eiichi yaoi route. I love that guy. Steamworks modders, get on it.\n\nEDIT FOR CLARITY: The game still has mature content, and even explicit sex. It's just not AS explicit. (For example, there might be a black screen while the main character directs a sex act, but then instead of showing and narrating the act "to completion", the scene cuts away.)","November 5, 2015","true","15.1"," 271 of 304 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","271","304","8","49"

To clear up the confusion, the title is NOT referring to the butt floss type of underwear. It is referring to the musical instrument of the violin in reference to classical musician J.S. Bach.\n\nG-Senjou No Maou Review\n(Score Breakdown Found at the Bottom of Review)\n\nIntroduction & My Personal History With This Game:\nIf I recall correctly, my first experience with G-senjou no Maou was in 2011. I'll confess, I was a bad person and pirated the game, along with the fan translation patch, because I didn't have a legal way of purchasing this game at the time. I always feel terrible any time I do this for a product, especially if I turn out really liking the product. However, as with every product that I've ever acquired in this manner, I promised to myself that, if this game was ever officially localized, I would be sure to make it an immediate purchase. With that out of the way let's jump right into the review.\n\nDifferences Between The Fan Translation and Official Localization:\nFirst off, the interface is much cleaner. I don't remember every aspect of the original interface, but everything just feels "smoother". Switching between the currently open scene, transcript log, and save/load screen is very quick and doesn't seem jarring at all.\nThe next biggest thing to talk about is the removal of the sex scenes (H-Scenes). Personally, I prefer these scenes being removed. If you are someone who enjoys the H-scenes when playing Visual Novels (VN's), then I'm sorry to report that they are not present in this current version.\nthe artwork appears to have had some work done on it's sprites to make them look quite a bit better, and the new 720p resolution is awesome.\nLastly, from the 6 hours I've put into this game so far, I can safely say that I prefer this translation to the original fan translation. Sentences just seem to be structured a little bit better, and It just feels easier to read.\n\nStory:\nThis visual novel is a mystery story at it's core, and places the themes of money and corruption front and center. The story of G-senjou no Maou centers around our main protagonist Azai Kyousuke; a high school student who is a prodigy when it comes to making money. Being the adopted son of the big shot Yakuza (gangster) family known as the Azai, we follow him as he tries to live his double life of normal high school and the dark and twisted world of the Yakuza. When a new transfer student named Usami joins his class at school, and other characters start to slowly learn of his double life, Kyousuke will find himself in over his head well before he knows what hit him. While all this is going on, we learn of a certain character named "Maou" who is lurking in the shadows planning something huge, that will shake the very foundation of the city. Unfortunately, I cannot give further specific details on the story without delving into spoilers.\nThe pacing is the story's high point. It knows just how much time to spend with each expositional scene, character, and event. The level of immersion is also phenomenal. You'll find yourself absorbed into this story from beginning to end.\n\nCharacters:\nThe highlight of this VN is it's unique cast of characters. Azai Kyousuke (our protagonist, and player character) is as morally grey as they come without being a strict anti-hero. Learning more about his skills, and seeing how he deals with each situation is one of the biggest reasons to keep reading hour after hour.\nAizawa Eiichi (the "best bud" character) isn't anything like what you're used to seeing in most VN's. He's a slimeball through and through. While often pretending to be cute, innocent, and effeminate, his true nature is that of a very angry little man who wants to go out with (and "bow chicka wow wow") a MUCH older woman.\nEach of the girls are also very well developed, especially the main girl Usami.\nUsami Haru is very good at noticing when people are lying, and is incredibly socially awkward. She loves using game metaphors (especially those referencing the RPG genre).\nShiratori Mizuha knows about what Kyousuke is up to after school when he returns home. She's a constant threat to our protagonist. If she was to say something he could easily lose his comfortable  life.\nMiwa Tsubaki is perhaps the most generic of the girls. She is the class representative of Kyousuke's class, and writes down absolutely ANYTHING that happens during a day in her diary.\nAzai Kanon is the last of the girls that Kyousuke interacts with on a daily basis. She is the adoptive sister of our protagonist, so they are not related by blood. She is an incredibly talented figure skater, who is trying to making it into the olympics. She adores her adopted brother and will often go out of her way to see him as much as she can.\nThe antagonists are also very good, but even mentioning their names (let alone their personalities) would be a huge spoiler. That said, just keep in mind that when they do show up, that they're going to be the highlight of the scene currently taking place.\n\nArtwork, Sprites, Transitions, and Effects:\nThere isn't really much to really say here. As far as all the visual effects go,  they're all top notch and show just how high the production values for this VN are. The new 720p resolution is also VERY welcome.\n\nSound, Music, and Voice Acting:\nAgain there isn't much to say about the Sound effects. They are simply crisp, clear, and appropriate.\nThe music leans heavily towards the classical genre of music, and remixes of said classical music. This is appropriate as Kyousuke is a huge fan of classical music, especially J.S. Bach. There are some custom tracks, but they are far fewer in number than the classical songs on the soundtrack. Almost all tracks feature some kind of violin.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is top notch. All characters are voiced, EXCEPT for Kyousuke himself. Whether you believe that having the japanese voice acting avaliable is worth paying double the price of the base game... well that's up to you. Personally I'd say that it is worth it, but if you'd prefer to get the game at half price; I can see why and wouldn't fault you for passing up the voices.\n\nConclusion:\nBack in January of 2012 I listed G-senjou no Maou as my favorite VN at the time. Although that list has changed a lot after reading the Zero Escape series and Danganronpa series, G-senjou no Maou Is still easily one of my top 3 visual novels. I can easily say that if you're a fan of visual novels, despite the high pricetag for a Steam VN, that you should buy this story asap. You definitely won't regret your purchase. Before ending this review, here's a numerical score breakdown for this visual novel, and a list of the types of people that I recommend this game to.\n\nScore BreakdownUser Interface:\n95/100 (Super Easy to Use, Smooth, and Intuitive)\n\nOptimization:\n100/100 (Will Run on a Toaster)\n\nStory:\n97/100 (Unforgettable and Amazingly Paced)\n\nCharacters:\n95/100 (Unique and Memorable)\n\nArtwork and Visual Effects:\n82/100 (Solid but Slightly Dated From Being 7 Years Old)\n\nSound Effects, Music, and Voice Acting:\n87/100 (Appropriate and Consistent)\n\nOverall Final Score:\n96/100 (Characters and Story Weighted Higher Than Other Sections)\n\nRecommended Purchase For Those Who Enjoy:\nMystery Stories, Unique Characters, Philosophy, Criminal Underworld Stories, Drama, and/or Anime\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this review, and I hope it was helpful to you.\n\nLove\n-Aristile","November 8, 2015","true","41.0"," 112 of 123 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","112","123","8","9"

Originally released in 2008, the Steam Release of G-senjou no Maou – The Devil on G-String marks AKABEisoft2’s first officially localized release. The Devil on G-String prices at $19.99 for the standard edition of the game, and $39.99 for a fully-voiced (in Japanese) version of the game. Both versions of the game will be discounted 30% until November 12.\n\nThe Story You will play as Azai Kyousuke, the adoptive son of a yakuza boss you will see the world through his eyes as he puts up a facade of being a “rich person with taste” to keep his classmates away from him. He often enjoys listening to Bach and “working” part time for his stepfather. But when a beautiful girl named Usami Haru appears in town along with an international criminal known as “Maou,” they bring with them their cat-and-mouse game of plotting and intrigue.\n\nVisual and Music elements Visual Elements\nBackgrounds and CGs are beautiful and detailed very well done overall very smooth looking sprites and they look really cute when i first saw Miwa Tsubaki sprite with the cute “Ahoge” above her head my first impression was “wow she looks really cute”. There is also time based character color calibration which is a really cool addition because it makes the character have Evening and Night color immersion which adds to the overall atmosphere of the visual novel.\n\nMusic in the menu give that creepy feeling when you play in the dark I loved the overall creepy atmosphere it manages to set and I loved the way they can turn the creepy and dark atmosphere into a cheery and cute atmosphere all with the use of music that goes along with the gloomy and bright colors being put to use. Overall music being used in the game is good\n\nInterface and FeaturesThey have features like having song titles appearing at at the top right of the screen when a new song plays with the composer name.\nThey also have the feature to change specific characters text colors which not many Visual Novel have this feature which I find this a nice feature to have because sometimes the words colors may blend into the background and thus making it very hard to read them.\n\nTo sum up I would definitely recommend this visual novel to anyone because this visual novel overall would appeal to most people and would recommend anyone that likes mystery/thriller genre with investigations going on all around in the visual novel.\n\nClick here for the full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","November 6, 2015","true","18.4"," 61 of 74 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","61","74","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andrew_lim/recommended/377670/","andrew_lim","Andrew ⚡","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andrew_lim/","411 products in account","TLDR: Fantastic cat-and-mouse detective story presented as a visual novel.\n\nAt first glance I thought this was just another dating simulator, but all the Steam reviews said it wasn't. And I'm glad I was curious enough to buy it. It's actually a really good detective visual novel. The story is akin to Death Note's - a genius detective tries to stop an evil criminal, and they engage in a cat-and-mouse game of outdoing each other.  At the time of this writing I'm near the end of Chapter 4 and found myself blown away by a plot twist I totally didn't see coming.\n\nA word of warning though - this is not traditional game. It's a visual novel and while there is the occasional choice you have to make, it's 99% reading. The story is broken in chapters, and each one will take a couple of hours or more to read through. Along the way you meet interesting characters, and each chapter of the novel usually focuses on a crime that affects one of them.\n\nLuckily the reading is made bearable thanks to the pretty anime art that accompanies each character. I recommend buying the fully-voiced edition as it breathes more life to each character. The music that accompanies the game is made up of remixed classical music from Bach, Beethoven, etc and gives the game a unique touch.\n\nAre there any flaws? Not really - just that sometimes the story digresses into parts that seem pointless. But sometimes these seemingly meaningless diversions turn out to play an important part later. ;)","December 13, 2015","true","24.2"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/davin/recommended/377670/","davin","Davin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/davin/","390 products in account","Don't let the cover or the name fool you. This is a story of family loyalty, revenge, crimes that cannot be forgiven, and hatred that cannot be let go. A picture of a few girls for the protagonist to pursue is as far from the focus of this story as it gets, but that's what sells the copies in the marketspace. The name itself is a reference to "Air on G-string", and an unfortunately distracting choice of name for the western market.\n\nStory:\nThe writing is excellent, particularly if you're the sort who enjoys crime mysteries where the villain and protagonist clash in deadly knife fights of razor sharp wit. The girls who you are given the option of pursuing are a distraction in the most literal sense, as those story branches will detour you from the main plotline and prevent you from getting to the best material of the novel.\n\nBGM:\nThe majority of the tracks are remixed classical pieces, some of which do an amazing job of setting the mood. A remix of "Marche Slave" was used as a mood piece and character theme for a mafia boss and I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nFin:\nThere's not much more to say than that. This isn't The Fruit of Grisaea. Grisaea was entertaining and had its dark moments, but at the end of the day it was a gal game. G-senjou no Maou is focused on telling you a story and takes a very novel approach in preventing the distractions that some buyers may be seeking from interfering with the story it wants to tell.","November 9, 2015","true","36.9"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","38","44","3","0"

Top 5 for sure.\nA lot of visual novels start off slow, making you used to the characters before you get to choose which one you want to know more about further. This can make early reading a chore for people who just want to read a story and find it difficult to make an emotional connection with each character through hours of comedy.\n\nThis novel is not like that at all. This novel starts off strong, and makes you come back because you want to know more. It grabs your curiousity, and pulls you in. This is the first and only novel I've read that does this. Not once did I feel like I had to struggle through content I didn't care about in order to get to the main dish. It's full tension from start to finish.\n\nUnlike some visual novels, this one is very linearly story-oriented. However, there are plenty of choices to be made here.\nThere are route branches to different heroines, but doing so will abandon the main story, or canon route if you want to call it that, and grant you a character-specific route. While I'm not personally into that, more power to the people who are. That's a good thing, right?\n\nStory:\nThe story gives me a slight Death Note vibe due to the cat and mouse battle between wits, while still being original and not copying. This is, in my opinion, a must read for people who are into that genre, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Death Note or anything mystery/crime.\nThere are a lot of dark themes, and it's definitely not a fanfare title for sure. If you prefer titles like Sakura <insert whatever here> or NekoPara, this is probably not for you. May contain badassery.\n\nArtwork:\nThe artwork is fairly decent, better than average to most standards. Steam's release had a lot of UI improvements made, which I only welcome. There is plenty of CG to be unlocked, and it looks pretty.\nCompared to Akabei Soft2's previous releases, it's definitely an improvement.\n\nSoundtrack:\nBefitting to the title of the novel, the soundtrack consists of remixes of classical music. Need I say more? There's a wide variety of classical composers, ranging from Beethoven to Bach to Tchaikovsky and the list goes on. As a Norwegian, it makes me feel special that there's even Edvard Grieg in here. Hot daym.\nAnd yes, the title theme is Air on G-String. No more G-string jokes pls.\n\nA few last words:\nA complaint I see is the price difference between the voiced and the unvoiced version, but this is because of how Japanese voice licensing works. It's expensive, and you're given a choice, rather than being forced to pay full price. How some people see this as a negative thing confuses me.","November 6, 2015","true","5.4"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","33","40","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paradoxycal/recommended/377670/","paradoxycal","Dris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paradoxycal/","78 products in account","G-senjou no Maou - The Devil on G-String Review\nPersonal History\nI’ve been a fan of visual novels for quite a time now. It probably stemmed from my love for immersive stories and because of that, I was constantly reading as a child. Since I was kid, I was into anime and always heard of these “visual novels” but never really understood what exactly it was until I got around to reading them. I remember reading the fan translated G-senjou quite a while back and it left quite an impact on me and would lead to my eventual obsession into all things visual novel related. (I have no qualms towards pirating only because it was next to impossible to read English translated visual novels back then. But since that’s a bad excuse, I generally go out of my way to buy visual novels I’ve read before as they come onto steam to make up for pirating and also to support the work that went into making the product.)\n\nStory\n“The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.” –Sherlock Holmes from The Hound of the Baskerville\n\nFor this visual novel in particular, the story is heavily driven by corruption, money, and revenge. While it does have its light-hearted moments, this novel, at its core, is of the mystery - and thriller - genre and shows this through many different scenarios similar to that of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. The story itself begins a bit slow, but as more and more mysteries start revealing others and the main villain, “Maou”, shows up in the shadows, the story accelerates and it becomes very captivating. It was next to impossible - for me - to peel my eyes away from the computer screen; especially at moments like the previously mentioned “Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty”-esque scenes between the main characters Kyousuke, Haru -and others - and the villain Maou.\n\nSound/Music and Voice Acting\nLet me go ahead and say I’m a big fan of classical music. I’m also a big fan of Japanese pop music. (My computer and phone are filled with anime openings and endings that I listen to constantly). You can expect a lot of high paced violin and orchestral related music. Me trying to be as objective as possible, I really did think that all the music was very well done. It fit the mood of each scene and served to bring out the best in G-senjou.\n\nThe voice acting is truly a wonderful addition. There really isn’t much else I can say about that. They really do bring out the best. Sometimes I had goosebumps at just how much of an immersive experience it was. Every single character that was voiced was spot on and made for an exponentially better read. That being said, the voice acting is an add-on for the Steam version. Personally I kind of want to punch you – or maybe drop-kick you - if you don’t buy it with voices, but I do understand that some people can’t pass up a cheaper product.\n\nArtwork\nIn my opinion, I always thought the artwork was pretty good. It isn’t super godly tier artwork, but it’s very beautifully done. The characters are properly portrayed, the sprites are cute as heck, and transition and effects are very well done. I do enjoy the high resolution as compared to the fan translation though. I noticed people complaining about how the event CGs was cut due to the new aspect ratio, but I honestly didn’t even notice on my run through of the game even though I played the original version. Everything still looks amazing.\n\nCut Scenes\nYes, a couple of H-scenes are cut. Coming from someone who's read it WITH the H-scenes, it didn't really...mess with the immersive-ness of the experience.\n\nPersonal Enjoyment\nObviously this is the only category that truly matters. Reading this way back when – I forget the actual year because I’m a forgetful person – this transformed my visual novel experience. It made me realize how amazing a well written story could be for a visual novel setting with its artwork and voice acting. To this day, it has remained a contender for my favorite visual novel of all time and that will probably remain a fact for many decades to come.\n\nI’m not going to numerically break down the scores for the key points of this visual novel but I will rate my personal enjoyment. 10/10, totally, 100% best visual novel ever, will read again. But in all honesty, this is truly a work of art. Perhaps even a masterpiece, at least in my subjective view. But in the end, only you can decide whether or not you want to read said visual novel.\n\n“There is nothing like first-hand evidence.” –Sherlock Holmes from A Study in Scarlet\n\n-Dris","November 26, 2015","true","17.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

Do NOT let anyone tell you this is 'just an eroge' or 'a dating-sim' either. It's not. In the same way a sex scene doesn't make a movie a porno--a hentai scene doesn't make a visual novel an eroge.

Kyousuke is a slave to money, working for his foster father to pay off his father's staggering debt. When a new girl, Usami Haru, transfers to his soon, a mysterious man known only as "Maou" also appears. A stange series of events begin to unravel, including kidnapping and murder threats, in this 30+ hour crime/mystery visual novel.\n\nThe Devil on G-String is by far one of the best visual novels I've read to date. The writing is absolutely fanastic, although I did feel the endings were a bit weak. The artstyle and music are also fantastic, helping to show the scenes perfectly. Fans of the old fan translation may find issue with the fact the CG scenes were adjusted to fit the 16:9 format, but I felt the CG scenes looked amazing. There are some spelling issues within, such as Gonzou being spelled "Gonzo" once. Also, while the original version had erotic scenes, this version does not, though the lead-ins to them are still present. I didn't really feel like I was missing much with them not being there however, so they don't really seem to necessary.\n\nThis VN is more than worth the asking price. The voices do add to the experience, but for the asking price of getting the game voiceless, you're getting a fantastic deal. G-senjou no Maou - The Devil on G-String is an easy recommendation from me for fans of crime/mystery stories, and for fans of visual novels in general.","November 19, 2015","true","41.0"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Although you don't have a lot of choice moments on the game, your choices are impactful(at least, most of them) on the story as a whole.

It has a great story, excellent art, interesting characters, a great soundtrack, and multiple endings. It will keep you entertained for a very long time. I just finished one ending and it's taken over 20 hours already (and that was probably one of the shortest!). That being said, I can't wait to finish the other 6! It's definitely worth picking up, if you're still on edge about getting it.\n\nAs for the voiced version, it's up to you whether or not to get it, but I'd definitely recommend it. I basically went broke after buying it, but I don't regret my decision in the slightest. The voice acting was fantastic. A lot of people are against it because they think it's a ripoff, but understand the licensing issues. It costs extra for them to get the voices in the game, and it's your choice whether to get the voices or not. Some other VNs are quite expensive just because they're voiced, so at least you have option to get it cheaper non-voiced here, if you don't mind that. Price-wise as well, the voiced version here matches the same as some other high-quality fully-voiced VNs here on Steam, if not cheaper than others.","November 22, 2015","true","21.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I played this game 2 years ago and I completly fell in love with it! I saw that this was on Steam just now and I immediatly bought it. It was mostly because of this game that I got into visual novels.\n\nGameplayFrom what I have read, the H-scenes have been taken out, but those aren't really worth caring about. This gem of a game has an amazing story and there are many hilarious parts (especially with your green-haired best friend). The gameplay is zilch however, so be warned. This IS a visual novel after all. Pretty much all of the music reflects the protag's choice in music, so it's really immersive (he likes Classical so most of the original sound track is Classical music). The main route is Haru's story and is definetly the true route while the other endings are for the other heroines. There are some bads ends though if you choose a choice incorrectly.\n\nPersonal ReviewI'm really glad that Steam is finally getting some awesome VNs! I would give this a 9.5/10 and not feel sorry. No offense to those of y'all out there, but Nekopara and games like that have ****ing terrible stories. Please give this game a chance!

This is to date my favorite Visual Novel out of the many I've played, mostly off steam. I was intrested in the premise of this game a few years before the original enlish fan patch was released, and I picked it up as soon as they were done and read all of it in one go. Since then I've probably re-read all the routes 2 or 3 times and the main route an extra 1 or 2, mostly from streaming it for other people who had yet to experience it. Though I have yet to completly play through it again on steam, I made sure to play enough that I could review it and let people who might be thinking of getting it know: Yes, 100x yes. It's an enjoyable and unique story of cat and mouse, with many intresting characters who grow and flourish as the story continues. I can honestly say I was never bored, however some people who are itching to get to the meat of the story may tire of the into chapter, as it is mostly setting up and getting you introduced to many of the key people in the story, but if you're one of those people, stick to it! It's worth it, and make sure to at least read all the way through the 'true' route, because that's where the real good stuff is at.\n\nTL;DR: The main route is a fantastic game of cat and mouse but it's a bit slow to get going to to that part, which might put some people off, but stick with it and I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.","March 6","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

While it is definitely a good read, it had a few glaring flaws that need to be addressed.\n\n1) Unlikable characters. There are a few, but there is one constant character who I wouldn't think twice about locking in a trunk which I would then proceed to drop-kick down a flight of stairs into a vat of acid.\n\n2) Archetypal heroines. This one is less of an issue, given the medium, however it really did feel like the author was just going through a checklist of sorts, particularly the side characters.\n\n3) Wasted plot potential/deus ex machina. This was present throughout a lot of the routes, but none more so than the Mizuha route. Seriously, I finished that route and was extremely dissapointed. The book seems to hint and foreshadow at one hell of a plot, then ignores it and either timeskips or pulls some random BS that violates Knox's Decalougue seven ways from Sunday.\n\nAll of this said, I thouroughly enjoyed the game, and find it well worth the price. I did splurge and pick up the voice pack, and recommend such to all who would read this one. I also particularly enjoyed the soundtrack, specifically the arrangements of "O Fortuna" really set the tone perfectly.","January 9","true","15.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It manages to have horrible morals, yet still portray an incredibly sweet love story. It manages to be disgusting yet endearing, deppresing yet hilarious. These charecters appear to be steriotypes, but the VNs twisted nature molds them into something unique. The art is qute good (While not amazing, the backgrounds can sometimes use work, and some charecters arent even drawn). The music is an excelent pairing of classical music with a modern vibe. The actual plot (While a bit reppetitive and drawn out at some points) extremely interesting, but the way it manages to suprise me is incredible. As for the endings (I have gotten Tsubikis good ending, Kanons good ending, and Usamis true ending) they always go through their ups and downs, always leaving me tense.

It does take until the end of Chapter 1 to do so though. Also, the main story gets more and more intense per chapter too. The writing is excellent, but has some vulgarity and many pop culture references. In the end, the story made me feel all kinds of emotions.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nGraphics\n\nAll I can say is that the graphics look nice. The character art, backgrounds, and UI have nice synergy.\n\nRating: 9.5/10\n\nMusic and Sound\n\nMost of the music was an interesting rendition of classical music. The music still managed to be creative enough in its own way though. I could feel the intensity and emotion of each song. The sound effects are pretty average, but get the job done just fine. Both the music and sound made reading the text more immersive.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nCharacters\n\nEach of the characters have a distinct personality and text color. They range from having a dark past to an innocent childhood. Throughout the story, you can see the characters developing themselves and their relationships. I felt empathy, sympathy, happiness, anger, sadness, etc. towards the characters. Not too many character tropes, like a tsundere, are used either.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nGameplay and Miscellanous\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and works well. Saving and Loading works well (especially with 150 save slots plus the quick save file). I found no bugs in the game either.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\nOverall Score:  47/50","March 20","true","28.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But overall it's an entraining ride.\n\nAs for the romance itself. Like I said it's pretty slim pickings. Especially since this is an all ages version.

If you are looking for cat & mouse plot line with full of intruiging characters and top tier villian then this is an experience you don't want to miss out on. I've already beatin this game in the past but I'm looking to do a second run now that it's own on Steam.","November 6, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Despite some of the other routes being somewhat weak, the main route is amazing and will leave you wanting for more. I've even read this VN several times with the unofficial version each year because of how good it is.\n\nThis version is better due to:\n-Higher resolution and new aspect ratio (720p and 16:9)\n-A nicer looking user interface\n-Sprites look better\n\n\nThere is cut content (H-scenes) and some cropped CGs but it should not affect the story much. Unless you're a cheapskate, please buy the voice version to enjoy this VN fully.","November 5, 2015","true","0.7"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","2"

Stop eating your poke/ramen dinner and put down your ramune soda. Maybe even take a shower for the first time in weeks, because this game will raise your powerlevel to unseen levels. It will certainly make you go monkey mode to the point where you are cockoo for cocoa puffs.\n\nIf you are a NORMIE then you are going to get BTFO'D. I played the original game ages ago (adjusts fedora) and I only had to commit honorable sudoko/JENGA a few times. You will go from a life of dank memes and rare pepes to becomming a weeaboo with anime superpowers.\n\n\nNot a bad weeaboo sim. probably spent longer than i should have replaying all the arcs on the original fan subbed release. Obviously Kenji is still best girl and hanako is worst. This is a god tier VN and its half the price of Grisaia buy it now or GabeN will send decepticons to your router and 1337 h4x0r u.","November 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","30","3","10","5","0"

The main character (you) is far from the usual 'knight in shining armour' or complete div that seems to be the norm in these VN's\nA lot of thought and effort has been taken with the story with even some of the the minor characters getting fleshed out  in the differing paths.\nA very Japanese (unsurprisingly) view of the west (almost the stereotypical standpoint) is shown in some paths, which i believe is a regular stance for the producer\nWell worth the money if you are looking for VN that isnt all boobs and shagging or fluffy bunny girlies and/or you have a slightly darker view on the world\nA class above most VN’s on steam at the minute\np.s. Although it may seem to be a marketing ploy the voice pack adds a great deal to overall ambiance of the title","May 2","true","50.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mystery is fairly easy, however, and both the culprit and final twist were easy to figure out almost immediately, even with the red herrings and faux-credits.

I bought it again on Steam when it came out because it's just that good. I think having to pay extra for the voices is a little wonky though so I recommend buying an actual copy of the game; Same price, better quality.\n\nAkabeisoft2 is a great VN company, I recommend most of their works.","May 19","true","0.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Very entertaining thriller with loads of twists, top notch classical soundtrack that's over 70 tracks long and filled with new takes on many legendary songs, and a final few chapters that are incredible.\n\nWeak points include the voices (which are REALLY good) doubling the price of the game, a few writing missteps at some points, and not so great backgrounds art wise.\n\nOverall, I feel it's somewhere between an 8.5 and a 9 out of 10, leaning towards 9. Hugely recommended.","June 5","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
