Despite my criticisms, the dev gave me a copy through twitter. Stripped of the pretty words others seem to lavish on it, it’s basically a platformy puzzler you play at your own pace which you’ll either hate, grow bored of quickly, or love. There is nothing innately pretentious about the game itself which makes me wonder why indie game reviewers try so hard.\n\nIn Starseed Pilgrim, you collect “seeds” to build block formations to explore your central hub and unlock other pilgrims. To collect seeds, you must venture into a place where the darkness of space is actively devouring everything. The darkness of space, if you jump into it, inverts the playing field, making those solid blocks into empty space and vice versa. You want to collect seeds and keys in order to get back home and use them. You can’t grow anything in the darkness of space so thought must be invested beforehand.\n\nThe game largely leaves you to your own devices, so you’re free to explore whatever you can reach. Different coloured seeds grow into different shapes and sometimes do special things, like provide seeds in the darkness of space or allow you to jump higher. Certain levels have rules. It’s up to you to figure out what does what but nothing is so obtuse that it’s impossible.\n\nIf you find peace in repetition and enjoy setting your own goals, I’d say buy this game, otherwise you won’t get much out of it. And on the front of accessibility, the game has colour blind mode on by default and supports scaling. I was appreciative of both.","November 30, 2013","true","9.3"," 127 of 151 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","127","151","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/recommended/230980/","Futurato","Futura&!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Futurato/","610 products in account","In Starseed Pilgrim, the first thing you learn is that you can break blocks and plant seeds. You are then set upon a large, earthy block suspended in white void and expected to use your fresh and limited knowledge of this universe so far to explore away from your starting point. Different seeds grow at different speeds, shapes, directions, and wonderful sounds. You plant away and start to climb, sure without being sure that there must be something else in this vast emptiness besides yourself.\n\nThere is a challenge to the exploration, discovery, and successful return home – enough that even with the game's insistence on minimal to absent guidance, you'll want to make it at least once.\n\nHowever, it is after surmounting this first hurdle that I no longer felt compelled to play, because the more I saw of Starseed Pilgrim, the more I recognized it as a solid proof of concept rather than a complete and satisfying game. Allow me to explain.\n\nThe blocks, the seeds, and the void are simple components: easily understood with some trial and error. These same elements, however, are also samey to a fault and become bland with overexposure. While the simplicity of the core mechanic is both visually and sonically polished, the simplicity of the game that contains it is lonely and boring; it feels incomplete. You will make your way from base block to base block with practiced efficiency, but there is less and less of a reason for you to do so. Exploration continues to reveal more of the same, as if the game had something against variety in design.\n\nI have heard that, with some doing, you can indeed find the novel experiences that I expected as the rewards for my progress. I'm afraid that I just don't have the patience. I enjoy exploration for exploration's sake, but when a game tells me nothing and shows me even less, should I really be expected to keep at it?","February 23, 2014","false","1.2"," 191 of 254 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","191","254","0","4"

There's symbolism and artistic metaphor, but they're so vague and caved-in under so much repeatition that few, if any, players can actually give them even a minimal identity. There's straightforward gameplay with puzzles to be solved and rewards to be had, but the biggest puzzle is solved the instant the player has planted a seed of each color for the first time and collected a key. The rewards for success are nebulous and consist mostly of being faced with the same puzzle again, while the penalty for failure is also being faced with the same puzzle again. It's essentially entertainment for art-game snobs, who want a reason to laugh at the riff-raff that don't appreciate it the "right" way, and for defeatists who are only comfortable playing in a world where all their actions are doomed to begin with. Certainly, people other than the above mentioned types can enjoy Starseed Pilgrim, but the intentional kind of enjoyment this game produces isn't about trial and error puzzle-play (like House of Dead Ninjas), exploration of a metaphor-strewn environment (like The Path), or even some combination of the two (such as Limbo). Basically, this goes into the same category as "Vinnie Vole's Existentialist Nightmare."","June 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 75 of 102 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","75","102","0","4"

I've played my fair share of games with ambiguous floating meaningful text.\n\nThe game has an interesting idea for a puzzle and interesting variations on tsaid puzzles. BUT the game is too random for it to be fun or completable. Completing a "level" to bring seeds back to the "overworld" to explore is fine.\n\nGetting to the challenges in each level is bloody impossible.\n\nHere's why:\n- After the first 1-3 seeds, the seeds you get are entirely random. Only restriction to this keeps you from getting the same seed twice in a row.\n- How 2 of the 6 seeds grow is semi random. That's a third of what you have to work with and PLENTY enough to mess up your best laid plans.\n- Where the keys AND THE ALTERNATE EXIT FOR THE CHALLENGES spawn is completely random. This is the clincher. There is no way you can even BEGIN to formulate a stratagy if you don't know where you're going. You can only do the same basic thing over and over hoping you pointed yourself in the right direction. That is insanity.\n\nHaving only one of those randomized would make the game challenging but doable. But Starseed Pilgrim has all three and the end result is tedious, annoying, frustrating, and just not fun.","December 4, 2014","false","10.8"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","42","53","0","0"

I'll warn you, it can be pretty hit or miss, but if it's a hit, it's a unique experience that you don't want to deprive yourself!  I wish I could tell you all about it, but I can't.  I can tell you plenty of things its like, but I can't really describe it except for in the very abstract.  And my abstract description is that it is a game about learning.  There is little in the way of obvious instruction.  It's up to you to figure it out.  When I first looked at screenshots, I saw random squares in patterns that were aesthetically pleasing.  Now I look at them and see order.  I see several levels of order.  To tell you more about the game would be to rob you of the experience of transitioning from seeing order to seeing chaos as you play this game.\n\nAs for things its like, I would say it is like...\n\n* Learning a new language\n* Getting lost in a maze, and that joy when you finally find your way out\n* David Bowie's song, "Moss Garden"\n* Discovering that the world is round, firsthand\n* The NES game, Wario's Woods\n* Your first kiss\n* The "Aha!" moment that you get when figuring out a puzzle\n* The 11th Hour, by Graeme Base\n\n\nIf you play this game, I can't promise you you'll love it.

Okay, this is that, but incredibly abstract and with no explanations given.\n\nA lot of people recommend going into this blind. I'm gonna break this down into two tiers of review: one that's incredibly minimalist and gives away as little as possible, and one that'll be more detailed for the curious who give no heed about spoilers.\n\nTHE BRIEF REVIEW: Game only uses a few keys total. Plant seeds which grow in different ways/have seperate effects based on their color (or shape, if you have colorblind mode on). Your enjoyment will greatly hinge upon how much you want to experiment with this process until you figure basics out. Hint: grow upwards, grow outwards, and remember you can delete blocks beside/below you.\n\nTHE SPOILING REVIEW: Seriously, stop reading probably.\n\nOkay anyway.\n\nThe game gets a little repetitive as you try to 'grow' Green blocks because they have block seeds in them. Your journeys into the resetting world(s - plural, you need to explore to find new ones) will be based on reaching a black speck in the void to get a key, so you can get inside the structure you've grown, grab the seeds, and use the gate at the bottom to make it 'home' with your haul. Use those to grow out the permanent structure, and find new places/some worldbuilding text.\n\nDo this for a while, blindly seeking out the next area with whatever construction you create. That's the game, and as far as I can tell, it does not change. I cheated and looked around to see if I had anything new coming and went "I think I'm good here" a few worlds in. Not bad, but decide for yourself if this seems like your bag, spoiler-haver.","March 8, 2014","true","1.5"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","24","41","0","0"

That.\nIf someone can give me a compelling reason to continue meandering through a bland game that urges you to think strategically about placement of pseudo-random adjustments to your environment, while having limited time to think about it, for the reward of: umm, doing it more?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/basketnoise/recommended/230980/","basketnoise","Bread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/basketnoise/","153 products in account","Starseed Pilgrim is a quirky puzzle action game. It starts out being quite obscure with its rules, and the process of discovering them (without outside help) is both frustrating and rewarding. I should note here that discussion about the game has grossly overstated the way that reading about the game before playing it will ruin your experience. ALL good games are better if you discover what's in the game from inside the game, rather than from outside of it. Starseed Pilgrim isn't special in this regard. It's just got weird rules. Pretty much all puzzle games do. It's the weird miscellaneous genre. Anway...\n\nSooner or later you find that randomness holds significant sway in this world, and accumulating resources increases your chances of success. So after you get a grasp of the initially mysterious mechanics, luck and grinding play a large role.\n\nThe game's structure is an interesting effort toward combining a system of 'endless' randomly-generated puzzle-action (like Tetris, Panel de Pon, and Puyo Puyo) with crafted puzzle-platformer challenges (like Loderunner, Lup Salad, or Braid). This mixture could be improved by aiming more toward the side of crafted stages.\n\nIt could do with more of a sense of progression. The unchanging atmosphere is austere, thanks to minimal low-res pixel art graphics, and ambient music with chords as sound effects. There are rhymes written in the background of the hub world, which tell a whimsical tale about an environmental space disaster or something.\n\nThe game's strength is in that feeling of mastery through discovery as you uncover its rules. I recommend it for that, despite the weak payoff of optimising and employing your grinding strategy.","February 1","true","57.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The most important feature of Starseed Pilgrim is that you figure out how to progress through the puzzles yourself, if you're looking for some basic tips I will reveal some in the rest of my review. (Nothing game changing, just the stuff you'll figure out for yourself. I'll use spoiler tags though.)\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: There really isn't a story in Starseed Pilgrim, if there is any type of story it's each time you change characters... or character suits? Personally stories drive me to complete the game because I want to know how the game ends and what happens at the end... so in Starseed Pilgrim I didn't have that motivation.\n\nGameplay: The mechanics in Starseed Pilgrim are the winning factor... well to be more specific it's learning how to work with the mechanics,  You're basically a space farmer... “space” being that white void surrounding the small patch of land you plant on. And “Farmer” being you plan different seeds that do different things, one you can harvest to get seeds (the mechanic I needed to look up a guide to figure out), some grow tall, some grow big, some grown out, some let you jump higher, etc.\nThe problem sets in after you've figured out the mechanics... Unfortunately since the story isn't driving the game, I felt like I was repeatedly rubbing my face against a cheese grader trying to grind the game out to get seeds to build my way to the next island platform.\nWhile initially it was fun and exciting to see an island off in the distance, the reward for getting to one was last luster at best.\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for Starseed Pilgrim. It's quite possible sometime achievements could be added to the game... which would then force achievers like myself to completely finish the game... on the on the bright side I'd get that "motivation" to complete the game that I was talking about.\n\nPrice: Starseed Pilgrim is priced at $6.00, while I won't say the price is unreasonable, I like to spend an hour on a game for every dollar I spend.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion; the Story wasn't really existent. the Gameplay was fun to learn, but after learning there was nothing else to drive the game forward for me. There are no Steam Achievements. The price was fair. I recommend this game to people who enjoy figuring out puzzles mostly on their own, I feel like this is a certain flavor of game that you either love or don't care for.","October 16, 2015","true","3.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Upon starting the game up for the first time you're thrown right into the game with not a single instruction on how to proceed--no menus, no starting screen, no tutorials...straight into the thick of it you go! I want to stop short of calling Starseed Pilgrim a block based sandbox game, but the basic gameplay mechanic is about "growing" blocks so you can travel around the gameworld. To this extent the game is focused on exploration and growth, opposed to more classical examples of sandbox games where the emphasis is on the destrution and reconstruction of the game world. In Starseed Pilgrim the player instead must use their resources to reach new levels within the hub world. Each of these levels is similar in design, yet each offers a unique twist on the mechanics of gameplay. The goal is the same in each however, exit the level naturally with as many "seeds" as you can, allowing you to continue to grow pathways in your hub world.\n\nSince Starseed Pilgrim is all about figuring things out on your own, I'm afraid to say too much. What I am confident in saying is that I'm having a lot of fun with Starseed Pilgrim, the fusion of exploration and a zen-like puzzle/building style of gameplay make it a very enjoyable game to just sit back, relax, and enjoy. My initial impression of the game was a bit hazy as I played through the "figure-things-out-for-yourself" phase, but once I got through the first hour I became quite hooked with game--it quickly turned into something I wanted to play all the time.\n\nIt's not for everyone, true enough, but for those who find the concept interested will undoubtedly feel it a rewarding game to play. It's simple in nature, but can offer complexity to those who wish to master it. Don't stop playing too early, as it's never clear what you need to do to win.

I initially got it because of Extra Credits recommending it in one of their 'games you may not have tried' series, but I really wish I hadn't.\n\nIt's a very simple puzzle/platformer/exploration game where you are given only the basic instructions and are told to just figure our the rest for yourself. It's not that this is inherently bad or anything, it's just that the repetitive nature of the exploration and the lack of direction make the game just frustrating and dull. For most people you'll be looking up guides with in a few minutes and you'll discover just how little the game has to offer.\n\nBeyond a few brief lines of poetry you're probably going to give up on this one long before you discover anything.","May 3, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Essentially you play as this astronaut looking guy as he plant seeds that make structures that open up new worlds where you continue to do those same actions.  It is very sparse, not very much sound, and bizarrely haunting.  It's one of those games where you start playing and you just have to let things happen, try new things and discover for yourself.  In some respects it is extremely frustrating, in others it's highly rewarding.  That may sound vague, but the game itself is rather vague and confusing.

Most of the fun comes from experimenting with the different colored blocks and figuring out what everything in the game world means. Nothing is explained when you first start, but the game doesn't penalize you at all and lets you explore the mechanics as you teach yourself how to play and develop your own strategies for succeeding. In the simplest explanation, you place differently colored blocks to try to get more differently colored blocks and grow your tower while escaping the spreading darkness. Each colored block behaves differently, so the engagement comes from figuring out how to optimize your block placement to get as far as you can.\n\nI don't think Starseed Pilgrim will keep you coming back for too long, but it's the kind of unique game you should try for a little while to see what works and what doesn't.

Mechanically it's brilliant. I originally gave this game a negative review, but I've since come to reevaluate what the notion of a worthy game playing experience is. My initial reaction, after 6 hours played, was that I had wasted most of those hours on repetition, with no further revelations after those of the initial couple hours playtime. New players should take up Starseed Pilgrim without the expectation of the great puzzle leading anywhere special. Instead, solve the puzzle, play with the mechanics for a couple of hours, explore and enjoy the lonely ambience. Then put the game aside. It doesn't have to be any more than that, not at this price. Enjoy the experience.\n\n----\n\nExploration, discovery, mystery, wonder, suprise. Just some of the brand of adjectives that seemingly every review of this game coos. And true enough, the game does have that. For the first couple of hours I was glued to the screen while I solved the metapuzzle that is Starseed Pilgrim. The puzzle is to understand the game's mechanics, and wonderful and clever mechanics they are.  The problem: the game does nothing afterwards. In the solving of the mechanics, you've already seen all of what the game has to offer. Those nouns above comprise about 10% of your playtime, The rest: repetition. With its involving atmosphere and great use of sound, as well as said mechanics, I was expecting Starseed Pilgrim to evolve into a masterpiece. What a shame.","July 9, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hastypixels/recommended/230980/","hastypixels","{PK} HastyPixels","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hastypixels/","444 products in account","Indie developers pride themselves on breaking our expectations of game mechanics by flat-out doing things differently. Sometimes it works, too. However, there are occasions when the function of design contribute to the value and purpose of the subject. Instructions are integrated with the level design and after several sessions I was able to make just the barest sense of them.\n\nExperimental games have limited credence with me. Structure has its benefits, and so do clear instructions. Released in 2013 on the now thriving Indie scene available on Steam, Starseed Pilgrim is an exercise in minimalist presentation and resource management. In this game you are a ‘symphonic gardener’, but so help me I wasn’t able to determine what the tools were, much less how they functioned beyond movement and block removal/placement.\n\nThe entire game is presented in a single screen with visual and audio indicators of your degree of success. Our nameless, 8-pixel tall caretaker is constantly pursued by an ink-black space that results in a reset of your garden when caught. A numeric counter of–your hearts, as it turns out–ticks down to zero over a fixed period of time, and your only hope is to grow more and collect them… I think.\n\nLogic puzzles are a hobby of mine, but only when they make sense. Crazy, right? A legend of your inventory and their attributes would have improved my understanding greatly… not to mention more accurately phrased goals and consequences.\n\nI have over the years enjoyed a few artistic interactive experiences in the past, and that’s usually all they are. If you’re feeling rebellious and anxious with mainstream, this is your bag – or, garden. For my entertainment, too much pruning of useful information took place here.\n\nWhat’s fun: Discovery of unique mechanics is fascinating. Graphics and audio are refreshingly simple.\n\nWhat’s not: Ironically, graphics and audio communicate function and mechanic far better than the handful of words that appear during play.\n\nRecommendation: Know your mark before you buy. This is an information-sparse puzzler with perplexing logic. If this style of play interests you, it’s worth every bit the asking price.\n\nThis review is featured with others at Thousandhour Gaming http;//thousandhour.nudgeworksdesign.com/ .","January 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, abstract puzzle game is abstract, but I got bored shortly after figuring out what all the various cubes do, some of which are frustratingly detrimental to your attempts to outrun the blackness that consumes everything. I tried building outwards and upwards, but the game doesn't incentivize... anything, really. Just monotonous, RNG-based attempts to try to farm cubes back up to try to build far out for... some reason, until the blackness eats the cube you're standing on and you have to start over.\n\nIt doesn't really evoke the wonders of exploration in the way, say, Antichamber does, which is also artsy, but continuously confronting you with new and novel things and making you wonder what's around the next corner. This game appears to be one vast expanse of jack squat. It feels to me like a test model for a game's systems, but then they forgot to put the actual game in.","August 3, 2014","false","0.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

But cultivating and exploring are rewarding in a way that "fun" both is and is not. SSP is a game that you can immerse yourself in for hours, if you are the type of person who always wants to know what is next, what is coming. The boundaries of the game change as you play it, in a way that few other games allow. You discover the game in playing it, and I would recommend doing so before people start talking about it, because as a game about discovery spoilers kinda suck.\n\nBig name developers are saying that this is a game which could change the perception of what a game is, and that's mighty praise. Others are calling it game of the year (obviously not in a triple-A sort of way). If you go to the dev's site, you can get SSP in a bundle of 4 of the games for $10, and you will get a steam code, and I'd say this is even more worth it; it's a pretty wide array of games and game styles.","April 19, 2013","true","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Full disclosure, I was close to uninstalling this game multiple times. It got a solid initial play session where I got to grips with the instantly recognisable game mechanics, then eventually got bored and stopped playing. A few more games spread out over weeks not knowing how to progress, or even that there was progress to be made. Then pondering uninstallation once again, another quick game. Holy ♥♥♥♥. Stuff clicked. Now I think I have to uninstall it because I was playing it too much. When I close my eyes I'm shifting freakin Starseed Pilgrim blocks around. And looking forward to seeing what I find next!\nSo: totally worth it, but it was a fine line! Some people are going to be on the other side, but I think it's worth the shot.\n\nI've just read a few reviews and there seems to be quite the back and forth between the people who think this is minimalist indie wank and those who are lauding it for similar reasons that this game caught me. I would simply approach this game in the same way you approach a game like Tetris or Bejewelled (but the game's not easy! So I wouldn't use the term 'casual' in the same way it's not necessarily appropriate to Tetris) - innately fun gameplay without an overt goal, but with great mechanics, and using other aspects, such as music and graphics, purely as a tool to assist those mechanics. Fruther embellishment is up to the player to provide, if they're inspired to do so, so simply don't expect them.\nBasically, to people who are saying that this game is too simple, or isn't a 'real' game, what do you think a 'game' is? A good set of rules and mechanics is what defines a good game. This game has incredibly well thought out mechanics, and the rewarding (if you get there) progression and exploration is a bonus.

A puzzle platformer with airs of cryptic profundity and abstract poems on the wall, a spacey soundtrack, simple art, and exploration of an unusual game mechanic.\n\nAnd sure enough, I find he's waxing poetic about it, continuing his narrative about how morally and intellectually bankrupt the games industry is, and by inference, how smart and morally superior he and his inner circle of indie freedom fighters are.\n\nI'm personally not crazy about the game. Spoilers ahead. Discovering the function of the seeds is fun, and using them to explore, but once you gain that skill, its application becomes repetitive. There aren't many new surprises ahead - different colored "suits" offer only minor changes in your abilities and don't alter the gameplay much. Finding "special stars" with a triple lock behind them is something of a crap shoot, with random placement each time, and that plus randomization of the seed growth means you'll be dying a lot and repeating the same strategies over and over until the randomness works in your favor.\n\nThe unique challenges at the end of the triple locks are fun, but you have to do a lot of grinding to get to them, and if you die you lose - to the point that it wasn't worth the time for me.\n\nThe game feels a bit unfinished - I wish it had explored these mechanics further and introduced new surprises more often. Perhaps new seed types, or more and varied challenge levels without such a grind to get to them.\n\nI also found the poetry and tone a little (hate to say it) pretentious, and deliberately cryptic. Obfuscating things verbally doesn't automatically mean there's a profound message underneath, though people seem to think it does. To me the best art / poetry expresses something clearly - if everyone who sees it has a contradictory interpretation, it's probably just random noise. The game seems to take itself very seriously - and I found myself yearning for a little humor and lightheartedness.","March 6, 2014","false","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In the same way you can use seeds to make blocks grow in some determined patterns (orange seeds will always make some blocks quickly grow in a line, pink seeds will always make blocks slowly grow upwards and so on).

A puzzle platformer with airs of cryptic profundity and abstract poems on the wall, a spacey soundtrack, simple art, and exploration of an unusual game mechanic.\n\nAnd sure enough, I find he's waxing poetic about it, continuing his narrative about how morally and intellectually bankrupt the games industry is, and by inference, how smart and morally superior he and his inner circle of indie freedom fighters are.\n\nI'm personally not crazy about the game. Spoilers ahead. Discovering the function of the seeds is fun, and using them to explore, but once you gain that skill, its application becomes repetitive. There aren't many new surprises ahead - different colored "suits" offer only minor changes in your abilities and don't alter the gameplay much. Finding "special stars" with a triple lock behind them is something of a crap shoot, with random placement each time, and that plus randomization of the seed growth means you'll be dying a lot and repeating the same strategies over and over until the randomness works in your favor.\n\nThe unique challenges at the end of the triple locks are fun, but you have to do a lot of grinding to get to them, and if you die you lose - to the point that it wasn't worth the time for me.\n\nThe game feels a bit unfinished - I wish it had explored these mechanics further and introduced new surprises more often. Perhaps new seed types, or more and varied challenge levels without such a grind to get to them.\n\nI also found the poetry and tone a little (hate to say it) pretentious, and deliberately cryptic. Obfuscating things verbally doesn't automatically mean there's a profound message underneath, though people seem to think it does. To me the best art / poetry expresses something clearly - if everyone who sees it has a contradictory interpretation, it's probably just random noise. The game seems to take itself very seriously - and I found myself yearning for a little humor and lightheartedness.","March 6, 2014","false","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Let's start with that this game doesn't explain itself, except by telling you the controls. The rest is up to you, as the player, to figure out for yourself. If you don't like burrowing into a game, experimenting in trial-and-error, than do not get this game. You'll probably be left bewildred, confused or frustrated.\n\nIf on the other hand, you don't mind this at all (or don't mind grabbing to 'cheat' by looking up the core mechanics in a guide or something), than figuring out the game's mechanics is going the be the primary pleasure for the first hours of so. You'll learn about planting seeds, the growing black squares in the screen shots and about the characteristics of each individual 'plant' (the collored blocks). You'll have to be observant. But once you have figured out all the characteristics, you've gotten the first achievement for this game.\n\nThe second part of this game, is using that knowledge to further explore the world. I did this a bit, and i got bored with it. I didn't have the feeling that there was an actual point to this "Starseed Pilgrim Part 2". I just couldn't find a proper goal. Nor am I able to find on the internet with some quick searches if there even is any. Maybe it's proceduraly generated to be of infinite size and therefore cannot be 'completed' or won? As such, I've lost my will to continue spending precious time on this game, as I've started to perceive it as a time sink.\n\nAs such, I cannot automatically endorse this game, nor immediately recommend it. If you are a very curious person, and like the figure out game mechanics, than you can at least play the game for "Part 1" and feel good about yourself once you did. And maybe you are curious to find out if the game is more than, that it appeared to be to me, a game-concept... euhmm.... game?","March 27, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I gave this game a chance. I put on my diving gear. Somehow, it's *still* too deep for me (in the sarcastic way).\n\nI appreciate the short pieces of poetry (unlike some other negative reviewers), but the cool and mysterious opening doesn't seem to ever be capitalized upon. It takes far too long (30 minutes at least) to make any progress in the game, and I don't think my experience was benefited at all by the game not teaching me how to play. Compare this to a game like Super Metroid, which is vague in service of the story and still finds a way to explain gameplay in non-traditional ways.\n\nTo be fair, I didn't finish it. I unlocked two additional styles of play, which despite being the easiest to unlock, were some of the most boring unlockables (compared to a list of unlockables that I saw). I'd put *something* interesting up front to keep the player interested. As it is, it's a pretty boring game that doesn't explain itself. Maybe this is because if they did explain it to the player, the player would immediately notice its simplicity.","March 1, 2014","false","2.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I first played it for the entire length of a three hour web conference and it transformed that waste of time into a mysterious daydream.\n\nThe game is about exploring the unknown, and it successfully creates the tense feeling of that exploration by refusing to explain itself. The game's mechanics and goals must be discovered, and the rewards of the game are in that discovery. So patience is required, but players are rewarded with a real sense of accomplishment, which creates a powerful player narrative that stands in contrast to the effervescent visual design.","April 19, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It will spit out those who come in without any interest in figuring it out.\n\nFor those who complain about lack of tutorial, this game is about writing the tutorial in your head.  A tutorial would defeat half of the purpose of the game.\n\nThis is one of the very rare games that asks the player to first find the problem that he then has to solve.

Haunting atmosphere, challenging dynamic puzzles, and some really great subtle strategic planning all feature prominently here.\n\nThe game is also a very interesting experiment in not giving the player much at all to go on. You're expected to be curious enough to try and figure out what any given thing does on its own. Because of that, once things do start clicking it's a very satisfying feeling, and every little revelation is a bit of a rush.\n\nThis game is fantastic, and a steal at only $6, especially if you like any sort of puzzling or exploration-based games.","June 7, 2013","true","4.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The aim of the game is to plant seeds (which each grow into different structures) in order to reach the exit. The music is quite nice. The controls are decent.\n\nThe plot revolves around you trying to defeat the darkness (which is trying to envelope the world).\n\nThe main problem I have with this game is the lack of tutorials. Immediately when your given the seeds to plant, your not told what each one of them does. You have to instead use trial and error to learn how to use each seed. Another problem is that the exit in each level is randomised, so you won't know exactly where to go most of the time. This is further hindered by the fact that the seeds you get are also randomised, so you have to waste time figuring how to use your seeds and where the exit is which can be frustrating. Finally, there isn't enough insentive to keep playing, with no reward or sense of achievement, which means the game gets boring fast.\n\nIf you really, really like puzzle games with no real sense of achievement and diffcult to grasp then maybe get this game, else spend your money elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n","January 25, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That kind of game isn't for everyone, but if it sounds like your cup of tea, you'll probably enjoy it. The initial confusion does a wonderful job of promoting the themes of exploration and discovery that are at the core of the game. The gameplay itself is very basic: plant blocks that do different things to escape the growing darkness.

I've been meaning to replay this for a while, but when the game's developer, Droqen, was a guest on one of my favorite gaming podcasts the other day (Video Games Hot Dog), I knew that now was the time…\n\nWhat makes this game so great? Primarily, it's the lack of tutorial, or any instruction beyond the very basic controls. That's it—no explanation of your objective (or if there even IS an objective), or how to achieve it. But if you can resist the temptation to look up an explanation on the web, the experience of figuring out the game's systems for yourself is irreplaceable, and it is forever YOURS.\n\nThat being said, this is still a fun and challenging game to replay, even without that initial experience of discovery. The music is procedural and relaxing, and the game's mechanics change enough as you play so that you are required to keep changing your strategy.

The mechanics are simple, though the overall objective is one that will require guesswork to figure out, and even when you've passed the first level, it's still unclear exactly what you're building towards. Success is rewarding, and failure seems often. The feeling of being cheated by game mechanics can sometimes happen early on, but once you start understanding how different seeds work and what things get you "killed", this feeling diminishes. The uniqueness of the game is intriguing enough that I've returned to it a few times since owning it, picking away at the game's shell in short bursts. It's an easy game to start, toy around with, and leave alone for a while.\n\nThis leads me to my final point, and a reason why I lean towards not recommending buying Starseed Pilgrim.\n\nPut simply, the price.\n\nThough six dollars is a modest amount compared to most indie games on Steam, this price just doesn't feel justified to me. I aquired the game from a recent Humble Bundle, where I received numerous other games for about the same price as this game by itself. Knowing that there are other games of equal or lesser price that have a more apparent value-yield going in, I can't recommend this as a safe buy. As said before, the game's narrative is obscure and doesn't offer direction, much less a sense of depth that would make you compelled to dig deeper for greater lengths of time. It's a unique and clever way to spend a few minutes casually teasing your brain with ways to accomplish the game's simple objective, but that's an experience that's worth less than six dollars. If you can pick the game up for half that, I'd say it's definitely worth the gamble, but only if you're one to enjoy puzzle platformers.","March 17, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a cool idea and it has a lot of potential to be a really neat game that would be super fun to play, but it has a few glaring problems that mean I just can't recommend it at all.\n\nFirst and most visibly, there is no manual, or instructions, and people seem to think it's cute that you have to figure this game out yourself. That'd be fine if it were less complicated, but it's actually a pretty intricate game with complex mechanics to it that are VERY frustrating not to know at first. I put this game down for a long time, having given up on it or just assuming it was broken, then only recently found some kind soul had written up a very good description of the game's mechanics. I ended up still disliking it, for the reasons below, but I felt I needed to mention up front that if people can't figure out how to play your game, THAT IS A PROBLEM WITH YOUR GAME. It just is. The cutesy mystery crap around how to play this game is just obnoxious. If all your game has to offer is the mystery of how to play it, that's pretty pathetic.\n\nMoving on. The lack of gamepad support makes this game awkward to play, to say the least. There are no settings, so you can't adjust the key bindings, so basically unless you happen to love the key bindings it comes with (arrow keys with "up" as jump), you're just screwed. Gamepad support isn't hard to implement these days, and this game feels like an incomplete project without it.\n\nSpeaking of the lack of settings, there is only one supported resolution in this game: too damn low if you have anything approaching a modern computer. It's not as big of a deal as the other problems I had, but this is definitely an issue when the window is utterly lilliputian in size. So the playfield size is infinite, but your window into it is non-negotiably small, and there's no full-screen setting.\n\nI can't ever get back the minutes I've wasted trying to play this game. Don't waste yours too.","January 2, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The idea of figuring out how to accomplish tasks with no direction just using the tools of the game itself is actually cool but it really is lost in the random nature and poor implementation of this game.\n\nFirst off the game has no options for video, audio, or controls. I don't expect it to be scalable to large screens but an ability to map controls would've been nice but the fact that you can't mute the audio is very annoying for a puzzle title that is largely based on multiple retrials. I had to turn it down in the system settings to be able to listen to my own music/podcasts. That's one of the main reasons it feels like an unfinished game. Most flash games let you at least mute the volume. Anyway, let's delve into the game itself.\n\n(this gives away the tricks) You are some kind of spaceman-person in this game who gets seeds when you enter a level outside of the hub. The seeds do different things that always end up building blocks to extend the ground and reach a star block. Both a block at the beginning and the star block contaminate the other blocks, blackening them and that spreads, if a black block is touched you go to an opposite world where the everything but the blocks you walk on are solid and the star turns into a key that unlocks a "door" at the black block back at the beginning so you go through at the star block and exit back at the beginning.\n\n(this gives away more) The bright green seed makes bright green blocks that have hearts in them, when you go back to the minus world after getting the key the hearts are collectible and turn into seeds when you go back to the hub. You plant the seeds at the hub and go up to find spaceman-holograms that have cryptic sayings above them and more levels.\n\nThat's all I've found that this is. Which is not enough of a game to me and progression is largely based on the random nature of the seeds you're given and the way the seeds grow the ground blocks, both of these things can make an entire entry into a level pointless because you might get a bunch of good seeds at the beginning and then at the end you only get the dark green seeds that in later levels mean you lose because you can't dig them up in later levels to allow yourself to progress.\n\nAlso, you can complete a level and not get to the exit or collect a heart in time and then it just quits out the level and you lose because it's always good to make you randomly lose for no forseeable reason and again wasted time. It's also possible to enter at the star and completely miss contact with the key because it doesn't take up a whole block and then the entire time spent is wasted because the hitbox of the key is small for some unknown reason.\n\nIf it was easier I wouldn't have liked the game better but I wouldn't have disliked it enough to write this review in the negative. It was a small cheap game that became more unlikable the more I played because there was nothing there but more of the same except with even more limited options to arbitrarily make it harder instead of having variable gameplay.\n\nI don't like feeling like my time is wasted. When the only thing I did wrong was miss the hitbox of a key when dropping into the minus world and I lose 5 minutes of my time for no real reason other than the key's hitbox is small or I got a bad order of seeds then it's not a game I would recommend to anyone and would, in this case, actively discourage it for that feeling of loss that comes coupling puzzles with random chance.","May 23, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

First, the player must discover the control scheme and, soon after, interpret the arcane interface. Second, in the existential vein of game design, the player must determine their purpose and chart the course of their journey. If that journey involves discovering the story and reaching the end of the game, then the next step is to develop the skills needed to outrun the encroaching darkness and satisfy the requirements of the 'challenge levels' in the game.\n\nIf by this late point in the game you understand the control scheme, GUI, have mastered control of your seeds and have discovered that there is, indeed, a story and challenge like levels, then take a moment to step back and realize that this is a game not about gardening, but colonialism.\n\nYou are escaping from an encroaching darkness, but by upsetting the already existing balance of the new world, you bring that same terrible fate upon a place that would have been better off without your existence. Your constructs, your plants, may seem beautiful, but they are merely decorations, fleeting attempts at meaning and growth which simply provide a foothold for the darkness.\n\nWith that alone, you should be able to predict the end of this game and the overall message Starseed Pilgrim conveys. What is the historical outcome of pilgrims, fleeing from persecution and slaughter?\n\nPilgrims bring the same darkness with them and, regardless of their noble intentions, spread the same disease they tried to escape.\n\nIn Starseed Pilgrim, if you can somehow initiate yourself into the esoteric knowledge base required to play and enjoy, then you will not be rewarded further. Knowledge, in this game, is its own reward, and once that has been gained, then the remaining game is very much the equivalent of the Baby-Saving minigame in Stanley Parable: a tedious grind that does indeed become more potent in meaning with time, but spending the required time and effort (and at the time of this review, $5.99) to reach that false 'nirvana' results in self-destruction.\n\nRecommended to those who would appreciate Starseed Pilgrim as a piece of fascinating artwork, the kind of person who wants games to travel the route of James Joyce into oft-inaccessible academia. Definitely not recommended to those looking for a fun romp in an indie game: go play Terraria or Minecraft instead.","November 25, 2013","false","0.2"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

The game doesn't explain itself with a tutorial so at the beginning it's a bit difficult and you have to figure out yourself how it works, but trying to understand it is part of the fun and once you do it gets really interesting. I really recommend it to puzzle fans.","March 12","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlocking all of the levels is not the ending, there is much more to it. If you have not gotten to the third phase, you haven't even scratched the surface of what this game is.\n\nThis is a platformer where you grow platforms by planting seeds. Each seed grows in a unique, slightly random way. Each level has the same basic objective with slightly different rules. Figuring out those rules and the objective requires some logical thinking and some trial and error. Actually accomplishing the objective requires strategy, utilizing your seeds in the most effective way possible, and planning far ahead to how your actions during the first phase will affect your options in the second and third phases.","February 7","true","41.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't but help but compare it to Tetris. In both you're constantly buidling yourself out of puzzle death. This is one of those games you'll start to dream about because it's mesmirizing, challenging, and creative. I loved this game. While the later stages are very strange and the story is simply vague, the game mechanics are brilliant. This is not an easy game. I died a ton of times yet I came back for more. The one downside is that you can sort of master this game. In the later stages I was frankly a little bit bored because I managed to sort out the best way of building without a sweat. However, learning how to master this game WITHOUT any sort of hand-holding or tutorial is the best way to play this game. I really hope they make a sequel, especially with online multiplayer.","May 15","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game, you are given a random sequence of seeds that will grow in a completely random way.  Yes, there are ways you can abet the enemy of randomness by planting them strategically, but unlike something like Tetris, where the player's strategy and direct control ultimately allows them to conquer the RNG, this game turns up the randomness times 10, and when the RNG beats you, it beats you HARD by throwing a wrench in your plans that you can't do anything about.  Imagine if Tetris occasionally gave you an awkward shape that has 20 squares in it.\n\nThe discourse around this game will scoff at you and tell you that you just aren't artsy/smart enough, and you should go back to playing your easy games like CoD and AC, you non-progressive little pleb.  I think this is just an unfortunate legacy from older players whose nascent years were the 80s and 90s, when publishers had to convince us that excessive trial-and-error punishment and RNG-derived difficulty were good things.  If you are fine with (or enjoy) such game design, then you will actually find a really neat puzzle game underneath these things that I hate.\n\nI definitely would have given this a thumbs up if it weren't for how punishing the RNG is, because the concept of the puzzle itself is fun, discovering the mechanics was fun, and the aesthetics were cool.  It definitely isn't worth 6 dollars in my eyes (good thing I got it in a bundle), but I could universally recommend it more if it were around a dollar.","June 3","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
