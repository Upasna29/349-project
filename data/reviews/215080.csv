"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunnysunrise/recommended/215080/","sunnysunrise","sunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunnysunrise/","493 products in account","After having played this game for a fair share of hours (~300 by now) I feel like I am able to give an acceptable review.\n\nUpdated: With the major update for Wakfu on the 9th September 2014 there was quite something added and I will try my best to include it as well.\n\nWhat's Wakfu?\nWakfu is a turn based Strategy-MMO that, to me, feels like a love-child between Ragnarok Online and Fire Emblem. And I love it.\n\nThe player is able to impact the actual economy of the world, meaning that animals, plants and trees have to be taken care of and replanted to keep the natural balance.\nIf that is not the case a species will go endangered or even extinct. Each nation's political system is governed by players that were voted into their ranks by others. They set the law, breaking those will result in you becoming an outlaw. Players joining the guards of their nation can hunt down outlaws and put them in jail to atone for their sins. Justice!\n\nThe graphics may seem not up to date on first glance, however when playing the game one will notice that there is actually a high level of detail in everything.\n\nTo sum up what I like and dislike:\nPros:\n+ Free2Play: There is a Cash shop, however it only sells cosmetic items or Sidekicks that can also be acquired with ingame gold (Kama) instead. You can get your hands on anything without paying a cent as there are many players that sell cash shop items or currency.\n+ 15 classes with three elemental specialisations to choose from.\n+ 17 professions and you can master them all in one character at the same time if you want to.\n+ Strategic gameplay as your composition and line-up can determine success or fail.\n+ Up to two mercenaries (sidekicks) that can help you in solo and even teamplay to substitute missing players/friends\n+ Economical System depending on players\n(Fun fact, the money that circulates through servers is player crafted too)\n+ Nations (4) and a political system governed by players\n(Nations can wage war against each other)\nUpdated - There is now a fifth Bandit Nation players can join.\n+ Many secret places or recipes(!) one can discover in the world that will reward you handsomely.\n+ can be played casually\n+ It's damn cute\n\nCons:\n- The starting area (lvl 1-10): Astrub is not a fun place. You can get out of it luckily in less than an half hour and join a nation. However it wants you to do a few quests that are not fun to do in my opinion and probably put-off a fair share of people before they even really ever started the game.\nUpdated - The whole starting Area was revamped into something much better!\n- Steam and Wakfu: If you wish to play the game via steam, you do not necessarily need an Ankama account, HOWEVER I highly recommend one to you. As you will not be able to play Wakfu whenever steam has connections issues to your server.\nUpdated - You are now able to login with your steam account on the Ankama website that allows you to have all conveniences Ankama Account users have. The server connection problems however may remain.\n- Region bound servers\n- Java: the game runs on java and everyone who played minecraft knows that java's RAM allocation is not great by default for games and you will need to allocate more by customising yours under your system settings. Else after hours of gameplay your wakfu client may slowly start to lag more and more until you relog.\n- Positioning and Terrain: in rare occasions certain big tiles of the map like pillars or similar make it hard to actually click "behind" them to position your character there.\n- Support: Even though I have had an okay experience with the support myself so far, everyone that I have met that had/has severe problems ingame has huge troubles with the support, to the point it feels about non-existent.\n- Grindy: Not a problem to me but I know there's a fair share of people that dislike grinding.\n\nI personally love it and have to admit I have not yet had a game like this and thus it is nice to enjoy something different.\nSo I would give it an 8/10\n\np.s. It has a great anime-like cartoon with two seasons that you should watch!","August 30, 2014","true","715.3"," 397 of 427 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","397","427","7","25"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D_Wormkiller/recommended/215080/","D_Wormkiller","D_Wormkiller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D_Wormkiller/","75 products in account","As a particular lover of turn based games and role playing games in general, I decided to give a try to this MMO. Once he landed on Steam, I got into the beta and started to enjoy the universe of the World of the Twelve.\nDespite having few hours compared to many other players, I can say this game is actually enjoyable and well made. However, there are some factors that could lead some people to avoid this title for various reasons. Let's analize every detail of the game. If you want to skip the wall of text, just go to the end, where there's a short version.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphic is 2,5D Cartoonish - Style, similar to animes. I like it, but somebody may not appreciate it. Colourful environments, characters and enemies (aka mobs).\nHowever, sometimes you'll encouter a bunch of graphical bugs like invisible enemies, sidekicks not appearing, your avatar being nude (yes, you heard it right!) or colors that make your eyes to cry blood (phosphorescent enemies).\nAt last, talking about the active parts of the game, while the enemies are well made and be distinghuished between their gender, the characters (not including npcs) tend to be more feminine. If you give a try to the game, you'll notice that even the males look like females.\n\nSOUND\n\nThere isn't so much to say about the sound. Each sector has its own, enjoyable track, including islands. The only bug you may encounter is an infinite loop after the dungeon of Zeppelantern.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nHere we come, in the longest part of the review. Let's start with the choice of your avatar. You can choose between 15 different races, each one with its peculiarities and abilities. You can even decide if you want to have a male or a female, with the exception of the foggernaut (it's a robot!).\nRegarding the gamestyle, it's a turn - based game during the fights against the mobs and the other players, while it's in real time during your journeys, explorations, harvests and crafts. Yes, because in this game you don't only get experience by killing tons of monsters or by completing dungeons you may access with specific keys and after you reach certain levels, but you can also produce your own items by collecting the resources in the environment and by crafting them in specific workshops.\nYou can also decide to group with some other people (or recruit up to 2 sidekicks) to face evil forces or stronger enemies that you couldn't defeat if you were alone.\nNow the negative aspects of the gameplay. The tutorial itself is kinda crappy, made not properly because it teaches you only some parts of the game. It's useful just to know how's the interface, how to fight and how to collect and plant the enemies in the field in order to generate a wave of monsters to fight. Ah yeah, also to get the starting experience when you'll start with the real game itself.\nThe second most negative aspect is the interface. It isn't intuitive at the beginning, you can't move nor rotate the camera while you're in real time (but you can zoom in and out), while in the turn-based combats you can move it in a way the game doesn't explain. In fact, it doesn't tell you that holding the right button of the mouse and moving the cursor on the borders of your screen will allow you to see the entire battlefield.\nAnd, at last, the quest system of the main missions is kinda...lame. You don't get involved in the main story and you do just some random quests in order to get experience and your first and only free sidekick. But, considering how's the game, you don't play it surely for the main quests.\n\nGAME SYSTEM\n\nThe game is totally f2p. You're granted access to every part of the game (with the exception of the last 2 islands introduced not long ago), you can choose a nation at level 18 and do every kind of job. The nation system will allow you to player versus player fights and each nation has its own peculiarities. You're granted a free sidekick you can keep forever with every single character you make (until 5 per account) plus a free additional sidekick with a weekly rotation system.\nThe real money allows you to buy the sidekicks and keep them forever, cosmetics, costumes and booster packs that let you drop more loot and get more experience (in a small percentage however) plus the access to the last 2 optional islands. However, these zones are reserved for characters around level 140+.\n\nSHORT VERSION\n\nPROS\n\n- 15 races to choose from, with possibility of gender changing, that can reach until level 200.\n- Different zones and islands to explore, with a huge variety of enemies\n- 4 Nations to choose from, each one with its dominant element and peculiarities.\n- PVP, Guilds and PVE system\n- Huge quantity of dungeons, with specific dungeons you may find only in a certain nation\n- Rewarding system well made\n- Great variety of jobs, in harvesting and crafting, letting you to get your own items and to collect kamas (the game currency) fastly\n- Colourful graphics\n- Good sound system\n- Mobs having ehm...sex?\n\nCONS\n\n- Shabby tutorial that teaches few things compared to the real potential.\n- Not-so intuitive interface\n- Main quests system not involving and realized superficially\n- Might be boring if you focus only on getting experience\n- Requires a lot of time and patience, 2 things that most people don't own...unfortunately.\n\nI recommend to try this game at least once to every kind of afficionado of rpgs/mmorpgs. However, if you are included in one of the following categories I'm enlisting, just don't play this game:\n\na) You don't like turn based games\nb) The story and the drama in a game is everything for you\nc) The graphics is the most important thing for you\nd) Anime haters\ne) Average Call of Duty player","October 26, 2014","true","697.5"," 249 of 269 people (93%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","93","249","269","41","7"

I admit, it does speak to an extremely small crowd due to the nature of the genre of game + the amount of grind you must devote. I still have a long way to go before max level (Current level 144, max is 170) So you see it does take a LONGGGG time. If you are fans of disgaea/fire emblem/other turn-based strategy game it MAY or MAY NOT be for you. You must not enter the game with the wrong mindset, and you must find others to play with. The content of the game becomes very difficult and without other players to team up with you are going to have a bad time. The community driven aspect of this game is amazing and this game has one of the best communities I've been a part of.\n\nTHE BAD:\nIf you are starting this game you are going to become overwhelmed in which skills to level, and which specialties to level in which order. I admit that does suck, but there are plenty of guides out there for each class. Another thing you should do is actually read the skills instead of just blindly following a guide. I still learn new strategies/perks on my character everyday!\n\nI hope this gives a good representation of the game; My hours speak for me and I love it!","March 25, 2015","true","738.7"," 153 of 170 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","153","170","10","7"

Everything about the game is completely fantastic and thoughtful and fills a niche that no other multiplayer game really captures.  I couldn't say enough nice things about it.\n\nAll of that comes apart though when you encounter any problems.  Did a glitch eat your stuff?  Tough.  Sending a request to the support group will result in nothing.  Did your class get nerfed right out from under you with no explanation?  Too bad, buy a class change scroll from the cash store for $40, it's your own fault for having played the class.\n\nIf the game's developers had any kind of meaningful dialogue with the players instead of acting like the invisible hand of an angry god, if the community staff actually fostered some kind of two-way communication instead of just passing on the sparse edicts from higher-ups, and if the support team had the people and resources to fix problems for players, Wakfu would be amazing.\n\nInstead I warn people against investing their time or money in this game, and it's a terrible shame because it has brilliant potential.","December 16, 2014","false","177.2"," 310 of 391 people (79%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","79","310","391","12","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theatrum/recommended/215080/","theatrum","Chrispea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theatrum/","673 products in account","Don't let the words, free to play MMO fool you. This game is pretty unique.\n\nI've been playing this game for about 4 years (closed beta) and have sunk in hundreds, if not thousands of hours.\n\nThis game is like Final Fantasy Tactics, to a lesser extent Fire Emblem. If you're a fan of Tactics games or SRPGs read no further, Play the game!\n\nI guess a big deciding factor on whether this game is worth your time is the "pay to play" question.\n\nThe sidekicks can be bought but are on a free rotation in game, a sidekick largely just makes the game more fun to play alone and you'll be using them to fill unfilled spaces in groups. They may save you if you get attacked by another player and you're alone but otherwise their purpose is largely convenience.\n\nXP boosts are pretty self explanatory, however premium members get a large boost on alt accounts.\n\nThere used to be an armour/ weapon set but it seems to be gone now.\n\nItems are otherwise cosmetic.\n\n\nSo, the game?\n\nAmazing.\n\nThis is about as high standard as I could possibly ask for a 2D game.\n\nCombat is played out on a grid, players move their characters on the grid and use abilities to carry out attacks, your weapon is essentially 1 customizable ability. If you've played Final Fantasy Tactics. you're at home.\n\nThe game gives you control over a single character, you will most likely be playing with other people. Seriously, go get yourself into a guild or get some friends together, this game is best played with others. It's all about teamwork, and few games do it so well. You'll quickly learn strategies for the different people you play with, and that moment when someone is just about dead but you pull them through by a thread, using some crazy tactic that only just worked. It's beautful.\n\nThe game is still fun alone, but much less so. You'll want to use your alone time grinding professions, though as far as grinding goes Wakfu certainly isn't offensive. You've always got something to do.\n\nLevelling can be slow though, this is probably less of a problem now and should continue that way as they add new content. It can get a bit samey, but find a good bunch of people and you'll be right.\n\nI think this is Wakfu's biggest strength, it's great at creating a friendly atmosphere and having fun with others. You take turns in fights so you'll be spending the rest of the time co-ordinating the team in chat or just having a laugh. Wakfu is the only MMO i've found that really gets the social aspect right.\n\nThe ecology can be a real pain. People don't care about killing off species so be sure to carry animal 'seed' with you, but doubly so if you want to get into logging or herbs. Despite the annoyance the fact the game takes ecology into account at all is fantastic, you can hunt animals to extiction and level forests.\n\nYou get respecs every so often but be careful with the stats you level, they're permenant. Chances are this won't be a hassle, you'll be given a respec at lvl 30 which is about the time you'll have worked out what you're doing.\n\nThe classes are really interesting, 15 classes but each has 3 elements. The elements act as sub-classes and they have drastically different roles. Water = support/ healer, Earth = Tank/ slow DPS, Fire = DPS/ Nuke, Air = Crowd control, fast DPS; but this varies a lot between classes. It's best to specilize in one element, sometimes two. You'll have about 9 spells you'll likely be working with, the classes do a good job of being simple yet deceptively complex.\n\nPretty soon you'll be in a guild, it's really the only way to play. The PvP is pretty fun too. There are disputed territories players fight over and people can just attack others on the street. These situations are where you'll be really pushing for every tactical advantage, it's often less about min/maxing like in other MMO's and more just getting together and responding to a situation with whatever you've got.\n\nThere's a political system but you'd have to have played the game a hell of a lot to get into that. There's weather systems and a very in depth crafting/ proffesions system, from handymen who make dungeon access keys and inventory upgrades to chefs who give buffs and weapon smiths.\n\nSo cons,\n\nThe game in steam launches a launcher which downloads updates. Would have been nice to remove this. Steam ID's work in game though so no signing up to third party garbage.\n\nThere's a lack of quests, the game is meant to be player driven but that can mean less to do for people playing alone.\n\nyou'll likely level your character faster than you'll level your proffesions which can mean it takes a while before crafting has a benefit.\n\nLevel up points are permanant and if you're not careful you'll be caused some grief on your first character.\n\nNo female foggernaut.\n\nBalance has been a bit shaky in the past, things are fairly good but some classes are definately more useful than others.\n\nNot quite a con but Ankama have been dragged kicking and screaming to the free to play model. They seem to have things fair currently but let's hope they don't screw it up again.\n\nI absolutely recomend this game","September 19, 2014","true","197.9"," 170 of 207 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","170","207","0","8"

This game is grindy and takes time, but if you want to just push buttons and feel good about yourself immediately, then this may not be your game and that's OK.  Sometimes however, effort required to do something makes it have more meaning, and if this is your thing you may just like this :D\n\nThe fact that I can do more in this Free to Play MMO -without restrictions- than I can when I buy a full version of a Total War Game which then gives me the 'chance' to buy a bunch of DLC, is a commentary in itself (on both games, despite different genre / game type and I am a HUGE Total War fan).\n\n*Items- lots of sense of humor with pets, armor, and misc items.  Sort of like the humor of Borderlands, but not quite.  (There's an NPC in a sewer named Donallangelo who essentially is a pun of Ninja Turtles, and pets like a Ghast have descriptions which read 'I ain't afraid of no ghast!' and so on)  Also, importantly, no restrictions on items that I can tell so far if you are free to play.\n\n*Great community - helpful and teamwork is essential.  Let's face it, many MMOs don't care to pretend about requiring teamwork - it's just login, get achievements, and feel good about pressing the level button.  This game is not that.  It's teamwork, has depth, and requires thought.  If that's not your thing - great!  Don't play.  Leave it for people who do because this makes for a great community that works together.\n\n*Graphics - pretty charming and actually really awesome artwork.\n\n*Class system - did I say there were what, 700 million classes?  Well maybe not THAT many, but at least 16. Yes 16, which if you can count as high as WoW classes, well then this is a LOT compared to many MMOs.  Beyond that, yea it's complicated "Oh noes! Don't try! Too hard!", wrong!  A game with some complexity is a great thing, its not going to hand you things, but its not going to stomp your face in either by giving you experience debt you need to clear by using item shop items (Runes of Magic).\n\nButt weight, there's more! (and yes those awful wrong use of word errors got your attention!):  You pick a class, then you have 5 tabs of stuff to put points into, so not only are there a ton of classes to pick from, but there's a very custom way you can build your char.  If you're not sure, look it up or ask someone.  Find a guild -\n\n*Guilds - did I say find a guild?  Find a guild!  Guilds matter in this game, and apparently there's even complicated politics with certain Nations owning certain regions etc.\n\n*Crafting - there's several paths to take, and you can do all professions.\n\n*It's free, and they give you a House, 5 character slots, you can wear all the gear, they let you use the AH, you can sell items remotely too apparently by dropping a bag and selling.\n\n*Gathering - there is this very cool anti-bot system, where if you are gathering it comes up like a 'fight' with this npc, but actually you and it just stand apart from one another and you have to select the same images around you as it has.  If you do this correctly, you get bonus resources and not just a few either.  Pretty sweet and easy!\n\n*Biomes - I don't even know what this is and I'm excited!  (:S  review pending here)  Also plenty of environments it seems and cool stuff in each.\n\n*Nations- player driven, can elect govenors of Nations, collect taxes, set foreign policy, control regions, etc.  Like Eve but without the crying about how broken capital ships are.\n\n*Pvp is a thing, more to come (tm).\n\nI'd say overall, having not spent any money on it, having joined a guild where folks are really helpful and kind, I would say check this game out.  It's free, all it costs you is bandwidth for a bit and you may find you like it. If not, you tried it and can move on to other games.","August 2, 2015","true","72.9"," 127 of 148 people (86%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","86","127","148","23","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostofthatgirl/recommended/215080/","ghostofthatgirl","ghostofthatgirl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostofthatgirl/","61 products in account","I would love to give Wakfu an amazing review...I really would. And I would have a couple of months ago, when I was glued to the screen leveling up my Osamoda. Unfortnately, after over 1500 hours, I've come to the conclusion that Wakfu is a huge time-suck with no true, fulfilling end-game.\n\nI have created a huge assortment of characters, trying to figure out the spells and play-styles that suit me. And while I love the handful (five) I have ended up with (Osa, Sac, Masq, Sadida, Elio), they just aren't enough to hold me to the game. Starting a new character means reliving questlines over and again...some of which have not even been finished by the developers...but which sit in your quest log and stare at you...day-in and day-out (the developers are apparently working on these...but who knows how long the questlines have been waiting to be finished up. Instead, they release new holiday material and conveniently ignore gameplay that needs to be addressed). and the monotony of the quests becomes unbearable. Your char is sent across different maps to collect items and talk to various NPC's, and it's a never-ending pace of back-and-forth-back-and-forth. Nothing changes, even though your characters do. Still, quests are all a must-do if you want your char to have special items or open up new areas that are inaccessible otherwise. So, if you take on another character...and then another...expect that you'll be bored to tears speaking to Pappy Pal and chasing after books across Astrub to obtain your dragoturkey.\n\nSpeaking of monotony...grinding is almost mandatory if you want to get anywhere. Professions can be ignored for only so long. Leveling each profession up takes a *lot* of time and patience. However, if you want to make kamas, you have to chop wood, pick herbs, trap animals, mine rocks, etc...as selling these items, or crafting with them, is the only way to really make kamas at the market. And the market is difficult to navigate, as searching for a particular item brings up only the cheapest for sale, instead of a list to choose from. This is frustrating for the simple fact that equipment is element based...and you're forced to spend kamas on equipment that you have to change to suit your particular elements...which also requires kamas. Dungeon runs gift you special coins with which to purchase new equipment, but the gear is often so expensive that it's not worth the time it takes to complete said dungeon the twenty or thirty times it takes to acquire said gear. And once acquired, that gear is linked to your character...so forget selling it at the market in hopes of upgrading to something else when the time arrives. Instead, you are forced into a grind of dun-runs. Quite often, the monotony becomes mind-numbing. Who honestly wants to pick 250 herbs or trap 250 animals just to level up a solitary profession one level---especially when each profession has 100 levels.\n\nEach new area opened quickly loses its appeal after battling its monsters and dungeons. I hit level 120 with two of my characters...and I am *still* awaiting something new to come along at level 132. Who knows when that will be. Probably never. My time with this game is quickly drawing to a close.\n\nPVP is, oftentimes, hugely unbalanced. Characters fifty levels over you can attack you (even if you have PVP deactivated), and there is absolutely no chance at making it out alive. And forget fairness. If you manage to combat a character around your level, and win the duel, you can be sure the player will log in with a much higher level char just to hunt you down and attack you---or call their higher level friends to do it for them. And you can be sure that some of the higher levels are strapped to the teeth with the best equipment/gear...courtesy of the cliques formed within guilds and groups. Also, fair warning: during PVP, you will be insulted, and often. If your enemy doesn't like your character or playstyle, expect to be called a plethora of rude names.\n\nAnd forget if you need help from Ankama. You pretty much have to sacrifice your unborn children to accomplish reporting a technical issue. They want detailed reports and multiple screenshots for each and every problem (no matter how small the problem is), and even after complying...very little is done to fix the problem(s).\n\nI loved this game at first. The graphics and music and spells and char classes are brilliant. But more thought needs to be put into the game and the gameplay. Because, as is, the hours spent in front of Wakfu are just not worth it when all is said and done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","April 5","false","548.8"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","60","65","0","5"

I am still going through my experience but from what I've played of it so far I can give a fair and detailed review of it. I will cover it in four sections; tutorial, gameplay, combat and community. I would also like to mention that I used to pay for and play this game when it was still in open beta about four to five years ago.\n\nTutorial:\nThe tutorial for Wakfu reminds me very much of the character actors at Didney Worl; they never break character. Your UI can give you all the information you need to break the fourth wall but when it comes time to learn from an NPC they will talk to you, the player, as if you are your character. The NPCs outside of the tutorial follow suit to this.\n\nAnkama has made one class exclusively for the tutorial which, in my mind seems rather pointless. Back in beta the reason I bothered going through the tutorial areas was so I could get a proper feel for my actual class before I committed to playing it. That said, you can opt to skip the tutorial. I wouldn't advise that if you are a brand spanking new player.\n\nGameplay:\nWakfu is what most people call a grindfest, but there is reason behind it I like to think. Monsters will drop items that are guaranteed to end up being used for something, no matter the level. Gear can either be combined into sets to be sold, worn or even ground into powder which can be refined into runes to improve the gear you use.\n\nKilling mobs and running quests aren't the only thing you can do in this game, you may also pick up professions. All of them in fact, conveniently located in the starter area known as Astrub. With this in mind a lot of players tend to lean towards one or the other based on their mood at the time. I personally rarely fight and would rather just go farm wheat fields.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat in Wakfu is unique, something I've never seen in an MMORPG. Ever played Final Fantasy Tactics? This is it. You (and your teammates if you brought any) as well as monsters have a set initiative score, which is a stat you can increase. Those with higher initiative go first and you follow along a grid-based system to fight your enemies. Your character has access to a plethera of passive abilities (able to swap them out between battles on the fly as you unlock them), class-specific utility skills and three skill trees, each one has an element (meaning that you will have access to three of the four elements, I advise you to look through them when you make your character even if you haven't unlocked them).\n\nThe player versus player content this game provides comes in some different ways, but ultimately ends up the exact same. There are four nations that you may pick from to be your home upon reaching level 15, with the option to join an outlaw nation at level 30... I wouldn't recommend this though and some people get confused. Let me break this down real quick, if you play this game and hit level 30 you'll recieve a quest called "Riktus for a Day." Do not complete this quest, you will automatically join the outlaw nation that only has one outpost in the ocean and are free game for anyone wherever you go. Aside from this, at level 30 you can opt to become a guard of your nation, sworn to protect the land from Riktus, eco-terrorists (will cover this in another section) and PKers.\n\nAnother feature to note for combat are sidekicks. They are NPCs that can act as party members you control. They aren't as powerful or versatile as players but they get the job done when you need it. Part of the beginner quest is going through a dungeon, rewarding you at the end with an Astrub Knight. This is the only sidekick you get for free, with the addition of the free trial sidekick. Out of Ankama's list of sidekicks, one is chosen every so often as a free trial. Kind of a try before you buy sort of thing, this gives you the option of not only playing as yourself and the Astrub Knight, but a third teammate once every...I wanna say three weeks but I honestly never noticed. These guys don't offer what other players can provide and you can easily solo your way the entire game with a little patience, the sidekicks only offer you some help along the way.\n\nOverall the PvP in this game is pretty fun so long as you don't get stacked against someone much higher level than you.\n\nCommunity:\nAs far as I've seen, pretty dead. I wish I could say this, but in the town hubs (Astrub and nation outposts) there are people everywhere. The further out you go you see less players though, most of them are hidden in small haven bags (which act as a portable home and player shop) either afk selling their wares or just plain afk. That said, if you're looking at only the game's point of view then you are sadly missing out, the wiki for this game is regularly updated and the forums always has people poking their heads in to say hello. That said, if you plan to play this game for a while then get into a guild ASAP, I suggest you head over to the forums to find one to your liking.\n\nBefore I finish, I want to add that this game does have a cash shop. Is it pay to win? Not really, most of the things you can buy are either cosmetic or do really minor things. You can buy weapons but they don't compare to the gear you can find and make. You may also buy extra sidekicks which can help out, but aside from your Astrub Knight you have access to a different free trial sidekick every once in a while.\n\nOverall:\nSteam is asking me if I recommend this game and do I? I'm a little torn, but yes I do. This is a very fun game with combat mechanics that require you to actually think when things don't go as planned. The community is there and very friendly but only if you take the time to actually look for them. When you're feeling bored of grinding mobs, go grind resources! Its tedious but addicting after a while.\n\nTL;DR\nGame is fun, try it out.

Game's likely an 8/10 for you.\nAre you a Quester?  2, maybe 3/10. There's one questline in the intro town to get you up to your Nation, then that's it.\nDo you just love FFT-style battle systems? 6 or 7/10.\nYou play Solo and "irrationally hate" Multiboxers? 5/10, you won't get too awful far alone after a point.\n\nLong Version:\nI played Dofus waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back when it first came out as a freaking zip file full of HTML files that was the actual game itself. I was hooked pretty quick, but like with all games, I eventually moved on. I tried to come back later and heard about Wakfu and both games had gone into EA-levels of Pay to Play mode, trying to lure you in with "Free" gameplay but it really only gave you 5 levels and then locked -everything- behind paywalls. However!\n\nFrom what I understand and have experienced so far, the Steam Release saw the removal of many of these Paywalls. No Exp nerfs or locking entire chunks of content behind them. It also saw major revamps to the classes, mobs, and loot drops(And as such, I can't find a damn thing I need to know about the game because it's all outdated at this time, lol). Another However, though...\n\nThere is an insane amount of Grind focus. You HAVE to grind to level. There are NO Questlines, at the time of this review, beyond the Initial line to get you to Choose your Nation. There's a few "small" ones spattered about, such as your Mount quests, and Daily Quests you can do once a day at each "Bag-Icon" Camp location(their name escapes me, Something or other's Disciple) for a small chunk of exp boost, but generally they consist of "Bring me 10 Drops from nearby Mobs."\n\nDungeons are hit and miss, too. I've seen Gimmicky ones that were fun puzzles, but most of them are "Fight 2-3 large packs of mobs thematic to the dungeon, then fight a huge group with a Boss Monster in it at the end" - Good exp generally, but difficult, especially if Solo. Sidekicks and friends ease this to an extent, and the game is also Multiboxer friendly so you can run "yourself" if you have the know-how and patience. Dungeon entrances require 1 Key per Player/Sidekick, though, and yup! Those Keys only drop from mobs outside the dungeon, some of which are rarer than others. If you disconnect(on purpose or accident) or die, you can't re-enter without a new key, which can happen if AI RNG decides to gang-bang and focus-fire on you alone. (And possibly not even the same one your group is in. I've not tested that yet.)\n\nSo, would I recommend the game? Yeah, at least for awhile. If you can stand Grinding, you might just love it. If not, it's at least a fun distraction for awhile.","September 24, 2014","true","63.8"," 57 of 67 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","57","67","2","4"

With 15 classes that can be built in many ways, you're bound to find one with a play style that you enjoy. Team up with up to 5 others to run dungeons and Ultimate Bosses!\n\nNo friends? Ankama have that covered too! With a couple of sidekicks by your side nothing will stop you!\n\n\nThere are 10 craft professions (not including Kama minting) and 6 gathering skills all of which, with some effort, can be leveled to maximum.\n\nThe enviroment and politic system are maintained by the players. Everything that happens within these will affect other players in some way. For example, Governers of each nation are players themselves and are voted in by you, the player. Planting too many mobs or plants in an area will disrupt the enviroment, as will killing too many of them. Distrupt the enviroment too much and you'll become an Outlaw! You'll be fair game for any passing Guard or regular Joe to aggro you...\n\n\nAs the game is still in development. There are A LOT of things that are going to be added or changed fairly soon™. Guild verses guild, a revamp of its guard vs outlaw system, a couple of class revamps along with a lot of other brand new content.\n\nThe game is extremely grindy at times but that's what you expect of an mmo, and there IS still a kind of subscription system in play, which has been recently renamed to "Booster Packs". Subscribers get access to the newest content, a shared chest, +10% drop rates, +30% kama drops (the currency) and +30% exp along with some other minor things.\n\nAs to why I only gave it a 6/10. That is solely down to Customer Support themselves.\n\nThe game, has had and still does have major bugs and issues which may make you reconsider playing. Things such as complete inventory/haven bag wipes and/or characters dissapearing combined with Customer Support ignoring tickets can be very disheartening.\n\nSaying that, these are rare cases and the charm of the game will likely outweigh this. The game is very playable as f2p and I highly recommend playing this game.\n\nOh Snap xXx\n2 years Wakfuing","August 2, 2014","true","68.4"," 127 of 182 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","127","182","0","7"

Which means, they bring you along, but you give them item drops in return to come along. This is probably the worst thing about the Nox (North American) community.\n\n- Ankama in general ignores the North American region in terms of feedback and communication. Which is always hard as foreign companies based in foreign countries have a harder time bonding with the community. The moderators and staff very rarely visit the NA forum. In fact, other than Sabi, we have little to no interaction with them at all.\n\n- Very grindy gameplay; this has been improved a lot very recently, but it is still unbelievably painful to get anywhere. This ties into the first point a lot as well. Progression screeches to a crawl after level 100 and without a dedicated group finder, you're basically solo (unless you have friends that also play) 90% of the time. People even go so far as to multibox 3-6 accounts just to not be alone. Which I suppose is an entirely different level of alone.\n\nAll in all; it's not a bad game, it has its moments, but dear god after 2 years, they are only now starting to fix a few glaring issues that have been prevalent since day 1.\n\nMy score as a standalone title: 6.5/10.\nCompared to most other MMOs: 7.5/10.\n\nWarning: They will try to milk you for as much money as they can get away with.\n\nMy reply to their support after being denied for another thing I needed help with.

I had basically given up on the genre, as there is very little variation beyond setting. When I saw Wakfu on Steam for the first time, I overlooked it. The artwork was not my favorite, and the name of the game itself didn't draw me in at all. It wasn't until a few days later that I was looking through the games again that I decided to look closer.\n\nWhat I saw reminded me of when I'd spend hours at a time playing one of my favorite games of all time, Final Fantasy Tactics. Most Tactical RPG's do that to me, as their style is so distinct in comparison to other genres. The grid on the floor is a dead give away to any one remotely familiar with the genre. Armed with some nostalgic goggles, I dove deeper in to the game Wakfu.\n\nWakfu is a mix of Tactical RPG combat, with MMORPG sprinkles to top things off while you're not in battle. You'll find your usual culprits; Proffessions split into gathering and crafting, Taxi locations for fast travel, an Auction House in the form of a "market", and Mounts and Costumes to show off how cool you are, just to name a few of the things you'll recognize from the MMO genre. Most of the activities within the game are easily recognized standards that even people who have only played something like Minecraft should be able to pick up quickly. It also tries to do it's own things, like a completely player run government, and an eco system than can give bonuses if its in a good shape.\n\nThe battle system is also pretty standard as far as Tactical RPG's go. Veterans will be able to pick up the battle system quickly, as soon as they understand the some times confusing tool tips for their spells. Combat takes place on a field created when you start the fight with monsters in the world. Each participant is put in order based off their "Initiative" stat. The batle then goes by in turns. Each combatant is restricted by how many tiles on the grid they can move, how far their spells can hit, and how much those spells cost. Of course this sounds simple, but like any great Tactical RPG, there is a lot of depth in this simplistic system, than can only be found out the longer you play. The classes range from simple to complex. RPG veterans will be able to pick up classes like Cra, Osamodas, and Sram, and easily identify them as your typical Archer, Summoner, Assassin. Then they will look at classes like Feca and Foggernaut, and scratch their head a bit. What you'll find seems to be missing is the quests. After storming through the opening area-Astrub-you'll be left to your own devices. Sure there are quests you can do, but they can be hard to find, since there is no mini map, and no indication of who gives you these quests. This can make leveling very unfocused until you learn how to recognize where these quests will be.\n\nWakfu has a very light hearted atmosphere. Jokes are common in dialogue and most of them worth a chuckle, especially once you start to understand the games lore. Enemies have idle animations and will use in game emotes, that allow them to be their own characters rather than just another random creature for you to mow down. The artistic design fits well, its very animated and colorful, adding more life to the world they've created. For those really enjoying the Wakfu setting, theres even an Anime now, allowing you to see the world in a more cinematic presentation.\n\nUnfortunately, the Music and Sound is lacking here. The sounds can get downright repetitive and annoying. You'll know what I'm talking about when you experience being stuck loading up your character select screen and you hear those cogs for 10 minutes straight, or someone is spamming emotes near you. The music on the other hand, is just all together forgetable. I couldn't tell you what one song on this game sounds like, because none of them are memorable at all.\n\nThe other strike against this game, is how much is locked behind a paywall. The game itself is free, but there is a lot that you have to pay for, that I don't think you should. For one, the mounts. You can get a mount in game for free, but its terrible. If you want a good one, you gotta pay. The other thing, is many costumes and emotes are up for purchase. Costumes I might understand, Vanity items are often sold in free games, but why emotes? Most games let you have all emotes from the start, but this one forces you to unlock them. Or in some cases, buying them is the only way to get them. Its not all bad, some of the things offered in the shop are very good, and I understand why you must pay for things like Nation Changes, or Class changes, even if they are over priced in my opinion.\n\nWhile I recognize this game wont be for everyone, it is for me. The blend of an MMO and Tactical RPG is right up my alley, but I'd say you probably have to enjoy Tactical RPG's more than MMORPG's. I could easily see fans of Ogre Tactics, Disgea and Final Fantasy Tactics enjoying this, but if you find yourself more of a WoW, Rift, or Old Republic fan, you might find this is an overly simplified version. If you're relatively new to either genre, this is a great place to start.","December 13, 2014","true","614.9"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","41","48","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buddhano/recommended/215080/","buddhano","chamillion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buddhano/","156 products in account","Overall Review/TL;DR (7.5)\nOverall I give this game (as of 8/5/2014) a 7.5/10. I'm primarily more in to the FPS and MOBA genres, but the visuals of this game were enough for me to give it a try. To start, the art-style is beautiful, the soundtrack is pleasant and gives the game a nice ambiance, and the animations are amazing! The gameplay (from what I've played so far, which is the tutorial) feels a bit slow, and I feel like the tutorial was unnecessarily long (although I believe you can skip it to begin playing the game), and the controls took a bit for me to get used to, but other than that I feel like this is definitely one of the better MMO's you can find on Steam (not to mention it's free!). I'd say download it, try it, and see if you enjoy it.\n\n\n\nFull Review\nThis is the first MMO I've played in a long time, and it's probably one of the first turn-based strategy games I've been able to play for more than an hour. My opinion is more focused from the average FPS/MOBA player's point of views, please keep that in consideration while reading my review.\n\nVisuals (9)\nThe only reason I decided to try this game when I got a hold of a closed beta key was the visuals of the game, and once I entered the game they really, really impacted my overall thoughts on the game. The game is beautiful, and the art style is perfect. Not to mention the game's animations are amazing, they truly and firmly "say what needs to be said"... if that makes sense. Not to mention character customization is great and makes you really feel unique. The only reason I didn't rate the game's visuals 10/10 was because majority of the playable characters all seem fairly feminine and cuddly, while my goal when I was creating my character was to be masculine and fairly intimidating. In the character creation, I didn't realize there was an option to switch from male to female and actually thought several of the male character choices were supposed to be female! Regardless, the game is GORGEOUS and fresh, there's no doubt about that.\n\nControls (6)\nWhen I first tried the game, the controls weren't really what I was used to. Being a primarily FPS/MOBA gamer, it definitely felt weird left clicking to where I needed to be and right-clicking on things to interact with them, and one thing that really bothered me at first was the fact that there wasn't edge-scrolling and that the camera wasn't centered on my character the entire time (although I have suggested on the forums to add edge-scrolling and/or the camera focusing on the charcter), and a little bit in I felt a bit tired of clicking everywhere I went, so I feel like the controls weren't the greatest but still worked enough for me not to give up completely.\n\nAudio (8)\nThe game's soundtrack is great, it has this... warmth to it I guess, and it really makes the experience pleasant for me. The sounds are good too, and I feel go almost perfectly with the visuals! A few sounds are a tad bit annoying to hear, like these little rabbits (known as "Woodlets" I believe) that did this sort of... giggle, and it slightly bothered me after hearing it (or a certain variation of it) every time I attacked one of them. Other than that the audio is great and well-fitting for the game's style.\n\nGameplay (7)\nThe game plays fairly smoothly, from what I've played (the tutorial) it seems like the game is mainly just accepting tasks and engaging in them (like most MMO's), but the tasks aren't always the same thing over and over, so it doesn't really get stale. The game is a bit slow-paced though, which I'm not very used to. The combat is good, and the spells are unique and fun to use and learn. The only reason the gameplay got a 7/10 was because the tasks seem slightly boring and overall not very exciting (to me). Regardless though, I feel like I'll definitely be coming back to this game to play several more hours.\n\nTry or nahhhh?\nDefinitely try, it's a quick download and is a great experience, I'd highly recommend this game to any gamer (besides my brother, the only games he plays are those of the Call of Duty franchise... that poor, sad little man.)\n\nThank you for your time, consideration, and for reading my first review! Feel free to comment anything you have to say about it and/or questions you have for me about the game!\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour friendly neighborhood (not to mention 15 year-old) Sweatshirt.","August 5, 2014","true","2.7"," 58 of 79 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","58","79","0","2"

Want to learn a class quickly so you can get to smashing things up, whilst being as powerful as any other damage class? Iop's for you. Want a class that's difficult to master and has tons of things to learn about and with synergies to discover? Xelor might be your pick. I had to cycle through nearly all of the classes and test them out before I decided to settle with Rogue. or you could just be a fat stinky lazy Cra and shoot arrows from the far back all day i mean geez\n\n+The game also has a virtually completely playerbased economy, with little to no "pricing metas".That means you can sell whatever you want at whatever price, and if someone thinks that's pretty legit, or even a steal, they'll buy it. At-least, I haven't seen too much of a meta other than higher level stuff = more money, and pets/costumes/emotes/all that = a high price.\n\n+There's 15+ Professions to choose from which can help this economy out.There's lots of demand for people who are high-enough level in professions, and some people will pay kilograms(tonnes?) worth of cash to just acquire the stuff they can make. From the Baker, who bakes bread(duh) to heal health and give small maxhealth boosts, to the Handyman who can make dungeon keys, crafting workshops, and more. Speaking of...\n\n+Haven Bags / Haven Worlds and Guilds, your own little slice(s) of the worldHaven Bags are basically transportable 'homes'. You can decorate them, expand them out with Haven Gems(acquired through multiple means that don't cost realworld money), craft using purchasable workstations(at a hefty price, those things don't come cheap), and even grow crops inside of your bag.\n\nYeah, that's right. You can carry a farm with you. Crazy stuff.\n\nHaven Worlds, however, are Haven Bags but on a much bigger scale, designed with big guilds in mind. You can do everything a Haven Bag can do there, and even more. Set your spawn point there, spawn mobs(usually penned up to stop them rampaging everywhere and breeding wildly), and probably lots of other stuff that I don't know about because I haven't done haven worlds too much and I can't be bothered to look at a wiki.\n\n+Woah, this game isn't Pay 2 Win?Not exactly. More like "Pay to make everything grindy a little easier", or "Pay to look cool". From EXP bonuses to emotes/costumes to restat scrolls to class switches. (The last two have 30 day cooldowns, I believe. Don't worry, Ankama has standards.)\n\nPlus, costumes/emotes from the store are tradable, which means people can sell them on the market. No need to fork out realworld cash when you can earn it with blood, sweat, tears, and mostly time. Definitely a lot of time.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhich brings me to my first con:\n\n\n-The grind is real.Literally just that. Both your level /and/ your professions are going to be a total grindfest. I feel like lots of people are deterred by this, and it makes some essential professions(like Trappers, who spawn in mobs because most ecosystems don't spawn mobs themselves)an endangered species or something. It does, however, pay off. Perhaps you can even make some money from it.\n\nWakfu does try to ease combat grinding with 'Challenges', though. Things like 'Do not get hit from the back', or 'Kill two enemies in one turn', which awards a bonus EXP/Loot percentage/chance/whatever. Only slightly eases it, though. It'll feel like a chore to some.\n\nI believe this puts a lot of people off from continuing to play the game, too. Especially if you're soloing.\n\n\n-Solo play can feel boring.Wakfu's a 2.5D turnbased strategy RPG. These kinds of games are usually pretty boring on their own, and more allies/characters/players makes the game more engaging and fun, /especially/ when there's diversity, which Wakfu shines at with its 15+ classes. It leads to another problem, though, which I discussed at the very beginning.\n\n\n-There's a void of players between early and end-game.Naturally, joining a Guild fixes this, though. Lots of guilds like recruiting at Astrub, the starting hub of the game.(Past Incarnum. That's the tutorial level.) Don't be shy! Ask a guildie to invite you. It'll be worth your while. (Certainly was for me. Big shoutout to 'The Secret Society' people, especially if they're reading this 'u')\n\nAnd one final thing.\n\n???This game certainly isn't for everyone, especially if you rush people into it.If you want friends to tag along, do your best to be nice and slow about it. Let them grasp the game by themselves. I find Wakfu to be a very 'learn at your own pace' kinda game. You can not know the inner works of your class, but you can still play it and win battles. It isn't like Dota(oh boy im gonna get flamed for this) where you have to learn an entire character to play them successfuly and win, otherwise you get flattened out.\n\n\n---SUMMARY AND WHAT I THINK OF THE GAME---\nEven with  its' flaws and its' grind and its' poorish solo play, I still enjoy Wakfu and rate it one of the best MMORPGs I've played. Compared to every other standing MMORPG on the market, I'd say this is an amazing little gem in the rough that needs more attention. The server populations are always low, and never full. I'd love it if we could get Wakfu a thriving community again.\n\nDo share this review, or even the game with your friends! Who knows, they might've been looking for a game like this. Thanks for reading. 'ω'","May 11","true","443.6"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vascus/recommended/215080/","vascus","Aleksandros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vascus/","454 products in account","Did you love Final Fantasy tactics?\nDo you love that feeling of accomplishment despite the hellish pain of constant death that rivals even Dark Souls? Do you love deep tactical rewarding strategy based combat?\n\nThen Wakfu will probably be the game for you. On its cute and pristine exterior, there's a huge amount of depth and punishing dungeons and temples. This isn't your average MMO, you wipe in a temple that can take nearly an hour to complete? Well that's too bad, you'll have to start from the very beginning. This isn't some game you can get away with spamming. Positioning, timing and execution is key. Even basic battles against mobs have a strategic depth to them that feels foreign to an MMORPG.\n\nThis game runs on turn based grid combat, you level your character like any other in an RPG, however each element has its specialties. Fire is typically AOE (area of effect) , Earth is typically direct damage, Water is usually healing or mobility debuffs or buffs with some damage mixed in. Air is usually knockbacks or line telegraph attacks. But that's only typically, each class feels extremely different. From manipulating time, to picking up your foes and tossing them, to entirely relying on lady luck in combat. Wakfu brings a whole new fresh style to combat that I've never experienced in an MMO before.\n\nWords of warning, if you like questing, you'll find it extremely lacking on quests until you reach the out-lying islands of the nations of the World of Twelve. However they continue to work on updating the game with more quest lines that guide you into areas. I say your first real challenging quest chain is on the Wild Estates, where a mixture of puzzle solving, challenging battles, even sports and an Indiana Jones style hunt for an artifact will take center stage. Did I mention its really hard? Because, it's really bworking hard!\n\nThere's a large slew of crafting professions, an entirely player run economy, and the most challenging PVE MMO experience I've ever had. As for the PVP I haven't experienced too much of it. It depends on the server you join but the economy has been somewhat at a standstill and it's more likely you will get trades from your haven bag or face to face than the market. Kamas, the games currency aren't all that hard to get however, especially considering you can mint them yourself.\n\nThe game honestly encourages you to find what best suits you, upon recently they updated both the starting area, stat rework making it much more easy to slide into if you're a new player all the while keeping the depth I've mentioned. If you still find yourself in trouble with having a hard time getting started.  Use these newly made video tutorials that Ankama has provided with the steam release, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaiMvAWwvVTQ_zgPDYP9mozBuwR8VjgwD\n\nAll in all, Wakfu is a beautifully designed, deep and well made game that is literally the most challenging experience I've had in an MMO, rivals even what I experienced in my days of EVE in terms depth of combat. There's really a whole slew of possibilities you can approach a battle based on your class and playstyle, those possibilities yet nail biting, hair pulling difficulty is something I do have to admit that I love. We need more games like Wakfu, not MMOs, just games period. This game is the XCOM: Enemy Unknown of MMOs, it's about as tense too. Give the game a shot, add me on Steam if you'd want to party up, don't be afraid to ask questions to the community either, they're quite understanding and helpful, there will be a few bad eggs I'm sure.\n\n\nIn closing, Wakfu is a generously made game, with a lot of love and hardwork put into it, down to the extremely artistic style handcrafted areas, and the lovable design. I would also recommend the first season of the newly released English dubbing of the show. If you tend not to like English dubs, there should be the native French soon enough with English subs. You can also find them online. With a new  third season of the Wakfu anime, a spin off prequel Dofus aux tresors de Kerubim and two movies in the works, a boardgame, and mangas/comics, you can expect more from this game and them on the horizon. So keep an eye out!","October 1, 2014","true","171.0"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

Unfortunately it kind of spiraled into a huge mess after Ankama rolled out changes that completely split the playerbase. Some people really loved the changes. Others, like me, really hated them.\n\nWhile I personally wouldn't get back into the game in its current state, I wouldn't turn anyone away from checking the game out if only for the novelty. It IS a good-looking game with good-looking mechanics, unfortunately marred by excessive grindiness and a not-so-nice playerbase.","April 29","true","141.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","0"

The gameplay kinda similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, but you only control 1 character, well. with sidekicks though, but still not much.\n\nNow on to the review.\n+ So many different class to choose of.  Each class have quite a lot of skill, you could make your own unique build.\n+ There's a profession system in this game, so apart from the main game itself, you could become a farmer, a blacksmith, tailor, and many more.\n+ Community oriented game, you can't sell your stuff to NPC, this game is really community based game, you must actually sell it to people, or... just throw it out. There's Region president election, Guild, and many more. You can join the bad guys, or become a guard instead.\n+ For people who prefers playing alone, there's a sidekick system. At least, there's someone to accompany you. Though, i recommend you playing with actual players.\n\n\n- The community is almost non-existent, many people said this game is still alive, but that's not applied in my case.  I'm playing in asia server, not sure about other server though.\n- Grindfest, and it's even worse than other MMO in general in my opinion.\n- Customization, There's costume and stuff, but... well, it's not rare to see people with a same face.\n- Progression, this game had quite an interesting story, but to progress in the main story is really hard. The level gap to actually progress in this game is really high.\n\nIf you have a friend to play with you, i really recommend this game, It's really fun to play wakfu together. If not, find one\nright away, join a guild, and have fun.\n","June 11, 2015","true","206.4"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","27","34","2","0"

Imagine um RO evoluído: com controle do ambiente feito pelos jogadores; itens super diversos feitos por jogadores; política feita por jogadores; risco de deixar seu personagem ruim se não pensar direito na build, guerras e tratados de paz, etc. Mas também temos o grind, que se você não diversificar fazendo outras atividades (que não são poucas) te deixará entediado.\n\n•  Wakfu é muito bem desenhado.\n\nÉ um jogo bonito, não se pode negar. Seus equipamentos são realmente usados por personagens carismáticos, que começam usando coisas "fofas", que transparecem bastante o "newbie", para um dia ficarem imponentes e ameaçadores. Os locais visitados possuem características fortes, que deixam claro, por exemplo, a nação daquele território, e visitar os mapas é sempre agradável.\n\n• Wakfu é estratégico.\n\nHá muitos elementos estratégicos em Wakfu, do combate (que é feito por turnos) até como você lida com o ambiente com seu personagem. Há estratégia no craft, na política (que oferece diversos cargos para os jogadores), no estilo de jogo dos personagens e na interação entre eles, nos itens que você usará, nas habilidades, enfim, falar em Wakfu é falar em estratégia.\n\nEntão se você chegou até aqui, dê uma chance ao jogo. Uma vez nele, leia, entenda-o, sinta-se livre de verdade, sem um caminho pré-definido a seguir. Não se prenda às missões, faça-as quando quiser, se quiser. Use a janela de archievements para guiar seus objetivos e viva o mundo de Wakfu à sua maneira.\n\nE faça o tutorial!\n\n______\n\n• Wakfu is the most F2P MMORPG in the market.\n\nBeginning with this phrase for you to make sure that he is really free, no limiters on what to do, and rightfully so I must support him by buying items I like in Ogrine shop.\n\n• Wakfu has sandbox in his veins.\n\nIf you played Ragnarok Online, then you're already trained to Wakfu. Imagine a RO evolved: the control of environment made ​​by the players; various items made ​​by players; policy made by players; risk of build your character wrong, wars and peace treaties, etc. But we also have the grind, if you do not diversify doing other activities (which are many) that leave you bored.\n\n• Wakfu is very well designed.\n\nIt's a beautiful game, one can not deny. The equipment is actually used by charismatic characters, who start using "cute" things, which are reflected quite the "newbie" for a day become imposing and threatening. The locals visited have strong characteristics which make it clear, for example, the nation that territory, and visit the maps is always nice.\n\n• Wakfu is strategic.\n\nThere are many strategic elements in Wakfu, the fight (which is done in turns) to how you handle the environment with your character. There are craft strategy, politics (which offers various positions for the players), the game style of the characters and the interaction between them, the items you will use, skills, finally, speaking Wakfu is speaking strategy.\n\nSo if you got this far, give the game a try. Once there, read, understand it, feel free indeed, without a pre-defined path to follow. Do not hold on to the quests, do them when you want, if you want.

This did not help when the promising new update of Moon Island and Heroes where it basically made everyone play by themselves and did not have to rely on anyone else to do dungeons anymore. Things became very introvert and very independent.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this game if you start this year and on.

Plant some trees but don't cut too many down, want to hunt some monsters? Make sure too many of them don't get killed but also don't let there be too many ect ect. There are generally laws in place to help keep it balanced.\n\n6: Character Classes, there are a total of fourteen different classes to choose from "Damage dealers tanks and healers oh my!" There's tons of variety in terms of how each class plays, each have their own mechanics making none of them truly "useless" Yes there's one that's overpowered but even that one has a down side, so in terms of classes you won't be dissapointed.\n\nSo if the things I just mentioned sound interesting and maybe even fun I would highly reccomend trying this one out, it has a beautiful art style and TONS of content to keep you playing!\n","September 30, 2014","true","82.7"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Thing is, I don't like MMOS. There is something about it that just doesn't work for me.\n\nThat being said, this game is an amazing turn based strategy game. If you like MMOs and turn-based combat, do try it!\n\nIf you're like me, it's not unlike any MMO. It gets boring too fast.\n\n\nOriginal review\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game has one of the best turn based combat I've ever played. All playable classes have 20 spells and 5 passives you can skill and level up, allowing you to build it any way you want to suit your tastes. There is a lot of ennemies and they all feel unique.\n\nBut that's pretty much it. There is no drive to level up, very few quests beside some for the intro, some milestones and the dailies. That's enough for me but it makes it hard to get friends into the game.\n\nAlso, the politics, crafting and environnement things seem like useless or almost useless gimmicks to me.\n\nOn top of that, the game have a lot of issues. The Steam achievements are not working (and at this point, I doubt they ever will). When my friend created an account, he got locked into a different region than mine and he gave up on the game.\n\nGive me a propper coop RPG with those classes and ennemies and I would buy it any time.","September 22, 2015","false","97.1"," 46 of 73 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","46","73","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisjoe/recommended/215080/","thisisjoe","Dirty Dingy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisjoe/","56 products in account","Wakfu is a phenominal game filled with an innovative turn based battle system. Very similar to final fantasy tactics and other games of the genre.\n\nThe tutorial is long and tedious because it has to be. The battle system is complex to those new to the genre, but once you can look past that; it's a game that you can tell lots of love and creativity was poured into it.\n\nClasses~ They're so many classes to choose. They vary from the typical archer and warrior to flying faeries and time robots.  Each class has it's own individual spells and abilities. For example, I have an Eniripsa. The Eniripsa is a support/healer class that can spec into fire, air, or water abilities. Without getting too much into this to prevent spoilers, (and because of my ignorance considering I have only played around 20+ hours) I can assure you that each class is innovative and will be fun to play.\n\nPeople~ People fuel everything in this game. They're no npcs, not too many quests, yet why is this game so fun? Because people make the combat system REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING FUN. You find a party of about 5+ people to do this exceptionally hard dungeon or invade another person's territory ( at level 18 you pick a civilization to live in) and after 25 hours I'm still having so much fun.\n\nProfessions- If you want to plant a seed. Plant it ♥♥♥♥ing anywhere. If you want to mine a rock go build a bomb and blow up the rocks to find the rare minerals within. If you wanna go trample on someone else's freshly planted seeds (♥♥♥♥ you btw) then go do that. There's total free roam in this game. ZERO RESTRANTS.\n\nArt style/music~  Wakfu is very colorful. Has pretty good mustic, and a flowing animation. Don't be fooled by it's cartooney style though; this game is ♥♥♥♥ing bloody. If you wanna go kill a cat and cut off it's fur go ahead. The blood will be on the picture in your inventory.\n\n\nThe games completely free~ That's right, it's free. Go play it you nerd.","October 17, 2014","true","50.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","0"

Albeit starting the game is mildly difficult, it's a fun and interesting game to play! For what it's worth, I love this game mostly because it's all about the player.\n\nThe economy is not run based on a setup from the developers, it's completely player-based, meaning you can set up shop in the little customizable bag you are given at the beginning of the main part of the game. Not only that, but there are a bunch of balanced, customizable classes you can jump into depending on your play style! Couple that with spells you have to use to improve, gear you can craft/find/buy from others, and all sorts of bonuses like Clan Member bonuses and Guild bonuses, you can increase your stats and quickly find a build for yourself! If that wasn't enough of a hook for the gameplay, you have several opportunities to "Restat", or change up all your spells and ability bonuses!\n\nThere are a few major downsides to the game: There are NO NPC characters that are useful. By this, I mean there are no shopkeepers or helpful questline helpers, it's all based on you and your groups. This might be bad for some people, but this means you can literally cut through all the crap with hirelings and stuff, and just find like-minded players to work alongside!\n\n+ The game is simple to work with, using mostly the right and left mouse buttons to control your character and your surroundings.\n+ You control the environment! You can decide what crops to take and what all is removed from the area, like herbs, trees, and even the monsters!\n+ The economy is easy to understand, you sell anything at whatever price you want! It's up to the player that wants what you have to pay the price.\n+ The graphics are good, as well as the sprites and animations!\n\n- There are bugs, as with every game. If you spot something, report it, please, the devs will want to know what is going wrong.\n- Guilds are at a downside, as there are what are called Haven Worlds, or a World for your guild members to use. Others can slip in and steal stuff from it if you aren't careful, and you'll want to realize you probably WON'T be getting one for a long time if you're a new or semi-poor guild.\n- PvP is included, so those of you who are low-lvl with high professions, beware other players! Some will want to steal all your crops and leave you nothing in return!\n- You have to reintroduce anything missing into the environment. If there are no more Ash Trees, to name something important, then if you have the seedlings for it, you'll be forced to replant.\n\n\nThere are ways around all the farming/environment stuff, but until you get enough money to buy the Haven Gems needed, it's a bit much to go after. Alot of the players love to help one another out, so ask questions if you want to know something. That said, enjoy playing Wakfu, and hope to see you in the World of Twelve!\n\nP.S. if you steal my crops, I'll shoot you. It's as simple as that.

When I got this game and started it up, I was abit skeptical about how it started off. But later in the game I got used to it and I felt right at home. It's a great MMORPG RTS game that I reccommend to those who want to have a fun experience. It's not meant for everyone, but it's something that I will keep coming back to when I feel down. The graphics in the game look pretty nice, and the world is VERY huge aswell. The fights are fun to, having a tile based fight, and each move counts as you try to figure out what to do. And if you have your friends, you can try to come up with more strategy. I was really impressed on the execution, and it's something that I will continue to love until the end of time. Not the best, but it's still unique. I would give this game an 8.67/10","October 26, 2014","true","25.6"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

It has a really unique gameplay style and fun characters. However, once you get farther into the game, you notice problems that start to pop up. Its starts with small things. Maybe your character bugs out a little, or your spells don't work the way they should, and it isn't too big of a problem to begin with.\n\nBut then these things stack up. And up and up and up. The development team is horrifically slow when it comes to fixing issues. Well actually, I take that back. Whenever there is a bug that HELPS players, it gets fixed very very quickly. But if you've got a gamebreaking bug that halves the damage you deal? Well, maybe they will get to it in three or four patches. And you get a patch once every two months if you are lucky. Whats that, your class is broken? Don't worry, you can always buy the 30$ class change!\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the support, oh lord. I sent in an issue, and a week later, after not hearing anything from them, I tried to contact them again. Again no response. So I tried to contact them a THIRD time, and finally, after almost a month, they contacted me back and said they had looked at the issue, and decided to do nothing about it.\n\nYou'll notice I have a lot of hours on this game. That isn't counting the time I put into it BEFORE it was released on steam. Its because they keep promising to fix things. Every patch that comes out I think, hey,  They continue to try and put more and more things into the game without ever fixing the old stuff.  And I hope you like doing hours of research in order to play games! Many stats and spells are ambiguous, and there is NOWHERE in game that explains what they do. So, you have to scour the forums, hoping that your question has been answered somewhere, and that if you do find an answer, it isn't outdated.\n\nTL;DR this is "Wasted Potential: The Game". The base concept of the game is great, and so much could have been done with it, but in the end it just leads to bitter disappointment.","December 21, 2014","false","281.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Wakfu is a pretty good sized media franchise from France, there are currently 5 games "in universe", 4 released, they are Dofus, Dofus Arena, Islands of Wakfu, Wakfu, and Krogmaster (a tabletop, digital tie in involving minifigures). There are also multiple animated series and movies, including the animated Dofus and Wakfu series. Overall there is alot of lore to take from, and the universe is rich and fun to look at.\n\nWakfu itself however is a pretty good game in my book, It feels like it has alot of strategy, combat wise, compared to most modern mmo's. The level cap in the game is pretty darn high though, so it may feel a bit grindy at times. But with the large and varied amount of classes and builds, I have got to say you wont run out of things to try!\n\nOverall I recommend anyone who is a fan of mmo's or turn based strategy games to take a look at Wakfu, and I recommend everyone take a look at the series as a whole!\n\n\nEdit: The game has been released on Steam for a while now, so I have a few additional notes.\n\n1. The player population seems to have increased, and is pretty lively compared to what it was before (at least in my opinion.)\n\n2. I just realized that the Steam achievements no longer unlock, I dont know what the deal with that is but it should not cause any real problems, its just a minor nuisance.\n\n\n3. have fun!","September 18, 2014","true","16.3"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","0"

Wakfu is a limitless universe, with 15+ classes, cute graphics, an amazing amount of content, 17 professions, nature management, government and politics, turn-based combat, player-driven markets, and most of all, 99% of all content is FREE.\n\nWakfu lets you play as a character in a vast universe, to travel it, to traverse all kinds of terrain, to explore, to meet new friends or enemies, but most of all, to enjoy.\nYou can choose amongst 15+ classes (that's a lot!), each with their own unique skills and way of combat, and you are also able to learn and master 17 different professions, from farming, cooking, baking to even tailoring. You can have all of the professions, but it's up to you on what you want to level.\nThis game has a dynamic environment; this means that the world isn't fixed. It's up to us, the players, to plant if the environment lacks plants and to reap if there is too much. It's up to us to decide what will become of the environment.\nWith that being said, a player can lean towards being beneficial (Wakfu) or destructive (Stasis) towards the environment. Wakfu and Stasis are paths you can choose on how you interact with the environment, planting plants, trees and monsters seeds makes you lean towards Wakfu, while cutting down trees, harvesting plants and others make you lean towards Stasis. Most people misunderstand this as Wakfu being good and Stasis being bad, but the proper statement is that: Wakfu is growth as Stasis is regulation. We can't live in a world with a tree in every grid cell, right?\nEconomy is also purely player-driven, you won't find an NPC buying your items for Kamas (the only currency), you'll have to find other people to buy it from you, or sell it in the outpost, where other players see items for sale, easier and in a more convenient way.\nThere are 4 nations that a player can join upon reaching a certain level, each with their own respective territories, laws and government.\nPolitics also play a role in the universe of Wakfu, every 2 weeks, there comes an election wherein a governor is chosen by the players. It's up to the Governor to change laws, pick members for the government and handle relations with other nations.\nConclusion? I don't know if you'll like it as much as other people and I do, but just give it a try, play it and you'll find out.","January 16, 2015","true","107.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

Since the very start of the game. Since 2011. I thought Ankama Games had the right idea by combining their great game with a great video game company like Valve. Since Ankama Games is a French game company, creating a connection with the United States and other countries really helped the game with one of the problems it had, population of the English servers.\n\nThe things that make this game great are the ideas introduced into the game mechanics itself.\n\nThe grid-based strategy aspect of the game, combined with the different ways of stat growth and play made this game trully creative with the way players enjoyed the game on a fighting aspect.\nAnother great form of the game is the creative design of the world of Wakfu. Every city, every character, every monster is unique and beautiful.\nOne more great feature of the game is the way real people manipulate with the enviornment, the government, and the people who play the game. Wakfu shines with the idea that people have everything and anything to do with the world in which the players play in. The player can manipulate the mobs in given areas. The player can vote for government officals to enact rules for the country to follow.\nHowever, no game is perfect. Wakfu has problems, and unfortunatly the problems happen to be fairly large.\n\nBecause Wakfu is a game made from a French company, support is not the best when something happens to happen, whether it be in the game or in real life.\nAlthough the content is large and the world of Wakfu is large, content seems to be lacking for people who don't want to 'level up'. There aren't many different ways to enjoy the game to its fullest, and although Ankama Games has tried to include ways of enjoying the game, it doesn't seem enough to really keep the players they recieve.\nI believe Wakfu is a great game and it should be looked at for players who want something different in their MMO. However, Wakfu lacks the ability to keep the players they recieve and although I greatly enjoy the game, and everything it provides, I can't help hoping for more of the game. 6.8/10","June 11, 2015","true","222.5"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"

But in practice, you can't.\n\nIf you write to their support and state your problem, they will quickly redirect you to Steam's updated privacy policy, regardless the fact that you mentioned that you've already read it. If you go ahead and do your research, take every measurement to make Steam Wallet work and you still can't buy anything from ingame--the customer service redirects you to Steam, who can't do anything about it, since it's a game-related problem.\n\nThis game is good until you don't receive something you paid for/your account is stolen/your account is suddenly wiped. I rarely see a case that got resolved. Read their forums.\n\nIf you are a casual player that won't pay for an MMORPG and doesn't want to play it for long... then play Wakfu.

Every place you go in this game will be different from another place. I'd say the developers spent a lot of time making the open world as beautiful as 2D can possibly get.\n\nGameplay - As many people will say, this game plays similar to Final Fantasy tactics. You play as one hero in a turn based setting with a series of Action Points to use for spells and a series of Movement Points to walk around. There are large assortments of unique classes and no class plays the same. What makes this game fascinating is how creative every class is.\n\nPlayers - This game has a surprisingly low population for how fun it is. There are many friendly and unfriendly players like in any Massively Multiplayer Online Game. Since the populations are so low though, some higher level players tend to become localy fameous within the servers.\n\nStory - I have to say, i haven't even touched the story. It seems kinda iffy to begin with. You incarnate into Astrub and do some mercenary work. Than a giant tv face guy tells you that you are the chosen one to defeat the mighty Ogrest.

One would think that since the game came out, developers could adress these issues. Instead, we get alternative questlines and new cash shop items.\n\nThe gameplay is enjoyable. The artstyle is good. But the world feels very, very empty.\n\nThe game was originally intended to have a community. Players run faction politics, entire economy and even location ecosystems. It has now gotten to a point where people jump to another server, just because it has a spike in population. Many people who return to the game after a long time seem to be bewildered by the state of affairs.\n\nThere is variety of classes, each with their own, unique abilities that grow stronger as you use them. This is great, except because of the aforementioned imbalance, which in turn leads to a class getting nerfed or revamped. Remember that character that you played a while ago that you really liked? Here, have a totally diffirent one.\n\nCrafting is a grindfest. If there was an active economy going, this would have been easier. But if you want to create a good item, you have to personally collect all the components required for a specific item and craft it. Both of these require a good amount of time to get the skills for. And the list of required components can often be quite extensive. This repeated process is the only way to advance in a crafting profession.\n\nThere's an extensive list of unique enemies, who often come in matched groups, so as long as you advance in level or just travel a lot, you get to face various new challanges. This only lasts until later levels, when the grind sets in, or when you just need to acquire specific components or a piece of armor. This uniqueness also causes AI to frequently do random things. And woe upon you if you picked a summoner class - healers who prefer full health targets over dying allies, melee summons who decide to just step back a bit and skip turn...\n\nI wish the game would do better, I really do.

Finny posting here, some of you who are reading this might want a brief review, some of you might just be looking at another Hardcore Wakfu players opinion so I'll give both. Played hours here 600 odd actual? 3.3k (no life)\n\n1st things 1st, this game is extremely unique i've never played a game like this, a game like this is truly amazing and so is the fact that the game is available on the Mac platform (what i'm using).\n\nTLDR: Game is amazing but VERY VERY grind-y, lonely and un-sociable (Read bottom paragraph). Would recommend :]\n\nStory: This is extremely limited, this is newbie friendly but is very short and only links to Ogrest which is still yet to be incorporated into the game (I think this was going to be level 200 content) once you progress to mid 100 content (level 50) the newely revamped islands (currently 2 out of 5-6+) you then get new quest-lines which feature ways to get Kamas (In game money) quicker through even more exploration of the game, this is tedious but can be fun for people who are casual and don't mind spending 20 hours+ running around the game. The story then jutters and jumps to mid game content (level 100, 118, 120 and 125) these questlines again feature kama making methods and are EXTREMELY fun and give an insight into the story of the game and the Ultimate Bosses (weekly bosses, sadly no challenge what-so-ever) you then have the section of the game which is the most grindy, intensive, game quit feeling inducing moment ever, this is the jump from 120 to the next 140 quest, this is the most boring and lonely grind experience ever, this puts most people off the game. From here you have more quests more frequently and you would have probably found a guild and start to have some online Wakfu friends, you then lead into the high level content, I won't speak about this since you'll probably have a basic understanding of the game and some good friends etc.\n\nGuilds: This is all down to preference but the size of the guilds aren't huge and you are basically forced into high level guilds just to see anyone online, there are a few English guilds which are really nice and newbie friendly (notice how I said few, it really is hardly any guilds that are newbie friendly) when entering this game it's not advised to ask high levels for leeching I will give you a quick run down of why:\n\nXP is grindy as HECK\nYou'll be on 0.5-0.75x XP meaning that someone grinding you a few levels will feel like a life time, period.\nFun factor\nIs it fun for high levels? Yes and No, depends on their mood and what you're like as a player etc.\nLanguage Barrier\nHit and miss remember this game is multi-cultural so be wary of whom you ask for help due to language barriers!\n\nIn game revenue / money method\nThis is called 'Kamas' you gain some each fight and with chests that you open from completing a respective Questline, this is tedious but you get quite a lot of money, awesome!\nOn Remington you have quite a nice economy meaning that while some items are crazy high they are endgame and so you'll only aim for these once you have complete knowledge of the game and dungeons etc. Majority of other high level stuff is dirt cheap so that's cool!\n\nDungeons:\nFun and grindy you don't have to run it 1,000 time for an item to have 1 chance of dropping it but instead....! You can run it 1,000 times to get enough tokens to buy it huzzzah! So it's all down to your opinion, there's also major awesome guides online showing you how to complete these dungeons as-well as other players that you'll be running with experience!\n\nPvP:\nCompletely broken due to only a select amount of classes being revamped and overly powerful, unless you follow the crowd with new classes i'd advise against it.\n\nClasses:\nOld ones are much weaker and often not taken/ accepted as much in dungeons compared to newer classes, same with other games but sad really R.I.P Sadida ;w;\n\nBugs:\nThis game has a fair amount of bugs in it but these seem to be ironed out fairly quickly, until recently where dupers have been duping end game items and selling them for very low prices, this has in turn kinda ruined the economy and the player base due to not trusting the market and other players, a lot of people such as my self feel slightly cheated that new people pick it 1-4 of these duped 20million each relics and I spent months farming 1 worth 4 million... This is a major problem as of May 26th 2015 so if you're reading the review take this into account!","June 2, 2015","true","714.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","1"

Do yourself a favor and try the game. I play on the Asian server, and the community there is FANTASTIC. Everyone is rather nice, the GMs do contests, and its just a blast. If you don't mind mob-farming a bit, and actual farming, try it out...its free. Nothing to lose. And its not PAY TO WIN. It is completely free. All content, all bosses, ALL EXPANSIONS FREE. The only thing a booster/subscription for the month adds is the ability to vote for a governor for your nation. Thats it. Oh and becoming governor yourself. Otherwise this is probably the best MMO I have played to date now that it free to play and class balances have come to be great.  Do yourself a favor, play Wakfu and enjoy your game time well spent making friends, figuring strategies, and being the best class you can be under your god.","November 7, 2014","true","771.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","1"

Obviously similar at first glace to games like Final Fantasy Tactics and the Disgaea series, but with it's own twist and features for online multiplayer!\n\nA few hours in and I still have quite a lot of learn about how to play Wakfu, but that's part of the fun! The medium strength learning curve means things may feel familiar to you from other games, but not entirely.\n\nOne of the best designs is the classes themselves. A large number to choose from and not the standard, boring names and designs like Warrior, Mage, and ...well actually there is a Rogue, but it's cool! The artistic design of this game is fantastic and also adds to the familiar, but fresh feeling that Wakfu brings!\n\n\nOh, and you get a crate for your bag....house...thing! :D","October 9, 2015","true","12.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I don't know how to explain. It's just a personal preference thing.\nIf you enjoy games that are slow and casual, you'll want to try this out.\n\nYou'll spend most of your time harvesting resources you'll probably end up selling.\nThe combat itself is turn-based, so that's self-explanatory. If you want a fast-paced game, you're looking at the wrong place.\nThe first 12 levels or so, you'll find yourself with a bunch of interesting quests, but pretty much after that the story kinda disappears. I've only played till lvl 50, but so far I haven't had any storyline quest after the intro.\nAt any rate, the most appealing factor of this game is probably its style and art. The grind itself isn't hectic, but farming for resources might break your sanity.\n\nPersonally, I think this might be more of a social game.\nAlso, this game has no problem showing animals mating.","November 25, 2014","true","106.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Almost no tutorial to get u anywhere. They drop u in the game and good wish u good luck.\n- Grindfest, Dungeons take long and the items have rediculous low drop rates. (Any good item will usually only have 0.1% to 0.3% drop chance. (token machines allow items to be bought with tokens earned from the dungeon, but will still take about 30 runs for 1 decent item)\n- Even tho the game is technically free to play. It asks money for tons of things. even certain areas require monthly payment to be accesed (newest areas)\n- Bad customer support. Sending in a ticket with a problem can take up to weeks for it to be replied. sometimes it will not even get answerd at all.\n- Extremely buggy. The game is FILLED with bugs. And not small ones ether. Things such as duplicating items turn up very frequantly allowing people who abuse the bug to make tons of money without any punishment. Every patch they introduce multiple new bugs. Some so major u wont be able to play for a long time.\n\n(For example as of writing this review they added the 1.43 patch, Witch makes every fight in dungeons bug out. Not start. and force u to relog. On top of that they have serieus lag issues aswell. making it impossible for people to play due to things such as 1 spell taking 10 - 20 seconds to respond. This current bug has bin going on for 3 weeks and still they do not have a clue how to fix it. And even tho they will fix it eventually. With the next patch added 100's of new bugs will come with it aswell. only to remain not fixed for weeks again)\n\nAll in all i actually really love this game. And if it wasnt for the horrible costumer support and frequant bugs i would mostly reccomend it.\nBut i cant. Seeing as u will most likely not even get anywhere in the game, due to bad early tutorials. And constant bugs.","July 29, 2015","false","0.1"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","17","31","2","0"

This game does a pretty good job of putting the combat experiences of those games in a multiplayer setting.\n\nBesides the combat, I also enjoyed the game's environmental mechanics because it kind of gives me a Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing kind of vibe where the world gives you these resources to do things with, and the players are responsible for tending to them or making something out of them.\n\nAs for the grinding, I personally don't know if it is actually necessary or not, but in any case I managed to skip the first story quests altogether and head to my chosen nation (Bonta) and then proceeded to grind the highest level mobs and dungeons that I could manage, purely because I love overwhelming myself in these tactics games and barely pulling through.\n\nIt also helps that the only punishment for death is no exp gain for a lost battle, reduced stats for about 3 minutes and a respawn back to the previous checkpoint area of your choosing.\n\nI've spent no money on the game so far, but I might in the future if I keep playing. Paying players get some nice bonuses, but I've been playing comfortably without them. There's also some nifty costumes and stuff too.\n\nI recommend the game because it's free and I enjoy it.\nIf you get it, I'd definitely recommend doing the tutorial and trying out a few different classes. I went through a couple classes and then went with the Elitrope as my main because I personally loved the portal mechanic. My brother went with the archer because he loved the obscene range and then the huppermage because of the elemental/light attack dynamic. There's a lot of variety, so don't be afraid to try a few out.

I more than likely have thousands of hours of gameplay which I think is more than enough to warrant me to review it. And yet... reviewing this is hard. The game itself conceptually and artistically is fantastic. It is such a visually pleasing game and the music is pretty great too (after a while I put the music on mute however). You can really feel the thousands of hours of hand drawn work that went into making Wakfu such an attractive game. But the two caveats here is that the game is buggy and the customer support is lackluster at best. But before you turn away and never touch this game - just give it a shot. The game itself is good enough and challenging enough that you might really take to it. If you loved those JRPGs with the word 'tactics' thrown onto the end (or front like 'tactics ogre') of their titles then you might really fall for this game. What is more is that it is an MMO and as anyone who has really dug deep into an mmo knows you start to form bonds with these people that you play with.

(So, if you don't like grinding all day everyday then stay away. Although that's mostly what mmorpgs besides the quests are all about. Let's be honest, lol.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eriix/recommended/215080/","eriix","eriixblaike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eriix/","442 products in account","* Caveats\nFirst of all, the caveats.  If you can't handle these, don't bother:\n\n** Partial pay-to-win\nBonus XP and loot abound alongside otherwise-unatainable items for those who open their wallet.  I wouldn't call it a true pay-to-play since it's entirely possible to compete with people who pay, but it will take significantly more effort on your end.  The items may even make sense in some cases if they're cheap enough, but I would never recommend to anyone the booster pack or paying continuous fees for the new hero system  It's preposterous unless you have far too much money and nothing better to do with it.\n\n** Slow\nTactical, turn-based combat that gives everyone 30 seconds to make their move.  With up to twelve players per battle (6 players per team PvP), there can be something of a wait until your turn.  For me, this is an advantage since I can plan out my approach more carefully, or even do other things while playing (the game makes a distinct sound when it's your turn), but people who prefer action will find it a bit troublesome.\n\n** Confused\nWakfu sometimes wants to straddle the line between single player and MMO.  The scenes when following the main questline definitely try to feel like you're playing through a single player RPG, and those other players with you are all extras.  You, yes, you are the hero of prophecy, and it is your task alone to defeat Ogrest.  It's a neat approach, but the disconnect is sometimes a bit much.\n\n** Trolls\nDon't like being randomly killed by someome three times your level?  Might not be your game.  The only way to completely opt out of PvP is to stay in Astrub, where you'll never be able to level far.  Honestly, this doesn't happen often.  Once every couple months or so, it seems to happen to me.  The consequences of losing are pretty miniscule -- You reappear at your phoenix and there's a negative status effect attached to you for three minutes.  My suggestion is generally to ignore them because of this, but some people have strong emotional reactions to this, so they should be aware.\n\n** Performance\nMy laptop is hardly top of the line, but it plays a number of my games with no problem.  It doesn't even slow down much on Minecraft most of the time, and we know how badly that was coded.  Why, then, does this 2d game sometimes completely tank in framerate even when the graphics settings are at the minimum?  Why can it then run quite well sometimes with the graphics set to max?  There's a wide variation possible based on what's happening at the time, both visually (there was a problem with the steam/smoke effect a few months ago that brought both machines I used Intel cards on to their knees, while my significantly older Radeon didn't suffer at all) and in terms of action (beginning and ending battles, loading areas, players suddenly logging in, etc. can sometimes leave Wakfu unresponsive for seconds on my laptop), so if your machine is fairly weak, prepare for occasional input or display lag.\n\n** Documentation\nMy goodness.  There are tutorial panels that come up occasionally to try to tech you what's going on.  Some of them are massively outdated, some aren't descriptive enough to be much help, some come up at bad times and block your view, or even mouse (Though most can be dismissed with a click, I encountered one that could not.), at awkward times.  Frequently, the best option is to ask someone.\n\n* The rest\nNow, on to the good stuff:\n\n** Class selection\nThere are a variety of classes that can represent a significant range in play styles.  The classes I love the most aren't neccessarily liked by my friends as I do not always like theirs, which I generally take to be a good thing on variety.  Even within classes, there are a surprising number of variants available based on the spells you choose to bring to battle and where you spent your points when leveling.  There are some respec opportunities available for free (as well as one for cash and one that requires you to collect a rather shocking amount of items), and it's relatively easy to level a character once you learn where to go and what to kill (so you can even discard a character and redo it all if you don't feel it's worth earning a respec).\n\n** Fun combat system\nIt's not the best system I've ever seen (Makai Kingdom forever, man!), but the combat system is remarkably nice.  With the recent update, you are limited in the number of spells/abilities you can bring to battle.  This has significantly hampered one of my characters, who was a staunch generalist, but it has helped refine a few others.  The spells, active abilities, passive abilities, and attributes of your character are genuinely brought to life by a combat system that effectively allows you to translate your choices during character growth into sometimes novel and interesting results in combat.  It then goes further by offering additional challenges in combat that you can complete for bonus XP and items.  If you decide to go along with it, these can sometimes make a battle much more interesting.  Even enemies notably weaker than you can get complicated when you refuse to give up on any of the challenges, which can be a delightful way to keep things interesting when you need to gather items dropped by weak enemies.\n\n** Graphics\nThe anime-style graphics are generally well done, with good customization for your character's appearance (Your equipment appears on your character, allowing for great flexibility in appearance if you're not too worried about having great equipment, or you can use costumes to hide it and choose freely.) and relatively fluid animation that feels quite right when put together.\n\n** Story\nThe story itself is pretty generic, but it's realized in a remarkably nice universe with solid backstory and a wide varity of interesting characters.  Suffice it to say the world has a great feel to it.\n\n** Community\nYeah, I mentioned trolls earlier.  They definitely exist, and there's no real way to control or contain them implemented.  They're a small portion of the population, though.  Some of the conversations and interactions between players are hilarious or intriguing, there's a wide variety of emotes to unlock, and even text smilies are brought to life with the vizage  of your character doing the expression above your head.  There's plenty of people to talk with, and sometimes random people just feel like inviting you to join their group.  Being an introvert myself, I was rather cautious at first, but I've grown rather fond of people randomly inviting me to go stomp through a dungeon or two with them, or to do a bit of this or that quest line with them.  It's really rather fun.\n\n** Types\nA bit of a note, the options available to players are a bit more vaired and detailed then Healer, Tank, DPS.  Obviously, there will be damage specialists sometimes, but they can specialize on distance or close combat if they can afford to sacrifice the other, there will also be those who specialize on moving allies or enemies to different spaces in the field to maximize the advantage for their side, characters who can use a great number of status effects on friend and foe alike, characters that place blockages on the field to keep enemies where you want them or who scatter automated turrets or summoned allies across the field to win with sheer numbers...  If you're expecting battle to always be straightforward, you're in for a surprise.\n\n* Conclusion\nWhile I hate some of the free-to-play nonsense, and I mourn the great potential the hero system had before it became the rent-a-slot deal it is, I have a great deal of respect for the effort and thought that has shaped this game into the remarkable thing it currently is.  I enjoy Wakfu a lot, and many of my fellow fans of tactical turn-based combat will likely come to the same conclusion should they give it a long enough try.  I wholeheartedly recommend Wakfu to those who enjoy a good turn-based tactical fight.","November 8, 2015","true","829.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferizo/recommended/215080/","ferizo","ASH+Ketchum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferizo/","1490 products in account","So.. I played this game before as well as it's predecessor, Dofus. However, I never got into it because it didn't had a F2P-friendly environment due to heavy limitations and restrictions which greatly reduced overall fun and in my opinion doesn't give new players a good impression of the game before even considering spending money on it. Anyway, with the full release on Steam this game seems a lot more appealing as all of those restrictions have been removed. You're truly 'free' now.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there's been quite a lot of changes, most of them for the better.. But I'll go ahead and say this game does require you to invest quite some time into it to get somewhere (besides the usual RPG nature) especially if you're totally new to the Dofus/Wakfu Universe. The new tutorial for instance feels odd.. to say the least. You really have to explore and pay attention to what is asked of you, and even then it is sometimes unclear as the general pacing of it is a bit off. I guess in a way that is sort of the tutorial; to pay close attention to what is said and asked. Because after the tutorial you get plunged into a world where you could basically kill yourself if you approach it the wrong way.\n\nOther than that, the game does look promising. The turn-based combat is really fun and a nice change of pace if you're used to the real-time combat from most other games nowadays. Along with the 15 different and unique classes it can be said that there's a great amount of strategy/tactics to be had for grouping up with others and the big battles later on in the game. ..and that's not even the main appeal of this game to be honest. The best thing about this game is that the world is pretty much completely run by the players/community. Politics and total control of the Ecosystem that can and will affect everyone else. Create, Destroy, Rebuild.. you decide.\n\nIn short.. upon closer examination and from what I've seen so far, it's a unique and interesting concept and I'm looking forward to exploring it much further. But most of all.. if the concept itself isn't appealing enough, it's 'Free to Play' and aside from a small boost to your in-game earnings doesn't incentivizes a P2W environment as everything else is purely cosmetic.","September 18, 2014","true","94.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has play style similar to Final Fantasy Tactics where combat takes place in a grid.\n\nThe character classes (15 of them) in Wakfu (and Dofus) have unique play styles and the classes themselves can be played many different ways.\n\nThe spells have a variety of rules, and positioning makes a big factor in damage dealt/recieved.\n\nThe art in this game is very charming.  It's very pleasing to just look at the content in the game.\n\nThe music is very pleasing as well.  All from playful, cheery music to serious, blood-pumping music.\n\nThere is a lot of humor in this game and a lot of funny parodies.  A lot of naughty references are in the game too, but are subtle enough that kids wouldn't (or shouldn't) understand.\n\nOf course, playing in a team with others is a lot of fun (and often necessary for tackling dungeons of your lvl).  Being in a guild & the in-game group finder tool helps with playing with others to enjoy the game better.\n\nPlayers can also make an impact on the environment.  Most mobs can be planted to have them spawn, and they can also be killed enough to have very little to no population in the area (sometimes ghost forms appear when that happens). Flowers, Trees, and crops can also be planted in the world and are shared with others, and they can also be completely harvested with none left for others.  Making certain plant/mob population too high or too low or just right can affect area bonuses and nation bonuses.  One nation (Riktus) benefits from other nations having their bonuses ruined.\n\nThe environment, plus nation laws and wars set by a governor voted by its citizens (who then can appoint other people to different positions in government), makes for interesting experiences in the world.\n\nI've been playing this game for a long time (since open beta Jan 2012).  It's enjoyable and I recommend it.","December 2, 2014","true","651.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Beautiful art and style. Extensive crafting system. PVP option. Dungeons are unique and mob's are difficult to master-  they all have different abilities. Gameplay grind and difficulty creates a relatively mature player base. Can play for free if you can stand the grind punishment.\n\nCONS:\nGear acquisition until you have a maxed out character is very punishing! If you're used to Warcraft dungeons, where you can get all the gear you need that matches your level running  dungeons, you're going to be frustrated. Dungeons AT YOUR LEVEL, are DIFFICULT for a group, YOUR LEVEL. So you're basically left with hoping you have some maxed level freinds to run you through, over and over. Which by that time, you've leveled past the gear you were after in the first place. The system really makes no sense.\n\nGetting groups at levels other than high levels is hard. Most players are maxed and have no incentive to help you with low level dungeons. They need to introduce player scaling and rewards so high level players are compelled to play low level dungeons.\n\nBIGGEST CON:  THE GRIND.\nIt's the most punishing grind I've ever experienced- even if you purchase booster packs for 3x the XP. Now I only get to play an hour or two here and there and on weekends, but I've been playing about a year and my highest toon is 115 out of 165. People get around this by being "power leveled" by high level players- which is about as fun as teasing a cat with string... You're just there for idle chit chat while they blow mobs down- for hours....\n\nSUMMARY:\nOne of my favorite games ever due to art, sounds, playstyle and difficulty. But it has serious flaws with helping and keeping new players interested (grind and grouping).\n\nBest summarized as an MMO Chess Game.","January 17, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Really, there's a lot of great mechanics in the game that are super unique and fun to play around with, but the game is pretty empty sometimes and there's no real questline structure past the early areas. You're kind of just released into the world to grind, and while the combat is unique, it's really personal preference as to how fun it is.

I mean I REALLY want to like it.  There are a few things preventing me from giving my full life to this game.\n\n-Pros-\n\n-Great design and look\n\n-Unique classes\n\n-Interesting skills (more on this later)\n\n-If you like tactical RPGs and MMOs then this is probably for you.\n\n\n-Cons-\n\n-VERY complicated for a beginner to get into. (this seems to be a theme)\n\n-Not very beginner friendly, most things have to be explained by long-time players within the game.\n\n-Skills are horribly explained, skill buffs/beduffs are explained in pop-ups within pop-ups within pop-ups at times.\n\n-Very convoluted texts and quests.\n\n-Some things such as haven bags, setting a location, and professions aren't explained very well at all.\n\n-Unexplained reasoning for actions having to be taken by the player, such as HAVING to have a respec at lvl 10 or you cannot fight anything in the game, ever.  If this is a bug of some kind, it should be stated as such by the developer.  Otherwise, it's quite jarring to suddenly realize you can no longer battle anything in the game.\n\n\nAgain, this game is great and has wonderful depth to the classes and skill sets, but the convoluted execution of it all does not create a well-thoughtout package for beginners.  The tutorial in the beginning leaves much to be desired and only prepares the player for the battles.  Everything else in the game has to be found out, missed, or learned through other longtime players in the game.\n\nI still recommend trying this game out and see if you are willing to spend the time necessary to learn all of what it has to offer.  I'm still learning as I go, gaining a little bit more knowledge as time goes on through other players.  It's a slow going process but it might pay off in the depth and fun to be had.","July 10, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

This game originated from France, something pretty rare to come from them, it also has a anime that is subbed and dubbed in English on Netflix. The gameplay is something new and unique to this style of game, it takes concentration and planing in battle, should you use up all the points to move in close and unleash a flurry of attack or stay back and chip away at you enemy is up to you and your class. This system makes PvP a real challenge, most classes can far well in PvP due to the way you can build your class, all classes have at least some ranged spells, even those up close types.\n\nOh boy the classes, one of the best things about this game next to the combat. There are 17 unique classes that all have there own style of play, some examples are the Cra, your run of the mill pew pew archers, they have accses to these things called beacons, which they can use 3 different elementle attacks on the beacon which will have different affects depending on the element (Air, Fire, Earth). Another good example is the Sram, this class is all about assassination, going invisable and closing the gap behind there prey, also they use giant scythes, whats not to love.\n\nThe community of this game is hit and miss, you will have some people that are nice and try to help you and some who spam you with guild invites because they just want more guild points. The big areas where people gather are hot spots for spam bots trying to get you to go buy accounts and that junk, just put those people on your ignore list, the starting area seems to have some pretty chill people but if you are new or do not like trash talkers DO NOT go to The Temple of Scriptures. The Temple mostly has high level people that challenge eachother to PvP at the base of the steps, after sitting there for an hour to listen in on people all they do is call eachother homophobic slurs and offensive names, unfortunately you will have to come here once a day for a quest and it is also the best place to do high level gear trading due to all the high level people hanging around there.\n\nAre you one of those "save the earth" people? Well guess what, this game has its own eco-system that you, the player, have control over. Do you wanna make a jungle? Go right ahead. Wanna destroy another nations resorces and laugh as they can't craft anything? Well you can, you sadistic monster.\n\nEver wanted to be a baker, a chef, or even a talor, making cute dresses for your in game wifu? Welp get to grinding that job XP, or run for governer of a nation and have everyone look up to you as a god. Of corse if you don't want to rule a whole nation you can always run for Vice governer, or Head of the Guard, and even control the weather of the nation, if you are having a bad day, flood your lands with rain.\n\nPROS-\n+Has unique gamplay\n+Can run on most systems\n+Has a plethora of classes\n+Not pay to play at all\n+Has its own in game eco-system\n+Prices in store seem really far\n+Has its own government\n+Anime Wifus\n-------------------------------------------------\nCONS-\n-Small player base\n-Players can leave a sour tatse in your mouth\n-Takes a lot of grinding\n-Can be boring playing alone\n-Have to redeem all DLC code through Ankam's website\n-Graphics are nothing special\n-Fixed cammera can make fighting very difficult\n\nIn the end, despite its flaws I really enjoy this game, and would highly recomend it to all my friends","March 6","true","264.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Then YES! this game is for you.\n\nI've been browsing and testing alot of free to play games on steam now for a year now and I've finally came across Wakfu. At first I thought "O.K... now let see what this game has before i uninstall it and move on to the next game." and holy sh!t guys. I've been hooked.\n\nNow this game isn't perfect, but no game is without it's flaws.\n\nCombat, when paired correctly with your LV, is tough. Very good challenge.\nThere are no "in-combat" consumable items, so no potion chug'n.\nNo NPC's you can sell your junk to, all currency is player based. Player to Player trading help build teams and connections.\nAlmost every item is a crafting material, even your equipment. Meaning most of your items can be upgraded to better teirs of equipment. However you need the the crafting skill.\nYou are not limited in crafting, so you can make everything in the game.\nMost game rules are controlled by the players, that sound a bit confusing but once you understand how the game works and it's politics.\n\nYou can really do some crazy things. This world is digitally alive.\n\nIf you're trying this game out for the first time. Play until LV.10 and decide if this is worth your time. And try multiple classes. Now I'll admit that this game is a grinder. There are times when I thought or said, "F**K THIS SH!T, I'm sick of killing these damn chicken peacock things." but still, it was so worth it when I collected all the items and made some sweet armor. Trust me the grind is worth it, and this game is worth your time.\n\n"just with i had more time to play...

The world is the same in both games, but the time and story have a huge leap, while you have almost all the same classes, the skills each one have is different in every one of them. But not different in sense that is only an upgrade, it's more about a different system without touching the gameplay itself, which is quite frankly almost the same.\n\nLike j-rpgs and korean rpgs, wakfu is a game where you gonna need to grind a lot in order to get strong, craft, obtain powerful gears. that could bother some players that wish to have more action. well in that case this game is not for you. Also it's a teamwork game, so party, groups, friends, guild is a must. Of course you can play solo, but you will need multiple accounts to fulfil your party.\n\nThe wakfu art is very cartoony and charming, I really enjoy the draws since Dofus, the french guys really got nice artists. Heck they even did an animation with tons of episodes , it's interesting , cool and a great addition to the game story and vision on the world of the twelve.\n\nUnlike dofus in wakfu you don't have to be a subscriber in order to play, But obviously if u p2p you have advantages suck as + 30% exp and drop bonuses. Howeever the game isn't p2w so no worries about that, every player can have the same stuff that someone that paid have. Most of stuff are cosmetics or consumables.\n\nAltought is not all rainbows and sunshines, the game currently have a few bugs that has to be fixed.

The combat system is similar to final fantasy tactics and players are able to shape the the environment. But there are not a lot of quests that will tell you what to do and lead you the way, it's more of a sandbox game where you decide what to do and where to go.\nIf you prefer quests from Lv. 1 to XXX this game will not appeal to you.\n\nMain Quests:\nWhen you create your character you will get your first quest chain until like Lv. 12-15.\nI think the next is around Lv. 35 to get your first mount.\nThe next one is at Lv. 50\nThen there is another one around 90~100\n...\n\nAs you can see, there is alot of spare time between those main quests. So, if you don't like to explore the world yourself, you will be stuck after each quest chain ends.\n\nClasses and Spells\nThere are 16 classes to choose from, each once has its unique fighting style. These are no archetype classes you'd normally expect. Except like 3 classes which are similar to Warrior, Archer and Assassin. But you probably won't know which one is the warrior, if you see them, they are more like a mix of a Barbarian, a Warrior and an idiot (The game calls them stupid, not me I swear). There are also Faries, Bamboo-Milkoholics, Machosists, Robots, Human-Plants, Gambling Cats, old greedy Farts, Terrorists and a few more...\nBut there is no higher class change at a higher level or something like that. You will be stronger when you level up your Class abilities and elemental spells.\n\nThere are 4 Elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Air. All Spells in the game are categorized in one of them.\nEach class has access to 3 Elements, 5 spells for each Element.\nEach class also has 10 Class specific supportive abilities. 5 of them are active spells, the other 5 are passives.\n\nWhat are the elements for? Everything has Elemental Damage and Resistance.\nIf you have a lot of Fire Damage, your fire spells will deal more damage, if the target you attack has a lot of fire resistance, you will deal less damage with your fire spells.\n\nElemental damages can go over 100% to infinite. Elemental resistance has a maximum of 100%(which would block 100% damage of that element), but you cannot reach that. I have about 60% resistance at Lv. 105. So you can at least reach that :)\nFor your first 20% resist in each element you will need 100 points in resist, which are 5 points for each % resist.\nAfter that it will slightly increase the amount needed for each % resist.\n\nLeveling\nThe best way to level up your character is probably by doing dungeon runs. You get a wisdom bonus in there, which increases exp gained. 20 Wisdom = 20% more exp after the fight. To enter a dungeon, you will need the corresponding key, which are usually not too hard to get. If you know what monsters are inside the dungeon, kill the same monsters outside of the dungeon, they will drop it sooner or later. You can also craft keys by using the items those monsters drop. Usually its 7x Item X.\nThere are also daily quests in each zone of the world, which tells you bring 10 items of the monsters that are lurking around. If you collect 20, you don't need to hunt them tomorrow, just accept and finish the quest immediately. Those quests give you a decent amount of exp.\nI think in all zones except the first one in each nation are also timed events with a small variety of quests. There are either monsters appearing, or other random stuff you have to interact with before the time runs out. Those are highlighted in green if you see them while the event is ongoing. There is a new event every 10-15 minutes I think and the exp is also decent if it's around your level.\n\n\nThere is a lot more to talk about this game but if I tried to explain every detail I know, I would need 2+ hours to write this review. I will try to end this with a short Pro and Con.\n\nPROS\n\n+ High Variety of Classes (16 Classes)\n+ 10+1 Crafting Professions (the extra profession can't be leveled. you can create in game money called Kama with it, if you have the materials)\n+ 6 Gathering Professions\n+ Battles get more challenging at later levels (monsters gain passives, you can't always ignore to win battles)\n+ You have your own home, which is a bag and is accesible from almost everywhere (You can put furnite in it, plant stuff and there is an item storage)\n+ A lot of costumes for customization. Also everything you wear, besides the belt, can be seen on your character, haven't seen that in many 2D games.\n+ If you don't have friends, you can have 2 Sidekicks fighting by your side.\n+ Shape the world, Kill monsters, replant them, cut trees and flowers and plant them where you want em, but be careful, in the open world everyone has access to this.\n\nCONS\n- Bugs, Glitches. The longer you play, the more you will find. Some are just minor bugs that don't matter much, others are killing you in battle. The worst battle bug I know is that you can't do anything for 1 round. I have that once in maybe 2 weeks. The friend I play with has it every 25-30 battles. I guess, it depends on your computer.\n- lack of guidelines\n- Most crafting professions don't feel satisfying to level (only a few things you can craft are better than hunting equip)\n- Some gathering professions are really slow and boring to level (Ex.: Trapper, most stuff you collect from monsters to level up will be thrown away to save item slots)\n\n\nI play and like this game because the combat is fun and challenging to me. In an even battle, every wrong step you take, might cost you or your party members life. The special effects are also pretty well done.\nIf some bugs and glitches scare you away, you won't be playing for long.\nGive it a try if you like most of the things I have mentioned about Wakfu. If the bugs you find don't affect your gameplay experience too much, you will enjoy it.","April 6, 2015","true","403.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Just one character at lvl 14.\n\nI liked this game and still plan on playing it. It's pretty fun, and I don't even like anime MMOs to be honest.\nThe choices and strategy is what caught my eye, and it's easy. So that's a bonus.\n\nKind of annoying that you absolutely need to do the tutorial every single time you make a new character, because if you don't, you do not get skill points and the level you were in the tutorial map. If you decide to skip the tutorial, it puts you into the online world with no skill points to spend, and you're level 1, and all the "low level" creatures are level 5 or higher.\n\nSo skipping the tutorial is an absolutely stupid idea, and a waste of time. Because it traps you in the house and will not let you leave. So you have to delete that character and do the tutorial. It shouldn't let you skip it if it just traps you inside of a house and never lets you decide if you want to go back and do the tutorial or actually leave the house. You're just stuck there until you decide to redo everything. Which is the most pointless option they give you.\n\nLong story short, DON'T SKIP THE TUTORIAL. It's an absolute waste of time and your character will be useless afterwards.\n\nAlso the compass sometimes does not track my missions. It will for a short time, then it vanishes without explination. I'm talking about the above ground quests, not the quests underground. It get's really irritating having to keep pulling up the stupid quest thing and  click the compass "Follow" button every single time.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out how I sell my garbage items to get money. Where is the NPC that just buys all your crap items? Or do I have to drop everything on the ground. Some things aren't explained in the game, and you have to figure it out for yourself most of the time.","October 9, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am not going to preach that it is the best thing since sliced bread but I am not going to say it is absolute ♥♥♥♥.  This game was made with children in mind and some of the visuals and names suggest the same.  This game was also a game you had to pay to play but as you can see it has gone free to play.  However, I do from time to time find some really funny, slightly immature jokes, that actually make me pause and laugh.  The infamous section in one of the regions named Mourning Wood is a big example of this.  There is even references to pop culture such as TMNT and it pokes fun at that series and the series of MMORPG's in general in some points.  However, some references are actually quite infuriating with their difficulty.  This can be solved with grabbing a friend or guild mate and running dungeons.  If that doesn't help you can always take up one of the environment quests that happens every so often that spawns in either special enemies or special objects into the world for a time and if you finish the quest, you get a decent reward of experience so it is not completely pointless.  They make the world feel very alive with the mobs interacting with each other and carrying out their daily routines.  There is also a special form of housing in this game called Havens.  You get a Haven Bag after the tutorial which is your portable house.  You can craft decorations to decorate or sell your useless ♥♥♥♥ to the unfortunate if you have a Display case to store them on.  There are also large zones for your guilds called Haven Worlds which contain buildings and houses.  I do not know much about this due to my guild being only level one.  But you can do Guild Quests which are 3 random assignments assigned every so often to earn guild points to help your guild level.  In addition to these quests, you can fight other guilds and other nations (Nations are basically a form of Alliance vs. Horde style and there are alliances and stuff and blah blah blah.) and earn guild points for every person in attendance of the battle.  Dungeons require keys that you can either farm off of the surrounding mobs, buying them from others or marketplace, or by crafting it if you have the materials and the proper training.  Dungeons are far from a cake walk and most definetly require at least one other person to help you.  But if you don't have anyone to play with, don't worry, you can unlock side kicks which are your companions that you control which come with their own abilities and can help you win the battles.  It plays similar to Final Fantasy Tactics.  As you use them, they grow more and more powerful.  So do your elemental abilities.  Of the probably 16 or so races, all can use magic, just some use it better than others, and there are specific spells just for your race.  You can have ordinary weapons, though these do not scale in damage and efficiency as you use it, so magic is a prefered option for heavy hitting.  Harvesting even has special encounters to mix it up, if you win, you gain 10x the resource you were collecting but if you fail, it halves your productivity with harvesting anything for an hour and it stacks higher and higher until you beat him, when you win, the buff and all the stacks are gone.  Good balancing.  This game is very strategy focused and if you get surrounded with no assistance, you are doomed.  Character customization needs some work but it is still great with some of the choices they give.  Combat is fun, dialog is interesting, and the social aspect is there.  There is no advertisers and everyone is friendly for the most part.  I recommend this game highly to all who love a challenging turn based strategy RPG.","September 27, 2014","true","55.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well Wakfu has some bad sides, but the good ones are much more! Great atmoshere, innovative gameplay, world ruled by the players and ofc since they go to f2p - this is MUST try, or better MUST play game! Since i mentioned the bad sides of Wakfu - it's support! Yeah, great game and devs and support guys tries their best to ruin it. Each update are worse, they did the most insane thing - made great Prison Island and after few months - they remove it ?! WTF ?! Who does that ? You must fix and made better the content u made, Ankama, not to remove it! Other bad thing is - they advertise something good on the cash market - u bought that precious item, and after month or two they change it and U left with worthless piece of trash. The support: well common joke with Wakfu people is "what support?" :) So this is it, good game with few negatives ... but it's pretty addictive, so u can handle the bad sides :P Have fun!","September 28, 2014","true","873.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Any avid Wakfu player should know that Dofus is the game that started it all.\n\nBut I digress. Wakfu is definitely worth your time if you love RPGs. If you don't, well, now's the time to start loving them. Beautiful, artistic, modern graphics combined with addicting gameplay, old school turn-based action, and funny NPCs make Wakfu a blast from the past as well as a next-gen RPG. So go ahead, give it a try, and if you don't like it then you can go back to CS:GO and/or TF2 and leave the rest of us alone.","October 4, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I started with Dofus, and gradually made my transition to Steam where I discovered more resources and a larger fanbase of my favourite games.\n\nWakfu, like its predecessor, is a player-controlled environment where the ecology and economy of the world are entirely dependent on the users. While that seems simple enough, the game goes slightly further, allowing players to be elected as the governing rulers of an entire area of the map, dictating how money should be spent, and how the environment should thrive. The downfall to the above is that 100% of your item profits are from users. There are no NPCs to whom you can sell or trade items from your inventory.\n\nWith a large collection of classes, Wakfu (and Dofus) has ensured the general availability of most preferred character archetypes, and has done extensive work keeping all the classes fairly well balanced. The tutorial is only generally comprehensive, so it's strongly suggested that trying a new class is done in the Incarnum world where everything is easy enough to not concern oneself with the dangers of durress. I personally prefer playing support roles, and have found that the highly acclaimed Eniripsa is fun, but the Eca and Xelor make healing very different, and definitely a lot more worthwhile in the aspect of overcoming challenges.\n\nLeveling is tedious, and the quests aren't very well thought out, so once you're finished with Astrub, prepare to grind. The maximum level takes a while to reach, especially since it's primarily done by grinding the entire way after LV20. Max level is 170 at the time of this writing, so there's a bit of perspective. The dungeons are awesome! when you can get friends to tag along, especially if you're following the difficult to locate storyline. I've read the manga and watched the anime, so seeing the dungeons and being part of the story is definitely a great deal of entertainment for me.\n\nIf you're having a tough time getting through an area or quest, and haven't made friends on your server yet, no problem; Sidekicks are available in the market for Ogrin. If you're from Dofus, you know Ogrin can be purchased with Kama (in-game money), and thus is possible to acquire at no cost (for those who prefer not to pay). As a long-time subscriber, I highly recommend you give Steam's monthly options a try. I'm used to getting a pet or piece of gear with my Ogrine each month, but Steam goes a step further including more items that are only available through the now gaming giant.\n\nMy final, most important factor to playing Wakfu is this: It's adorable! I love cute, and Ankama has done a great job at giving exactly that to me. Have fun, everyone, and feel free to join me on Nox or Remington. Just let me know you're coming.","March 27, 2015","true","154.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Due to recent updates, though, I'm glad that I waited to make this. There's one BIG thing about this game that I would like to point out that may be the decider for some people. This game's combat system works great and allows most of the game to be played solo. As all games work, it's better in a group, but solo gameplay is still fun.\n\nThis game has a lot of good to it. It has an amazing soundtrack that rarely reuses any songs. A great story (For an MMO. This is no Xenoblade level of story) that you don't have to worry about and can easily skip over. A very expansive world that can be explored without many worries and a great set of races (Which decide what your general class is.) The community in this game is great. It has lots of people who found the game for different reasons (Which includes its animated series.) One important thing it has is direct communication between the company and the players. Whenever big updates happen, Mods are on to help players understand what is added and understand themselves any problems with the update. There's also a Mod on Steam to help out players and post what the updates contain/when they come out. (I forgot to put this in originally, but the Mod also announces when the game goes down for maitnence ahead of time, so people can plan around it)\n\nThis game doesn't have much bad, but these points can easily turn someone away. The first major one is with the most recent update. This game just added a new spell system to complement individual play-styles better, but also made the game less new user friendly. (Though it is less new user friendly, that is only present because it used to be insanely user friendly and had a lot of freedom to it. Now it is moreso what people would expect from an RPG. This is an edit from after looking at the system a bit more.) This new update did a lot more than just a spell system, so it currently has quite a few glitches. At about level 100, the only easy way to level up and get good gear is by doing dungeons, which means groups are required to get through the game above a snail's pace. (Just a reminder from earlier in the pros paragraph, but the community is very friendly and helpful. This is only a problem for those that 100 levels into the game still want nothing to do with other players.) Powerlevelling is present and is something you might think would be good, but spells are levelled up individually through use. (This means powerlevelling should never be used for more than 10 levels. If you're going to do it, do it because the areas available aren't worth much, not because you don't wanna play the game. That's usually a sign that the levelling aspect of the game either isn't for you or not for you over long amounts of time.)\n\nI can easily recommend this game to most people and am willing to answer questions to anyone who comments on this. The game is still gaining many updates, so this review could easily have very few points that stay true other than the soundtrack, the gameplay and the community.(I'll try to keep it updated, though. Check when this was last editted to when the last major update was if you don't trust that this has been kept up to date.) If your not interested in this game after at least trying it (about to level 30) the developers do a ton, so you might want to look at there other projects or come back to this one at a later point. (This universe is their main project, so many of their project relate to eachother. This includes a similar MMO under a different artstyle and an animated series on Netflix that can be watched without needing to play Dofus or Wakfu. Basically, if you don't like this universe, they have many other things, but the few in this universe get the most attention.)","July 18, 2015","true","536.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

The strategic turn based combat is very well done, the monsters, skills and spells look good and its a world I keep going back to. Like any MMO, it will take you some time to level, but the game gives you a companion that makes levelling a lot quicker than it otherwise would be. Im more than happy with the pace of levelling and you get a level every couple minutes if you are in level appropriate areas.\n\nThe only thing that frustrates me is that the game has recently been updated to be a lot better and more friendly to players, but the player wikis have not been updated to reflect this. Mob levels have changed, some locations have been moved about, and I have found myself directed to places that no longer have the item i require once or twice.

I started playing again when it wend f2p and now I use steam to play it.\n\nThe game is much like it's predecessor Dofus. A turn based tactical mmo. But unlike Dofus you can change the world around U in real-time. Kill a lot of monsters and they get extinct cut down a lot of trees and there gone. And you can of course plant trees to let them regrow and you can even plant monsters so they come back.\n\nThere is a lot of crafting in this game and you can do them all! I advise you to at-least take up backing and farming because bread is the most used way of healing after a fight. You can wait to heal, and that's OK when you are low lvl. But after a while when you get to a point where you have a lot of HP it will take to long to just wait to heal.\n\nThere is a recent revamp of the game that changed the lvling up system. I think it did this in a good way and allows for more unique builds. They also did a revamp on the in game sets. You used to get a bonus from having a X amount of set items. These bonuses are now on the items themselves and the dmg type a set have is now randomly generated. I understand why they did this. So you can have any item you want and not be forced to use a complete set just to get that +1AP. But I Prefer the old system. That update has broken the economy a bit to. Items sell for a lot less now and its a lot harder to earn a decent amount of in game currency (kamas). But I hope that this is just now and will recover in a while.\n\nI think its best to join a active guild because this game really has a nice community. And its best to play with others.\nBest thing about the turn based system is that you have time to chat in fights with your team and discuses tactics our just have a good chat.\n\nAll in all its a great game and recommend it to everyone to try. It has a nice player-base, looks great, easy to run on almost any machine and although you can go P2P and never feels you have to, F2P gives you just as much to do in the game.","October 20, 2014","true","120.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You should give this amazing, under-rated game a shot.\n\nWakfu is an amazing game that doesn't get enough credit. It has been (mostly) improved by the most resent major update. (9/9/2014) The art and animations in this game are beautiful, the music isn't bad, and the new revamped level up system makes the game much more accessible, and actually give you a feeling of progression over the old stat system. If you like Tactic games and MMOs I don't see how you would not enjoy this game. There are two free and effortless character respecs. The first is given at level 30, when you have all of the skills unlocked and plenty of time to try them all out, and another at 80, when you have a much better understanding of the game. Aside from the two respecs given you can do a quest to respec, or buy a respec from the cash shop, to save time.\n\nThere are many classes to choose from, and they are all very different from each other. You have the more basic classes, such as the Iop, who is just a front line warroir. Then you have the much more complex classes like Xelor, whos spells have alternating effects every turn. On top of that each class can be played multiple ways. No matter what class you are looking for Wakfu will have a character for you.\n\nThe new starter zone/quests are mostly enjoyable. The starter quests explain a bit more, and reward with more items that you weren't introduced to at all before, such as; Weapons/Armor, Haven Bag Decorations, Shop Stalls. Inventory Bags, and a Pet. HOWEVER. The quests themselves are ... not very fun. Its not that they are bad, or poorly done, but they do not fit into this game. A sliding block puzzle is great, but not in a turn based tactics game. The other quest that doesn't fit uses silly context to teach you the mechanics to a (boss?) fight that you have to do right after... It would have been much more enjoyable to just FIGHT something. There is a daily quest NPC on every map that is simply collect X from Y and bring them to me. Much less annoying. Although nothing original there, if you are fighting the monsters to level anyway, it is a welcome bonus to exp. I have not tried the new "Mercenary" quests, so I cant give a review on those.\n\nDungeons are fun (I enjoy them at least) and there is no lack of them. The new token system means you wont run a dungeon 20 times and still not get the drop you were looking for. On top of this, any item from the token machines is account bound, so you can't flood the market with items you got from boss tokens. At the start of the game Dungeons and boss fights are simple and straightforward, the further you get into the game the more challenging and complex dungeons become.\n\nPVP has had more content added in the recent update, bringing PVP gear and rewards. Much more active PVP with the nation vs nation, and limited alliances between nations. If you do not have PVP turned on the only way someone can attack you is through the PK system, witch was already in the game. The level range to attack other players with PVP turned on is much too high right now, at 50 levels apart. I have high hopes that they will lower this range to 20, at the most. I believe for that to happen we would have to see a population increase.\n\nThe Ecosystem ... system, is both fun, and frustrating. On any given map there are values of monsters and resources that should be on the map, within your nations you gain points by putting said resources within these ranges. While the ecosystem is in balance, you will also enjoy a buff on that map. The Riktus clan gains bonuses by destroying this balance, so this also fuels PVP. The frustrating aspect of this is that little to no players seem to care about the ecosystems, the problem with that is that monster populations are a part of these. I have gone to maps with monsters nearly extinct because no one is repopulating them. An easy process through gathering from said monsters, and simply using the gathered material on an empty cell on the map. I believe the reason behind this is no one really want to level the professions used to manage these things. As much as I would love to see a population increase I fear it will bring mass extinctions to the beginning areas of the game, so please, at least repopulate the monsters.","September 18, 2014","true","519.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The first time was when the game was still under Squarenix's publication (They later relinquished it due to Ankama's lack of management). You left it once the game left beta and it created one mistake after the next. The second was when everyone flocked to the SEA servers which were free to play, unlike the American one's monthly fee for a laggy java game. You quit a second time after you calculated it would take you months of clicking on rocks to get your mining level to where you want it to be.\n\nNow you want to try it again. Oh, maybe it will be better. Maybe it will be more fun. While you're betting on that, Ankama is betting on you falling into the same trap for the third time.

I mean i really liked dofus but the pay2play subcription was a real downside. But turns out wakfu is huge improvemen of dofus and best of all it is completely no subscription to be able to enjoy the whole game content.\n\n8/10\nI would recommend playing this game if you like turn based combat. Alone or if you have a friend to play with that would be much more fun from low lvl up to high lvl.\n\nPro:\n+ Player driven economy\n+ 4 nations with players controlling them/governing them with rules chosen by the "leader" of the each nation.\n+ Can start war to control more lands for your nation or become allies to control more lands together\n+ All class skills are available once you have reached past lvl 10 and they have their one lvl depending on how much you use it in combat, no more lvl up for one skill every 10-20 lvls\n+ Turn based strategy combat <- I LOVE STRATEGY <3\n\nCons:\n- No Trade NPC to sell junk item to so you can get easy kamas(games currency).\n- Rather hard to find party at low lvl since you get your own sidekick and lvl up rather fast alone.\n\nCurrently i'm around lvl 20 so don't have much experience of this game but i have played dofus and reached lvl 40 or so. The similarity are almost identical but with new changes.","July 5, 2015","true","23.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

I played it on every game station it has. Started on PSX, then Lion War on PSP came out, I even installed emulator so i can play on my phone. Thats how much i Loved it.\n\nThe Grid-Based battle. The Story written. The Plot. The Character classical grinding process. The Class complexity and lots of skills each of them have.  The Game was simply.. perfect.\n\nUntil I reach a point where I want to explore another great game with same criteria. I try a lot of games, not very satisfying. Sometime the battle was not good, the story not interesting, too easy. it always lack of something, that tend to makes me stop playing. "Maybe  FFT is the best game after all." Thats exactly my thought at the time.\n\nThen, I found Wakfu.\n\nIt was an RPG. MMO at its best. Grid-Based Battle, and Free roaming. Various Character you could choose to play with and the complexity of each character skills, is remarkable. It has profession system, side quest like. A Guild, Nation, Outlaw, and environmental system. Also, It has many secret too. I found several secret places that even havent used.\nI saves several and upload on my profile.

Turn based combat is well executed, and the universe of the game is compelling. However, while the idea of an in-game ecosystem to maintain is brilliant, the way it is actually implanted is rather disappointing, it never really feels like your actions have a true impact.

A very high paywall.\n- steam sales =/= in game store sales on top of which there are sales on stuff in store. If you run the same game, why can't you package the steam bundles INTO your in game store the same as having sales on steam? Advertising trading cards that buying FROM the steam store don't go towards smack of free publicity without the payoff. In fact, a simple search on google reveals you tinkered with the in game/out game currency price to cash in on the new market on steam. The older players, who now can link into steam and may be interested in the card feature, won't exactly like the sales and booster unlock being on two seperate paths.\n\nIn fact, it's almost a slap in the face of anyone interested in your trading cards, as you're effectively saying: "buy stuff on sale and unlock all this in game optional frill bonus content, or unlock the booster pack for the cards and just buy some exp boosters, which is almost begged for by rhe see through costume, 2,500 in game currency I might add, that just lets you stay the same way you looked without your silly bunny hat equipment...I'm happy you can pay to make some armor sets look like others just with the same stats as the other one, but I've never quite heard of a game that charges you to look naked, it's neat, I'll get it that, but for the price????????????!??????????????\n\nThe paywalled character isn't game breaking; the in game shop is lacking in my opinion, except the boosts/subscription(exp boost/item drop/curency boost)/sidekicks, the costumes are kinda...limited. In spite of the franchise, the low costume count and their contents are just asian mmo style lazy, with the only one that really glows being a spikey samurai affair that we're all so familiar with, and hell, it only comes in one color mix of blue/teal/black. *I'm just getting into the series so this may be wrong *trying to avoid all this I simply bought a farmer costume, but my only options were pirate/drag queen as the rest is clearly geared towards ladies, muskateer, golden helmet = justice league/superhero (eh), dastardly black caped guy, mohawk S&M and that was about it. Whereas the female costumes had more variety and unless you count the super saiyan zodiac glow gear, generally better but not by much.\n\nAll of which is really kinda spendy. I can only hope the money goes towards animation costs as well as server maintainence, because aside from sale prices on steam, I can't see someone except a die hard fan of doofus/wakfu or the cartoon wanting to spend these high prices, except for the exp boosts, to reward the creators and devs, and good for them, but it really feels more like a friendly mugging then a reward.\n\n28$ will get you 13,000 in game shop currency.\n\n3x30 exp days (90), which start the second you buy them, costs 8,100 in game shop currency.\n\nAs far as sub prices go, especially an optional one, that's pretty good, but with every other item ranging 2000-3500 in game shop currency, to emotes, of all things, costing 900(effectively 2.5 dollars a pop) in game currency and there's about 15+ of them. Yeah, but at least unlike the sub it stays with you and that should make up for it, riiiiiiight? Ouch. Not for me, but for whoever is out there looking to unlock every little social thing in this game, it'll cost you. ...at least they animate nice, but maybe they should have been made into upgrades or version 2's of already available free emotes.\n\nSimply put: who is the target demographic you're trying to sell to? These prices seem wonky.\n\nThe exp rate isn't an issue unless you can't stand a grind, especially knowing you can put money on it to speed it up. Depending on how you approach mmorpgs, this would be a deal breaker as for some, that would mean they're holding the xp hostage and the grind is even more arbitrary.\n\nThat being said, have been meaning to catch up with this game and I'm glad I played it.","February 11","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are multiple classes to choose from, all unique, no archetypes are used, and combat is interesting, if not engaging. Party members can make or break certain dungeons and the learning curve is certainly high, but once you hit your stride, the game opens up tremendously. There are also several gathering and professions you can learn/master all of which can factor in your early game.\n\nAll the content is well thought of until you hit level 120-120 and then it all becomes irrelevant. The game has no endgame goals, PVP is pointless, token and nonexistent. The "government system" doesn't actually impact your game in any way and ecological features do not factor in the endgame content. Wakfu is a semi-meaningful 70 hours followed by nothing. If you like spending time by yourself crafting, farming and turn based combat, I recommend either getting Xcom2, Stardew Valley or Rune Factory on DS.\n\nNow, let me get to the bad stuff. The cash shop does not work. READ: Does not work. It isn't 100% reliable, which is pretty pathetic as far as F2P games go. Payment options are extremely limited cash shop or otherwise and there doesn't seem to be any change in the system.\n\nIf you're looking for a more robust MMO experience, hit up Terra online, Tree of Savior, or even Ragnarok. Let this game die in peace.","May 4","false","9.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

I played via Wakfu launcher for much more than i did here.\n\nThis game is a remake of a popular game known as Final Fantasy Tactics. a Square grid based, turn based tactical game.\n\nThere are some great features of the game but most are overshadowed with extreme lacklustre support and game management. Ranging from hacks and exploits never being dealt with causing the entire auction house(market) to flood kamas into the game nulifying the years spent aquiring them. Top end-endgame gear being duplicated and flooding the system making them about as expensive as a level 20 set.\n\nEven dealing with the PKing system which is an absolute joke if you run into a kiddie that has nothing better to do then camp decent leveling zones ( such as A.W) and kill you for no reason hours on end. (Which wasnt really a problem  after a while because i just Ddos'd him anytime i needed to enter the zone again so my friends and I could atleast play the game hassle free.)\n\nThen there is the subscription issue. As a player that has been with Wakfu and Dofus for many years now and owns all DLC and content. My subscription has finally ran out and I am no longer able to enter most end-game zones to further progress my character. So I provided Wakfu with money to assist with producing new content for them to release the content and then make me pay again to play on it... Seems a bit stupid from a consumers prospective. My friends and I have now actually quit Wakfu due to extreme neglect from Management and lack of content advancements over the years.\n\nWhile i DO recommend this game for a new users for a few hours to pass some time. I do not however advise you to ever pay them for their lack of service and progress and just quit once it gets a little boring after a hour or two.\n\nPS. There is a reason the "Bug and Issues" forum is bigger than the "General Disucssions" forum..","May 18","false","388.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","5","11","3","0"

You could hardly do anything. It was fun but so incredibly limited. Now that it's ~95% F2P, you can do pretty much everything. So far, the only thing I've seen in-game that costs real money is an account-share vault that allows you to store items to be used by all characters on your account. A huge improvement from what I saw so long ago.\n\nThe fighting style is very similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, one of my favorite games of all time. Play with friends or else you'll feel lost in this big, confusing world. You can solo but it's a lot easier with friends and the game seems to lean heavily on party play.\n\nI'd rate this game a 9/10 with a half point deduction because of repeatition (which is in pretty much every RPG) and another half point deduction because it's not as fun to solo.

It has the old isometric feel of old rpgs, and maintains the turn based combat with grace, hardly any part of the combat system feels clunky or out of place. Even grinding for xp (Trust me, you'll have to do that A LOT), there is a sense of achievement in beating your foe. The artstyle is really good, on par with the French TV show about it. It also has a nice diversity of classes, weapons, and fighting styles, for a free to play game. Also, DUNGEONS! There's a fantastic diversity of dungeons that help you level up, get some kick ♥♥♥ items, and are evidently made with a lot of thought and care.\n\nNow the bad parts:\nIt's often a bit laggy, not enough to make you sick, but enough to annoy you after several hours of viewing it. The game as mentioned before, is incredibly grindy. They give you a few missions to get you on your feet, and then set you free. to some, that sounds like a gift, but trust me, it's a curse. Yuo get lost easily, and the map is no damn help at all, so you end up killing Bow Meows (cats) until you stumble on an adventure. They have a lot of items and dungeons that can be only unlocked by being a certain level, which is to stop new players from being stomped, but leveling up becomes so hard after level 10 that you end up forgetting about dungeons, which is a shame because they are SO FUN. Customization, one of my most important parts of an rpg, is pretty much nonexistent, so make sure to create your charater EXACTLY AS YOU WANT THEM TO LOOK LIKE becaue there is no covering your mistakes in heavy armor.\n\nOther than that, the game is a really good time waster. Even though it gets very dull quickly, I find that I keep coming back to it, and I've made it a bit of my daily habit. Would recommend at the very least, try it.

The Steam-version lacks some sounds, what is a bit disappointing because they, too, made the fights and so on more interesting. What's bothering me is that I had an Ankama account before and linked it with my Steam account. Now it seems like I can't get any achievements on Steam for the things my character (that I already played before linking the Ankama account with the Steam account) does.\nSummed up, it's still a pretty awesome game but it lacks some stuff that the original from Ankama has. I'd really recommend it because it's fun to play and lets the players their freedom, the classes are interesting and if you know the series you're pretty much in heaven. Let's keep our hopes up that the lacks I mentioned before won't bother us for too long.","May 28, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Steam-version lacks some sounds, what is a bit disappointing because they, too, made the fights and so on more interesting. What's bothering me is that I had an Ankama account before and linked it with my Steam account. Now it seems like I can't get any achievements on Steam for the things my character (that I already played before linking the Ankama account with the Steam account) does.\nSummed up, it's still a pretty awesome game but it lacks some stuff that the original from Ankama has. I'd really recommend it because it's fun to play and lets the players their freedom, the classes are interesting and if you know the series you're pretty much in heaven. Let's keep our hopes up that the lacks I mentioned before won't bother us for too long.","May 28, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Hellcelot_/recommended/215080/","_Hellcelot_","Hellcelot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Hellcelot_/","127 products in account","I want to start out by saying, that if you can look past the initially grindyness of all MMORPG games, this game has a great community that you can return back to whenever. It's got great art, and wonderful music, cheezy PG-13 humor, and a great combat system.\nPossibly my favorite things about this game are the fact that the four nations of the game are entirely player-run. Economy, Ecology, etc. I play as a character that makes sure other players have enemies to fight and I try to keep a good ecological balance in the places I go. New players don't seem to realize that you can actually make an enemy type go extinct, so you have to be careful. This game gets an 8.5 or a 9 out of 10 from me. Anyways, that's it for my little introductory, brief review.\n\nFull review;\n- Wakfu has an anime art style. This is because it's based around an anime of the same name, which is a french anime that, while I've personally never watched it, I do know plenty of the characters from it and I do know that it is a really rather nice anime, at least, from what I've heard from my friends. It has a great soundtrack also reminescent of the anime, and the humor is right around the same. The character designs for the game are all very solid, and even though it looks more reminescent of, say, a flashgame, where you can notice like, how the limbs move, maybe stretch, you'll notice that here, but it's in a cartoony sense so you won't pay it much mind, Id think.\n\n- Wakfu has a very robust crafting and harvesting economy. All your resources, except for ores, are things you either have to hand-plant, or harvest from groves or gardens that are maintained by other players. Nations can impose limits to how many plants can be harvested or planted in a percentile range, and going over or below those percentiles will actually impose a penalty on you, being something as low as a 'citizen-level' penalty, to something as strict as a kill-on-sight bounty. The monster ecology for this game is exactly the same as the herb/tree/plant ecology, and everything is controlled by the players, even influencing the weather in the game for certain regions, making one region better for certain plants, and even time of years will influence the temperature!\n\n- Wakfu's combat system is probably just as robust as it's ecological and economical parts, and I'll echo the sentiment that this game's combat system is similar to Final Fantasty: Tactic's. I can't really say too much about the current state of the combat system, as it's apparently undergone a good deal of revisions, according to my friends, and skills and passives no longer work like they used to, and work in different ways, but the combat system is still very in depth, and you can view all of it's workings, majorly, in your own character screen, so it may be intimidating at first, but the more you play around with it the more you get used to it. I'm not a very serious combative player so I can't fully explain how the combat system works, but there are a lot of classes for you to try out and tinker with, so there's probably at least one playstyle for you to like!\n\n- On Wakfu's community.. I'm going to make one thing clear; Every game will have it's people who are there to ♥♥♥♥ with other players. This game is no different, and there's no exceptions. Players from hostile nations can invade your nation and try and instigate you to attack them, or deforest your region you're in. They can also try and bring your nation's enemy population down, but that's majorly it, people can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but a major group of people are either rather kind and helpful or they keep to themselves, which is understandable. This game shines in my opinion for how it's all player run, and you, yes, you could be nominated for helping whichever country you join, or even ruling it, if you make enough friends and prove yourself to be worth of such a responsibility. It's daunting at first, but you'll meet plenty of people who've played as leaders or as parts of nations. It's like, a half-sort of roleplaying thing, half nation management for your role. I've never been a member of a nation's staff, but I plan on working my way to that.\n\n(I'm currently reinstalling this game, and the game's done-- for now, this is my review, but I will add more later!)","October 23, 2015","true","251.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

I thought I would try it out to see whether it was good. It did NOT turn out to be just another boring MMORPG!\n\nThis game offers you to choose between many different classes with completely different battle and playing styles and it gives large variety in choice of character build and creation!!! You are very quickly allowed to go through a tutorial that introduces you as the player to the game and gives you the run through the game. After that is finished, the character instantly starts a questline that can unlock, and make it easier to go to, new and different areas! These many and different areas have levels at which they can unlock more questlines to allow you to progress through the game and get legendary, epic and other amazing items and trinkets that help.\n\nNot only is there all of the fun provided, but there is also quite a consistent PvP system that can rank you up quickly in fighting other players and give you useful rewards!!!\n\nIf that didn't get your attention, the creators honestly keep making and putting out Bonus XP weekends, awesome exclusive offers and purchases at the online website shop, and they certainly keep you busy with the ability to play three characters on the same account (Heroes), as well as use loads of sidekicks to help you out!\n\nIf you're not intrigued, oh well! I've loved this game since day one, even if I haven't had a load of time because of occassional barriers (Bear in mind that I've played much more on the normal launcher and not just the hours shown on my Steam account). However, it keeps you updated as much as possible, makes fun events and allows people to do their thing. The ONLY problem I found with this game is the 'required' purchase of Booster Packs to access the FULL contents. Although it shouldn't matter to most people, seeing as how most features are very much playable by anyone!\n\nWhether you're a loyal player coming back for more, or a newbie...Play this game if you find this cool, and if not, then go find something else!!!","November 30, 2015","true","40.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Second, some areas are black screen and you can still walk through it, Third, i got item bug which make me cant get any item even though i farm for it. Fourth, I level up my skills but it shows level zero even though it said i level up. The interface is fun, though sometime it is boring. still, not a game which i will recommend you to play with friends. If your playing alone, maybe you can go around doing quest and try.

It does little to hold your attention as I played it I found very little enjoyment in the combat system as I was thrown from boring quest to boring quest.\n\nWhat really hurts the game most though is how it trys introduce mingames viva the combat system one fine example is the Pizzalarva quest where the player is asked by a NPC to cook larva as this will train him somehow to fight Cult members. The idea was forced and the mingame itself was horrible as instead of just straight up fighting you had to not only keep the larva from reaching the end of the track but also had to tenderize and granish the larva the correct way. Sounds simple but in reality all the player finds themself doing is running back and forth from granish barrel to conveyor belt hoping that the next larva is the correct color and trying to keep other larva from escaping.","March 11, 2015","false","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Up until level 10 or so there are some really annoying quests but that's expected out of an MMO. There's one specifically which has you pushing flower pots into plants in some sort of puzzle that I find mind numbingly stupid.\n2. The professions are an amazing part of the game but there is no mission or anything that really explains any of them. You have to track down the trainers themselves and read the little mini books the give you on each profession.\n3. The starter area is way overpopulated and makes grinding out some of the lower levels/gear grinding kind of annoying.\n\nThat's the only real gripes I have, now, for the positives.\n\nPros:\n1. When they game says it has unique classes it really means it. I found myself making quite a few new characters just for the sake of trying out the classes. One that sticks out in my mind is the Escaflip which is a gambling class in a since. Certain skills in the class (namely the "Earth" path) are 100% based on pure luck. There are passives that make you luckier but I just find the class overall interesting.\n2. The amount of stuff to do fresh out of tutorial is amazing. Immediately what came to mind is runescape just on a smaller, better scaled version. Including the gathering, crafting, etc. which brings me to pro number 3\n3. This one will vart from person to person depending on who you ask but I do not find the gathering to be tideous or boring, Wakfu is a beautifully designed game with vibrant colors and cute, anime like avatars. I found joy and going around collecting seeds from animals. Yes, I said seeds from animals. This sort of solves the issue with con number 3 because it takes roughly 5 seconds (no exaggeration) for an animal to spawn after you plant the seeds.\n4. The community is very friendly and talkative. Now, me being a somewhat older player I found this to be annoying as well as helpful because, like I said, the game is very anime-esque. This means LOTS of 13 and 14 year olds. As long as you're the type of person who can easily ignore this it's no issue. If you go dungeoning that's where you'll find the informative, helpful, mature mmo players.\n\n\n\nI could go on and on about this game because I literally plaed it for about 8 hours straight. It's a fun game and I reccomend it to anyone who's looking for something new and different. solid 9/10","September 19, 2014","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay has very much depth on comparable terms to when ragnarok was popular before transitioning to 3D. For somebody who has watched the show on both seasons, I can say this is very faithful to the wakfu IP, especially if you like old video game references and culture.\nIt is a very artsy game for something than runs on java and is sprite based.\n\nGameplay\nThe game itself is very hardcore in terms of rpg's where you need to number crunches and research on having the ideal build for character’s. The gameplay is more forgiving in a sense compared to the old days where everything was un-killable without organized efforts. It is sandbox but it has some sense of direction, every so often you will get a quest giving you an idea of what you should be doing at this point.\n\nHowever the professions in the game and the drops give it a very strong grindy feeling, but it doesn't hurt so much because of how easy it is too grind. They give you several options and ways on how to level professions so you don't get bored or annoyed instantly.\n\nIt's very easy instead of being this long gradual process, not to mention how fast you can level up. In each battle they give these conditions in the upper left which are rule sets, and if follow them no matter how confusing they can be you will get some insane bonuses. Me and a buddy have been playing this since Friday, and we reached the 30's bracket with just 6 hours of game time each day in-between this game and dark souls. And we came from games like WoW and Guild wars where everything was boring and repetitive.\n\nThese rules are unique challenges and make everything more challenging because we are purposely putting handicaps on ourselves to get the best rewards. And the xp and drop rates are astonishing if you follow through, I used to beta test this game back in 2011 before they came to steam and I dropped it because of how much of a chore everything in the game was.\n\nThey have these little Gatcha machines outside of dungeons and depending on your performance in them you get these tokens to use on the machines so if you trying to build a set, you just go to this little machine and use the tokens you earned to finish the set.\n\nUps\nAnkama did some really good revamps and permeantly removed that paywall, everything is there for free to play and the gap between people who get boosters are very little because it just a time saver. There are some annoying options like not being able to deposit money or items in an account bank and have it spread across all characters, and having limited bag spaces;  But is solved if you just make bags or buy them off the market boards.\n\nThis may be one of the first games I played where they made the environment an integral part of the game because when you cut down trees, harvest plants, or kill mobs. These things don't respawn. You have to do your part and befriend nature by collecting seeds, planting trees, and breeding monsters so you can the players around you have access. You get rewards and points by helping the environment and give your character a reputation on how helpful you are to the people around you.\nEveryone is rewarded for not being selfish and increasing this collaboration between people.\n\nThe last part I’m going to cover is the politics system and how it affects people who join nations. The people in seats of power are given the reasonability of making sure everyone in their territories is looked after. They spend their cash and collect taxes to buy bonuses which apply to everyone in their nation and their lands by having increased drop rates, more natural resources available to use, and giving access to dungeons that are not normally open for everyone. They also organize the pvp structure for the lands and against other nations.\n\nThey pass laws protecting the environment and reward those who plant and expand dwindling resources. And give people titles for those who go out of their way to give security to the people that serve their realm. Everyone has a part to play to guarding lands against thieves and invaders, to distributing crafting materials and giving to the less fortunate or under leveled.\n\nDowns\nThe game is confusing at times and does not always explain what you need to do, I had to use the wakfu encyclopedia from time to time to figure out where stuff is, what drops what, and how to get things. It is also very weird on how sensitive things are for spells, victory conditions, quest conditions, and crafting conditions.\n\nThere was an instance where I had to capture and tame a wild giant turkey, and was given 3 books which actually do nothing for me in terms on capturing it. They gave me a book on how to eat these things when I am supposed to capture one and use it as a mount, so I do not know why they would tell me how to eat my mount. I have to talk to a guy inside the pen and had to make sense of his explanation.\n\nOne of the problems I have with the game is that I don't want to sit and read a bunch of paragraphs, and by not doing so I am punished by not giving me something intuitive. I constantly need to read stuff otherwise I won't know what I’m doing and I don't play video games to read things, I don't mind cut scenes and people telling stories but it’s kind of hard to enjoy the game if I am constantly reading everything. I won't give them ♥♥♥♥ for not narrating anything but it would be a nice change of pace if they gave small tutorials with a over voice explanation so you’re not constantly consulting manuals or googling.\n","September 22, 2014","true","47.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I always said that Dofus is great game and you won't ever find game like Dofus. How wrong I was. Wakfu is like evolved Dofus. Sure it lacks some things we didn't even know we like in Dofus (e.g. you don't get all skills at once so you have more time to learn using them), but generally Wakfu is even better. Why is Wakfu so special? You have to use your brain while fighting. Of course you will have some skill pattern, few skills you will use again and again, however you have to know where to go, who should be killed first, etc. New monster means new type of battle. And another great thing Wakfu offers to its players is economy and ecosystem. There are no NPCs for buying/selling, everything is on players. Another thing, that depends on players is nature. You can gather plants, you can cut trees, but if you want them to grow again, you have to plant them. And monsters as well. Also everyone in certain area can get bonus, because special NPCs who take care of areas will tell you how much trees they want there, how much monsters, ... And if they are pleased, players get temporary bonus stats. I am not saying everyone will love the game, but I think everyone should at least try.","September 23, 2014","true","516.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Wakfu really tried to build a world that was entirely dependent on the people who play it. So, right off the bat? There are zero NPCs, aside from the occasional quest giver. That means if you're looking to sell your ♥♥♥♥, you better start up a stand. There's also an Ecology system that effects monsters and gathering nodes (trees, plants, ore, etc.) wherein, if you kill too much, or take too much, it'll actually GO AWAY. It's up to the player to repopulate these areas by planting things, breeding animals and generally working with the "Wakfu" of any particular area.\n\nSome other notable parts are as follow: Player elected governors, citizen points that can effect how the world treats you (Wanna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, be an outlaw and go to jail? Hell yeah you do.), instant player housing (Haven bag) that... also works as your store, a place to decorate things, a place to put gathering nodes and so on. There's also huge maps, the ability to spec into every kind of profession, interesting character classes that have little to no over lap as far as utility... I mean, come on!\n\nI'll admit I'm pretty stoked about this game. However, it is definitely not a game for everyone. The combat can be pretty off putting, and it's generally not as fun of an experience if you go at it alone. But, if you're the type of person that really likes to see a game take some amazing steps for MMOs, you might wanna give this a shot.","September 21, 2014","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

They gave me a book on how to eat these things when I am supposed to capture one and use it as a mount, so I do not know why they would tell me how to eat my mount. I have to talk to a guy inside the pen and had to make sense of his explanation.\n\nOne of the problems I have with the game is that I don't want to sit and read a bunch of paragraphs, and by not doing so I am punished by not giving me something intuitive. I constantly need to read stuff otherwise I won't know what I’m doing and I don't play video games to read things, I don't mind cut scenes and people telling stories but it’s kind of hard to enjoy the game if I am constantly reading everything. I won't give them ♥♥♥♥ for not narrating anything but it would be a nice change of pace if they gave small tutorials with a over voice explanation so you’re not constantly consulting manuals or googling.\n","September 22, 2014","true","47.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will do a LOT of grinding.\n\n2.) The end game dungeon currently requires you to pay to even ACCESS. (No sub means the highest level area is locked out for you.\n\n3.) If you pay money you get to field more heroes/sidekicks allowing subs to monopolize more turns per fight\n\n4.) PvP is dominated by people who have sunk hundreds, if not thousands of hours into the game, even with subscriptions. If you plan on doing any serious pvp, it won't be until your AT LEAST 1,000 hours into the game. Until then be prepared for a lot of repetition.\n\nIf one of these points don't turn you off then you might want to check the game out. Mechanically it isn't bad and the community, for the most part are a cool bunch of people. That said, around 120-140 prepare to spend hundreds of hours running the same 1-2 dungeons fighting the same group of mobs over and over again. Unless you can join a guild to find people who will help pass the repetitive nature of the game it will eventually get to you.\n\nNOT FOR LONE WOLF PLAY - PERIOD","January 10","false","359.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Tactical RPGs should never be MMO's to begin with and the game has very little driving aspect to get the players to play the game. That being said it still has unique features and fun gameplay mechanics that is better suited for single player. You can play single player in the game by building a bunch of characters and then sidekick them to your main character (with the only fatal flaw being you have to spend over 25$ just to even do that for 90 days). I like where Ankama is going with this but they are doing it the wrong way. They should do what Squaresoft did when they made Final Fantasy Tactics for the Playstation 1. If they were to do that and sell the game for roughly 20$ on steam than they would be able to have a successful video game. If people like tactical RPGs, this game will be up your alley. Just a note though: Game is kind of buggy and not many players to play with.","January 2","false","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I used to play it with a bunch of friends back when it was in closed beta, and still do from time to time nowadays. Why is that? Well, quite simply, because it's addictive.\n\nFancy stylized graphics, isometric perspective, fast yet challenging levelling, satisfying combat, microtransactions never seen ingame and do not offer any advantage, the list as to why this game is great just goes on. Additionally, it runs on low-end hardware and takes very little space, making it the perfect MMORPG to put on weak computers.\n\nThis game does have a few flaws, however. The customization is limited, it uses Java (Resulting in memory leaks) and more importantly, it just isn't as fun to play alone. If you really want to experience this game to it's fullest, having friends around is almost a requirement.\n\nStill, I reccomend you give it a try. Install it, go on the international server (Remington, which for some reason offers free premium membership) and have a look for yourself. It's just worth it.","July 9, 2015","true","50.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm supposed to be gathering a bunch of flower seeds, but the game is refusing to count them as I harvest. Then the "Report a Problem" link locked up the game.\n\nI can't comment on the quality of the game, because I can't play it.

Wakfu of course is that sequel.\n\nWell it was announed years before it arrived and that signalled only the beginning of its issues. Not as late as Duke Nukem Forever but late enough to miss its own funeral because Wakfu is effectively dead.\nI say effectively because the servers seem to still be online, probabaly with the funding from the first game and piggy backing on those servers too no doubt.\n\nDofus became a franchaise even having its own cartoon series over in France and its nice that we have a game filling this cutesy on the surface but brutally difficult when you play niche, but Wakfu is an MMO and with so few people around to play with, it just falls apart.\n\nBut lets go back in time! What about when there WERE people to play with? Dofus was still a better game! Its like they took out all the things in Dofus that demanded teamwork and made Wakfu a 1 player game with online connectivity.\nSome people may like that idea but remember that this game was born from an MMO; it is akin to World of Warcraft having a World of Warcraft 2, still set in Azeroth only now its a one player twin stick shooter. It might be good on its own merits but we can't ignore the dramatic shift and we know the old crowd, the ones most likely to even want a sequal are going to feel very alienated.\n\nThat is Wakfu. Welcome to Wakfu.\nNow all that aside is the game even good? Well the animations are fantastic, no really they are a joy to look at! The music...Well it exists. Yeah no one track really adds much which is a shame. The graphics are once again top notch like the animation and looking at the world around you isn't breath-taking like in Dark Souls or anything like that but they look great. Real dediction went into every art asset.\n\nWakfus biggest failings are not even its own fault. Communities grow and wain as new products come out to tempt the crowds. Anakama are terrible at customer support but that is more of an 'outside of the game' issue. The music might lack pepper but that is very minor indeed. Really I don't recommend Wakfu but only for 1 reason and that reason is that its old!\n\nI don't mean old games suck, not in the least but what I mean is the community is effectively gone, its like Guildwars, which is a fantastic game, but going into Lions arch and having no one to play with, well it is the death kneel for an "MMO" and while people are playing Wakfu, the vast community has long since moved on and when I played I found barely anyone to interact with, even my screenshots were barren of life when I took them.\n\nWhat a shame.\nIf you and enough of your friends can populate the game, you may have fun. If however you are looking to play this game in order to make new friends then move on, their is nothing to see here.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 26, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","3","8","3","5"

Between the absolutely terrible tutorial on my first session, and the failure to connect through steam on my second session, I don't recommend it.   The characters are cute, but as with many MMO's, the story is so nonexistent as to be pointless.  Whether RPG or tactical, I come to an MMO for the story.  That story should be something that engages ME, and the character I've created, too, not just some authors' buttpatting himself and his side characters.  I should know my character's role in the game, and what the plot basis is, within the first ten minutes of playing.  In that regard, this is a complete failure.  I played for over and hour, and had no idea.  I finally got to a cinematic, and it wouldn't play.\n\nWhat I've seen of the anime is also so deeply geared toward making you want to play the game, that it burns the heart and soul out of anyone who loves animation in its own right.  The anime is to this game, what My Little Pony was to their toys, back in the 80's.  It's just self-aggrandizing garbage, made SOLELY TO GET CHILDREN TO BUY INTO A PRODUCT LINE.  It's the kind of thing that knocks the world of animation to the stone age.  In a period where there are a ton of folks trying to elevate animation into an art form and a craft, people are still shoveling out cartoons like Wakfu, which exist only to be advertisements, and they destroy the credibility those people have worked so hard to build.  Shame on everyone with their hands on it!  The art is beautiful, I won't lie, but they essentially sold their soul, and far too cheaply, at that.\n\nIf you're feeling in an MMO mood, go play WoW, EVE, or Guild Wars 2.  You want FFT style tactics, then just go replay FFT.","September 28, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

PvP is not fun at all in this game and hard to find.  Most people with their pvp wings up will just have a counter build waiting for you after the fight so if you dont play with 6+ accounts you are at a huge disadvantage.   Then theres the merit farmers who just pvp themselves for points so the ranking system is a complete joke.\n\nThere really is no reason to play this game unless you wanna feel like a complete dweeb playing a multiplayer game BY YOURSELF with 6 accounts.  Or if you are heavily medicated and need an endless supply of things to click over and over while your life slips through your fingers.\n\n","May 10, 2015","false","99.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","2","3","0"

It has its own unique charm and somewhat unique gameplay elements. There are many job classes--and I do mean many with tons of specializations you can consider by spending your precious skill points in one skill tree or another.

WHY CAN I NOT COLLECT RESOURCES ANYMORE!? Why would you not tell me this BEFORE I choose a profession!? Your tutorial sucks!\n\n4 hours in, getting annoyed that I STILL DO NOT HAVE A RANGED WEAPON EVEN THOUGH I PICKED THE ARCHER CLASS. No money to buy any ranged weapons, no general stores to be found to even buy basic equipment having to pray to the gods that someone threw a bow on the ground to sell...still no ranged weapon...\n\nNearly 6 hours in, encounter a glitch that made the pizza larva mini game strike against me even if I do everything the game asks of me...oh and still no bloody ranged weapon, got some spells but I am equiped like an axeman. Did I mention I STILL DONT HAVE A RANGED WEAPON!? Because I dont!\n\n\nI wanted to share my experience because it seemed the only way I you could feel my pain.\n\n\nWhat is the point of being a ranged class if they don't even give you want you need to be the class YOU ARE TRYING TO BE! Something is wrong here...why would you do that? Why would you force a ranged class into melee for so long? Not even a starter weapon for the class, I would of settled for a bag of rocks at this point. At least it's ranged, at least I would of got to put my strengths to some use.\n\nWhy does the game only explain I'm locked out of something else after I learn it? Can I even unlearn professions? I don't know, the tutorial sure didn't say anything about it...hell, if I could ask NPC's in the starting town how stuff works I wouldn't have a problem with this...but that's not an option! You just get a text box telling you some vague things about what you did, and basically laughs at you because you didn't know before hand. The Souls series has better tutorials then this game, and that is the most bare bones tutorial I've seen ever...yet it told me more information then this game did.\n\nHow do you do that!?","January 7","false","5.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","1"

Too bad it doesn't make any use of it.\n\nThe combat is fun. It's different than what most games do, it's pretty tactical. It lasts you for about 2 days, because it gets repetitive fast.\n\n\nWhy? Well there are a lot of classes, they are pretty different from each other, you can really find one for you. Each class has 3 branches of abilities, depending on element you will be using.\n\nWhile you have up to 15 active abilities you will only use about 2-3(at most) from them, since there aren't many situational skills, there are just those that do more and less damage. You don't want to mix abilities between branches, because that means less damage(best gear gives element based +%damage). Skills in the same branch usually have the same range, so you're stuck with either long range or close combat once you choose. And that's not a bad thing right? Well, no, but once again, you're stuck with using 2 skills because the others deal less DPS.\n\nIt doesn't help that you kill the same enemies over and over again, because the game is so empty that finding a group for a dungeon is nearly impossible, except for the most popular dungeons, and even then it's problematic.\nMost people meet in starter area,which is pretty populated. After you get to your nation, you're pretty much playing single player with someone passing you by every once in an hour.\n\n\nAt least the crafting system looks nice, after choosing to become an area of effect weapon smith I was greeted with message that I won't be able to harvest materials, and will have to buy them from lumberjacks and miners.\nWish I had some kind of warning before I chose my profession, but okay, I'm fine with that, the system looks great! This means that what I make will surely have buyers, because if you're a lumberjack you won't be able to make those weapons. If you're a baker you will buy my weapons and I will buy your bread. That's awesome! Finally someone did it right.\n\nExcept I still could harvest. I could chop down the trees and gather iron ore from deposits. I could learn all the professions and create anything I needed myself.\n\n\nInstead of having good economy based on supply and demand, they screwed it up completely. You want to be a baker? Well you better be a farmer too, because otherwise you would have to pay for the flour.\n\n\n\n\nIt's fun for about 2 days, after that you have tried all classes, finished the Astrub(starter zone) quests 10 times, and there's no point in moving to main land, since there's no people there.\n\nThat's a shame.\n\n\n\n","September 25, 2014","false","131.1"," 18 of 39 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","18","39","0","2"

What makes it tactical is the fact that you might block other players view, you have a limited amount of steps you can take per turn, and stuff like that.\n\nIt also has an interesting ecological system in which you can take part. To take part in it you can plant new trees, spawn new enemies, plant crops and of course harvest all this stuff, etc.\n\nBUT if you are looking for something like a "classic" MMORPG with straight questlines you might want to try another game because this game is a pure grinder. Except for the starting zone there are like no quests. All you do is to go from one group of enemies to another. While doing so, do not expect to meet any other players.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that this game has a great potential because the tactial fighting system is a lot of fun but there are hardly other players except for the starter city but still there are like a 100 servers. What ruins the game for me is the lack of quests.","October 17, 2014","false","11.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

But here is my perspective:\n\nThe game is quite nice but I do not reccomend this to brand new players. It really is not new player friendly, and the dungeons are very difficuly for new players. You need patience to play this game.\n\nIt is turn based, and the combat system is unique but what made me (as a new player) leave this behind were:\n\nDungeons that are puzzle based, really give you zero hints on how to beat it. You are forced to use google on this and you cannot leave a battle unless you quit the game. Other tactical based mmos allow an "escape" feature if the battle is too tough or you need to leave, this however does not.  This right here is a red flag for me.\n\nAnother feature that didn't really keep my interest is the quest system. For new players, if you log off, you have to manually try to find your quest destination as most do not give you a compass (quest tracking tracing feature).\n\nSo in summary:\n\nPros\n____\n\nUnique battle system\nTons of classes\nSmall Patch and Download\n\nCons\n____\nNot new player friendly.\nMap layout can be confusing for new players.\nGoogle how to beat puzzle dungeons (new players).\nNo hints on puzzles from in-game.\nCan't leave in the middle of a battle without logging out. (no escape or flee chance option).\n\nOverall: Do tons of research and look up guides if you are new to Wakfu. If you are a veteran, then jump right in.\n\nNew player perspective: 3/10","September 24, 2014","false","3.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Many different stats affect gameplay.\n\nThere are no NPC's. Players will have to barter or trade for any ingame currency. This can be a blessing or a curse depending how it is implemented in a game and how a games economy is setup. In wakfu , this is a curse.\n\nWakfu suffers from an extraordinarily handicapped economic system. There is a central auction house however most things cost 1-20 / ea , ingame currency. If those things are even listed. It is cavernously empty most of the time. Many items run 20,000 - 20,000,000. Prices vary wildly , not because of some economic principle , but because there is a large glut of equipment left over from those whom are "Leeched" through most of the games levels to level 105 by already established guilds. If your a new players who does not wish to interact with or play marco polo trying to discover who the major guilds are - Good luck.  The player base is sharply divided between old veteran players (commanding in some instances hundreds of millions of ingame currency) , whom are largely silent and meandering new players who dont seem to understand what todo or where togo and whom appear to be largely confused.\n\nLeveling is fun ....... the first 50 times you encounter mobs.  Once you realize exactly how much grinding is entailed you begin to understand the presence of xp pots in the ingame item mall - and why new players are encouraged simply to quit the game if they cant find an active guild which they can tag along with during higher end repetitive runs. Seriously , I was told this several times.\n\nRespec'ing your character? Is considered an act of god in this game. An occassion so special that it requires no less than 1400 items spread across 8 different mob types which must be killed to gather at a pace of about 1-3 per encounter (Not kidding). Even THIS can only be done every 30 days.  Act of god? Or act of marketing? You decide.  Oh and if your a new player - you can expect these encounters to last anywhere from 5-10 mins , EACH.\n\nFor a game as complex as wakfu is with so many different tactics to try - to have such a choke hold on simply redistributing points you earned through gameplay is rediculous in the least in my opinion. It is clearly a money grabbing effort.  Almost no information is available for many of the classes , many posts date back to 2012 - some so far as 2011 - so one is never sure whether the information you are getting is upto date or not.  The game is updated semi-frequently however , going so far as to literally change the stats on sets of armor between updates***     Have fun with that!\n\n\n\nDespite all of this?  Im still playing it. Glutton for punishment? Likely.","October 8, 2014","false","96.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snekadid/recommended/215080/","snekadid","Snekadid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snekadid/","755 products in account","This game is terrible. Think of the worst aspects of The Old Republic F2P along side the grindiest bits of the original Ragnarok online and you have Wakfu.\n\nUnless you pay money you earn half as much exp and constantly lose items, that they blatently flaunt stealing from you in the exp window after combat labeled "PREMIUM REWARDS". Thats not all! Theres a P2W element in the mix too! There as sidekicks which are additional party members that you control. They give you one free one, but he has only 3 attacks and is always weaker than single mobs of the same level, meanwhile they sell a wide variety of sidekicks that have about 5 attacks along side passives and a higher stat climb and you can use multiple at the same time. Thats all along side what appears to be a level buying option in the store labeled "Class change 1-200". Thus ends the money section, onto the bad systems.\n\nThe crafting system is a hilariously bad joke, requiring a ludicrious amount of materials for even low level recipes, to the point where you will out level anything you are trying to make before you can get the mats and the skill level to craft it. Also, pretty much all the crafts require you to use something you make using early mats even way back into the later levels, which means grinding low level herbs and picking cat hair ro make that leather you need off level 1 mobs at level 50.\n\nThe dungeons aren't terrible, they have about 3 fights in them that rise slowly till the final boss, but the grouping mechanic doesn't work. I ♥♥♥♥ed with it for a full 15 minutes before giving up. From what I can tell people put up requests to do a dungeon or quest and people can .... "register" for thier group, but nothing happens and trying to set up my own was a waste of time due to poor UI implimentation as the buttons had faces and crap on them rather than words so what they did, if anything, was unclear.\n\nThere is no story. They pretend there is one but there isn't. Intro: something horrible happened and youre the hero to fix it, and thats the last I heard about it till i quit at level 30 due to boredom.\n\nThe game is so buggy I'd call it broken. Alongside achievements being disabled since september according to the forum, I was given a quest thats uncompleteable due to being unable to interact with the arena tables without getting a connection error in game. Leveling up is agony since mousing over a stat to see what it does causes the display box to stutter rapidly until you find the magic pixel the game wants you to rest the mouse over so that it can display properly.\nThis doesn't just apply to menus though, the game ♥♥♥♥♥ itself if you are both moving and mousing over an NPC, jerking and flickering so much that you'd think it was crashing.  Then theres the broken npcs. I went into an area where EVERY SINGLE female mob was bugged and as a result so was every other enemy that was in its group. I could not harvest from them, I could not attack them and they covered an ENTIRE ISLAND, so it was effectively offline. That was one occurance, It happened 4 different times with 4 different mobs in 4 different areas and logging out and back in did not fix it, it was a server issue.\n\nFinally, the game also lags horribly. I have a 3mbps connection, yet every 10 seconds everything on screen would stop while the server struggled to keep up with what is a turn based game.\n\nThere is charm in this game. The combat is interesting though bog standard for a tactical game and the art is cute, but it is so grindy and incompitantly taped together that I cannot recomend it to anyone.\n","January 20, 2015","false","19.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

[The part where you need to explore the cementary]\nDude wtf. Im just level 6 and you ask me to fight a level 10. This is not a normal RPG. This is turned based. And when I was fighting I read what I was supose to do. They asked me to hide to avoid getting damaged by the chaos plants which is summoned by this strange mage. I managed to pass the first one. But then there was another.. The 2nd part there was less hiding spots. Also I stood behind a tree but it still damaged me. I was like -.- there is too many chaos plants. Then I died it says if i wanted to reappear but just now I died trying to fight the first one beacuse idk what to do and I clicked I wanted to reappear it sends me back to spawn. So I didn't want to fight the first guy again so I waited for 3 minutes. Nothing happened... So I though its done so I clicked reappear.... And so I had to fight the first guy again.

Sence the anime finished they stoped updateing the game and theres like no one playing this anymore it looking better in anime 100% and more beautiful and the quest tracker sucks balls.  ya if it tells you GO KILL SWETTY BALLS where is swetty balls and you go search for a hour and still cant find swetty balls.  the biggest snitch about this is XD you need to do things in the game to get more classes ya like in gonna go back and do a class that has a pet  and dose 4 DAMGE.  This game is crap they should remove it from steam no one bothers with it anymore probbly not even the developers. overall in my way its 3/10 the artstyle is not good (Was 2014 the year that everything looked like it was real and had over 1000 graphics and chould make you speachless) and i call BS too the story  STORY: you warp in too a place that looks like a kid made it up when he was dreaming you greated by a FAT ♥♥♥ PANDA that calls you a noob ya i started but dont have to be a ♥♥♥♥.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiderr/recommended/215080/","spiderr","Crunchy Spider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiderr/","868 products in account","My review will simply be about things I wish people had told me before I clicked 'install' on this:\n\n1.) THERE ARE NO VENDERS TO SELL JUNK TO. Too much junk? Throw it on the ground. Click 'Ok' on popup. Did it have a little hammer icon on it? Whoops, looks like it was needed to craft some crap somehow. No big deal, was probably 1 of 90 of the item needed.\n\n2.) GOOD LORD THERE IS A LOT OF CRAFT GRINDING. Let's say you wanted to wanted to make a 'Ham Sandwich' so you got +2% damage for 15 minutes (in a turn-based game). In WoW, you'd butcher some mobs and buy some salt and then cook over a fire pit and *BAM* 'Ham Sandwich' ... but not Wakfu. Nope. Go grind mining until you mine raw salt, make 3 raw salt into "Refined Salt' and then go out in the field and skin some mobs for meat. Hope you leveled skinning! Go farming for wheat. Make 3x wheat into flour. Draw some water. Bake the bread. Cook the Sandwich. Each of those skills, the Mining, Skinning, Farming, Baking, Cooking... are all separate skills with a METRIC TON of grind and there's a FAILURE CHANCE as you're crafting. ALL THAT FOR A SANDWICH BUFF THAT WILL BE OVER IN 1-2 COMBATS. Since there's no vendor to sell crap to once you're done, you either throw it on the AH (Governor sets a tax!) and it come down after 24 hours or you put that trash right on the ground because your bags are full.\n\n3.) SPACE FOR ALL THE MATERIALS. There's no low-end bag vendor. You get two quest bags early on, but you'll fill up soon and the "You're too full" popups always have a "Are you sure?" annoyance chaser. Nobody makes low-end bags on the Auction House, so you're left stumbling through a horrible crafting system. Often, you'll need stuff from Tailor, Tanner, AND Armor crafting lines to get an item made... and the next upgrade will need you to make 3x-10x more of those AND use dungeon boss drops. Don't forget the failure chance! Or you can spend $1USD on 9-slot bags or $3-$10 on bank slots.\n\nThis game could easily be the MMO equivalent of a 'F-ville' game. You can walk anywhere without being attacked and just grind material collection. This could honestly be the best Mother & Son, Farming & Killing crossover game of all time... but that'd be such a rare niche thing to hit. If this was Steam Market-able, then you could play the game with all sorts of loot and then sell it or trade it on the market once you'd decided it was way to grinding and directionless... but you can't. Meanwhile, Ankama totally wants you to spend $10 on character pimping, $10 on functional stuff, and then $6 every 30 days on a 'booster pack' for XP boost and access to subscriber content.\n\nThe last thing I can say is about the class I played. Sram. I HATED the character design of the Sram, but it did what I wanted. I hate, Hate, HATE the character design. It's a stupid sugar skull design tattoo'ed on a WoW troll, complete with troll witch-doctor hat. But you may think "Well, weren't there cosmetic outfits or at least armor for characters?" Well yes. But all the other characters have on short-shorts or just panties, so 99% of the outfits are designed to leave the legs bare. The stupid Sram is in a bone-print onesie, which bleeds through every outfit but one. And there's no reason given! None! There's no "Oh, they have to wear this crap or their souls won't go to Sramville!" ... it's just "We didn't make pant-armor in the game so nothing ever covers that up?"","October 11, 2014","false","751.0"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","1"

The delay in my text appearing on screen is almost 5 minutes long you dont want to know what its like in a battle.\n\nI don't have these issues in any other games other then wakfu even their prior game Dofus which has been around for 10 years isnt laggy.\n\nHow this got on Steam i will never know.\n\nThey keep bringing out more new cool things with each update but never actually work on the current issues not to mention their customer service is absolutley shocking. Countless threads have been made in the forum regarding issues with the game and they have gone unheard or simply ignored for YEARS! There is an issue that every person has ingame where they will start to freeze up at around the 3 hour mark of playing if not sooner. But as ankama doesnt bother fixing this long time running issue the players see it as a normal thing and actually accept that they have to restart their client every hour or two just to keep playing.. What if your in a high level dungeon and all of a sudden start experiencing these freezes. I know for a fact my guildmates have become frustrated to the point where they quit as have I.\n\nI came back to check it out as I saw it was on Steam but I am very dissapointed.\n\nThe game has picked up in popularity due to its Steam release but alas I still think its not worth the time invested, As like me you will get a high(ish) level character invest money in the game and then it slaps you in the face and becomes unplayable.\n\nAlso purchase Ogrines at your own risk there are multiple reports of people not recieving their Paid for Currency and as Ankama take so long to reply you may be waiting over a week to hear back..

It changes core features of the game with patches, and patches are common; it changes classes, changes skills, items, most of the times it makes them all obsolete.\nI remember playing a sacrier back then when the game got "full", i spent months building him tank, a lot of months and time, the GRIND... What happened next? Ankama decided to nerf every skill of the Earth Sacrier... ok, so i can live with that... what happened next? There was ONLY ONE BOSS that COULD USE an Earth Sacrier that was build IN ONLY ONE WAY... so i was obsolete/useless. Pretty much 8 months wasted.\nI dont even want to start with the loot.\n\nThe Game Art its beautiful, lovely, i really like it.\nThe gameplay, is good, sometimes the fights are intense. Some fights can change with just a blink, you may thought you already won the fight, but then something happens, like a critical, and it changes everything. It can improve drastically, it can learn from really good RPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics, but overall its ok.\nClasses balances where ok back then, but as i said, Ankama HATES this game and its players.\n\nI encourage you to try the game because it has A LOT of potential, and hope someday Ankama dies, Square Enix dies, and a good developer gets its hand on it.

I know this comes off as incredibly negative review but I was trying to curb my frustration with this game for the simple reason that I REALLY wanted to like this game. The genre is SO rare to find a good version of it that isn't plagued by utter stupidity.\n\nThe BIGGEST and most SACRELIGIOUS issue with this game is the TIMER. Don't EVER make a tactics game with a timer. There's NEVER a reason to do this and it just rushes things.\n\nNow ... this wouldn't have been such a massive issue if it wasn't for the fact that everything is SO hard to understand. The translations aren't HORRIBLE, but the descriptions are rather ... vague and subpar. They make figuring out how abilities work and effect function more trial and error than actual reading and understanding. Which is made harder by a short turn timer.\n\nThen you have an opening tutorial that does nothing to grease new players into the game. This will be a grindy game, from beginning to end. And in all the weirdest ways. Grinds in the typical ways of course too, but weird ways like forcing yourself to learn a new game that fights against you because the genre is so promising and the like.\n\nIt's very painful to see such a pretty game turn me away because of simple, outright, horrible execution. I sometimes wonder after playing a game like this .... Do these people even play their own game?","October 6, 2014","false","2.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Pain","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021903573/","49 products in account","Wakfu is a turn-based MMORPG, with a great variety of characters and builds, and a heavy dose of grinding.\nI found the first hour enjoyable, but the tutorial leaves a lot to the imagination, and there is a steep learning curve when entering the actual game.\n\nMy main problem with the game is the combat system. In combat, there is a timer for every action, and when you're a new player, obviously you want to read what all your spells do and what your enemies are weak against, read passive buffs/de-buffs, etc. But the timer is way too short to do any of that, and seeing as you have enough action points to complete multiple attacks/spells in a go, it is a rush to complete your turn.\n\nSecondly, the combat area is split into tiles/squares, each one accounting for 1 movement/range. Now, when casting a spell or attacking an enemy, you have to ensure that you have clear line of sight to the target, and that they are within range - which means, inside of the minimum and maximum range.\n\nWhen you move your character, as there are often so many obstacles on the map, it is really hard to tell whether you will be able to attack the enemy with a spell, from the tile you are moving to. This means, if you are playing a spellcaster (and all characters have spells), you may sometimes waste a whole turn just trying to stand in a position where the enemy is in range.\n\nThere is also no basic 'attack'. You can't just hit someone. Your basic attack is determined by the weapon you are holding, and the weapon will have a predetermined attack range and attack area. For example, in the tutorial you receive an axe, this weapon attacks three squares around your character in a big sweeping motion, and if you have an ally nearby, the ally will take damage from the swing.\n\nBasically, the combat is too complicated to have a timer, the tile system seems quite broken, and the information needed to make the learning curve less steep, is not very accessible. The tutorial itself was of no help when coming to the actual game.","September 27, 2014","false","3.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I used to laugh but then I just deleted it.\n\n\nMaybe I just don't like MMOs anymore but that one really made me to get back to fps games.","October 24, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It is, without doubt, one of the worst things to ever hit the internet. I won't even go in to how ABSURDLY unintuitive it is, or how awful the entire sound scheme is. I'll just focus on this one, glaring, point that makes this game completely not worth it.\n\nThere is a tutorial mission, that will two-shot you. I understand what I am supposed to do. It's teaching you about Line of Sight, and how to avoid damage. Here's the thing though, the punishment is somewhere in the area of 15 damage, when you've got about 60 HP at this point. This is horrendous. You make a few mistakes, and you're dead. And I'll be honest, that isn't even THAT awful, but the line of sight for the attacks isn't SHOW to you! You have to run a gauntlet to an enemy, and you have FOUR chances to mess up. It's trial and error at the most ABSURD level. Your reward for finally getting to the end of the gauntlet? You get to do it again, in an even LESS defined map. It's stupid. It's awful.\n\nIf the tutorial was this horribly put together, then the game as a whole can't possibly be much better.\n\nOh and the kicker, at this point, you're not even allowed to be in a party to get help from somebody. In an MMO, they don't allow you to be in a party.\n\nAn MMO...where you can't party. Can I stress that enough?\n\nSave your time, avoid this awful excuse for a game.","June 11, 2015","false","3.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

HE DOSENT HAVE A ♥♥♥♥ SPARE SADDLE, THERE IS ONE ON THE ♥♥♥♥ING THINGS BACK ALREADY!!!! so i go to every corner of Hell's creation called WAKFU. takes around 5 to 10 minutes to talk to the people at every shop because they all of a sudden have to explain how to use the ♥♥♥♥ing tools you have been using from the start and after being treated like a 7 year with Down-Sindrome you get to go through the the waiting of the smelting, sowing, and crafting of the mount you have wasted 3 hours trying to not ripe your own nipples off in a mixture of boredom and intense menstrual rage. then i get sent back to this sack of Granny ♥♥♥♥ that is so called a mount trainer. at this point i am so angry i am about to go on a school shooting for a school for baby puppy's. This load of ♥♥♥♥ is greeting me with his smug ♥♥♥ smile and says its all yours, you just have to catch it!!! WHAT IN ALL ♥♥♥♥ING HELL IS THIS RAT ♥♥♥♥, FOR ALL THE ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ THIS ♥♥♥♥ COULD HAVE DONE... i get in the cage with the buggy eyed ♥♥♥♥ and try to mount it. after failing 3 times because i skipped everything this smug ♥♥♥♥ had to say i try'ed to read the books for the first time thinking they had good information in them. they all three only had a ♥♥♥♥ joke in them the Devs thought where funny. ha ha Devs ha ha, that was funny ha ha ha. then i try for several additional hours trying different things before getting it by luck with the pro skills of a toddler. the games was quick to take away my glory by saying you only need 300000$ for a licence to ride it. at this point in my life i start to think of a way to get away with murder. after 4 days of straight grinding for cash i finally get it, i cant stop my laughing and slow crying. that smug ♥♥♥♥ starts to talk and i dont even care, my eyes are blood shot and i pass out. after 4 hours of needed sleep i rebooted the game. i get on my mount I am so happy, the mount was 1.35 times player speed, not ever 2 times the speed... i start to have a hate speech in my room loud enough that my neighbours neighbours neighbours could hear it, i get 13 noises complaints and a warning that next time would be a ticket. after that i stopped playing games like this for the fear of suicide or mass murder. the game looks innocent and its anime wasen't half bad but this game... this game IS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ ON A PLUMS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IN HITLERS LEFT TESTICAL. this game gets a 0/10 would never play again!","May 20, 2015","false","65.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","14","1","7","4","0"

I picked this game 'cause it  seemed like it might've been fun. It seemed like it would be different from most mmo's, or at least that was my impression, and I was right. Sorta. To start with, there are a reasonable number of classes to pick from. Although the brief descripions left me a little unsure as to what classes were actually effective in a fight. Although I've seen a bit of plot kicking around, I wasn't entirely sure what it was nor could I be ♥♥♥♥♥ to find out. The battles were kinda fun for the first two or three before the tedium set in. That was mainly because while there were a bunch of skills they only level up when you use them. Which meant that you'd only wind up using a couple that were strong enough to actually do anything. Even then I found that enemies I fought that were something I could techincally beat, especially in matches of 1v3 or more, I'd still have my ♥♥♥ handed to me. So either I'm terrible at tactics in a general sense, which I can't entirely deny, or I'm just finding all of the battles meant to be fought with other people. So to put all that in one sentence, Wakfu could actually be fun later on but I'm not willing to invest the time that seems necessary to get there.","October 6, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Whisk the eggs: Crack both eggs into a mixing bowl. Whisk the eggs until completely combined, and season with salt and pepper. If you\'re adding cheese or other fillings, make sure they are prepped and nearby.\n2. Warm the skillet and melt the butter: Place an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Tilt the skillet as the butter melts to evenly coat the bottom. When the butter stops sizzling, the pan is heated and ready.\n3. Pour the eggs into the skillet: Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Immediately tilt the pan so the eggs coat the entire bottom. The eggs should sizzle on contact; if not, continue cooking, but remember to heat the pan a little longer next time.\n4. Drag and push the eggs to form waves: Use a spatula to gently drag and push the cooked eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan, making space for the uncooked eggs and forming waves in the omelette. Tilt the skillet so that the uncooked eggs flow into the open spaces.\n5. Cook the omelette for 1 to 2 minutes: The omelette will finish cooking in 1 to 2 minutes. When done, the bottom will be set and the edges will look crisp. The top of the omelette should still look fairly wet and uncooked, but there will no longer be any loose, easily flowing liquid egg — the omelette will continue cooking off the heat, so finish when you think the top still seems a bit underdone.\n6. Top with cheese and fillings: If using, sprinkle the cheese and fillings down the center of the omelette.\n7. Fold the omelette: Fold the bottom third of the omelette over the center, and then fold the top third down. Alternatively, fold the omelette in half.\n8. Slide the omelette onto a plate: Gently slide the omelette onto a plate and garnish with parsley.

Feeling the euros pouring out of your pouch yet? Sure the movie has some free blocks but the experience will never be truly had unless you put your dinky in the cd-drive. This game is a game and should be treated as such but a review is not a review unless it is one. So go and make the choice do you want to feel it? Do you want to experience the decree that is peace? No. There is non. Make a choice and decipher the vent do what you want but stay away from my fedora bud.","October 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

It definitely doesn't need to be adjusted content wise. However, this game is over filling with broken English so DO NOT EXPECT the tutorial to help you in any deep sense; you learn this game by guessing and learning from your mistakes. It is NOT an 'intuitive' game and I've met many players higher level then me who didn't know basic stradegies that I learnt early on. Many as in several. As in 7 other players who considered themselves amazing.\n\nSecondly, finding your feet is an awful experience. If you're a stranger to turn-based gameplay GIVE UP NOW. You're tossed into this enormous world filled with options but absolutely no sense of purpose or direction. To begin with, it can be SO immense that quiting IMMEDIATELY was a considered option. "Why should I even bother with all this CRAP?". You learn  your own way and you creative your own incentive, which works excellently later in the game but early game it's a miserable experience. After you find your feet and get the rythm of the game it BEGINS to become amusing enough to be considered a video game. So prepare for a pretty bitter beginning phase.\n\nLastly, the in game content itself... So I've tried not to make the same mistake I've made on other MMOs. I've avoided the "grind my character to max and then quit" attitude and instead have be working on leveling up all my professions with my main level to make the game much more interesting. In fact, there has been some real "shining moment" inside Wakfu that no other game has come close to fulfilling. I mean there was a point where I was mining, skinning, farming and fighting all in my own little area and it was AWESOME FUN... to begin with. Now every bit of storage I have is totally and utterly filled with essential crafting resources all of which have an enormous amount of units (400+ thistle, 500 wood, etc) so dropping IS NOT AN OPTION. I tried to combat this technical issue by crafting bags but the developers seem to have not considered that new players may want to try crafting as well; only assuming that you're clearly a high leveled player with tonnes of bag space because you poked enough fat mobs to have a full set of maxed capacity bags. I needed to gather 6 Royal Feathers from a very easy and low level dungeon. I ran that dungeon over 250 times over 2 days at my maximum speed. After all of that ... 5 feathers. Oh and a quest that will take 10 off of me. So really now I need 16. I am NOT willing to be put through such a f**k around for low level content, get real you idiots. Try PLAYING YOUR GAME instead of theorizing crap that works. "Ohh 16 feathers isn't much in theory"... WRONG. Wrong. Wrong. It's TOO much and has wasted over 16 hours of my life. For the dungeons themselves, they're *okay*. You fight the same mobs you come against in the world and then eventually a boss with much more HP and stats then normal. There is very little feedback to add to such a generic system. It works fine? That's all I can say. But! If you're with a friend and your friend lags out or DC's then expect a 40 second skirmish to last longer then 15 minutes (which is bloody insane to sit through) because the game will CONSTANTLY "wait" for the player for minute intervals even if the dungeon and game itself has acknowledge the player not only leaving but being offline.\n\nOverall, you're basically fighting the game the entire way through JUST to enjoy small parts of it.\n\nLong story short: play something else because you'll quit most likely faster then I did.","October 3, 2014","false","145.0"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

And then I started it...\nFirst let me tell you, I'm not a fan of strategy RPGs, where you have to position your character and such. Maybe this clouds my judgement, maybe not.\n\nI opened the game, and had the choice to do just the tutorial after a few MB downloading (which is a pretty nice feature!). I then proceeded to wait for the game to finish loading. Since it took more than a minute, I just restarted it. And it loaded instantly. Then I had to give my acoount a name. Well, seems like "God" is forbidden in your account name. The game doesn't tell you however. It just tells you "This name is forbidden". Nothing more, nothing less. After a few tries I finally found out, that "God" isn't allowed, so I took something else. The game asks me if I want to play the tutorial. I did, and I regret it. In the tutorial you are asked to gather and plant seeds. Gathering is easy, but the planting... Imagine a field full of flowers and quite a few spots with just grass on them. You can only plant seeds on grass obviously. The game thinks so too... or not. "The area is full", "Ecosystem: bla bla, try killing some monsters" are the messages I get. Well, ok. Let's kill a monster. The game doesn't give you an option to do so though.  Tired of this, I deleted my character, so I could pick the name again. And finally could play it, after ignoring all the bugs (also ignoring the fact, that no sound played, another bug).\nThe classes seem to be fine and fun. I have only tried one class, however. So I guess I can't really tell much about it. The GUI seems pretty nice. Big screen, almost nothing on it. I guess that's pretty good, I missed the minimap though (Dunno if you can activate it somehow). Finding out, how the "Quest Compass" works, I finished a few quests and leveled up. The game yet again tells me something "Don't forget to spend your points!", or something like that. However, this is only something you can do on level 5 and later on, because then you unlock something, where you can actually spend points on leveling up.\nAfter finally reaching level 5, I decided to stop playing. I still don't know how I level skills or how I even get them. The game doesn't tell me either.\n\nMaybe if the game fixes some of the bugs, I will give it another go. But as of now, I can't recommend it due to the bugs and the innovative GUI.","September 19, 2014","false","8.1"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","7","29","0","6"

All the business model cared for was money money money. Players weren't able to get in-game currency and you weren't able to leave the newbie area unless you were a subscriber to the game.\n\nNow everything has changed. F2P players can go to the zones that subscribers were able to go to, and monsters drop in-game currency (in the past, the only way you were able to get money as a subscriber was by minting it.)\n\nThe only downside to this is that the in-game currency minting machines are almost obsolete now unless they revamp that system somehow to make money-minting more profitable than grinding. But in the past items were much more cheaper than they were due to the fact that money HAD to be minted to order to get money. Now everything is a lot more expensive.\n\nOverall if you like games that play like FF Tactics or FF Tactics Advance for fighting, as well as games that have job professions, and a Havest Moon like open world where you are able to plant things that grow (even monsters,) try this game out.","January 1, 2015","true","105.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a complete lack of quests, story, and guidance after that. This is something that the developers have been aware of for months and have yet to address, which is the second biggest problem with this game. Bugs and issues that have existed for months go unaddressed and support requests almost always go unanswered. There is a staff for this game, as events and updates seem to come fairly often, but they definitely don't have their priorities straight.","January 17, 2015","false","42.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For all aspects of PvE and economy it gets 10/10 the graphics are smooth and login is issues are almost non existent. the F2P model they opperate on is very accessable to players who want to pay and players who dont, I felt like my money went places when i spent it but didnt feel i ever needed to spend money. Lots of effort put into cometics that dont affect gameplay but mean that every haven bag and every character will have its own look depending on equipment or the array of costumes they have.","December 31, 2014","true","266.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The other players are nice, the story is interesting, the art is very cute, and the game mechanics (when they work) flow better than a lot of other games. Unfortunately, a lot of the game mechanics and coding based around events are not well though-out, which causes a lot of bugs and complaining. However, if you are looking for a fun, casual game and do not get hung up on the accessibility of the every single event (some work, some don't), this is a great game.","December 2, 2014","true","415.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time everyone is friends\nThere are no incentives to become a bandit other than for the hell of it\nGame suffers from imbalanced resources (using three logs to get one plank, and using 17 planks to make a box)\nexperiencing minor, but consistent lag. Game seems to hickup ever couple minutes, or when pulling up the map/gathering resources\nSometimes creatures are labeled as “Busy” but aren’t doing anything, so you can’t get rid of them.\n\nOverall, a very good game and most issues I have with it can be solved if players start trying to kill eachother in-game.","December 4, 2014","true","125.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
