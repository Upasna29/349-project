However, I have watched gameplay to see where people are coming from.  It's similar, but not the same.  It is a Runner (as the name suggests), but lightly sprinkled with RPG elements.\n\nWelcome to the land of Hadrion.  A land polluted by a great wall dividing 2 social classes (rich and poor) who tend to either be cultists or assassins.   You play a nameless thief simply called a "Shadow" who steals a magical artifact from a group of Cthulu cultists that turns into a gauntlet on your arm rather than killing you, mysteriously.  You escape from the cult and are recruited by a sexy moonelf named Quick Silver to join a group of assassins and mercenaries known as the Fraternity of Shadows.  The story begins here and expands through a series of fetch-quests.\n\nThe game looks great and feels great.  The artwork is wonderful, the narrative is awesome, and the controls are (mostly) solid....and this a free game, to boot.  However, there are moments where the game will feel "pay to continue", except if you grind and buy (with gold) smart, then you can easily continue.  Some moments, however, are forced "buy this" options that will give you no chance to buy what you want until after the story has ended.  You'll often see "FEAT NOT PURCHASED" or "NEED A BETTER SWORD" mid-gameplay.  This WILL get annoying.\n\nAlso, as a tip, do NOT buy any items or lives with your gold.  You'll need that gold to purchase sword upgrades, gauntlet upgrades, and location unlocks often.\n\nSadly, at this point the game's story is incomplete and the controls are buggy at times (especially against mid-bosses called Nephilim).  There are also 2 VERY grindy achievements.  One took me 75 hours to complete (Breadwinner) and the other took 145 hours to complete (Nouveau Riche).\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Beautiful artwork\n+ Achievements\n+ Free\n+ Casual\n+ Sexy Waifus (half of which are elves)\n+ Great narrative\n\nCONS:\n\n- Incomplete story  (Ends after you give a guy called Hunter a box he needs while he searches for the "Azurian Bow" to fix a mess you unintentionally made.  No more main quests or side quests after that moment.)\n- Fetch quests can get monotonous.\n- Forced gold purchase moments  (Game can be completed for free, but will take a TON of grinding)\n- Buggy cutscenes  (I missed half the game's cutscenes because the game would black-screen after I killed a Senior Nephilim)\n- Buggy controls (You come up against a Junior Nephilim with a "Rage Restoration" option available, but jam all the number buttons, it won't trigger.  Enemies will rarely spawn out of the ceiling, too...but they'll be harmless as they're too high.)\n\n\nWould I recommend this game?  Yes.  I would say this game was a pleasant parkour experience and was a great game to have for free.  Instead of having real money purchases in-game, I would say this game would be better priced at $5.  I wished that they would have completed the story.  I felt really involved as the story moved along.\n\n7.5/10","March 11","true","147.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game had some promise but soon it shows its true colors. It is at not a pay-to-win but it is a pay-to-play. It is obvious that the business model intended for this game to thrive by micro transactions by putting pay-walls of every type of progress. Let me be clear, everything is available with in-game currency but the amount of grinding needed reminds me of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes.\n\nFor example : you level up. A new area unlocks. Now you need to trade gold to play it. You grind for it. You get the gold but now you leveled up again. Now the enemies on the new map are immune to your attack because your equipment is too low for them. You grind for it and get a new sword, but now the next area that will unlock which as you for a new “feat” (quick time event). If you don’t buy it quickly you will score less and get less gold to pay for the next requirement in your way. Etc.\n\nSo my assessment after 90 hours.\n\n+ Nice functional graphics\n+ Nice traps and obstacles\n+ Ok music and sound assets\n+ Quick reply for customer service\n\n- Bugs bugs so many bugs that brake the game\n- Main quest broke after asking for an item that never dropped\n- Side quests that finish very quickly\n- Pay walls for everything\n- All the equipment is mandatory sequential\n- Core mechanics like rage recharge work 25% of the times.\n- Inhuman reactions reflexes needed to get a “feat” at perfect that result in less bonus gold\n- At this point the game is not finished\n\nI will not make a conclusion but I hope by reading the above you can make yours.\n","March 24, 2015","false","125.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/recommended/330760/","rsc","RSCNyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/","106 products in account","There's a lot of things wrong with Running Shadow.\n\nFirst, saying it's a mix of a runner and a fantasy RPG is...wrong. There's no RPG mechanics here, it's a runner, through and through. You run through various corridors picking up coins and mana. You can jump, slide, and do some silly looking special moves to dodge obstacles and traps. There are also enemies, but you fight them the same way: Press up or down depending on their stance to kill them.\n\nYou do missions to progress through the story, which involves some cult trying to use a magical gauntlet to resurrect the Old Gods. The story and characters are forgettable, and seems more like an afterthought. Which leaves the gameplay.\n\nIt plays mostly alright: 3 lane runner, controls seem to work fine. You earn in-game coins to upgrade your gear and access missions. It starts extremely easy, but after a while, the game's true form starts to show itself. After around 30 minutes, I could no longer kill enemies because I had to upgrade my weapon. Obstacles and enemies started doing around half my health in damage. The game started shoving DLC offers in my face for survival. Not because it'd make the game more fun or anything, just to PROGRESS.\n\nI'd be happy to upgrade my equipment, but missions often require a coin fee to access, and I often find myself desperately short on cash. Eventually, about an hour in, enemies had the ability to one shot me, and obstacles almost did the same. I upgraded my sword, but I already couldn't kill these enemies either, having to upgrade more.\n\nThere are side missions you can do for coins, but the amount you earn is hilariously low. In addition, the difficulty isn't any easier in these side missions: You still can't kill most enemies, you'll still take huge amounts of damage, and you'll  maybe get 100 coins. Upgrades cost 2000-3000 early on, and new equipment generally starts at 5000. These side mission runs usually take 2 minutes a piece. Considering you survive.\n\nOr, of course, you can buy the DLC. According to the DLC description, the outfits don't benefit your character at all, BUT you receive 10,000 coins. That's more than enough to make sure you have an easy time through most of the game. Don't worry, there's weapon and armor DLC too that does benefit your character.\n\nApparently there are special moves you can do, like draining health from enemies or instantly killing everything for a short period of time. I don't know how to get them to work. You use them specifically in training missions, but outside of that, I never had a chance to use them. Would've been nice, since they seem powerful, but that would prevent you from getting stuck and feeling forced to buy DLC just to progress.\n\nIt's pay to progress garbage. The game becomes either an extremely tedious and frustrating grind, or deceptively expensive if you want to see the awful story to the end. Avoid at all costs.","February 21, 2015","false","1.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pibbjuice/recommended/330760/","Pibbjuice","W is for Walrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pibbjuice/","161 products in account","After putting in around 10 hours of actual gameplay, discounting some AFK time, I think I can share my (many, probably too many) thoughts.\n\nMy first thought is that this brings me back to the chaos emerald stages of Sonic 2 (and to a lesser extent, Sonic 3), Being a huge fan of those old Sonic games, this genre hits a sweet spot for me. The game is a grind. You will be doing the same things over and over again at various levels of difficulty. To call this game bad because because of this is like calling One Finger Death Punch or Space Invaders or bowling bad because of it. It makes no sense if you are actually having fun with the gameplay.\n\nAnyway, about the actual game:\n\nPros\nIt's a casual game designed to be rather addictive. In my opinion it is as such.\nControls feel (minus a few bugs. see Cons) very responsive. It can get pretty fast-paced, but you still feel in control.\nIt looks fine. Different areas are colorful and stuff. Environments are not terribly different, but enough to mix things up a little.\nSatisfying to master. Started off dying quite a bit and using lot of the buff things, but now I always play natty and die a whole lot less, usually to bugs or really unfortunate combos of obstacles.\nCons\nThere are bugs. Sometimes the buttons don't work for killing the QTE enemies. Sometimes the buttons (1,2,3,4) are out of order, which is kinda weird and can throw you off. Rarely I've seen objects spawned way up in the air and unreachable. Others have seen bugs that I haven't seen, so I can't really comment on that.\nSome obstacles are near impossible to see at times, especially when other things wreck your line of sight.\nAs far as I know you can't remap buttons, which would be convenient especially for the QTEs.\nTo start the games, you have to click buttons. It's a minor thing, but it would be way more convenient to have keyboard bindings for that since the VAST majority of gameplay is 1 handed.\nGeneral Thoughts\nPersonally, I like it. I don't think it's for everyone.\n\nObviously it is FTP with micro-transactions, so there's gating and the gold cost of upgrades is higher than seems necessary. However, I don't think it's quite as bad as people tend to make it. At the stage of the game I'm at, a run will net me 400-ish gold, a little less if I suck. Gates and upgrades are 5500 -8000 or so. It could be a lot worse. I play it for the gameplay because I enjoy mindlessly reflexing some dude to flip and slide around with decent visuals whilst listening to trap music (Should be the official soundtrack, but I sadly don't make these decisions).\n\nThe story and rpg elements are really only there to give a sense of purpose, but none of it is that important or engaging. Gear is used as another way to gate, so most of the time you're not even choosing what to upgrade. A lot of quests are along the lines of: "Go get this ring. Neat! Now get this necklace. Neat! Now get this other ring.".\n\nGameplay-wise the main quest missions are not much different from regular ones. So grinding out gold to get past a gate is almost no different from doing the actual story. This makes using micro-transactions to get past a gate seem silly to me since you'd essentially be paying for the exact same gameplay.\n\nIn conclusion, these are only my opinions and I'm just a nobody on the internet. If you can't tell yet, "grindy" and "mindless" are used a lot in this review. Thankfully, I like that in a game when I can get into it. Plus it hits me a bit in the nostalgia.\n\nIt's not Bioshock. It's not Skyrim, or Half-Life, or Out of the Park Baseball 2007. It's not the next Great American Video Game. But it can be very fun and very free for people who have a psychological tendency to enjoy this genre.\n\nI think you should give it a shot if you're remotely interested, it's not exactly a commitment.","February 23, 2015","true","25.1"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","7","14","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitalaether/recommended/330760/","digitalaether","Aether","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digitalaether/","432 products in account","This game is a lot better than I expected. It's a shallow runner game and obviously a mobile port. The graphics are nice and the game is well made. It's obviously not a AAA title, but it's better than most of the greenlight and early access titles covering steam. I saw the reviews coming in, and was expecting to hit a gold wall where the f2p systems became abusive. I haven't found that yet after 4 hours, and that's longer than any of the negative reviews I've seen of the game. If you like runners, it's actually a nice little game to kill some time in. I'm sure most people looking at reviews are going to see if the game is abusively F2P, so let me explain where that notion might come from.\n\nPotential Gold Pressure 1- Map Unlocks:\nNew map locations are unlocked with gold. You get missions at these locations with random requirements (collect mana, find items, kill baddies), and each location has a different look and usually some unique mechanics. Rooftops have multi-leveled running, the dungeon has more pits and floor traps, a temple has pillars that burst through the ground as you get close, etc. The main story will eventually drag you through these places, and at some points the story might move you to a new location before you have the gold on hand. This happens once about 2 hours in, where you need 3000 gold to continue and have about 1500. This is the 'paywall' people are talking about.\n\nWhy it isn't bad:\nThe map locations level up as you play non-story levesls on them. They have difficulty ranks, and end up giving higher and higher payouts. New mechanics from later levels show up in even the first levels at higher difficulty, keeping them interesting. You can get 500 gold payouts on expert level missions, making that 1500 gold seem like nothing. The game isn't making you grind boring, slow, easy levels just to get anywhere fun. The game is a runner, and running an old map at a higher difficulty is still fun for me.\n\n\nPotential Gold Pressure 2- Gear / P2W:\nUpgrading your weapons lets you kill higher level enemies. Without the upgraded damage, your 'attacks' let you run past them, but you won't get the kill. Upgraded weapons also give you more "Rage", which is an energy for power attacks. Upgraded armor gives you damage reduction and health bonuses, letting you survive more and bigger hits. Without it, certain threats will one shot kill you in runs, and some things will leave you at like 3/150 health. Paid masks also give XP bonuses, which aren't available on free masks.\n\nWhy it isn't bad:\nDon't get hit! It's a runner game. You're not supposed to be running into spike walls. The game is incredibly fair, you see obstacles coming, and RNG doesn't force you to lose. Gear is there to make the game more forgiving, and it takes a decent amount of gold. You can buy it instead if you want the forgiving expirience without the grind. You don't have to be able to kill every enemy on a map, and since you can still attack them without getting harmed, all it does is make "Kill Enemeis" levels take a little longer. The real money items are roughly the same power as the best gold-bought items, within about 10%. It's still a convenience kind of purchase, and that's fine. The game is free and there needs to be a reason for someone to put money in. I haven't bought any gear yet, and nothing seems off or abusive to me.\n\n\nOverall, it's good at what it's trying to be, and it didn't feel abusive or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playing it as a free player. It's one of the few F2P games I've seen that's been monetized fairly.","February 22, 2015","true","23.3"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","17","36","2","0"

However, it has a slightly more in depth RPG element to it, with customisable outfits, and upgradable weapons. I recommend this for people who don't have the time to play an in depth RPG.\n\nAfter playing for an extended amount of time (Over two hours straight), I am still enjoying this game. Why? Because I'm playing it for what it is. Do I expect an immersive RPG experience? No, I do not. Do I expect tension filled moments of dashing through narrow corridors, while barely escaping traps at the last moment? Yes.\n\nI will admit, I was pleasantly surprised with what I got. Yes, it was a very Temple Runish game at first. However, the first few minutes of gameplay do NOT in any way compare to the overall experience. There is some sort of strange satisfaction in leaping over a flaming trap, only to meat a hostile spearman waiting to challenge you. And after you've completely brutalised him, you narrowly evade a blade shooting from the wall to slice you in half, kicking a heavily armoured enemy in the chest and bringing your sword down to stab him in the torso.\n\nRunning Shadow is a thrilling, innovative experience, bringing a new style to the genre.","March 2, 2015","true","24.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It obviously is a game that was on mobile phones, being an endless runner and all, but it is a good one. The graphics are pretty decent, the gameplay is solid, the story is interesting, and unlike most endless runners, this is actually broken up into short stages (which honestly make more sense for a mobile game in my opinion) so it makes for good short bursts of play. It does have some pretty expensive microtransactions, but from what I've seen the gameplay is very fair and balanced, so unless you want the cosmetic items or just can't stand waiting for a grind (and as far as I can tell, not a bad one), you can play this just fine without spending anything. If nothing else, at least consider downloading it to your smartphone or tablet to play on that. Only issue I've encountered is that playing with a controller eventually is not doable once it comes to doing the feats, they often require you to press 2 directions at the same time, and you simply can't do it with a controller. Perhaps a fix is needed for this.","March 22, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I would highly recommend this because of its ingame features, trends, music, costumes arent similar to those ph games. Well, it also combines u with more competitive scenes, more turnabouts and more exciting. Whats more, it includes several stages for a typial running game. A bit stress is tht some scenes u need to earn money before doing quest and u need to open up ur bankbook for tht.

Tried for few hours and here's my impression:\n\nPros:\n- it's free\n- can use keyboard to play (I'm really terrible using touchscreen for playing games, so it's a plus for me)\n- equipments can be bought and upgraded for better stats\n- the feats are for cool parkour movements during a run, and give high score when performed correctly\n- combat is simple, either UP or DOWN depending on enemy's pose.\n- the sideway run looks great.\n\nCons:\n- Microtransactions (well, it's F2P game anyway)\n- and can be considered as p2w I think\n- first few level is fine, later either you grind for gold to proceed or buy using real money\n- graphics are so-so\n- got few bugs while playing (mission not completed even though already done, causing the run cannot be completed)\n- no infinite run\n- QTE (seriously, opening a chest also need QTE???). boss fight looks cool though.\n- This game literally has only 1 soundtrack for all levels. Well, probably got new music on higher levels but for now, it''s the same song over and over.\n- Wanna replay the level when you're dead? Leave the mission, go to level selection, find the level again, and click Play. Why not just make a Replay Level button on the You're Dead screen?\n\nExtra note:\n- no leaderboard so far, so no competitive value\n- leveling is really slow, played for few hours, and only reach level 8\n\nIf you're Temple Run fan like me, then you should give this a try.","February 21, 2015","true","17.1"," 46 of 97 people (47%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","47","46","97","6","3"

So the grinding becomes much harder.  Enemies you need to kill to earn a gold reward which means more coin require a better sword which costs coin.  Also you're level locked, meaning they control the amount of grind you do per level.  The levels have not duplicated yet, I believe it's procedurally generated, but this means they already know how much coin to spawn per level.\n\nOverall, everything is starting to point to actually using real money and the moment that happens I won't be playing anymore, I wanted to see the game mechanics and it has a few perks, but I can already see how it's going to be used to stop you earning more coin.  Don't use perks early on if you want to do far less grinding, that's a fact.","February 23, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/330760/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4009 products in account","What is Running Shadow?\n\nRunning Shadow is a free to play game where you control a "shadow", i.e. a ninja or assassin or whatever you want to call it, in a fashion very similar to Bit.Trip.Runner. The game reminds me of that "Temple Run" I saw on mobile platforms but never played, so I can't say how comparable they are.\n\nThe controls are very simple: You steer your protagonist with WASD, he runs automatically. The challenge comes from the protagonist running faster over time and there being absurd obstacles. Honestly, the way the very first level is built, any real city would be abandoned if built that way.\nBut it doesn't matter. You don't care about realism in such a game anyway. You care about the quick satisfaction that you mostly get. Every level nets you experience and gold which you can invest to upgrade your items.\n\nThere we come to the pricing system. The game is free to play, but you can of course buy various things. These are cosmetic outfits, ingame items with real benefits and gold which is used to purchase everything but as said above can also be received by just playing. In my opinion the benefits of the DLC items fit nicely into the play, i.e. they are great for their level but mostly get obsolete. In all cases you will sooner or later have an item that is just as good if you play for free, but it will take a bit longer to get that item. As an example you can get a cloak with 300 health on level 9 if you upgraded your starting cloak thrice, or a similar one as DLC on level 6 without that prerequisite.\n\nAfter only a short time in the game, I find it to become a bit grindy already. There seems to be not much content, but that doesn't matter in the end since you do the same thing over and over again anyway, i.e. you run through levels and avoid obstacles, kill enemies, perform feats.\n\nThe graphics and sound are nicely done, they definitely fit the game.\n\nIs the game worth playing?\nWell, yes, it is! You will at least want to give it a try. It is fun for a short while. It's for free, after all, so (unless you have download costs) play it! :-)\n\n\nEDIT: As I went further into the game, I encountered a game-breaking bug, see here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/330760/discussions/0/617328415066149044/\n\nFor your own sanity, you might want to wait until the dev fixes it. Otherwise see the 2 hours or so before you get there as a demo version. :D","February 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 21 of 47 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","21","47","2","5"

Other than that it seems to be just like every runner, except for the fact that it has quest and missions instead of just going on indefinitely.    My biggest issue is that sometimes you have to grind coins to get gear to complete higher level quests.

It's sort of like temple run, but ALOT shorter.  Temple run is indeed an endless runner, where this is more of a short range runner game.\n\nIt's obvious that Running SHadow is a mobile port.  The graphics are PS2 quality.  But there isn't much to this game.  Use the WASD controls to move left and right, up and down.  UPgrade your gear to take on bigger opponents per board.  If you don't have the proper gear, the game will tell you this, forcing you to just avoid the npc and not earn the bonus points for killing it, kind've stupid but I guess works for an "endless" runner type game.\n\nAnyone that spends real $$$ on these types of games are completely ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

I've always wanted a PC version of Temple Run."\n\n\nBut this game couldn't even acheive THAT. Such a simple task, but it couldn't even achieve a decent Temple Run clone. The game holds your hand so much that you can't even use the menus without a bunch of arrows instructing you.\n\nIf the game had a good interface, it wouldn't need these arrows, and instead would just give you a short description of what some of the buttons do. Seriously, fire the guy who designed the interface.\n\nBut, wait. You think the menu hand-holding is bad? You haven't seen anything, yet. You play approximately 3 levels or so jumping over holes and lazily hitting enemies until the game finally decides that it's time to teach you how to jump over a fence. Yes, after 3 levels of jumping over holes, I need fences explained to me. Thanks a lot, game! I wasn't smart enough to figure this out on my own!\n\nAlso, the micro-transaction system is a blatant pay-to-win moneygrab. You have to play through the same level 5 times before you're ready to unlock the next dungeon, if you don't want to do this repetitive task to play yet another repetitive dungeon, you can buy coins with your money to unlock more equipment so you can proceed into the dungeons.\n\nThe enemies are completely pointless, most of the time you can dodge them, and killing them doesn't reward you, and neither does it feel or look fun.\n\nHowever, the game does at least challenge you a little bit:  The fire effects in this game looks like the wall is glowing instead of shooting a trail of fire, so they're likely going to surprise you the first try. So, there, the only redeeming quality of this game is a flaw.\n\n\nOverall garbage game. 3/10, would not recommend, not even for a joke.","March 15, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Short version of this review: I personally like it. Now for the longer version.\n\nThe game is about a thief who gets his hands on an awesome gauntlet that gives him magic power and then goes on to learn awesome thief things. Or something. Yeah, the story didn't really grab me, but considering the amount of dialogues in the game, it definitely is there. I can't really fairly comment on it, since I skipped through most of in favour of actually playing.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you controlling a running thief. You can move him left and right and you can jump and slide. Every level consists of reaching a certain goal such as breaking x number of barrels or killing a certain amount of enemies. There's not much more to it than that.\n\nAs for the music and graphics, I quite liked them. The character designs are detailed and the levels themselves look quite nice. The music consists of just a couple of tracks, but for me it took a while before they became a bit stale. Nothing mind blowing, not bad either.\n\nNow, I've seen there are quite a couple of people complaining about the fact that this is a port of a mobile game. In my eyes, that would only be a problem if the port was buggy and the controls unintuitive. While I did run across some minor bugs, the game does run smoothly. As for the DLC, yes, it is there, but it is by no means a necessity.\n\nI understand that this game will not be for everyone, but then again that holds true for pretty much anything. If you like simple games that are free to play, I can definitely recommend this. I admit I'm easily entertained, though. If you dislike the running game genre or want deep story and gameplay, I'd say you might want to pass this.","March 16, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nordic89/recommended/330760/","nordic89","Nordic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nordic89/","22 products in account","First of all it seems to be a funny game in which you have to proof your fancy footwork, but later on it becomes more and more boring.\n\nYou need to buy/upgrade items all over of the item. To do so you need coins which you gain by playing the missions - sounds easy. However buying and upgrading your stuff is very expensive - you can buy for real money coins, but it's obvious that this game is more a pay to win than a free to play game.\n\nLet's talk about collections - you can find some items by doing missions and collect them. If you have some items collected and enough to complete a collection you can trade them to gain rewards e.g. live or boosts or coins.\n\nThere are secondary missions which ask you to complete certain collections and if you follow the instructions it's kinda guaranteed that you find the items you need. However if you already found one of the items and trade the collection (because it's completed) before you were asked to do so, you'll find yourself searching hours for hours to reclaim a last item in a mission. You won't get other secondary missions, so you have to pray to find the stupid items you need to complete the collection again.\n\nIf you want to play a new level of this game you have to buy a key ... at the end it all comes down to COINS, COINS, COINS. It's like the developer want to make this game boring if you don't pay and hunt for coins all of the time.\n\nKinda funny for one or two weeks, after this game is just boring.\nIf you look for a "pay to win"-game with the same tasks, same obstacles (just the textures of levels and opponents change) and a boring storyline you'll be satisfied. To my mind the developers haven't spent much time into this game and it appears to be made as cheap as possible while hoping people will buy coins with their real money if they can't continue quick enough.\n\nMy own result: Boring. Bad game. I can't recommend it.","March 26, 2015","false","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While on the subject - you can augment your character with cold hard cash in this game with special gear - that pretty much makes it a P2W Wallet Warrior payment model. Good game, bad way to promote purchases.\n\nADDENDUM: For the record, I would gladly pay for non-character enhancing mods such as storage space, or cool looking gear - I will not, however, aug my toon in order to get perks to make the game easier or faster to level nor support those kind of payment models.

I would recommend you at least try it, however I find that far too early in the game you are forced to either farm (a LOT), or make a purchase of in game currency. I don't mind supporting devs, however when a game deliberately demands I make a purchase, or it is extremely difficult to move forward, I tend to lump it in the same category as pay to win. While on the subject - you can augment your character with cold hard cash in this game with special gear - that pretty much makes it a P2W Wallet Warrior payment model. Good game, bad way to promote purchases.\n\nADDENDUM: For the record, I would gladly pay for non-character enhancing mods such as storage space, or cool looking gear - I will not, however, aug my toon in order to get perks to make the game easier or faster to level nor support those kind of payment models.

And read this review and millions of the other bad ones out there like these. The reason why i said (buy) was because this game isnt technically for free. I learned this the hard way after spending £6.99 just on a sword simply because after some time enemies get stronger and the only way to get around is avoid them, get ♥♥♥♥♥, or simply enter your credic card details to pay real money to get a new sword or gear, since it takes forever to get enough coins to buy even a single mask, How wonderful!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterOfLazyness/recommended/330760/","MasterOfLazyness","MasterOfLazyness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterOfLazyness/","270 products in account","This game is terrible on all accounts.\n\nFirst off, the only voice acting sounds like the guy has a wet sock in his mouth the entire time. Thankfully it's only in that one useless cutscene. Basically, they claim that there will be some important dude to claim the gauntlet and then I come in and steal the gauntlet. YAY! So why is this important? What does it do? NOBODY KNOWS!\n\nSecondly, they continue to force me into mindnumbing tutorials that over explain things. Then when it comes down to something actually worth explaining, they don't even bother to explain it. Or if they do, I never had the chance for it to explain it to me.\n\nThirdly, the gold sinks in this game are harder and faster than the Titanic. Seriously, you have to Pay for everything. Want entry into that new area? Pay 700g. Want that new weapon? You know, the one the game keeps telling you that you need in order to kill those tough new bad guys that SUDDENLY got harder after 1 mission? Pay 5000g. It's an endless cycle of pay and grind. This isn't even talking about Paying with REAL money. Just in-game earned gold!\n\nFor me, I couldn't stand it. Normally I'm fairly open and or okay with grinding out things. That's typically because the combat or story is holding my attention. Here, nothing is holding it but wanting to see the next area layout and art style. The other thing I couldn't stand is the pace; it's either slow as crap or starting to get faster only to hit a full stop END OF MISSION door.\n\nIf this game is all about rushing towards the end then I WANT TO BE ABLE TO RUSH DAMN IT! Let me attack enemies or completely avoid them if I so choose. Instead, you want me to kill all enemies, never get touched, collect all gold and or items and then complete the level. You kidding me? Doing that repeatedly in the same area 5-6 times is boring.\n\nYou want me to collect all the dumb items in it then I gotta replay it multiple times. Then, I found out that I need these dumb resource like items... which mean I have to go back and grind it out until I have enough to "Trade" all of it in for a small pile of gold.\n\nWhat does your visuals matter if your actual gameplay has me looking at very little of it? What does your sounds matter if you have me ignoring it due to it being extremely lackluster? What do you even think I'd spend my money on? Certainly this would never see a dime if you don't even allow me to advance the story without dropping gold everywhere.\n\nI'm not even giving this a number out of 10. It doesn't get that right.","March 6, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I downloaded this, and noticed, hey, for a free game on Steam, this isn't that bad.\n\nWhat I've found from this game is that:\n- You do not need a good PC to run the game.\n- It requires no skill, meaning you can sit back and chill on the game.\n- The more you get into the story, the more abilities, and more objectives to complete.\n- The graphics are pretty good, for a free game.\n\nSo yeah. The game is free, so nobody can expect it to be an experience like a game which costs £40+. However, for a free game, it does have a lot in its favour, the story seems to be pretty long, so whenever I get bored, I can just go chill on this. It's not a game you have to spend time on, leveling things up, it's just something you can come back too, which is a nice thing to do sometimes. It requires no concentration, and it's generally just a fun, and very chilled game.","February 28, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's entirely possible that further releases will add new content, or change the pros and/or remedy the cons addressed below. While I will try to update my review as needed, it's also entirely possible that I won't come back to it. As always, use your best judgment when making purchases.\n\nRunning Shadow is a 3D runner game with bare bones character action trappings.\n\nOn one hand, this is a fun addition to the genre, and the side missions ramp up in difficulty fast if you're itching for a challenge. There are a number of mission types, but they typically boil down to the same goal: avoid obstacles, collect coin, and take out enemies until the exit is reached.\n\nA chunk of the game is devoted to the “RPG” elements, which play out in a manner similar to those found in character action games. Coin received on missions, based on your relative success at the level, goes toward gear upgrades, consumables, and skill acquisition. In addition, feats and kills play out in a manner reminiscent of simplified character action, in which a button or button combination is pressed, and the animation plays out.\n\nThe artwork is delightful, with trinkets, characters, and the world map looking sleek and polished. The graphics, while not terrible, are obviously designed with less powerful machines in mind. Occasionally levels will open up, and switch over into a 2.5D perspective, thus changing up the gameplay somewhat. The level design is minimal in terms of assets, with each area having its own standard set. This is made up for by the fact that levels are randomized, thus remixing the level and obstacles each time that area is played.\n\nThe microtransactions aren't obtrusive or particularly necessary. They're largely cosmetic or convenience features, and can easily be avoided unless you'd like to support the devs.\n\nThe sound design is, as a whole, neither bad or particularly great. The music is no exception; it likely won't grate on your nerves, but it isn't particularly amazing, either.\n\nOn the other hand, the story is stilted at best, and laughable at worst. The handful of two-dimensional characters deliver some very awkward disposition before each mission in the interest of relating the story. In particular, the way the hero is regarded by the other characters smacks of poor fan fiction.\n\nYou're booted out of the mission each time you fail, and focus is pulled to the part of the map where the main mission is located. This is inconvenient and short-sighted, considering the meat of the game appears to be grinding the side missions to upgrade equipment; an action that will require multiple restarts of missions from all but the most skilled of players.\n\nFinally, and perhaps more a nitpick than a real critique, is that it's a shame that the collections acquired throughout the levels serve no other purpose than to confer sporadic consumable rewards. Some of them look interesting enough to be made into gear/cosmetic features for the player, but aren't.\n\nAll told, I recommend this game, with a caveat: you'll likely enjoy this best if you're really into the runner genre. It's certainly fun in that respect, and will offer a fair bit of challenge and game time. That said, if you're not a fan, or were hoping for a more in-depth RPG system, you'll likely find this title lacking.","October 8, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After 6, though, you need all of your shT upgraded, and there is no way to afford that without some serious grinding.\nThis runner isn't simply "play this map over and over." It's randomly generated each time, including the difficulty. If you can't defeat that level, too bad. Learn to beat it; it won't randomize again until it's beaten. The quests get ridiculously hard ridiculously fast. Stay alive until you get a score of 36k?!

It's pretty good quality and seems like a game for tablet, but I don't mind good quality tablet games on steam. It's quite fun and a good test of reflex. Firstly, it is pay to win, but I wouldn't say you need to pay to have fun. In fact, paying would probably make it boring. Paying just lets you take a few hits, but there's nothing stopping you from playing for free and using quick reflexes to beat missions without getting hit.\n\nI enjoy the story, and the items are a cool idea. That said, at level 12 I realized that they completely ARBITRARILY make you buy an expensive, unnecessary item. It had done this previously but previously I had enough money to proceed whereas this time I didn't. These items increase your survivability but are not needed. What this meant is that although I was doing well, I essentially got stopped and had to grind for no reason. I then had to raise 4500 gold in increments of 100-200 per run. I couldn't even do side missions since my storyline and 2 side missions all took place in the same location and the gear check was locking me out of that place.\n\nThe only other issue was sometimes the buttons aren't quite responsive when fighting nephalim. This seems to get worse the further into the game you get. I've died quite a few times hitting the button shown on screen and nothing happens. Unlike other reviews, I never had a single issue with hit detection.\n\nOverall, it's free and quite fun up until the grind at 5 hours. I'm going to keep playing, but if I run into another arbitrary gear check, I'll probably quit. 5 hours of fun for free isn't bad though.\n\nEdit: 9 hours in and I'd say it's downhill from 5 hours. The game gets grindy and way too easy once you've figured everything out.\n\nEdit2: 12 hours in and it's even more downhill. Nothing new since the 5 hour mark. It's clear the developers only put effort into the first part of the game. It's now so easy I'm starting to watch tv while I play. The story is super repetitive: get a disguise kill boss, repeat. Level 16 slams 24,000 gold worth of arbitrary barriers in front of you that you have to grind 100-200 gold at a time. I'm finished.","February 22, 2015","false","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
