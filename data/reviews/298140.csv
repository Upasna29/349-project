The voice acting is good, and the graphics aren't too bad but certainly not top notch either. You may find the fonts used throughout the game (even on the main menu) offputting as they don't blend well with the game or interface in my opinion.\n\nI bought it at a discounted price, but to be honest I am having trouble deciding whether or not it was worth that. The storyline was good but, leaves a lot to be answered as we never do meet the girl who is the 'damsen in distress' throughout the entire game. That being said though, it has an interesting theme and I did enjoy the puzzles for the most part.\n\nAs for the horror factor, there were a couple of parts that made me jump but it's not really a scary game. The music throughout was sub-par, but bear in mind this may have been made on a small budget.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like point and click games Rhiannon: Curse of the Four Branches has some tricky puzzles, and will be worth picking up at a discounted price. If you are looking for horror, this is very mild at best. And if bad fonts bother you, I wouldn't go for it. Still, I'd recommend it as I managed to finish the game and the story is fairly thorough.","May 20, 2014","true","9.7"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tupungato/recommended/298140/","tupungato","tupungato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tupungato/","242 products in account","I just finished this Welsh point-and-click adventure game. You find yourself in a desolate farmhouse in Wales and get to investigate strange ghost-demon related activity there. Let's begin with the fact that it was fun at some times and some of the puzzles were enjoyable. Some moments of the story, too. On the other hand, many of the puzzles were very typical (find a light bulb to enter an unlit room etc.), some of the puzzles were randomly stupid. Many of the parts of the storyline are boring and they feel really random and illogical.\n\nThe game was made in 2008, but it feels like 1997. Graphics is OK at times, but most of the time it feels like a high school project, same goes with animation (but there isn't much of that). Music is almost non existant and when it's there, it feels like MIDI made by a single person over a weekend...\n\nRhiannon was made by a three person development team with Wintermute - freeware amateur software for creating point-and-click games. I got it in a game bundle, but I wouldn't recommend paying more than $1 for this game.\n\nAlso, there are bugs. Sometimes inventory items disappear. Sometimes menu buttons (MAP) disappear. If you save afterwards, you'll never get them back. It is a known and never corrected issue.\n\nTo sum up: if you ever played a point-and-click adventure game, you probably won't enjoy Rhiannon. If you haven't, you may enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend it though.\n\nGRAPHICS: 4/10\nAUDIO: 3/10\nGAMEPLAY: 3/10\nSTORY: 2/10","November 24, 2014","false","12.1"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","23","30","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/recommended/298140/","emblemparade","Emblem Parade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/","3117 products in account","A lovely but flawed hard adventure game. Would be especially attractive to fans of Myst/Riven.\n\nThe story is very engaging, and the puzzles are "realistic" in that they are never obvious. There is no hand-holding: it's very challenging. Not quite Riven-challenging, but you better take care to look closely at every clue. The puzzles are fair, but sometimes the clues are extremely subtle. For fans of hard puzzles, it would be greatly rewarding to solve them through patience and sheer perseverence. If you're looking for a casual point-and-click, however, this is definitely not it. With a walkthrough, though, it could definitely be a more casual experience.\n\nThe UI is annoying: many times you have to click in a very small area, but there is no indication if you get it wrong. Too many times I had the right idea, but thought I was mistaken because I didn't click at exactly the right place. That felt quite unfair.\n\nAnother problem is the rather weird pace. You would think that puzzles would get harder towards the end, but suddenly they become easier. It almost feels rushed. Well, except for the very last puzzle ... those always have to make no sense, right?","November 8, 2014","true","2.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BOBSSON/recommended/298140/","BOBSSON","bobsson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BOBSSON/","1072 products in account","I consider Rhiannon: CotFB to be an innovative and clever take on the point-and-click puzzle adventure genre, despite some flaws.  I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre, but suggest that anyone who doesn't have a great deal of patience give it a pass.\n\nSince almost every positive I have for the game has some kind of negative to it (usually related to the interface), I'll intersperse the two as follows:\n\nThis is a good thing.\nOn the flip side, this is the flaw.\n\nSo here we go:\n\nUnlike most games, your character does not pick up everything they come across, just in case it might happen to be useful later.  You can pick things up and examine them, but until you have a use for it, you'll just put it back where you found it - and not everything you can examine will have a use. It took a little getting used to at first, but it feels far more natural to go "Oh, where did I see that flashlight?  Let me go get it before I go into this dark room" than most games manage.\nOn the flip side, your inventory is still infinitely large, and the only way to scroll through it is clicking on buttons on the edge of the inventory bar.  No scroll wheel, no "show me everything" mode.  When you have large collections of stuff at once, it gets very annoying to find what you want in it.\n\nDespite never meeting or interacting with a single other character, the game manages to not feel "empty".  Your character is house-sitting while the owners are away, and it feels like it.  There's no sense of "there should be people here", like in Gone Home.  Instead, I very much felt like "of course there's no one around, but I'm not isolated."   You can take care of the cat, although you'll never see it.  The mail gets delivered.  Messages get left on the answering machine, and they're not "Where did you go?" messages.\nOn the flip side, the "haunted" effects of the house annoyed me.  Some of them worked well, but most of them were more annoying than spooky, atmospheric, or informative.  And the limitations of the game engine meant that you could tell when something was about to happen, so they were rarely startling, either.\n\nThere is a huge amount of backstory and character development around, and every single last piece of it feels natural.  Clues are buried in the mundane debris of people's lives in such a way that everything makes sense.  Journals.  Email.  Letters.  Newspaper clippings.  Reference books.  Posters.  I never felt like an infodump was squeezed in just to provide some clue or another, or that the information got repetitive, or anything like that.  Almost everything of any length had its own unique format, too.  It wasn't "yet another private diary" over and over again. Even a particular paper you keep finding pieces of could plausibly have been scattered all over the estate as scrap paper.\nOn the flip side, there IS a lot to read and remember.  You can always go back and read things again, and if it's particularly relevant you'll be able to pick it up, but you still have to remember that the information exists.  And the aformationed paper kindof hits you over the head with clues, unlike everything else.  It makes perfect sense why it's there, but it's pretty blatant, especially due to the hint system...\n\nThe "Premium Edition" sold here appears to have added the three things that show up at the bottom of the screen: The map, the interface guide, and the notebook.   Or at least that's what a post in the forums said.   The map doubles as the quick-travel system, and notebook functions as the game's hint system and/or goal list, for better or for worse.\n\nThe biggest benefit to the notebook is that it exists.  Without it, the game would be almost impossible.  Things you need to do will automatically get added to it, and crossed off as they get done.\nHowever, the pacing of it is rather poor.  Sometimes you would have no idea what to do next if "you" hadn't somehow mysteriously divined it and wrote it down in your notebook as a to-do.  Other times, the step is so obvious that it'll be done even before you (the player) think to check the notebook.  Sometimes even with the clue, there's no way to tell what you're looking for or how to accomplish it, and other times it explicitly spells it out for you.  I recommend the UHS hints at  uhs-hints.com [www.uhs-hints.com] as an augment to the notebook, for when it gets the most obtuse.\n\nThe map doubles as the quick-travel system, and it's amazingly useful for getting around the grounds.\nThe map doesn't cover the inside of the house, so you'll be going to the front door and manually climbing up to the second floor or otherwise walking through the house a lot.  It's not a huge number of clicks, but given how useful it is for everywhere else, the lack of in-the-house quick travel is quite frustrating.\n\nAll in all, I am very happy with the time I spent playing this game.  If you have the patience to deal with a lot of reading about fictional character's lives, and to put up with the interface flaws, this is well worth it.","April 15, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one is ranked low on my list (but it's not the lowest). The highlights for me are the ghostly whispering and spooky images that flash across your screen every once in awhile. Although the tutorial and map navigations is a very nice touch to this point and click game, I still found myself lost, multiple times. Also, when I play point and click games like this, I don't really like to jot down where I found items for later use. However, unlike most point and click games, there is a notepad containing what tasks need to be done, which is a rare thing in these types of older games. If you can look past the movement system and the interface then give this a try, if not, I suggest something else.","December 8, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I've played about an hour, and so far, the game seems like it will be a good one.  I can tell already that this game is likely to be pretty creepy, so keep in mind that it might be scary. So far, there has been no vulgar language or objectable content, other than some creepiness. As with most point and click adventures, the graphics are pretty good, and you navigate through the world by navigating through a series of pre-rendered images. For the most part, you can look every which way and interact with many things you come in contact with. Surely, there are lots of logic based puzzles. I arrived at the house where I'm supposed to be house-sitting. I found the hidden key to gain entrance. Found a couple notes, heard a few answering machine messages, discovered that the cat needs to be fed. The cat left a dead mouse near its food bowl, so I fed it. What to do with the dead mouse...?

If the item I want is right in front of me, just let me grab it. There were some okay puzzles, but a lot of them were random as heck and nonintuitive or just plain made no sense at all. The story left a lot to be desired as well, and what little you get simply comes from far too much reading, so by the time you get to story text that would be interesting, you are just so tired of filler text that you don't care enough to read it. Navigating in this game was also a major pain and some areas were awkard and could not be reached unless you moved in a certain way that made no sense. The ending was a let down that had me going "huh, is that it?" The girl magically comes back off-screen after putting a cloud of smoke in the ground... yeah okay where was she, what happened to her really? We hear nothing about where she was all this time? Well.... let's just cover that all up with a "twist" that says the unnamed woman who died just so happened to be the mother of the dude helping you with the translations... not that that adds a single thing to the story, and I kinda expected it with the way he was so into the lore, etc., that he'd chat up a seemingly-"losing it" young girl.\n\nP.S. I swear to god you are some kind of diary voyeur because you snoop so so many of them in this game, and despite most of the entries being filled with garbage or blank pages that you still have to flip through (which may be more realistic but tedious), you always go back for more the next time you see one.","June 16, 2015","false","11.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The atmosphere is great, it's fun to explore the grounds, there are three or four Jump Scares and at some point you immersed yourself really deep in the story. Thanks to the map you can travel to another location within seconds without having to click through like a maniac. The graphics look pretty dated and music is virtually non-existent, but the sound effects are great. The voice overs sound great, too (lovely accents!) The built-in help (Notebook) was really helpful sometimes, other times it had even the most obvious tasks in it and sometimes nothing at all (ie I had no task and had no clue where to go). Accordingly I had to use a walkthrough; people with a lot of patience will manage without though. The puzzles themselves are very fair and logical. However, I felt that it constantly got easier instead of harder. The controls are not 100 % smooth either (I missed a few screens/items and it's easy to lose orientation) but it's not really annoying or preventing progress or anything.

Well I must confess to using a walkthrough a fair bit, they are tricky but mostly well thought out - you might want to take notes along the way!\nIt did actually seem a bit of a drag at first as you can only pick up objects as and when they are required so I found myself backtracking alot. This was until I read that the map serves as a quick travel system so once I twigged that the game became far more enjoyable.\n\nAll in all a good little yarn for fans of supernatural point and clicks, It'd be nice to see more from this studio.\n","January 3","true","45.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
