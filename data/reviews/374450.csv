"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/374450/","seph_au","seph.au","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/","6757 products in account","Disclaimer: Steam code provided by publisher\nIntroduced to 3 lead characters the task is to help other students pass exams by cheating (surprise!). Game does include a background story that is well presented in a comic book style between chapters which involved the janitor and his past history with the school but I won't elaborate and spoil the plot.  Store page mentions 'episodes' which refers to each chapter, all 5 are included.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgFTPDsVUFo\nCharacters have their own personality traits and special abilities which increase your chances of success while classes (missions) had different teachers who carry their own unique skills that did the opposite. Levels start on the easier side and gradually introduced new obstacles, coming in the form of awkward chair placements, classmates who spot trouble and inform the teacher and general improvements to enemy skills.\n\nGame really opened up after the first chapter. Given access to the Cheaters Clubhouse where you can upgrade skills, craft a wide range of new gear including 1 use items and take on side missions along with repeating completed ones. Item choice does end up being critical since characters have limited slots, thankfully they can be swapped in level. Characters also had stats that raise passively through skill usage which added some extra rpg elements.\n\nGamepad was not supported given the multi-tasking nature but mouse controls were intuitive helped by the clean UI. Only a few minor issues with character selection in later levels but probably more a pebkac error. Graphics are simple but effective, biggest flaws would be the lack of steam achievement integration and extremely repetitive soundtrack, which was good for about 5minutes before I had to disable it.\n\nOverall I've enjoyed my time with the game. For the fair price point and surprising amount of depth it's recommended and worth taking a look at. More so if you like time management and lighthearted strategy games. Cheers folks. :)","June 26, 2015","true","2.4"," 80 of 126 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","80","126","5","0"

Throwing a dart (named spitball, figures...) to a teacher will sometimes just won't work (I'm not talking 'bout the principal special skill here).\nTime-critical clicks won't be handled in right away, thus the IA wins over the mouse lag.\nExtremely short playthrough ( well, it's not that expensive, but the price/hour ratio makes me grind my teeth a bit).\nNotification boxes don't come with a "never show this message again" feature, which can drive short-tempered players cray-cray.\nNot much content... Almost none actually.\nMy opinion : this is a Facebook game, but this time you have to buy it.","June 29, 2015","false","11.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"
