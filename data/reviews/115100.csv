More on that in a bit.\n\nCostume Quest is a streamlined RPG. It's a fun game, but not particularly difficult. The combat is a simplistic timing game, and the quests have a way of fulfilling themselves as you wander around the map. But that's OK, because Costume Quest doesn't present itself as a serious RPG.\n\nI's a breezy, light RPG with a sense of humor, that begs to be played straight through in a sitting. Truely, it's an RPG/Platformer hybrid, in that there are environmental puzzles that must be worked out to advance the map and the story. It's a mix that works.\n\n...until you come to the Autumn Haven shopping mall. There's a game-breaking bug in the camping equipment store: If you walk between the sleeping bag and the tent, your companion will follow you into that wedge, and block you in. None of your special skills will get you out of this position.\n\nIf this happens to you, don't exit to the menu! Crash the game manually, so it doesn't have a chance to autosave your position. If it saves your position, you'll be stuck there when you start again, and you'll have to start over from the beginning of the game. Seriously. Check the Steam forums, I'm not the only one with this problem.\n\nSo, yes. I like Costume Quest, and I think you will, too. I want to complete this game, but I don't want to replay the first two hours again. I give Costume Quest a thumbs up, but be careful in the mall so you don't lose your game like I did.","November 26, 2013","true","5.7"," 100 of 106 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","100","106","0","5"

The game takes you on a journey of the imagination as some children’s quest for candy on one Halloween night quickly turns into something much more.  Ultimately, this game is just very well done and has a “soul” that should easily appeal to a vast audience.\n\nThe level design is charming and exploring the maps is fun.  The whole concept of “trick-or-treating” being a fundamental part of the gameplay is brilliantly done.  The story is basically one giant trope, but the way it is told is delightful.  The characters are likeable and the humor is clean but entertaining.  Even the style in which you warp into old-school, turn-based battles is executed well and synergizes perfectly with the atmosphere of the game.  This game is a quintessential example of how several good things can work together to create something great.\n\nAs I alluded to, one of the most charming aspects of Costume Quest is the way “trick-or-treating” in the game world is a central part of progressing the game.  You knock on doors and are either given candy (treat) or have to fight a battle (trick).  This leads to another splendidly charming feature of the game, which I also alluded to earlier: the battle warp-ins.  Depending on what costumes your characters are wearing, they change from little kids into various gallant warriors with nothing but the power of their imagination.  From there, the battles play out in the old-school, turn-based RPG style that was prevalent in the 90s.\n\nAside from that, you may also want to explore the levels, find secret areas, meet characters, and do side-quests and mini-games to gather more candy and collect the trading cards.  There is plenty to do!\n\nCostume Quest is a charming little game that makes for quite an enjoyable experience.  As I said, I feel it can appeal to a wide audience.  I would posit: if it sounds like the type of game you may enjoy, it will probably be a specific game you do enjoy… if you decide to get it.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","June 1, 2015","true","7.2"," 64 of 69 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","64","69","0","0"

When the fight starts you‘re being transformed into your costumes (robot, ninja, knight etc.) and the fight begins. Fight system is generic turn based rpg system but it doesn‘t need to be different.

While the game is very fun to play, it is kind of short. You can breeze through the main game in about 4 hours. The add-on story is about 2 hours. I'd suggest waiting for at least a small price drop or sale.\n\nIs this game for anyone?\nYes. The game doesn't require any specific gaming skills and can be enjoyed by anyone.\n\nLinear, open-world or something else?\nWhile the world of Costume Quest is technically open-world (that is, you are not restricted to a "rail", moving from A to B), the world itself is so small, it still forces the player to simply move on when the player finishes up quests in the area.\n\nGameplay mechanics, gimmicks?\nIt's basically Halloween meets Final Fantasy meets Persona meets Super Mario RPG meets Tim Schafer. It sounds weird on paper but it works. When in battle, your Halloween costume changes into the real thing (i.e. a cardboard robot costume changes into a real giant mecha). Additionally, each costume grants the person wearing it special attacks. Battles are turn-based, which are usually pretty slow-paced, but thanks to pretty good animation design, attack animations are fast, fluid, and don't leave the player bored while waiting for the enemy attacks to end.\n\nGraphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?\nEven though the world in Costume Quest is pretty small, it is crafted with much attention to detail. The cartoony look only adds charm to the whole aesthetic.\n\nAudio design and soundtrack?\nAudio design is impressive. The soundtrack consists of generic Halloween-ish songs but with a few twists. Sometimes the music will actually take a sinister turn, bringing forth really creepy humming, drones, etc. A nice touch that hits the player off-guard.\n\nPlot, story?\nBrother and sister go trick-or-treating. One of them gets kidnapped. Sounds generic? It isn't - that's all I can say without spoilers.\n\nHow does the game run?\nRuns perfectly fine on my 5 year old PC (Dual-Core 2.66GHz, GeForce 9600GT, 2GB RAM). No stuttering, no framerate issues, everything turned on except for SSAO (which is known to be a resource hog on older machines).\n\nAny details, character, motif, etc. you particularly liked?\nThe costumes in battle form and their special attacks. No other game will let you have a yeti, a giant black cat and the Statue of Liberty as your party.\n\nAnything you didn't like?\nYes, a few things. The music in the add-on story is of lower quality for some reason. The Battle Stamp system could be a bit more complex. Finally, the static camera can be annoying at times (especially in the early part of the game where you're navigating through suburbs).\n\nFinal score?\nI give Costume Quest a coffin with candy in it out of 5.\n","February 20, 2014","true","7.4"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

There is definitely a sense of atmosphere that is set with the colors, lighting and art style. You'll wander through a neighborhood, a mall and a carnival. Everything is beautiful and charming with a slight spooky edge to some places, but its a charming spooky not a horrific kind. After you select a gender, you are quickly thrown into the story. Your sibling has been kidnapped by goblins that need candy and since the sibling is wearing a giant candy corn costume you understand how mistakes can be made.\n\nSpeaking of candy, you'll find it everywhere, because its the currency of the game. In the map there is an attack button to knock candy out of objects. You'll find candy after battles, in treasure coffins, completing quests and you'll trick-or-treat for it going door to door. Of course there's not always a stranger giving candy, sometimes it a goblin that results in a battle.\n\nIn battles, you're not just kids in costumes, you become giants. Your little cardboard robot costume turns into a towering robot, a french-fry costume becomes a mega fry crab, a statue of liberty costume becomes the statue of liberty! So its a little pretend, and thankfully the game lets you skip transformation animations to start each battle.\n\nThe combat is really simple and very well animated. First your entire team completes a turn, from the leader of the party to the last member. Then the enemies will each take a turn. You have a limited selection of what to do, attack or a special power every 3 turns. Different costumes have different basic attacks, each with its own way of getting a critical hit. Timing, to press a button or key at a specific moment, others have you wiggling the analog stick, others have you button mashing the same button or key. It keeps you watching the battles and make the long animations feel like less tedious to watch. The special skills range from damaging all enemies, healing all allies, majorly damaging one enemy, hiding an ally and other things depending which costume you're wearing.\n\nWhen the enemies attack, you'll be given a chance to lessen the attack with a quick button press. These button presses are different each time, which is nice, but I feel like even timed correctly, there's still a chance the block won't be successful. Some enemies really telegraph their attacks, such as jumping into the air with a strike. Enemies don't just attack, they'll cast heal, shield, strength and fire. Everything you've seen in RPGs before, but this is just simple.\n\nThe enemies don't have too much variety, goblins, big goblins and ravens, but each 'race' can have a 'class.' The graphics look great and they are in full 3D, its just there aren't that many of them. Each enemy has a level, which is good, but early on in the game enemies feel far too overpowered when you have a party of 2 characters. You'll never have a party more than 3, but neither will the enemy party.\n\nWhen you are on the map, you can see enemies march around, so there really aren't any random battles other than the trick-or-treat battles. You can even sneak up behind map enemies and attack them so when the battle begins, all enemies take a small amount of damage. Its a nice feature in what can be tedious, thoughtless battles. Every battle seems to play out the same no matter what enemy classes you face. You just need to time everything correctly and sit through your special ability animations.\n\nYou can also buy stamps that you can equip to each of your characters that will give them added benefits such as dodging, more HP, regenerating HP, counter attacks, higher attack damage, higher critical damage, a stun skill, the ability to poison a foe or damage all foes next to the target. These simple stamps do a lot to really personalize the game and I feel like you need the stamps to succeed in the game.\n\nWhen party members fall in battle, they're back after the battle. Everyone gets full health after every battle. In fact, when your party gets wiped out. You just respawn back on the map next to the enemy that killed you. There is no consequence for failure in the game and I feel the game is smoother because of it.\n\nEvery battle gives you experience points, but so does completing quests. Since the enemies are limited, so is the experience. So that's why I had to turn to stamps in order to win battles and even then a lot of battles seemed like only luck got me through the first two hours of battles. There is also a level cap on your party and you don't level up individual characters, but rather the entire party.\n\nOn the map you'll talk with NPCs and read their little text boxes. The town, mall, carnival and village feel alive. There are plenty of NPCs to give you quests, such as find this or do that. Other costumed kids want non usable items that you'll find from winning battles and some quests have you finding kids that are playing hide and seek. There is even a well done apple bobbing minigame where red apples count as one point to your score and green apples count as 3 points. Its a nice deviation from goblin slaying monotony.\n\nEvery costume doesn't just have its own special and basic attack, most of them have a practical use on maps. As a robot, you can speed around on your rocket skates to jump off ramps. These rocket skates are the game's run and its so much faster than just walking. The ninja costume can vanish, the fries costume baits people into following you, the knight has a shield to protect you from things overhead and other costumes help too. There is a big variety of costumes and you can find pieces to make new costumes. It adds to the game variety, even if I ended up using the robot for the skates and the statue of liberty for her healing power.\n\nIn all this is a 5 or 6 hour game that is easy to play and easy to finish after the first two hours. There is even DLC that keeps the game going in a different setting. If it wasn't for the cute charm and the extras like costumes and stamps, I'm not sure I could recommend it because of how dull and mindless the fights became.","September 25, 2014","true","8.4"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

Costume Quest puts you in the role of a young boy who's trying to save his little sister from monsters that invaded their neighborhood on Halloween. You find friends along the way and unlock and craft new costumes. Each costume grants you with a different ability and diferent abilities to use in combat. The combat in Costume Quest it's turn based, very similar to the way Final Fantasy games handle. There's also some perks which you can buy with candy that grant you certain passive abilities such as extra damage or health points recovery after each turn. You'll probably spend alot of your time going around the place smashing stuff and the more fun, knocking on people's doors (Trick or Treat) and sometimes you'll get candies from the people that live on those houses and sometimes a monster will open the door for you and you'll jump into combat, that's pretty much how you collect candy which is used as a currency in Costume Quest. Visually, I think the game looks pretty neat, a rather unique cartoony looking which I really like, I also found the monster design to be rather funny. Other than that, the game has no voice acting, it's all text based and the story is certainly entertaining. In the end, Costume Quest was made by Double Fine and that alone puts it up on a great position, per say. You'll definitely get both your time and money worth on this. Just one last thing, the Steam version of Costume Quest also includes the DLC Grubbins on Ice which takes place, and continues, the plot of the base game.","December 18, 2013","true","9.4"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","1"

Worrell I bring you these words of advice.. "Pretty soon the kids won't have to worry about eating their Brussel sprouts because the Brussel sprouts will be eating them."\n\nExchange the word Brussel sprouts with candy corn and you'll understand the game of Costume quest, a cute Halloween themed adventure game from the wonderful team at Double Fine entertainment.  The same group responsible for such classics as Psychonauts and Brutal Legend (Jack Black playing a rock and roll roadie.... YES PLEASE)  In this game you play as Reynold and Wren a pair of twins who have recently moved to a new neighborhood, it's Halloween night and they are planning on going trick or treating.   After selecting which sibling you want to control, either Wren, the 10 minute older sister or Reynold the 10 pound heavier member of the dynamite duo, you are shipped off into the world.  The selected sibling gets a Robot custom, the other gets dressed as a piece of Candy Corn..  Social norms be damned if you pick the female character..  who says females aren't into Robots :-D  certainly not me.\n\n(It was here where the first bit of disbelief struck me, the parents allowed their twin children to leave the house unaccompanied to go trick or treating in a new neighborhood.  These are two children who appear to be 8 - 9 years old, wandering the streets of a new neighborhood on Halloween night which is a night when child predators are normally tremendously on the prowl looking for victims.  Furthermore, after the sibling you didn't pick gets literally kidnapped, instead of running home, or screaming for help  or literally anything we've been teaching children to do for the last 30 years, they decide to go on a crazy adventure to find the sister to avoid punishment.  Just a quick note, a police officer is literally a twenty or thirty feet away away from the abduction site...)  soap box off\n\nAfter trick or treating at the first house, the pair try a second, only this time the candy corn gets abducted by a candy stealing grubbin monster...  OH MY!!!..   So off we go on an adventure to rescue our sister/brother from the clutches of a nasty candy stealing evil corporation, I'm talking a really dirty nasty organization we haven't seen in video games since Umbrella corporation..   Along the way to rescue your sibling you meet new friends, discover a sinister plot to steal candy, and defeat some monsters making for an amazing Halloween adventure which can be enjoyed at any time of year.\n\nThe Story\nI pretty much described the story above, siblings, candy, stealing, adventure.  The story takes place in three locations, Auburn Pines, which is the starting neighborhood, Autumn Haven Mall (easy enough it's a Mall), and Fall Valley carnival, each area offers up the chance to explore, trick or treat, bob for candy apples, defeat monsters and oh yeah... get that sweet, sweet candy baby.. nuff said!!!\n\nThe Gameplay\nThe first aspect the gamer is introduced to is trick or treating, which is just as it sounds, you go up to a house, knock on the door and wait for a trick (battle) or a trick (candy)  It's as simplistic as that.  Knocking on doors isn't the only way to collect candy, numerous interactive objects in the environment such as mailboxes, trashcans, shrubs, etc etc etc, can be pounded on by your candy pail in an attempt to wriggle loose a few extra pieces of candy, also numerous areas have candy thrown about on the ground...  I personally wouldn't pick up candy off the ground and eat it, but hey whatever floats my characters boat.  The game features three types of collectibles, the first is Costumes, you start with the Robot costume, and soon after acquire a knight outfit, others you can collect are the statue of liberty, a unicorn, french fries and many more.  Many of the costumes have two special benefits, the first being an extra ability you can use while out of combat, like the Robot which can travel faster, or the Knight, that can shield from falling items.  The second ability is a special battle ability, whether it's rockets, a shield of protection or a powerful group heal.\n\nThe second type of collectible in the game are battle cards, these cards can be used to further enhance your character, give them additional HP, defense, a stun, etc etc etc, you can buy the cards from Sadie using the candy you collect during your adventure.  With each new area, additional cards are added for you to buy, the new cards offer upgrades over the older cards.  These are very useful in helping to gain the advantage in your battles to come.  The final collectibles are called treat cards, these resemble trading cards, they really serve no purpose, outside of being necessary to complete a few quest and unlocking a costume for collecting all of them.   You gain treat cards by defeating enemies and completing quest.\n\nThe Combat\nThe combat in Costume Quest is rather unique, upon starting the battle your given one option to select basic attack (unless you have a battle card which gives you a secondary option like a stun)  after selecting that option you're taken into a quick time event.  If you succeed in the quicktime event your character does extra damage, if you fail, your character does quite a bit less damage.  During the enemy phase of combat, when an enemy attacks one of your characters, you're given another quick time event, if you are successful you defend some of the damage and minimize the damage you receive, if you fail the quick time event the enemy a significant amount of extra damage.\n\nSpecial ability's   -  those special abilities each costume has I mentioned above are useful here, after three combat turns each of your character unlocks their costumes special ability, this can be anything from from protection, heals, massive damage to a single or all enemies.  It's a good idea to mix and match your party to ensure you have all your bases covered in terms of combat, defense and healing.  A good defense is a good offense makes sense in this case.  It's especially important to include some type of healing for your party, as no healing exist outside of special ability or battle cards.\n\nThe combat sounds simplistic and it is, but the quick time events keep the gamer engaged and on their seat with each successive battle, letting your guard down can and probably will result in you suffering a defeat.\n\nPro's Good story,\ninteresting characters\nunique combat system\nvery fun to play\neasy to 100% if you're into achievements\ncontroller support\n\nCon's Can be a bit too easy with the right combination of costumes/battle cards\nSlightly repetitive enemies\noccasionally controls can glitch out\n\n\nRecommendation\nI'd highly recommend this game, on paper it looks rather simplistic, it seems to have many strikes against it from a gamer's perspective prior to even installing it, but trust me on this one, once you start playing and get into the story you'll be thoroughly entertained as I was.  A fun game to play and enjoy, once you start to play you'll want to keep playing until you finish the the story.  It can be a bit difficult to get into, especially when you realize you'll be playing with children as characters, but that's part of the charm, a person of any age can kick back and enjoy the thrills and exciting of going trick or treating once again..  (without having your neighbors call you a cheapskate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for trying to collect candy from them)  I'd really suggest taking the plunge, buying the game, collecting the candy and saving Halloween for children and adults all across the world..","April 6","true","15.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","23","25","4","6"

You play the role of a child who is obsessed with halloween, and spends the night going around the neighborhood trick or treating to get his candy. At the beginning of the game, your twin sister is kidnapped and you embark on your journey to rescue her. Along the way you make friends with other trick or treaters who join your party.\n\nWhile you are walking around the world, you are able to pick up extra candy, talk to the residents of the town and start battles with the bad guys. The combat system in Costume Quest is turn based, each of your characters will have their own costume which all have different powers. The combat is also primarily quick time events, which is normally not something I am a fan of, but it works quite well here.\n\nThe graphics are nothing special, but they do look pleasing and the cartoon style is something which fits the story and setting nicely. Sadly the audio in Costume Quest lets it down, there isn't any voice acting, and very little sound effects when you are walking around the world.\n\nThe game is set across four different levels, each of them has their own theme and style, with lots of different items and hidden locations to find in each of the levels, they feel plumped out and interesting to explore. I didn't find there to be any difficulty, you can complete the game without being beaten once, so maybe a New Game+ mode would of fixed that. I'm not sure why Steam has counted me having sixteen hours, as the game took me about five hours to complete along with the majority of all the side missions and achievements.\n\nI only really ran into one technical issue, and that was frame rate, the Steam in game counter shows it running at 30 fps while walking around the world, while in the combat phases, this jumps up to 60 fps. I noticed some screen tearing with v-sync off, but this also may be an issue with my rig (I don't think it is considering the specs I run), but it was nothing major.\n\nI can recommend Costume Quest, because I had a really good time playing, and it has a different take on the party based games, and for the full price of £6,99, you can't go wrong with the amount of content that is included.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

You play as one of two suburbanite siblings (brother or sister) on a quest to save the other from monsters on Halloween, but the only way to do that is by trick or treating, getting candy, and crafting more costumes, naturally. From start to finish, this game does a great job in recreating the wonder and excitement of Halloween that we all remember from when we were little. You're not in costume as a robot, you ARE a robot. Each costume transforms the character into what the costume represents when you enter combat, a brilliant idea that makes you feel like your imagination is making it happen, as it did as kids. Each costume gives you different stats, 1 special move in combat, and some also have special abilites on the world map that you need to use to progress in a puzzle like way, though I am disappointed that the different costumes look the same regardless of which party member is wearing them.\n\nThis game oozes personality with its fantastic writing and entertaining characters. It creates a fun world that is both whimsical and believable and for that, Double Fine deserves a lot of credit. The game consists or 3 zones (for the normal game and 1 additional zone for the expansion Grubbins on Ice) that are each varied, noticeably distinct and very well realized. You start in the most familiar of places and gradually move to the more fantastic. The further you progress gives a feeling of going deeper down the rabbit hole. It's an adventure that, once finished, leaves you glad you made the journey.\n\nThis game is not perfect though. As with most turn based RPGs, the combat can get repetitive, and the system is rather shallow. There are only 3 choices in combat, basic attack, special move, and stamp attack. The special move is only available every 3rd turn and the stamp attack only exists if you have an ability stamp equipped so most of the time you will be using basic attack and each costume only has one animation for each battle option. Though combat incorporating timed button presses to strike harder or deflect some of an attack aids in keeping the player focused. Those same presses lead to another complaint: the default keyboard mapping is a bit strange and even movement felt a bit clunky on the keyboard; once I switched to an XBox 360 controller, the controls felt great and much more natural.\n\nAnother minor complaint is that sometimes the text goes by too fast (automatically) and you may miss a line here or there, which can be disappointing as the writing is a big part of what makes the game so enjoyable, but that's just a nitpick.\n\nAlso I wish the game were a bit longer, I managed to 100% complete the game in around 7 and a half hours. I wouldn't say the length is a con, more that I enjoyed playing and hated for it to end.\n\nOverall: A great game with a great story, writing and atmosphere. It manages to accomplish exactly what it sets out to do. Could some things have been a bit better? Sure, but that can be said about most games out there. I'd give it 8.5/10","November 8, 2014","true","7.5"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

Although Double Fine has somewhat fallen from grace of late, this game remains a shining example of the sort of excellent games they are capable of producing. Definitely a game that shouldn't be missed or passed over by anybody. Make sure you play this on Halloween, and at least turn it on Christmas Day for a few minutes (you will know why if you do it).\n\nA classic, one of the best games out there, and an easy 10/10.","March 5, 2015","true","49.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

You pick between a girl and a boy character at the start of the game, you knock on houses in the neighborhood to collect candy which you use in the game as currency. It's a shorter game so it's starts off quickly with a bang but the gameplay never gets or feels competitve. Combat is turned based. When you approach an enemy, you go into battle realm mode where your costume morphs you into a hero based on what costume you are wearing. Outside of combat, you will be tasked with some simple (but relevant) side quests which reward you with new parts for new costumes, more candy for upgrades, booster cards (battle power-ups), and other items you may or may not need to progress the game. There's also a few mini-games for you to enjoy as well.\n\nThe audio is nothing to brag about and the soundtrack is kinda repetitive but it does set a dark tone for the game. Kind of Tim Burton-esque. There is no voice acting really but there are some decent sound sound effects which change up the mood before going back to the same old tune. Costume Quest's storyline is told by animations and text even though it's a newer rpg game. Then we have the cute art style which makes up for the lack of audio. The cel-shaded goodness has always been appealing to me, I've always been a fan of the 3D cartoon look that only cel-shading graphics can achieve. It's cute and fun and offers an early 2000's colorful look to it.\n\nThe gameplay that Costume Quest has going on is addicting, making new friends, playing hide and seek, etc.. it all feels freakishly familiar. It really reminds me of how it felt to go trick or treating as a kid -running around the neighbrhood, meeting other kids and talking to them about their costume and other life topics is believably eerie and well-written. One of the most important things to mention about Costume Quest is that each costume reacts differently in and outside of battle and that's a clever thing that Double Fine did here. Not only does each costume have a different fighting style in battle but outside that, each costume also has a unique ability to help you open up secret paths or achieve certain things. This makes for a great feeling when earning/unlocking new costumes (as it only adds to exploration and new ideas in the game).\n\nPros  Charming art style\nSimple controls\nStylish Halloween theme\nFunny humor\nCons  Repetitive Soundtrack\nNot much to interact with comapared to other rpg's out there\nSuper short storyline\nVery little replay value\nFinal Thoughts:\nOverall, this is a great one-of-a-kind rpg experience for both hardcore and casual rpg players alike. Short, simple and sweet but executed well enough for you to want more. It's charm will keep reeling you in and it will most likely bring out your inner child.... and YOUR SWEET TOOTH! Check out this Earthbound inspired game when you get a chance and don't forget to have a fairly large bag of candy to munch on!\n\nRating (7.9 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","April 10","true","6.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","6"

It is a relaxing change of pace in the gaming world littered with FPS's. Don't let that fool you though ! This is a game which will involve you for the short 6-7 hours it lasts and the boss battles though easier than average will require rudimentary strategy. In all an enjoyable game with leaves you smiling ! I mean, with Glowing Unicorns, Ghost Pirates and even Ninjithsu Scarecrows, there is little chance of going wrong :)\n\nWhat's to Like ?\n\n1. Good story, involving for both young and old.\n2. Great variety of content for a short game, lots of items and quests.\n3. Relaxing style of open world gameplay, with exciting battles.\n4. Achievement Hunters will get 100 % easily.\n5. Addon "Grubbins on Ice" DLC included by default ( Around 1/3 the length of the original game)\n6. Great cartoonish graphics remniscent of old games such as XIII.\n7. EXCELLENT PORT RUNS SUPERBLY WITHOUT GLITCHES.\n\nWhat's not that exciting ?\n\n1. A little more length of the game would have been nice.\n2. While the number of quests are nice , it would have been nice to have achievments for some more of them too.\n3. Although I think that a lack of map is no way detrimental for this particular game, some gamers might think otherwise.\n\nWhat's to hate ?\n\nNothing :) No major flaws.\n\n\nCostume Quest will bring out old memories in you, even if you live in a region where Halloween is not that big of a festival/event. All those childhood fantasies of wearing a make-do costume and pretending to be a bigger robot/ninja/whatever-you-liked is what forms the premise of this game. Evil monsters are here with a sinister plan to rob the world of all its candy!! Your sister, who dressed up as a candy for halloween is abducted by them too. Hence starts your quest to rescue her. You get many costumes along the way, which turn into their big sized fantasy counterparts when you are in battle mode. Some of the fun ones include a burning fire attack Scarecrow, a Pirate that can summon ghost ships and even a glowing Unicorn to heal! You also meet friends along the way to help you in the quests, eventually increasing to a party of 3.\n\nThough this game is short, but it does not feel so as it has adequate amount of quests and in game story to keep you attracted for a lazy weekend of playing. There is the main story to follow, the addon DLC, trading cards (in game not steam) to be collected and even battle stamps to be bought with all that cany you collect ! Last but not the least. it rewards you as well with not that difficult to get achievements.\n\nThe game is open world, with a linear flow, yet is not pushy at all. Humour is present and its of the pleasant kind, not the very obvious or cheesy just-for-kids type. So full marks there too. Battle system is turn based with a system of quick key presses to get the most optimum attack once u have selected your options. Battles are easy for the most part. Later bosses require a little strategy, which while keeping you sufficently involved in the story, are easy enough not to deter the calm flow of the game.\n\nIn all, a recommended buy. Do not hesitate if you get it on sale.","January 17, 2015","true","26.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","100","14","14","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/recommended/115100/","Hotdogbitchface","Hotdog Bitchface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hotdogbitchface/","2391 products in account","NOTE: This is a shortened review without screenshots.For my full review, please visit  Real Gamer Reviews[realgamerreviews.com]\n\nCostume Quest is a Halloween-themed, turn-based RPG developed by Tim Schafer’s crew at Double Fine Productions. For those who don’t know, Tim Schafer is the mastermind behind critically acclaimed (but not necessarily financially successful) games such as Psychonauts, Grim Fandango, Full Throttle and more recently, Broken Age. In many ways, I feel that Tim Schafer is the Tim Burton of video games. Whilst not all of his games (or in Burton’s case, movies) are necessarily fantastic, all of them share a common, whimsical and imaginative style with a quirky sense of humour. Therefore, going in, I had big expectations going into this game. Needless to say, given the big red thumbs down above this review, these expectations weren’t quite met.\n\nStory:The game takes place on Halloween, where you (the character that you pick) and your sister/brother (the character that you didn’t pick) go out trick-or-treating, only to have your sibling kidnapped by strange monsters. You effectively spend the rest of the game in an attempt to rescue said sibling. There are three major locations to explore, including your initial suburb, a mall and … another suburb with a fair. Simple, straightforward, and not a whole lot more to say than that.\n\nGameplay:As previously stated, Costume Quest is largely a turn-based RPG. Unlike many other turn-based RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest, battles are not random encounters. Instead, they are generally triggered by either knocking on doors (“trick or treating”) or walking into a wandering enemy. A large majority of the enemies that you face in the game are compulsory, as you are required to “trick or treat” every house in each area in order to move to the next area.\n\nThe “class system” in the game is determined by the costume that each character is wearing. Each costume has a normal attack (which to my knowledge is the same regardless of which costume you use) and a special attack, which you can use every 3 turns, which each have their own unique abilities. This usually consists of extra damage, healing, armour or some negative effect on the enemy (such as stun). You initially begin with one character with the Robot suit. As you progress through the game, you unlock more characters (maximum of 3) and costumes (of which there are many). Unfortunately, despite the large number of costumes, many of the characters play very similarly and largely fall into 3 major classes – a fighter that deals damage, a healer and a character that provides buffs. This is exacerbated by the fact that, apart from one single boss fight (in which you are constantly reminded to use a particular sort of character), you can more or less run through the entire game without changing your costumes at all.\n\nThe battles themselves play out similarly to most turn-based RPGs, with the notable addition of timing-based button prompts, which will be familiar to people that have played Paper Mario or The Mario and Luigi RPG series on handheld Nintendo systems. The prompts for each attack depend on the costume that each character is using, and successfully completing these will lead to additional damage (when on offence) or reduced damage (on defence). These prompts include things such as pressing a button immediately, pressing it at a certain time, twirling your left stick around or mashing a button repeatedly. Although these do add some depth to the battle system, in the sense that you can’t entirely fall asleep at the wheel and just mash A repeatedly, it still remains far too shallow and far too easy. I am practically an old man when it comes to gaming, and even with my old-man reflexes, I managed to hit approximately 99% of the prompts without any trouble.\n\nWinning the battles awards you with which is used to level up (which increases HP and strength) and candy, which is the currency in the game used to purchase stamps, which can be equipped to your characters to give bonuses, such as increased damage/defence, splash damage and so on. Once you’ve reached the level cap and/or have purchased all of the stamps (both of which I did prior to finishing the game), there’s no longer any purpose to the battles, making the already cumbersome and tedious battles just that much worse.\n\nThe rest of the game is padded with tedious fetch-quests, hidden-object finding and an awfully unoriginal and unimaginative mini-game. Worst of all, you are required to do these same activities each time you move to a new area. Most (but not all) of the costumes that you unlock have a secondary ability that can be used outside of the battle. The Robot suit, for example, has rollerblades which allow you to travel faster (which is generally why you’ll spend most of your time in this suit) and travel up ramps, leading you to so-called “hidden areas”. The other costumes have abilities that are, for the most part, used once in a particular part of the game (most of which is right after you obtain the costume) and then never necessary again. As a result, most of these abilities seem really tacked-on, which is a real shame as I feel like they could have done so much more with it.\n\nPresentation:First things first – I loved the cartoony art style used for this game. I really have no complaints about the graphics. The characters are cute and the setting is undeniably Halloween. Remember - nothing screams Halloween more than Jack-O-Lanterns and candy, and be warned – there are Jack-O-Lanterns and candy everywhere in this game. The sound and music are, for lack of a better word, appropriately Halloweeney. One thing that they absolutely nailed is the animations used for the battle transitions, in which the cardboard boxes and cheap trousers used to create the children’s costumes are transformed into visually-impressive life-like versions. This will hit all the right spots for anyone that’s worn an awful costume in their younger years and imagined looking so much cooler. With that said, having these animations play out every single time you enter a battle wears out very quickly, which is exacerbated by the fact that there’s no way to skip them.\n\nAnother major gripe that I had was the complete lack of a map/mini-map. This, coupled with the fact that most of the sub-areas in the game look more or less identical, resulted in me walking around in circles looking for the last house to trick-or-treat, or the last hidden child.\n\nBy far the biggest hook for this game is the classic Tim Schafer-esque humour and dialogue that we’ve come to expect from Double-Fine. Whilst not every line will necessarily make you laugh out loud, it’s hard not to at least smirk. At the very least, you’ll appreciate the effort that Double Fine has gone through to give each and every character a unique line of dialogue. It should be noted that the game lacks any voice acting, instead opting to go with on-screen text. On one hand, it’s a shame, given how awesome the voice acting has been in some of DF’s earlier (i.e. Psychonauts) or later (i.e. Broken Age) has been. On the other hand, bad voice acting could have destroyed the delivery of the quirky, humorous one-liners.\n\nOverall verdict:Overall, the game was largely disappointing. It’s a shame, really, because the quirky presentation and humour really highlighted everything I love about Tim Schafer’s games – it was more everything else that let the game down, most notably the repetitive and shallow gameplay. I can honestly say that during the 8 or so hours that I spent finishing the game (including the DLC), I can’t think of many moments that I actually enjoyed myself.  Therefore, with a heavy heart, I can’t recommend this game to anyone.","November 12, 2014","false","19.7"," 61 of 101 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","61","101","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/115100/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","When monsters invade to disrupt the sacred trick-or-treating tradition of Halloween, kidnap your twin, and attempt to steal all the candy that is yours by right, there's nothing to do but turn your costume up to eleven and kick them back into the netherworld from whence they came. Thus is the setup to Costume Quest, a hilarious and creative RPG-lite from Double Fine that is as sweet as the candy you so eagerly collect, despite its gameplay being highly simplified.\n\nYou spend most of your time exploring the world, collecting costume pieces, and of course knocking on houses with the hope that a bundle of candy will be waiting for you on the other side. There are also a handful of side-quests to complete, most in the form of hide-and-seek games or typical fetching errands. Though in most games I find quests such as these mundane and uninteresting, here they are full of so much humor and charm that it was hard for me to keep from smiling the whole way through.\n\nBut supposing someone not so nice and full of candy answers the door, then it's time to for some Persona like turn-based combat to occur. This is where gameplay hits a snag, as while fully functional the battle mechanics are extremely basic, revolving almost entirely around quicktime events with little to no variation or strategy to speak of. They are also terribly easy (I failed all but once, and on the final boss no less) which made the few options you are given for altering your character's attacks even less noticeable and necessary. That's not to say battles are completely devoid of fun, as I did enjoy them to an extent, but after only a few hours the repetition becomes grating so much as to have me actively try and avoid encounters (as if the Ninja costume wasn't already awesome enough). Thankfully with the story clocking in at 6-7 hours, it never got so bad as to greatly degrade the experience, and so long as you keep play sessions to short bursts are little more than a minor annoyance.\n\nThe big head celshaded look works surprisingly well with the theme of the game, making transitions between the lighthearted character models to the much more intricate (and in some cases suitably creepy) characters used for battles seamless, on top of simply being cute. The fixed camera is at times a hassle, but for the most part works well for the style of gameplay and stays out of your mind where it belongs. I do have one odd complaint about the presentation, which is the lack of any music or sound effects for most cutscenes. Even a simple text scrolling sound would have helped, as the way it is now made them feel awkward and drawn out, not to mention greatly reduced the impact of significant plot points.\n\nRegardless of any problems I mentioned, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Costume Quest to anyone who has enjoyed a Double Fine game in the past. The writing is comedy gold, the characters lively and likeable, and its concept is completely unique. If you are looking for a complex and involving RPG then you won't find it here, but if you can look past the simple mechanics for the heartfelt adventure underneath it is greatly entertaining and worth playing.","October 7, 2013","true","6.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","4"

There was no originality. Why could we not see three different mini games?\n\nThe variety of monsters was also very lack luster, they introduce new species that have only about 4 or 5 varieties each for a total of under 20. Plus all most of them do is just attack you, no special moves, no variables, just one attack. I get that it was supposed to be simplistic, but it was just too much so for my taste.\n\nThe supposedly clever humor also fell flat in my opinion, the writing was not NEARLY as good as what I am accustomed to from this studio. I loved brutal legend and I loved Iron brigade not only because the games were fun, but they were hilarious as well. It also hurt that the dialogue is not voiced.\n\nIf you are looking for a cutesy little game for a young child who has 6 hours to burn, I say go for this as long as it’s under 10$. Otherwise unless you are a Double Fine fanboy (which is not necessarily a bad thing, they make good games) then just walk away.","January 16","false","8.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

It is absolutely adorable. You play as one of two siblings out to collect candy on halloween. Alls not well however, when they discover that the neighborhood has been taken over by evil doings.\n\nArtistically, Costume Quest is great. Interesting graphics with a FFVII-esque transition between the cutsy overworld and the combat scenes. The music fits the game well, but isn't outstanding. The story is silly and fun, and not super serious.\n\nMechanically, the game is solid. Combat and overworld controls make sense and everything is easy to pick up. Combat is menu based, but not overwhelmingly so. Each costume has different strengths and weaknesses, and different combinations can make for a very different combat experience.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick, uninvolved RPG, you could do a lot worse than Costume Quest.\n\nIf you liked this review, please have a look at my other reviews!","November 25, 2013","true","19.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

But is it worth playing? In my opinion - unless the Halloween theme truly appeals to you, not really. Sadly.\n\nThe thing is, you'll master the game's turn-based combat mechanics in the first hour. After that, the only challenges will be the occasional boss battles. Every other battle will just be a chore of waiting for it to be over, because there pretty much is no way for you to lose or have to develop a certain strategy. And as fun as the different costumes animations are to watch (the attack animations, especially that of the eyeball costume, are absolutely the high point of the game), after a while it just feels boring; despite the combat being spiced up by mechanics like having to push the correct button at the right time to do the most damage.\n\nApart from that, there isn't much gameplay to be had here. There's a decent enough minigame (bobbing for apples), and in the DLC (freely included) there is a little maze puzzle, which is hardly challenging, but entertaining enough. The rest of the game? Walking around and exploring every nook and cranny of it's world. Which is a charming enough world. It's a shame, really. The whole concept of the game is just really cute, the designs and attack animations of the costumes are as previously mentioned absolutely wonderful, and the dialogue is at times pretty amusing.\n\nBut it just doesn't cut it. The game is boring and repetitive (it has 4 areas, and your tasks are the same every single time) and all the charm in the world doesn't make it interesting to play. There is promise there - the final boss fight had some challenge, and it took me a few tries to find the best strategy (which combination of costumes would be most useful to help me win) - but the fact the game doesn't ever really live up to that promise just makes it all the more disappointing.\n\nThe game will probably provide a good time for players who are not looking for a challenge, or players who just haven't had a whole lot of experience with turn-based RPGs yet; or simply young players. Everyone else? There's better stuff out there.\n\n[After a bunch of "unhelpful" ratings, I edited the review to hopefully sound a bit less opinionated and a bit more informative.]","October 20, 2014","false","7.0"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

It has a wonderful sense of atmosphere that really does define Halloween for a young child.  The world is a bright, colorful, slighty scary place full of surprises.  In the game you have to explore the area for candy, solve a few puzzles, and battle a few monsters.   There is some rpg aspects in fact that you level the party,  you can buy power-ups with candy, and the choice of costumes. The idea of combat is great as your costumes come to life, each wih a special ability.  In reality, the battles tend to be a bit repetitive and button mashfasts.  Still, I always look forward to each new costume to see its animations in battle.\nOverall, I highly recommend this game just on charm alone.  Its got great artwork and the game mechanisms work for the most part.  I even like the soundtrack with its spooky sounds interpersed with children's laughter.  The humor is great too, you can view this game as a satire on American culture.","October 24, 2014","true","14.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Small games like this for me are far more exciting and interesting to play because they can be so random.\n\nCostume Quest is clearly a Halloween themed game where you play as a child whose brother/sister has been taken captive by monsters (Grubbins) that think he/she is a giant piece of candy. Progressing through the game, there are 3 or 4 main quest areas/neighborhoods that you 'Trick or Treat' for candy and do various quests such as trading collectible Creepy Treat Cards with other kids, bobbing for apples and finding 6 children that are hiding to get a reward.\n\nThere are of course Costumes that you find materials for and use to fight your enemies, you can buy Battle Stamps or receive them after winning a fight which improve your damage, hp, attack power or chance to dodge etc. Each costume has its own unique ability and attack moves which really adds a little strategy as to which costumes your characters wear to a fight.\n\nAll in all, i really have enjoyed playing through this game! It has a very South Park: Stick of Truth feel to it, in the sense that you are playing as children, exploring the neighborhood, fighting other children in turn based fights, finding collectibles, doing certain quests to unlock access to new areas, having boss fights and so on. The only difference here is that Costume Quest is a fraction of the price and isnt quite as content filled as South Park: Stick of Truth, but it is worth the price by far in my opinion.\n\nI have been uploading all of my gameplay to Youtube if you would like to see some gameplay but there are of course spoilers if you do watch them :steamhappy:\n\nCostume Quest Youtube Playlist","February 1","true","25.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Grubbins are experiencing a takeover by an evil crew of monsters who are raising the taxes and steeling the candy. Can you save the foes that originally caused you so much distress from a fate worse than death, a world without candy.\n\nGameplay:\nJust beat this game, other than the final boss on Grubbins on Ice being slightly challenging the overall game was incredibly easy. This game has a fun an interesting story which makes me wonder if all that occurred was just a child’s imagination or in fact was supposed to have really happened. The game drifts between reality and fantasy creating a world through the eyes of children. The game offers elements of questing, puzzle solving, and combat all without a single bit of bloodshed. The gameplay is interesting, but incredibly simple. The characters wear costumes which allow them to enter into battle with their opponents gaining the power of their outfit. The costumes have one attack and ability. No matter which costume you where the basic attack is essentially the same (doing the same amount of damage only visually different). The costumes differ based on their special ability, which makes each costume slightly unique.\n\nResults:\nIf you are interested in an RPG that’s not a page turner, but rather just a fun little side project then this may be for you. This game has simple gameplay, relatively easy to follow plot, and very basic questing; all which adds up to a game which you can play for a while, put down for a while, and come back to without feeling like you lost a beat. Overall it’s a fun little game that doesn't offer too much on your plate, but just enough to fill you up.\n\nPros:\n+Simple basic combat system which requires no real skill\n+Friendly characters and interesting story line.\n+Relatively friendly controls\n+Very basic puzzles which require not mental skill.\n+Good game for all ages as there is no gore or inappropriate dialogue.\n\nCons:\n-Gets very repetitive\n-No replay value. Once you have completed this game there is no reason to try it again (which is fine if you can get this game at a good discount)\n-Cannot cycle through characters and thus must play as the first character in line; this can be really annoying if you want to quickly cycle through costumes rather than continually opening the menu to change the costumes between characters. Which results in you then have to change the costumes back to the previous setting if you want your main character to wear a specific costume for its exploration ability.","February 19, 2014","true","7.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It takes elements from Mario RPG / Paper Mario with timed attacks, so the game tricks you in to thinking you're doing more than selecting "Fight" from a menu. The costumes are fun to change up, half of them are useless and impractical but they look cool.\n\nThe challenge does ramp up a bit at the very end and the final boss can be very obnoxious if you don't bring a healing costume in with you. If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy for it's job system and Paper Mario for it's timed button strikes, you'll enjoy this game.\n\nOnly downside is how slow the game can be at times, having to watch repeated animations over and over before a battle begins... also it can be a tad clunky especially when using the dash feature from the Robot costume...\n\nThis brings me to final point that it was bad game design on Double Fines part to allow this costume to dash and none of the others... It makes it manditory for you to utilize this first costume at all times meaning it doesn't give you much in the way of variety... Thankfully this was fixed in CQ2 with an actual dash button.\n\nThe DLC Grubbin's on Ice is around the same length as one of the in game core chapters, 2 hours in length. Worthy addition to the game and links the events of CQ1 and 2 so it's basically manditory to play if you intend to continue your Costume Quest. :P","October 8, 2014","true","12.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

I got it as part of a bundle I purchased in order to get another game I wanted and never really intended to play it. But I did. And I ended up loving it.\n\nIt's definitely a pretty casual game and you can breeze through it pretty quickly so it might not appeal to the most hardcore of gamers but I thought it was a blast. The designs are cute and quirky and thw worlds are just open enough to make them fun to explore but not too open so that you get completely lost and turned around.\n\nSince all of the different costumes the characters can wear have different powers attached to them, the fighting never actually gets boring. There's different combinations of costumes you can use to find the ones you like best and none of the costumes are actually a bad choice. They're all really powerful and have their own benefits, even the ones that seem weakest will have awesome healing abilities that make them great in a boss fight.\n\nThere are some puzzles that you have to solve using your costumes but they're all pretty straightforward, if not explained outright. This is never really a hard game but I think that works for it. The battles are just challenging enough to keep you engaged but never hard enough to really destroy the whimsy of the game.\n\nThe only thing I really found annoying was having to back track in order to find certain things you need, especially in the mall level. The top tier of that level just looked all the same to me and I kept getting turend around. At least your main costume comes with rollerblades so that you can just zip right along.","June 20, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I guess it's an anti cheat thing. Though I don't really see the point in cheating in a game so forgiving as this one.\n\nAnyway. The game has a very monster house feeling to it. Where you have your friend, later, friends, a little side humor and a lot of surprising events all wrapped in a properly ill lit scenery. The game doesn't even feel like an RPG until you get into your first battle. And it starts off very rock paper scissors until you get further in. And so far it is the only game I know that can potentially punish you for focusing on killing off the healer in an enemy party.\n\nYou traditionally go around collecting as much candy as you can from houses around as progression to find your sister, who has been abducted or something... I don't remember. It wasn't important. It's generic. There are other quests to do and things you can choose to find or not. But you do not have to do most of them to progress. Though if you're like me, you'll get lost in the darkness and end up getting everything done before you even find the last place to trick or treat.\n\nBattles... I feel like I played a game that was like this. But I don't remember it. Battles are more tactics based and there are No end all kill all invincible sets. A couple missed defense or sloppy offense will get you beat, and you'll be seconds from trying again. Because the game is forgiving, and instead of other rpgs that have you holding your head because you forgot to equip the accessory that would make your life a whole lot easier. You'll be right there able to try again and or challenge yourself with No penalty.\n\nCostumes have many roles in and outside of battle. Though honestly the run ability should have been either standard or at least something that could be swapped. I found myself sticking to the robot costume for it, as walking through the entire game seems like a chore, especially if you're lost. The roles inside of battle are diverse and almost always useful depending on whether you feel the need to attack or defend in battle. Other suits can also health or even revive.\n\nExploring was probably the most fun. Regardless of how often I've gotten lost finding the last windy road or silly mistake you overlooked is always gratifying and adds to how nice it is to have maps and areas you have to explore in its entirety to enjoy.\n\nBecause the levelling isn't all out of whack if you left other quests behind and need to do them battling isn't a chore of going through useless cinematics to clear peon battles. It stays fresh throughout and has a simple story that is deliciously visioned to make it worth playing again just to catch the quick humor or screenshot the sarcastic joke that had you hesitant the first time.\n\nThat being said, there is another story inside it that I hear is more expansive than the main one. So it is very well worth the time and effort. Even if it's just to look at the pretty visuals.","July 5, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Except if you are like me and forget to use stamps. The bosses can be tough without a strategy but are manageable.\n\nAll in all I liked playing this game and can recommend it.","September 4, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The "combat" in this game is amazing. You have various different costumes you collect along the way, and these are you're ultimate weapon against the bad guys. It’s extremely fun, you use abilities and do quick time events to beat your enemies and the friends you make along the way builds your team of defence, each having their own abilities which with the right combinations can make really good teams.\nGoing into the combat mode really reminded me of when i was a kid, back in the days where i watched power-rangers, it was a great experience, and i really enjoyed it.\nLike most of Double Fines games, there are various things to collect to make the game that little bit more fun for people like me that just can't resist collectables.

I could not abstain from playing this game for too long, it was too much fun while it lasted. I'm not going to construct an entire essay, but there are some things I would like to relay about this game before I call it a day. After all, I completed the game to perfection so I can at least assume I have accquired the right to do so.\n\nIf you're looking for a simple, concrete, and upbeat narrative, you will be for the most part satisfied with what is provided here. It follows a child named Reynold (I chose him, so I'm typing on behalf my experience) as he is rather sanguine about the idea of saving his sister Wren from the menancing clutches of Dorsilla... on his favorite holiday, Good Ol' Halloweenies. Or maybe he's not too happy, as he faces the prospect of being grounded by his parents for "not being responsible". He also gains the effort of two other kids on his pursuit, but they don't matter. It is imperative to know before prior to booting this game up for the first time that most of the humor that Costume Quest is adorned with is very hit-or-miss, seeing how most of the punchlines, jokes, etc. are elementary, even for an immature ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ such as myself. Perhaps this was Mr. Schafer's intention with this game, so this minor flaw can be dismissed if so.\n\nIt is a given that the gameplay here is rather tedious after a while but the classic halloween charm the game presents itself in achieved at making me persevere. It also helps as this game is by no means a difficult game to perfect, and this is coming from an anti-completionist (That's a story for another time). I couldn't help myself but to engage in a gameplay binge where I'd buy all the Battle Stamps, find all the costume patterns/parts, trick-or-treat houses, and a bit more. This is the first game I've played in a long time where once I start playing I'm consumed by a genuine desire to keep on playing, and I have to praise the game strongly for that, as it was the best thing this game has going for itself. That goes without saying, there are some glaring problems. One that I can pull right out of my head is the combat, as the system is fundamentally gleaned from other games of the genre. It was akin to the likes of Blue Dragon (turn based, sweet spot charge attacks, battle stamps improve aspects, mega/corporeal attacks, etcetera). Enjoyable, but derivative.\n\nCostume Quest is honestly a game that is easily accessible once your expectations are set accordingly. Despite it's bleak humor and painfully ubiquitous battle gameplay, this is a fun game that will keep most gamers on their seat until the credits roll. I need money for the sequel now.","February 9, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's simple, funny, touching, it's make you laugh a little and smile a lot and there aren't many things, that can do so, so I appreceate the experience. You should know though that the game is very repetitive: rob some shop, fight with monsters, do it again and again. Still, it doesn't mean that Costume Quest aren't enjoyable - quite the opposite actually, but I just give you warning.\nNow for the main part: it's a Halloween adventure and we have two siblings, who want to celebrate and take all sweets for themselves. They are boy and girl, it's your choice who you want to play with (hint: the choice happens, when your mother decide who will be in charge). But quite quickly events become much more difficult - the big green monster steals your sibling and now you HAVE to find him\her. Or take the wrath of your mother. Monsters just don't look so scary now, come to think of it...\nGameplay is very simple: you must take sweets from shops and homes, you must fight monsters that come your way and take some side quests and exploration if you like. It may sounds boring, but actually it's pretty fun because of battle system, story and dialogs. Battle system looks like a Dream world, where your nice costume (i didn't mention this? Come on, the game has a "costume" in title!) becomes a powerful weapon. Like, robot costume transforms into actual fabulous robot. There are also ninja, Statue of Liberty, Space warrior, magic unicorn... and french fries. Where else you can fight with your enemies, using your french fries powers?! Okay, to actual battles. Little warning: you need some reaction for this, because you will need to quickly press some buttons while you attacking or defending to make better results. And yeah, each costume have it's own special powers for battle. Like, healing allies or making a powerful attack, or shielding the ally or yourself. It's your choice what combination to prefer (hint: you aren't all alone, there will be friends, some from the very beginning, some later).\nAs for the story, I just don't want to spoil it for you, but it's wery fun and enjoyable with all jokes, references for popular culture, dantists's twist plots... You'll see many absurd situations and many exapmles of wonderful wrinting. Seroiusly, it's good and not only for child's taste. I highly recommend to complete every quest and talk with everyone - dialogs are pretty hilarious here, really, you will have a good time.\nSo, if you are kid in your heart or at least can be, try the Costume Quest. Despite all its humorous self, it tells a story about siblings, about people, who may fight and tell a pretty bad things, but they're still family. They still love each other, even if it take a monster invasion to understand such a simple fact.\nAnd if you still wondering: of course adults don't help children to fight monsters. When they ever did? *sigh* Adults.\n\nP. S. If you encounter sudden perfomance problems (characters move very-very slow), try to reboot your computer. Strange advice, but it helps me.","January 29","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story and music is nice, but without voice actors I really felt the little "extra" was missing. The text bubbles you're left with sometimes disappears too fast before you can read them, other times you can press a button when reading them, and this should have been implemented in a better way, if not for all of them. Also, there are too many unnecessary battles; because of the battles being very simplistic in nature, the game would benefit greatly if these encounters were cut in, say, maybe half. Or barring that, having a more advanced fighting system. Nevertheless, it's a really nice "cozy" game that I recommend getting on a sale.","March 26, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It’s a very simple and short turn-based RPG that hit a lot of the right notes.  It just has a certain charm to it that is hard to describe. The combat contains a timing-based component where if you perform the correct action at the right time, your attacks will do more damage or you will take less damage on defense.  This helps keep you engaged in all of the battles.  Thankfully this component was included, because otherwise you have very few options in combat (attack, use a special if it is charged, or use a battle stamp which gives a combat ability).  In terms of battle stamps, these are reusable and basically replace items in the game, and can either confer an ability in combat (e.g. stun a single enemy) or a passive ability (e.g. more health).  The other source of variety in combat is the inclusion of 13 different combat costumes, each of which have their own abilities and play style (single target DPS, AoE, defense, healer, etc.).  That being said, even with these additions the combat can still drag at times.  Fighting a limited variety of enemies in the same environment over and over can become tedious.  Overall most battles are quite easy, but a few boss battles require strategy when selecting which battle stamps and costumes to use.  The story doesn’t contribute much, but the writing is good and there are some funny moments.  If you enjoy RPGs that don’t take themselves too seriously, this is a good game.  In addition, the simplified and streamlined nature of the game would make it a good option for someone who is new to RPGs or a younger gamer.","May 31","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They bring a certain magic and charm to all of their products. Most of their games are quite humorous and the stories are creative and unpredictable.\n\nSo if Double Fine is Pixar, Costume Quest is Double Fine's "Cars." It's not a bad game. The premise is nifty and the jokes will make you grin, but there are just better showings if you want the Double Fine experience.\n\nCostume Quest takes place on Halloween, and you are a kid who has to rally some friends to trick-or-treat your way through town to save your sibling. It's colorful and delightful, like playing an old-school Nickelodeon cartoon. But after about an hour the old school Nickelodeon is overshadowed by the old school RPG game mechanics, which are repetitive and don't provide much actual decision-making or challenge. The story is divided into three beautiful set pieces, but again, the game play in each set piece is identical. Same main tasks, same exact sidequests, and the costumes you collect for monster fights aren't varied enough in their abilities to matter.\n\nIf you love Double Fine and you're very tolerant of JRPG-style gameplay, you'll probably have fun, but I wouldn't make this your first Double Fine game.

Who wouldn't want some of THAT for even just a single night? Count me in! Hygiene-wise, the whole rummaging garbage bins and picking up candy from dirty floors was kind of questionable, but I'm guessing nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about these things. Candy is candy and it's love.\n\nBy the way, I 've never tried trick-or-treating. I know, I know... I had a really boring childhood. This game made me want to turn back time and give it a try for even just once though. But then again, who said only kids get to trick-or-treat? I'm adding that to my bucket list.","November 28, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I MUST  say that this game is  AMAZING!  This game brought out my inner childhood of pretending that I was a Jedi or a ninja on halloween and you guys put all of it in a game! One of the best games I've ever played! Thank you Double Fine!\nSummary\nCostume quest is a cute animated game that is a turn-based RPG Halloween game! Your goal, to save your (brother or sister, your choice) from the evil candy stealing Grubbins! You may free-roam around the (actually) large 3 areas that the game provides you to search for your sibling, collect battle stamps, trading cards, costumes, Trick or Treat (A MUST :)), battle Grubbins, and find new friends! There is all sort of neat little things that the creators put in for you to find for yourself! The dialog is absolutely a belly-rumbler and the controls are crisp and easy to use! At the end of  Costume Quest  the creators decided to throw in the DLC Grubbins on Ice which adds on to the orignal quest and is also quite entertaing as well! If you are a teen or an adult, this game will surely touch your childhood in one way or another!\nThe good!\nControls are on point for this game, even with a controller!\nThe graphics are very cute and clean! This game his it's own style on graphics and runs very well on  ANY  Computer.\nGameplay and storyline gets right into action immediantly and never declines in action during the whole game!\nAlthough the game does not come with voices, the dialog is quite funny!\nVery good setting! Music helps improve the mood and the atmosphere. No doubt makes up for the lack of in-game voice-overs.\nA rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive!\nAchievements are real easy to achieve if you finish the story carefully.\nA  TOTAL  bang for your buck! The Bad!\nAlthough dialog is good, in-game voices would help\nA short campaign and DLC will only put you at about 20 hours to 100% completion.\nFamilar battles may get a bit annoying, but no too much. The  Ugly  AMAZING\nA rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive! The Verdict\nOverall this game is amazingly entertaining and fun to play for all ages! While the game may have a few minor flaws, like no voices and it's length, it makes up with no doubt with good graphics, sounds, entertaining storyline, neat details, and epic quest! It's a must have in your steam library! Good job Double Fine!\nPost-Game Stats\nGraphics: 9/10\nAudio: 7/10\nPlot, Storyline, and character builds: 10/10\nControls: 10/10\nEntertainment: 10/10\nOverall: 9.5/10\nFINAL: Must Have!\nTHANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING GAME! -CaptainParadox","April 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think FF3 with it's job system and a dash of QTE for DMG/DEF and you get an idea of what to expect. Finding the right combo of costumes and battle stamps that compliment the party is key (to boss battles mostly), although I did find one combo that was a little to OP. Also fast QTE reflexes can be a boon for survivability.\nThat said, sadly since it's not a high budget game, it's pretty short and not very deep in story and the battle system, but all in all it was fun and I had more than a few good laughs. I literally had a smile on my face the whole way through.

It is to Final Fantasy (and adventure games) what games like Deathspank are to Diablo: simplified, humorous, and story-driven derivations. Costume Quest may not necessarily be the hardest game out there, but it is thoroughly enoyable all the way through. Especially if you have fond nostalgic memories of trick-or-treating.\n\nThe free dlc/expansion called "Grubbins on Ice" that comes with it is also fairly good (it is a sequel, so play it after), however I feel much of my personal enjoyment of the original game came from the accurate recreation of what Halloween used to feel like. I still think there is plenty of room for sequels, but I'd personally like to see a return to Halloween in a town as the primary theme next time. Neighborhoods still have a ton of room they could grow in terms of varying atmosphere and style, so I wouldn't say a sequel back in town would feel redundant.\n\nBoth the original game and the expansion are full of DF-style humor, as well as lots of side tasks to keep you entertained. This is not a massive game, however, and can be 100% completed in less than ~8 hours (much less if you skip all the cutscenes). Still definitely worth the money, as the experience will leave you satisfied and wanting more.\n\nAlso, as a diehard DF fan there were a few fantastic references (the Psychonauts shop music at the mall, the Stacking dolls in the mountains), not to mention all the pop-culture jokes.","September 4, 2013","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The idea is great and very well implented.\nBasically you take the role of a boy or a girl und walk from house to house in order to collect sweets (the currency of the game) and battle monsters for experience points. Soon you are going to find a group and a load of new costumes. Each costume has its own exploration and battle abilities which have to be used to progress in the innovative quests. The gameplay is addicting and you always feel that you are getting closer to your goals - however, the battles become quite boring after a while because they are, except for the bosses, nearly always the same and they tend to be to easy.\nThe game is not very long, but it knows how to entertain. The humour is a bit childish but it fits perfectly to the game's atmosphere and the graphics are nice to look at.\nYou could say it's a typical Double Fine game: short and simple but also very innovative and entertaining.","April 8, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I MUST  say that this game is  AMAZING!  This game brought out my inner childhood of pretending that I was a Jedi or a ninja on halloween and you guys put all of it in a game! One of the best games I've ever played! Thank you Double Fine!\nSummary\nCostume quest is a cute animated game that is a turn-based RPG Halloween game! Your goal, to save your (brother or sister, your choice) from the evil candy stealing Grubbins! You may free-roam around the (actually) large 3 areas that the game provides you to search for your sibling, collect battle stamps, trading cards, costumes, Trick or Treat (A MUST :)), battle Grubbins, and find new friends! There is all sort of neat little things that the creators put in for you to find for yourself! The dialog is absolutely a belly-rumbler and the controls are crisp and easy to use! At the end of  Costume Quest  the creators decided to throw in the DLC Grubbins on Ice which adds on to the orignal quest and is also quite entertaing as well! If you are a teen or an adult, this game will surely touch your childhood in one way or another!\nThe good!\nControls are on point for this game, even with a controller!\nThe graphics are very cute and clean! This game his it's own style on graphics and runs very well on  ANY  Computer.\nGameplay and storyline gets right into action immediantly and never declines in action during the whole game!\nAlthough the game does not come with voices, the dialog is quite funny!\nVery good setting! Music helps improve the mood and the atmosphere. No doubt makes up for the lack of in-game voice-overs.\nA rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive!\nAchievements are real easy to achieve if you finish the story carefully.\nA  TOTAL  bang for your buck! The Bad!\nAlthough dialog is good, in-game voices would help\nA short campaign and DLC will only put you at about 20 hours to 100% completion.\nFamilar battles may get a bit annoying, but no too much. The  Ugly  AMAZING\nA rare game that brings yourself and your memories alive! The Verdict\nOverall this game is amazingly entertaining and fun to play for all ages! While the game may have a few minor flaws, like no voices and it's length, it makes up with no doubt with good graphics, sounds, entertaining storyline, neat details, and epic quest! It's a must have in your steam library! Good job Double Fine!\nPost-Game Stats\nGraphics: 9/10\nAudio: 7/10\nPlot, Storyline, and character builds: 10/10\nControls: 10/10\nEntertainment: 10/10\nOverall: 9.5/10\nFINAL: Must Have!\nTHANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING GAME! -CaptainParadox","April 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game reminded me A LOT of South Park Stick of Truth to the point that I actually wondered if the South Park team had used Costume Quest as an influence when they created their game. That being said, obviously the actual story and dialogue is very different to Stick of Truth. For one, the kids aren't swearing constantly, for two nobody is getting anything shoved up the rear region and for three there is no spoken dialogue. I was really on the fence about there being no voice actors in this game. What I enjoy about Double Fine Production games is that their characters are really likeable and they take the time to show you a little bit about everyone in your world, even the guy that you see for one second will have a funny line and a nice costume. Here I felt that was not necessarily absent but not as prevelent when compared to other Double Fine games like Psychonauts. I wanted to hear the kids voices especially in cut scenes where the dialogue is bouncing between 5 different people. It just would have made it easier to follow. Obviously it's not like you're constantly reading, this isn't a visual novel, it's just something that I would change. The characters are still likable and the story keeps you motivated to continue to the end.\n\nWhat I liked the most about this game is that it's funny! It's fun! It's lighthearted! The art style is great. The world is detailed and immersive. The turn-based fighting avoids becoming repetitive because every now and then you get a new costume and a new set of awesome moves that come with it. Everytime I got a new costume I would call my boyfriend over so we could watch it's ultimate ability and high 5 afterwards because 90% of the time it was FREAKIN AWESOME! Heck I even took one of the ultimates and put in on 9GAG because it rocked my world.\n\nhttp://9gag.com/gag/aLPeW75\n\nWhat's more, you get Grubbins on Ice which is about an extra 1 - 2 hours of gameplay after you've completed Costume Quest. It's equally as fun and provides a great ending leaving you wanting to purchase Costume Quest 2 so you can see what happens. To complete both Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice should take 7 - 10 hours depending on how into unlocking achievements you are. It's also the type of game that you can play again after a year or two. Oh and also, if anyone from Double Fine reads this: Thanks for adding the Psychonauts music in the Camping Store at the Mall. It made me smile <3\n\n7.5/10","March 31, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

During Brutal Legend's troubled time with no publisher, Tim Shaefer let the leads on that project brainstorm with their own smaller teams. Tasha Harris, Brutal Legend's lead animator, pitched the idea for Costume Quest and THQ gave it the greenlight and here we are with a great family-friendly turn-based RPG adventure game sugar-coated with a fun Halloween theme.\n\nSetup: you are one of two fraternal twins in a new neighbourhood and you have to go out and make friends on Halloween. Your NPC brother/sister dresses up as a candy corn piece and is promptly candy-napped by a goblin (called Grubbins) and you along with new friends take off through your neighbourhood, the mall, and eventually to the Grubbins' world to rescue your sibling.\n\nMechanics: combat employs a very basic turn-based RPG engine with quick-time events to bolster your attacks/defenses a la Super Mario RPG (press X at the right time to defend, match the on-screen commands to do extra damage, etc).\n\nThere is a 'collection' aspect to the game as well in the form of stamps that you can apply to your costume as buffs, granting you extra active/passive battle effects. Mini games and side quests scattered throughout the different locations are fun diversions that are key to getting all of the aforementioned stickers, money (candy--it's Halloween after all!) and other consumeables to use in battle.\n\nYou will also find random items that when combined with a 'design', form a new costume that can be equipped by any member in your party. Each costume has a special attack/support action and by mixing and matching, you'll definitely find a combination that suites your style of play.\n\nThe original story and Grubbins on Ice campaigns together have a decent length. I can't remember how long I spent completing them and Steam didn't log my playtime since I played the entire game while at sea with no internet connection (damn you, Steam achievements!) I actually had to boot it up again to play for at least 5 minutes before Steam would let me post my review.. makes sense.\n\nI'll just use it as another excuse for a second playthrough, probably around Christmas time ;)\n\n\n\nTLDR: what you want, Cliffs Notes?","March 26, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/115100/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick Summary: Costume Quest is a “children’s” RPG focused more on story than on graphics or complexity. The actual gameplay reminds me of a simplified Chrono Trigger or similar Japanese RPG where you travel the map with semi random encounters and fight by taking turns exchanging attacks with the enemy.\n\nI called it a children’s RPG, by which I mean not only is the story about a group of kids (even the main bad guy is a child) but the story would be considered PG if it were a movie. You control a group of kids teamed up on Halloween to stop monsters from stealing all the candy, using the power of your Halloween costumes. In the main world you look like a bunch of kids in homemade costumes, but when you encounter enemies and enter battle, you become whatever you’re dressed as. For example some of the costumes are robot, jack o’ lantern, or unicorn. Outside of battle you’re free to change your team’s costumes to whatever you have unlocked, and some costumes have some sort of real world effect (for example the robot allows you to run fast).\n\nWhen your team is in battle, the options are extremely limited. You can either run away, attack, or use a special move. The special move is unlocked every few combat rounds and usually it’s something like a big attack or a healing spell for your team. An added combat mechanic is the ability to boost your attack or weaken the enemy attack by doing an easy quicktime event. For example every time you attack you press the correct button in time and your attack does 10% more damage, or you press it at the right time during the enemy attack and only take 90% normal damage.\n\nPros:\n+Decent cutesy, fun story for kids. Nothing a parent would have to worry about.\n+Very simplified gameplay, with some element of skill in boosting attacks or finding hidden items in the world.\n+The DLC Grubbins on Ice is included and adds a few hours more gameplay.\n\nCons:\n-Kind of a childish game, but you knew what you were getting into.\n\nOverall the game is a nice diversion that you can finish in a few days. I only played it at first because when Steam was releasing their trading cards, this was the one of the first games I owned with cards and I figured I’d give it a try while waiting for cards to drop. It was not disappointing.\n","March 17","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not as complicated as there though, some might find it as a negative aspect but not me. I enjoyed picking "skills" in the form of stamps rather than using dozens of items.

Although the gameplay is very simplistic and the fighting system is fairly boring the short game length and funny dialog makes it forgivable.\n\nThe game starts you as an aspiring trick or treater. Unfortunately disaster strikes when your sibling is abducted by goblins and you have to go rescue him/her. The game plays quite simply, you have to goto various house to trick and treat which gives you candy, the game's currency. You battle goblins and other monsters as you go along and through completion various quests you unlock new costumes.\n\nThe combat plays quite simple. Yourself and 2 companions go into battle each wielding a costume that will grant them different powers and you then take turns attacking the enemies until one side is killed off. Each costume has only one regular attack and one special move they can perform every three turns but to try and break up the monotone a little each attack requires you to perform a quicktime event to maximize your damage.\n\nThe graphics are fairly simple but the style is sharp and the locations have a great Halloween look to them which really helps. The sound and music is nothing impressive but it doesn't detract anything from the experience either.\n\nAll in all it's a cute little that gives you a few hours of fun however the simple gameplay and short length means it's only worth getting as a bargain title.","November 14, 2012","true","24.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You pick up party members, extra outfits that change play style, and it's a nice simple story with some half-decent mini-games. If you've already gotten a few RPGs under your belt you'll likely be bored out of your mind, but as I said a great "my first JPRG" for kids around 8-12 yrs old.","November 27, 2013","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As sweet as its subject matter, Costume Quest puts you in the shoes of a fourth grader who is tasked with rescuing his (or her) sibling from the clutches of a villainess whose evil schemes is going to wreck Halloween.\n\nThe game features standard RPG fare such as leveling up, hit points, and turn-based combat. Instead of classes you don costumes which grant you special powers, which can be augmented with special battle stickers.\n\nI loved the art style, the humor, and the fact that I have a game about trick or treating. My only quibble was that combat was too easy, with the exception of the final boss in Grubbins on Ice, I don't think I lost a single battle. But this is probably due to enemies not respawning. So, instead of a standard JRPG where you're forced to level grind for hours against a never ending horde of enemies, you need to discover the perfect balance of costumes and battle stickers amongst your party to succeed. In this regard, I feel that Costume Quest is a very newbie friendly RPG.","December 26, 2013","true","15.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Once again, Double Fine leaves me with mixed feelings.\nCostume Quest seems to be the kind of game I would enjoy a lot when I was a kid!\nEssencially, you're Reynolds, and it's Halloween. In the midst of trick-or-treating, there are monsters, stealing all the candy, who ended up kidnapping your sister.\nSo, you put on your most badass costume and go look for her, fighting the monsters with the aid of your costume's powers, along with some friends you meet along the way.\nThat sounds like something I would enjoy immensively when I was younger! And I still enjoyed it today, but it's not quite my kind of game.\n\n\nThe game is a mixture of an adventure/platformer game, with a JRPG(ish) type combat.\nIn combat, each character has a normal attack and a special attack, which takes turns to recharge. Instead of simply choosing which attack you want, there's also a QTE event that you have to do in order to boost your normal attacks.\nEach costume the character wears influences their attacks, and have a very unique style to them.\nThere are also stickers you can collect while exploring the world, which will then give you a passive or active ability in battle.\nYou have from 1 to 3 characters, and the same with the enemies. Each team has their attack turn, until the battle is finished.\n\nI didn't find the combat system very deep, with the exception of the Boss fights, which sometimes required a certain ability to be beaten, making the player experiment with the different costumes until he beat it. That was cool, but other than that, it felt a bit too shallow.\nTo its favor thought, animation was top-notch, and every attack made you feel like a badass doing it.\n\nOutside of combat, you go around collecting candy, sometimes from door to door, other times just in the environment. You also interact with NPCs, with a very DoubleFine-esque dialogue which is always welcome. You have 4 zones (3 in the main game, 1 in the DLC), each with its theme, and a group of side quests. These side quests help the player explore the world, and also provide rewards. I didn't find them particularly interesting, but they were on the way, so it did not detract from the experience. I just think they could have done something more with those sidequests.\nThere are quite a few "secrets" and Easter Eggs hidden around, making exploration quite rewarding to do as well!\n\nBesides, you'll need to explore to find different costume parts, which is the best part of the game, since each costume has its twist wether inside or outside of combat.\nThe various costumes reminded me of some 90s cartoons, and others were just Halloween themed. They didn't every feel out of place. A good concept well implemented!\n\n\nThe graphics aren't fantastic in terms of fidelity, but it's DoubleFine, so you know what to expect! They're highly stylized and unique, giving the game exactly the vibe they were looking for.\nMusic was up there as well, really enjoyed it!\n\nMost of the achievements were mainly there to get the player to actually go out for the sidequests and different costumes so they're pretty standard... But, there was one about a Stacking Easter Egg as well. Nothing noteworthy, but it had a few achievements that could lead the player into a better direction when playing it, so that's good!\n\n\nSo... due to the combat's lack of depth, it often felt a bit too repetitive, and so did some of the sidequests, since they're the same style for each zone. I get why it is like that, but since I didn't find them very interesting, having them in each zone felt a bit repetitive as well.\nBut that's my biggest complain with this game.\nOther than that, I've had a blast with it, specially with the Boss fights! The game isn't very challenging (if it seems so, you're doing something in the wrong intended order, which happened to me), but it doesn't leave too much space for failure. Still, with its combat system, one couldn't expect anything too strategical.\n\nIt looks and sound great, it's definitely an unique game, which takes you about 6-9 hours to finish, without and with DLC, respectively.\nIt's not something I'm likely to go back to, since I've finished it, but it was a good experience nonetheless. It's a streamlined JRPG, with a twist!\nI'd definitely recommend it if it catches your attention at all. Great game, DoubleFine strikes again!","February 12, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You play a child out on halloween teaming up with other kids and fighting monsters, all while trick-or-treating.  Instead of the usual RPG equipment, the halloween costumes you wear transform into full size versions during combat, providing their associated powers to your characters.  It all meshes together perfectly, as you would expect from a Double Fine game.\n\nI'm not sure what else there is to say.  It's cute, charming, and a solid RPG experience that doesn't feel dull and repetitive like many of these types of RPGs do.  My only complaints are that the controls are a bit sluggish and the game is locked at 30 fps which will hopefully be addressed in a patch now that Double Fine has the rights to the game back.","February 19, 2014","true","9.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also for me is frustrating that sometimes even thought you do everything well in a battle you cannot win in any way because enemies are too high level. Apart from that, I loved how this game is designed, graphics are beautiful, costumes look great and abilities and powers from these are pretty cool. I wouldn't recommend this game just because I felt so frustrated playing it and i quited.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuchicken/recommended/115100/","emuchicken","EmuChicken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuchicken/","1279 products in account","Ahh, Tim Schaffer's company "Double Fine" creates a "light" RPG adventure game revolving around kids and Halloween. Crossing the style of South Parks "Fun with Weapons" episode with Final Fantasy, the powers come from the costumes that each wear. A Robot with strengthened attack power, a knight with heightened defense, the statue of liberty with powers to heal the whole team. There are a total of around 9 costumes, but each only has one "ultimate" power.\n\nThe ideas behind the game are great, the setting really puts the player in the minds of the children, how they think- even there is no voice acting, the feeling and emotions are brought out wonderfully.\nStory lacks depth, idea being that some witch or other is stealing candy to help her get to some other country where she can take over. It felt something that a kid thought up. At the start of the game, your twin gets kidnapped, and this is the only time I ever felt any kind of real connection to it.\nThe art-style reinforces the setting of playing in a kids world, big eyes, very cartoony.\n\nGameplay is either adventuring around looking for cases, hitting anything for candy (even getting candy from trash cans!), or spent in the battle sequence, where very "Final Fantasy" style gameplay commences. Unfortunately, both modes get old very quickly.\nThe adventure part feels like a very "dark" Zelda game. It's not bad, but not great either. There were times where paths were too difficult to be seen, or understood. Finding the cases in the Mall, or even the hill on the final stage, where I thought fallen trees had stopped me walking up. (took me 3-4 hours just checking online as I thought it was a bug, or checking if I missed something). "Trick or Treating" became old in the first half of the game with no variation, which brings me to the...\nBattle sequence. This is where the action happens. Unfortunately, each costume only has one ultimate, as stated earlier. Also each person has one "battle stamp", which gives them a "counter", "stun", etc. Basically one trait that helps the character regardless of costume worn. Like the adventuring part, this becomes very stale from the second stage and begins to feel just like a waste of time for the player.\nAll in all, for the experienced RPG player, this is very lack-luster. An even SIMPLER version of "Final Fantasy Mystic Quest" on the Super Nintendo comes to mind. So for children, this game would be a great purchase to introduce them to the genre of RPG.\nOther reviews stating that this game is "too short", may be correct. But with so little variation with Gameplay, AND a lack-luster story, I'd have to say it's a little too long.\n\nPros:\nThe universe is nice and well brought out by its use of graphics and sound / music.\nGreat ideas put on the table.\nNice bits of humor\n\nCons;\nAdventure sections too dark and sometimes difficult to navigate\nLacking gameplay and depth, game gets old very quickly.\n\nOverall;\nI give this a very average 50-60%\n\nIt feels that with all of the great ideas that were put onto the table, about half of the potential was made. I'm not sure if it was a rushed project or anything, as the music and sound was perfect, but it would be nice to see what would have happened if the developer had gone the extra mile.\n\nAs it is, I can only recommend this game for younger gamers who you'd like to introduce the RPG genre- outside the world of Pokemon","March 29, 2014","false","7.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

And I'm recommending it on that behalf, If you are a hardcore gamer THIS GAME ISN'T FOR YOU.\n\nStory (8/10)\nThe story isn't bad for a children game, but it's a bit lame for older audience. A kid saves his sibling on Halloween night. a bit long and unrealistic (for one night), but it's fiction, so who cares.\nAs an adult I liked the story at the beginning, but for a game meant for children it wasn't that simply put and the lack of audio narration makes a barrier between the child and the story.\n\nSounds (6/10)\nThis is one of the worst aspects of the game, and the reason for that is the lack of narration or sounding for the characters.\nIn a game heavily based on story with a lot of dialogues, FOR CHILDREN I think that is a huge problem. What takes me 7 secs to read might take a child 1-2 mins to read, and that's a deal breaker.\nOther than that, the game has good in-game music, and atmospheric music when entering some danger zones made a good time for me, and I think will more for a child.\n\nGraphics (8/10)\nFor a casual children game, the graphics are very good, I won't say they are mind blowing ones, but they are colourful enough to catch children's eyes, and decent enough for this type of games.\n\nGameplay (8.5/10)\nI think the most interesting aspect of thi game -for children- is the gameplay. It's way complicated than the ordinary children game, but it's way simpler than a MOBA or RPG. I think this game might be a nice introduction for children to use controller (I haven't used one to test it to be honest). Also there's a lot of side objectives those are pretty interesting and the different interactions between different costumes (although it's not that great of a deal) may be one of the most challenging aspects for children.\nIf I have a kid and I want him/her to start hardcore gaming this is where I might start.\nBUT... it's so repetitive in fights that for a hardcore gamer it'll be extremely lame. so be aware of that.\n\nOverall (7.8/10)\nIf you are getting this game for a kid, I think it's a good gift, just be aware of the repetitiveness of it. And the kid may suffer because of the dialogue if the kid reads slowly. Other than that, the game is good. It has sequel that I haven't played so I don't know how much it has improved, but I hope they have fixed the issues I mentioned.\nI'll definitly recommend it for a child.\n\nP.S. I say this again... If you are hardcore gamer that only enjoys AAA games you shouldn't even consider this one....","December 4, 2015","true","11.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The gameplay is smooth, graphics are clean, and the sound effects are pretty good too. The story is scripted with simplicity but is loaded with mildly witty humor, which I enjoyed. I found the battles to be somewhat repetitive at first, but the costume choices and battle stamps collected throughout the game made it all better. It took me about 9 hours to collect every item and finish every mission in both Costume Quest and Grubbins on Ice (part 2).

If those terms sound difficult to comprehend and you cannot understand why they should be the primary targets, you might be more at home with some lighter strategy games.","December 30, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","7","14","4","0"

It's devoid of pretty much any interesting game system. The slim turn-based combat system present is similar to the Final Fantasy games, but you'll get more depth out of Final Fantasy games or 99% of their copycats. All of the combat uses Quick Time Events as well, which gets old after the second or third combat encounter. Game balance is simple and a little skewed. The game can be difficult (but hardly) when you only have two party members, and its trivially easy once you have three.\n\nThe overworld is linear. There's a tiny bit of exploration to be had, but not much. There are roughly four quests in the entire game, each repeated several times for each phase of the game: find a card off a monster (combat encounters), bob for apples (simple mini-game), trick or treat houses (random combat encounters), and find six hiding kids (semi-hidden on overworld).\n\nThe game crashed a few times, and since there is no manual save feature at any time, I lost 15-20 minutes of progress each time. The game plays the same every time.\n\nThere are costumes to get, which are your battle suits or "classes". Variation here is only relevant in the costume's "special ability" but the game is so easy that once you have three party members, battle strategy matters little.\n\nGraphics meh, sound meh, witty dialogue is OK but not astounding. No voice acting.\n\nI don't recommend this game. You can find much better games in all of its genres for cheaper.  If you insist on wanting it, it's worth $2-3 on a sale perhaps. My playtime says 16 hours but that included a long idling session by accident. It's a 5-7 hour game.\n\nI'm surprised this game has a sequel. It's popularity seems dependent on the Double Fine brand, which hasn't been the same for me since Spacebase DF and the Broken Age Kickstarter mishandlings.","August 12, 2015","false","15.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It lack any real depth.  Combat gets stale very very quickly. Story is just mediocre, tried-and-true.\n\nItems, a staple in any RPG, for whatever reason is omitted, where Double Fine could have added some 'tongue-in-cheek' elements. The only faint sense of utility or customizations is from the 'Battle Stamps", which are 'added bonuses' like an extra skill or stats, which seemed meaningless other than the counter-strike or stun skill -- the only one which would give me a chance in battle.\n\nThe costumes did not offer any stat changes other than the obvious battle mechanic changes. Personally, I was expecting the 'knight' to have a more 'tank-like' role in addition to the 'shield' ability like More HP and lower attack. I'm expecting some differences.\n\nYou can find yourself very easily overwhelmed in a 2v3 battle with no 'usual' / 'crutch' mechanic to swing the battle in your favor like Items or some OP one-time use ability. Instead you are greeted with persistent in battle costumes (which could have been changed like that of FFX-2 dynamic) and 1 every three turns "super-skill" that aligns with the costume chosen. Oh, and the battles consist of you pressing a button to do more dmg or take less damage.\n\nI got as far as the mall and just couldnt careless. The story is unique-ish, but the gameplay is just boring and rather... lame.","October 30, 2015","false","1.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

It is a charming little game with really great graphic design and a good turn based rpg combat system like Final Fantasy style. You go around a town map doing quests and it is so far a lot of fun. Double Fine ♥♥♥♥ed up Iron Brigade bad which was really unfortunate, but they have a gem on their hands here with this game. The huge flaws in this game though is that it is very short (I beat the main game + the dlc in 7 hours), there is no replay value: once you beat it there is no reason to ever play it again, and it could also be more difficult. One of my favorite short playthroughs that I have played in a long time. I don't know why exactly but it just strikes a chord with me and I love it. I think because it reminds me of one of my favorite games of all time, Earthbound on the Super Nintendo. A very good game, just way too short.

So Costume Quest is a Action RPG with a nice concept on it.\n\nAs you guys already figure it this game takes place on Halloween, where two siblings, Reynold and Wren, will go ask for candies. The player at this point will choose which sibling to play as. One of the siblings will be kidnapped - depend what siblings you choose - and our missions is to find out her he/she is. During our mission, we will make some quest, and personally this was the worst part for me, because the quest are always the same. Costume Quest has 3 levels, the neighborhood, the mall and a carnival, and on all level the quest are the same, go ask for candy, do eat apple game, find some cards, get the costumes, find kids playing hide-and-seek, same thing happens on the DLC despite the level design is different.\n\nBut if you put that behind your backs the game is really enjoyable, the game's graphics are a cartoonish style - thing that i love - and are well designed and very colorful, Costume Quest is more than colorful, is nice piece of art! The neighborhood and the others locations can make ous dive on feeling, is like we are on Halloween. And since is a Halloween Theme we will have lot of costumes to wear.\n\nNow to get the costumes you need to, get three different materials. When we get the costumes, besides changing our appearance we can go through places we didn't can before and will also gives special skills to use in battles. This battles can arise in two different ways, when you are searching for candy's or on street when you find a troll. When such things happens the scenario will completely change and your suit power will be activated, the battle style is a turn-based + quick time events.  When you do three attacks you will have a change to make the special attack, that can be a offensive or defense move. The special attack will be different according to the suit you are wearing.\n\nSince this is a RPG make sence we get XP for doing things, well when you complete the quest, defeat the trolls you will get some XP that will raise your level as well your defenses and your attack. Besides, you can buy in-game booster to help raise your attack and defense, although this is not very important because your enemies don't give a strong fight.\n\nAlthough this is a soundless game, contains a decent amount of humor there, some nice jokes and the dialogues between the characters is funny to read too. Costume Quest really grabbed me from the moment i installed, so is totally recommend!\n\n~ 8/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 15, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/recommended/115100/","ahoopyfrood","AHoopyFrood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/","366 products in account","Costume Quest is a charming, fun take on the turn based RPG genre. Sort of condensed. Instead of individually swapping weapons, spells, attacks, and actions you choose costumes that change your appearance, battle abilities and attacks, and help solve free roam puzzles with various actions. On top of that you can choose one additional action or buff for each character and swap them as you choose. Instead of finding and swapping party members you can instead choose their costumes. It really is sort of a "My First RPG", which may sound dull to an adult but it works well enough to engage. My one issue with this system is that there wasn't enough difference between the costumes to incentivise change. You are forced to change to solve some puzzles but I would always switch back before a battle. The battle system is turned based and pretty simple with only a few options each turn. This style lends itself to a little repetition but I tended to enjoy them since they typically don't drag on. One twist (Maybe, I don't play a lot of turn based RPGs) is that to land more powerful attacks you have to complete a QTE. There are several variations but each attack only has one. Things like press at a certain time, wiggle a stick, or repeatedly tap a button. Personally I didn't find that it detracted from the experience and actually makes sure you're paying attention to the battle and lets you contribute in some way. In true Double Fine fashion the writing (literally because there is no voice acting. Not a problem, just a statement) is top notch. Funny, witty, and endearing with jokes for both adults and children. Don't write off Costume Quest because of its apparently juvenile theme, you'd be missing out. It's fun, funny, and really is a nice departure from what you've probably played last. It doesn't over stay it's welcome and is well worth your time.","December 5, 2013","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Costume Quest is a turn-based RPG by Double Fine. You play as a child on Halloween night in search of your twin sibling.\n\nI’d recommend this game to everyone who’s mature enough to look at it for the first five minutes and dismiss it as a children’s game. The story, while well written is fairly predictable, and the grinding towards the end really detracts from the experience.

When looking at some pictures, I wasn't expecting much, but was surprised by it. This game has what you can expect from Double Fine, very funny and well written dialogue, fun combat system and a nice world to explore. The biggest flaw of this game, is it's length and scope. It's a short game. But the 6-8 hours it will take you to complete it, will be fully enjoyed. The story, although quite simplistic, is fun and entertaining. The combat system is  very nice, it's a JRPG turn based system with some quick time events thrown in between. When you enter battle, you'll transform into the costume you're wearing, so if you're using a cardboard robot costume, in battle you turn into a full laser shooting robot. The game has a lot of costumes and all of them very different from each other so you'll have to consider what costumes are best for each character and each situation. To add even more diversity, you have battle stamps to collect and use. These give some additional passive abilities, and make a lot of difference in combat. The game has a very simple level system and currency (candy). You can use candy to buy some upgrades and stamps to further develop your character. All in all, this is a very good bur short RPG, and I recommend it to everyone who likes the genre.","November 29, 2013","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is quite original, as is the trademark of Tim Schafer and the great Double Fine Productions, and offers a mixture of RPG and Adventure quite unseen in all the role-playing games I have played so far. A possible problem is that it merely brushes the surface of the genre and never goes in-depth. Don't expect neat level up and careful customization of your party, Costume Quest need to be played for the taste of its storyline, full of humor and for the cool gust it blows on a game market filled with clones.\nI also continued to play this game for its atmosphere, despite the repetition and the boredom that may occur after the too many similar moments of gameplay: the combat system barely evolves throughout the (short) story and the items hunts sometimes break the rhythm.\nTo conclude, I would recommend it only to those who are ok with playing a game for its particular taste and the polish of its storyline rather than for the mechanics of its gameplay. Once again, Costume Quest is a very short game (I maxed it out in less than seven hours) but it is definitely a great pick for those who are looking for a bit share of originality .\n","November 27, 2013","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It doesn't have quite as much humor as Psychonauts, but it does have some, including a number of sly references to other works of fiction.  The costumes all have pretty cool battle animations, even some that I didn't expect.  There aren't any bad costumes, either.  They are all useful in one way or another.

You press a button and maybe time another button press or whatever on screen command is to do your one attack. After enough basic attacks you get a special move with a bigger effect. Thats it, each charecter can wear any costume in the game so there is slight variety but every costume boils down to the same strategy.\n\nThe mini games are nice at first. You trick or treat door to door and get either candy or a random encounter. There are children playing hide and seek to find. Stamps to collect new costumes to assemble. And theres bobbing for apples which is terrible. The biggest problem is that throught the levels you just play the same minigames over and over again. There may be some new puzzles each level but it always breaks down to the same basic thing.\n\nI wouldnt say Costume Quest is bad, just merely mediocre. If youve played a lot of games then there isnt much here for you, as plenty of other games can acomplish the same thing in a much more satisfying way.","October 11, 2015","false","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The visional style fits very well with the game. The game has some fun characters too.\n\nWhat I don't like with the game is that it is extremely repetitive. The first area you are in was pretty fun. But it feels like the game might as well has ended there. Because you then get to another area where you have basically the same quests again, just at a different location. The quests aren't very fun either. The combat is very repetitive because only have one normal attack and a special attack that you get after two attacks. So every fight is: regular attack which follows with a quick time event to get the maximum damage out of your attack, do this for every character. Then quick time event to reduce damage from the enemy. Then repeat this to get special attack, do special attack. if the enemy isn't dead do it again.\n\nThe concept for the game is very good. It could have been an awesome game. But sadly it's too repetitive and it kind of falls flat. Even though the game is very short is feels far to long for what the actual content of the game. It feels like they made the game longer by just using the same quest again with a new background texture.","February 27, 2014","false","3.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Similarly to Psychonauts and Brutal legend this game features collectibles, however unlike these 2 games - collectibles are not a side-quest but are the main quest of the game and you cannot proceed until you have searched every last corners for those collectibles.

Every time I start thinking of going back to console gaming these bundles and steam sales just drag me right back in the glorious world of PC gaming and the silly and serious experiences it has to offer.\n\nCostume Quest is a game that I read and saw a decent amount of before I played it from the various videogame news sites that I follow. As a result I went into the game with a certain amount of expectations which were not entirely met if I am being honest.\n\nCostume Quest is a pretty mediocre game. Its definitely not bad, but its not that good either. If you are hoping to find a game that can be used as an eight to ten hour distraction then you should be fine getting Costume Quest. If you want something that is more than a distraction then you need to look elsewhere. Because while this game has a lot of charm, its very superficial in some major parts of its design leaving the experience of playing this game feeling boring and repetitive in more than one instance. This is something I feel pretty strongly about, to that point that I'm not looking forward to the sequel that Double Fine recently announced. Unless there are some major changes being made to the gameplay aspect of the game which I don't think is going to happen to be honest.\n\nIf you feel like reading a more detailed review you can find it here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/06/costume-quest.html.","July 14, 2014","false","8.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

That's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my honest opinion. Why you would try to make an exact clone of the last game and try to pass it off as dlc/expansion is unforgivable.

It is a quirky kind of RPG yet it does not fully present itself as an RPG, you can roam around and complete quest without even looking at your quest log. It's battles are fun and attacks involve timing and require you to think fast on which key to press when blocking attacks.

I try to host a Halloween party every year.\n\nI got this game because I was hoping that there would be the same level of dialouge and characters as in Psychonauts. It's not.\n\nIt's a very, very simplistic game, with choose a button and some QTE stuff. The costumes change things a bit, but anyone who has played any RPG type games at all can probably figure out the two damage dealers, one healer, or one tank, one damage, one healer, and not ever really need to switch costumes, besides to look at the different attacks.\n\nIt's not a bad game for kids at all. The writing is still decent, and some of the jokes were amusing, but as an adult fan of Doublefine who purchased it for myself, I feel let down. It's also a very short game. Again, one that would more appeal to a kid audience.\n\nThere IS a market for more adult-based Halloween costume style games out there that don't need horror or sex.

It's really good and well-thought-out that all the "important" conversations give me two options: 1) stare at text bubble long after im finished reading it or 2) skip entire conversation by pressing escape. I'm using sarcasm btw. I'm being sarcastic. I am utilizing a sarcastic tone to convey the opposite meaning of the literal definition of my words. In truth, the instant the last Steam Trading Card drops I'm going to be quitting and immediately deleting local content.\n\nIf the dialogue was at-all interesting maybe it'd be worth sitting still through the horribly-paced cutscenes, but every conversation is Nick Jr. level garbage, dripping with that awful, condescending slime of Idiotic Childrens' Programming for Idiotic Children. It's patronizing, unimaginatively hokey, constantly condescending and utterly unbearable.\n\nIt's also really insanely good that the unimportant "flavor" conversations CAN be skipped one bubble at a time, thus proving that the designers were capable of implementing this feature, but for whatever reason they then decided all the Extremely Important Cutscene Dialogue needed to be read at a speed of approximately one speech bubble every thirty seconds.\n\nAlso the overworld control is pretty clunky (with a strange "momentum pause" when switching directions 90 degrees at a time) - probably feels a lot better on a controller, but WASD for life. Thankfully I'm probably not going to end up being horribly horribly frustrated by it because I don't plan on actually playing this game.\n\nThe battles are moderately cool I guess if you're into Final Fantasy and/or QTE-styled fights (press key to select thing, press key when slider is in the sweet spot to do thing) and maybe the costume mechanics are good, maybe they're terrible, I'm unfortunately never going to find out because every two minutes I'm interrupted by a cutscene that I end up completely skipping once my patience runs out, so I end up further and further separated from the most "important" plot elements or story goals or whatever these cutscenes are intended to convey.\n\nIn the interests of pointing out the positives: The graphics are very nice and colorful, and since there's no voice-acting there's no terrible voice-acting to either disable or bîtch about the inability to disable.\n\nRecommended for slow readers, fans of terrible cinematic pacing, and lobotomy patients.","December 4, 2013","false","2.5"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","3"

Appropriate since both this and Stacking was written in either 2 weeks or 4 weeks (I forgot the story) as part of a company creativity exercise.\n\nIt's really a shame that EA and LucasArts are such inept pieces of ♥♥♥♥ that they didn't capitalize on Double Fine during this period and allow them creative freedoms or the sequel to this would have came out much earlier and a Psychonauts sequel might actually exist. But oh well, great game overall and much of what I said about Stacking can be applied here.

It has a great idea, nice presentation, and tedious, repetitive gameplay where you do the same thing over and over again until the designers thought it was long enough to satisfy the minimum game length people want. SomehowCostume Quest manages to distill and concentrate the absolute worst elements of JRPG design into a seemingly endless grind mitigated a little by the cute plot and presentation.\n\nThe basic idea is that you have a Final Fantasy style RPG where the protagonists are children on haloween and classes are replaced by costumes, each with their own special abilities. This is, on the face of it, a brilliant idea. The problem is the game consist mostly of combat, and you are actually required to fight most of the enemies in order to proceed, against a small number of enemies, using a tiny number of attacks that you use over and over again. Worse, the attacks also incorporate a timing minigame, so you can't even get through the grind it by hammering the attack button while you read a book or something, because you have to pay attention to the events in the game in order to get the timing right.\n\n","December 11, 2014","false","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Adding an achievement that is a pure gimmick like to "Play Costume Quest on Christmas" (which has a a description that in the first place is ambiguous to people in other countries that celebrate more on the 24th), and which siad gimmick achievement prevents people from 100%ing the game is a slap in the face.  Many people on Mac and Linux systems are discussing this today and on Community guides so this is not an isolated occurance.  An achievement that is ostensibly only available one day in a year being broken on that day is unacceptable.  There are also reports that this has been a bug since 2012 and still hasn't been fixed.\nThe game is released for Mac, Linux, and PC, DF devs... you don't get to support them unequally and not get called on it.\n\nHaving steam link to the "game's website" and get a "server not found" error is a nice touch too.

The all around atmosphere still holds up well in the graphics, cute character design and the fitting soundtrack.\n\nThe costumes were fun, in both putting together via finding the necessary items and just plain seeing them in action during the turn-based battles, their own limit-attacks especially! When not fighting you spend your time searching for either candy, treasure-coffins, sidequests or the occasional minigame, all of which are also classic RPG features and were splendidly Halloween themed, but even during such short run some of them began feeling a bit repetitive. Trick-or-treating around the field was an exciting way to either treat yourself to most of your candy or get tricked into an enemy encounter!\n\nAll in all it doesn't take too much (or enough, more fittingly) of your time and is slightly flawed, but still had me and will surely have any other RPG and Halloween lover invested all the way!","July 9, 2014","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a combination of an adventure type and a rpg. It is Halloween and you choose to be one kid, brother or sister. The second one is kidnapped and your job is to rescue the other one. Somehow your halloween costume of a robot happens to turn into a real robot (only during the fights, but it's still awesome) so you can fight monsters that are stealing all the candies. The most incredible thing about that game is collecting and trying all the cool costumes. Fight is turn based,  "Final Fantasy"-like conected with a little bit of agility. For me the main con of that game is lack of talk, all the dialogues are silent, comic-like. But the game itself is humorous and fun to play.

Well, this game is kinda like that, only instead of playing as a plumber in a world made out of paper, you play a child during Halloween with an overactive imagination.. Or, is it in his/her mind? I suppose that is a mystery for yourself to solve.\n\nCostume Quest is a charming, yet sadly short, turn-based RPG with an amusing story about two siblings who used to bicker with each other on a daily basis.. Until one of  them gets kidnapped, leading the other on a quest to get their sibling back, and in the process making new friends as well as learning to get along with the sibling they once disliked.\n\nAs I said, the game is kinda like Paper Mario, where there are no random battles, and combat is based on timing button presses to get the highest damage as well as reduce incoming damage. What makes it different is the game's main gimmic: Costumes.\n\nThere is a decent selection of outfits one can aquire throughout the game, some earned during the story, others by completing optional quests. Depending on the costume you and your friends wear, it'll affect how fights play out. The costume YOU wear is also important, because some outfits have abilities that'll allow you to progress or make your game easier (Such as lighting up dark paths or sneaking around in plain sight).\n\nOf course, this game isn't just about costumes, but also trick or treating. In each chapter, you will be required to do some trick or treating in order to unlock gates. This is a rather amusing system, because behind each door lies a, of course, a trick or treat. If it is a treat, you get some free candy, which can be used to buy upgrades and abilites that can allow you to customise your style of play beyond just what costume you prefer to main. However, if you stumble across a trick, you get tossed into a simple battle. Anyone who played Paper Mario probably has a good idea how these battles work for the most part. They are quite fun, but after awhile it does get repetitive due to the simple combat system. Doesn't mean it is boring, though, because some battles really are quite engaging (and in a few cases, really hard unless you make use of a certain outfit or stamp).\n\nAt first, combat is challenging and thrilling, but as you progress in the game, it does start to get a bit anti-climatic (At least, until near the end), where you are able to effortlessly mow down anyone who crosses your path. Doesn't help that the highest you can level is up to 10, which brings up another sad thing about this game: It is short....\n\nAt first, the game will seem quite epic, your expectations probably being that it'll be a decently sized venture.. But then you reach level 10, and discover that you cannot level any further.. it is at that point that you discover that the end is near, and when I discovered this, I was a bit disappointed... I had gotten so invested that I was sad my adventure was almost over. At least the game ended with a bang, and I liked that, but it left me wanting more. Thankfully, there is a bonus adventure for those willing to brave it that are not totally satisfied.\n\nIs this game worth checking out? I'd say so. Despite its flaws, it is a charming title that I am glad I had the pleasure to experience, even if it was a short one.","November 26, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Adding an achievement that is a pure gimmick like to "Play Costume Quest on Christmas" (which has a a description that in the first place is ambiguous to people in other countries that celebrate more on the 24th), and which siad gimmick achievement prevents people from 100%ing the game is a slap in the face.  Many people on Mac and Linux systems are discussing this today and on Community guides so this is not an isolated occurance.  An achievement that is ostensibly only available one day in a year being broken on that day is unacceptable.  There are also reports that this has been a bug since 2012 and still hasn't been fixed.\nThe game is released for Mac, Linux, and PC, DF devs... you don't get to support them unequally and not get called on it.\n\nHaving steam link to the "game's website" and get a "server not found" error is a nice touch too.

LIKE SUPER AWESOMLY AMAZING TRANSFORMING COSTUMES!? than Costume Quest is the game for you.\n\nCostume Quest is an adventure RPG game where 3 kids are on a quest to defeat an evil witch that wants to steal all the candy to take to an alternate dimension to feed a giant skeleton monster and claim her place in that realm.AND DID I MENTION SUPER AWESOMLY AMAZING TRANSFORMING COSTUMES!?\n\nOver the course of the game you travel through 3 different areas, meet 2 new party members, fight monsters, and collect candy to save your sister (or brother depending on what character you chose at the start) USING SUPER AWESOMLY AMAZING TRANSFORMING COSTUMES!\n\nNow I am sure you are wondering about these costumes, scattered through the game are costume patters and peices and after you collect the costume pattern and all three peices of the costume you can craft it and put it on to use it in battle. When in battle you will transform into your costume (if you are dressed as a robot you will turn into a real fullsize giant robot). the battles are all about timing and pressing the right button at the right time, over 3 turns your special attack will charge up and they don't just do more damage but can do other things like shield or heal your team. Also some costumes have abilities out of battle that let you reach hidden areas or sneak past monsters.\n\nOther great features include awesome cartoon graphics and and the extra little story "Grubbins On Ice" where you help the monsters rebel against their evil leaders (P.S. I recommend playing Grubins On Ice after the main story).\n\nOverall even though it was annoying at times trying to avoid monsters (this is so much easier with the ninja costme) and beat bosses and it was a bit short, I loved this game and am super exited to play Costume Quest 2.\n8.5/10\n\n\n\n","October 31, 2014","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is quite easy, but I suppose it's because it's been made with children in mind (although some of the bosses are quite challenging). The characters and costumes are really charming, and each costume has a unique ability in exploration and combat. So even though the mechanics are quite simple, you can pull out some interesting combinations of costumes and battle stamps (they grant an extra active or passive ability to a party member).\nCostume Quest may feel short, but in my opinion, it's long enough to keep you interested (took me 9-10 hours to 100% it with the Grubbins on Ice DLC).

The all around atmosphere still holds up well in the graphics, cute character design and the fitting soundtrack.\n\nThe costumes were fun, in both putting together via finding the necessary items and just plain seeing them in action during the turn-based battles, their own limit-attacks especially! When not fighting you spend your time searching for either candy, treasure-coffins, sidequests or the occasional minigame, all of which are also classic RPG features and were splendidly Halloween themed, but even during such short run some of them began feeling a bit repetitive. Trick-or-treating around the field was an exciting way to either treat yourself to most of your candy or get tricked into an enemy encounter!\n\nAll in all it doesn't take too much (or enough, more fittingly) of your time and is slightly flawed, but still had me and will surely have any other RPG and Halloween lover invested all the way!","July 9, 2014","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not very surprising, since the company is known for making pretty fun games. Costume Quest uses a simple turn-based RPG battle system, so there isn't really any kind of learning curve to it. The story is pretty simple and not deep, but the characters are likeable. The costumes you wear decide what you fight as and what attack and special ability you have. It can be pretty fun to mess around and decide what the best team to use is. The game isn't really hard, but if you don't have a good team set up, it can be easy to lose. Even if you lose, there is no penalty or anything of that sort, which is sort of nice. If your a fan of simple turn-based RPGs, I fully recommend you try this game.

Unfortunately, it also has one of the worst battle systems ever. Although you can change costumes (effectively classes) outside of battle, once one starts you're stuck with what you went in wearing. And that's where the problem begins. Each class only has one attack and a timed special ability, none of which are particularly interesting. Worse, because there are only two costumes in the game with healing abilities, every battle had to be designed around the possibility that the player would be totally unable to heal. The end result is that every battle is exactly the same thing whether you're fighting a boss or a basic encounter. They tried to add a bit of variation with equippable Battle Stamps. Unfortunately, you're limited to one per character, can't change in battle, and some of them are objectively better than others. They don't solve the problem.\n\nIf you're willing to put up with the awful battles for fantastic writing and some unique scenarios, it's worth the sale price of $5. I'd struggle to recommend it at much higher of a price, unfortunately, because this is a game that hits its peak early. It's a fantastic first 90 minutes, a pretty good second 90 minutes, and a third that I didn't finish because it had become primarily battles rather than laughs.\n\nMinor note: This game has terrible mouse acceleration that can't be turned off.

Charming.\nCostume quest is a turn-based RTS at heart and enjoyable from start to end. I honestly can't think of any con except maybe the low difficulty.\nCostume Quest comes with achievements, collectibles, spells, monsters,costumes, bosses. What else does a game need in the end?\nAlso comes with a free DLC and the promise for more and while not trying to spoil the end, it does offer an opening for future development.\nMy advice, get it, buy it, play it.

I was very impressed despite the cartoon graphics and weird story. Controls & combat are simple and straight forward but the abundance of costumes adds a lot of variety. Definitely has some good humor and is still safe for kids.\n\nHighly recommend using a controller but it has to be Xinput or you need to use x360ce.

Although it took an extra year to get it from the consoles to the PC, I don't think anything was lost in the transition. Heck, it comes with the DLC, too!\n\nGameplay's kind of a little repetative; you trick or treat, you kill some Gomoblins, do some puzzlin' here and there, sometimes there's a boss fight. There isn't much to break up the formula, but it works well enough on its own.\n\nWhat stood out to me was how charming the game itself is. It's very much a trip back to childhood, with memories of homemade box robots or giant-headed felt unicorns. It's really cute and to me one of it's big selling points.\n\nIf you have any sort of childhood nostalgia, this will be a game for you.","December 27, 2011","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The objective of the game is to go to each area, collect candy as well as costumes (hence the name costume quest) and fight any monsters that cross your path.\n\nThe game style is turn based combat with each costume giving you a different ability, and different quicktime event-like buttons to press to do more damage. The one little problem I have with the game is the fact that the (spoiler alert) French Fry and Vampire costume quicktime event/button press can prompt you to mash the shift key. On Windows, this is a little bit of a nuisance, as the game will minimize and ask if you want to turn sticky keys on. It isn't that big of a deal however, due to the fact that it's a turn based game.\n\nThe game is not too much of a challenge if you can find the right combinations of costumes and battle stamps with which to fight the enemies. One can easily finish all of the quests simply by playing the game and not going too far out of the way to complete objectives.\n\nThe characters are lovable (even the grubbins), the style is pretty cool, and the story, while not too exciting, is fun.\n\nI would reccomend trying it out.","November 8, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are cute and the premise is great but it really didn't live up to expectations.\n\nFor starters, I had hoped a game from Double Fine would not rely on repetition quite so much to bulk out an already short game. The main story has only four enemy types, repeated with three different skins, at least two of the costumes are identical in attacks and powers and each of the levels has exactly the same set of quests - bob for apples, find the hide and seekers, unlock a door by collecting something.\n\nThat would have been fine if it was as fun to play the game as it was to follow the short story but there is virtually no challenge. Other than dying from missing one too many quicktime presses, it is near impossible to lose a fight and even when you do, your characters appear unscathed where you left them, without even a loss of candy. I was bored by the end and was thankful for the incredibly short playtime.","November 8, 2015","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its Halloween and hi-jinks are afoot, you play a group of kids out to rescue the main characters sibling who has been captured by an evil witch. Combat is of the turn based variety you are used to seeing in Japanese Style RPG's, your party on one side and the enemy on the other. Hey, come back here, its not dull at all, you see, the kids you have in your party? They can transform into the costumes they are wearing, dressed as a knight? Bam you are a knight in shining armour dealing blows with your sword. Dressed as a robot? Suddenly you are as huge as Voltron and dealing some serious harm. Its the kind of wish fulfilment any kid has when they dressed up as a kid and Double Fine tap into that nostalgic vibe with their usual charm and whimsy. If I have a complaint its minor and its simply that the combat can get a little repetetive, but thats more a flaw in the nature of this style of combat than any glaring fault on Double Fine's part. That little gripe aside, the humour and tongue in cheek Halloween take make this another good addition to Double Fine's stable. That said, pick Iron Brigade or Stacking first if your Double Fine collection is lacking those, this is a fine game but those are musts.","September 3, 2012","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This absolutely adorable games leads you on an adventure to save your sibling from monsters. Collect gross treats, buy powerups with candy, and change out your team's costumes for special abilities.\n\nHowever, there are faults. The game does get tediously repetitive after about an hour in. With about four different areas, you are performing the same side quests every time and battling similar monsters in a different arena. With the amount of constant battling, I wish combat would be a bit more interesting but unfortunately it just got painfully boring after a while and became a chore. The only redeeming factor of battles is the cutscenes when performing a special ability relative to the costumes your team is wearing. The design of costumes in battle was really well done and unique. Gaining new costumes to see in game was the only thing keeping me going after about 5 battles.\n\nAll the faults and boredom aside, it's still a cute and fun game that's definitely worth the sale price!

The banter reminds me of old Cartoon Network shows like Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory. It pretty much carried the game for me.\n\nThe gameplay itself is familiar from Chrono Triggers and Final Fantasies. Turn-based hit point reduction. I don't see anyone who has played a turn-based game being challenged by the combat.\n\nBut in the end, the game is clearly developed for children. And unlike most children's games, this one has intelligence and wit behind it.

Not very surprising, since the company is known for making pretty fun games. Costume Quest uses a simple turn-based RPG battle system, so there isn't really any kind of learning curve to it. The story is pretty simple and not deep, but the characters are likeable. The costumes you wear decide what you fight as and what attack and special ability you have. It can be pretty fun to mess around and decide what the best team to use is. The game isn't really hard, but if you don't have a good team set up, it can be easy to lose. Even if you lose, there is no penalty or anything of that sort, which is sort of nice. If your a fan of simple turn-based RPGs, I fully recommend you try this game. (Note: If you aren't very good with quick time events using keyboard butons, I fully recommend you use a controller, preferably an Xbox 360 controller.)","May 19, 2013","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If a monster opens a door you will engage in a random turn-based battle where your costume powers will come in handy.\n\nOn your quest you will meet other trick-or-treaters and pick up more followers for your search party. Collect candy from trash bags and smashed pumpkins which can be used to purchase perks in monster battles. Complete mini-quests to earn experience so you can level up. Do classic Halloween activities, like bob for apples and compete in a costume contest. Collect Creepy Treat trading cards and materials to unlock more costumes that have special abilities.\n\nIt's a unique blend of rpg-ing and casual gameplay that perfectly captures the spirit of Halloween.

It's rather fun and just enough challenging to make you think a little without being realy hard or trying.\n\nThe main game has all sorts of chances for achievements and the costumes you aquire are really neat.\n\nI enjoy the battle system.  It's a straight forward turn-based system, very old school RPG.  There's a little strategy involved, deciding what costume to wear and some are on by necessity along with what 'battle stamp' to use.\n\nIt's also nice that losing in a battle kicks you out of the battle, you're not 'dead' and go back to a previous point.\n\nOnly exception to this are boss battles but they point they send you is more to give you a chance to rethink your costume and stamp combos more than making you re-play levels.\n\nMy only real frusrtation is the graphics.  While fun and interesting, the level of detail lags my computer like crazy.

It streamlines the RPG experience with a simpler exploration feel that keeps the user involved until the end.  The biggest drawbacks are the repetive, three button combat and length.  Sadly, you can 100% this game in less than 8 hours if you care to.  What it DOES provide though, is a unique take on a RPG system that does not really require grinding.  The game does a great job of facilitating just enough combat to keep you at the appropriate level without the need to do extra legwork.  All in all, I'd give it 4/5, and a high recommendation.","January 8, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The RPG combat is kinda like Paper Mario, in that you do QTEs to deal more damage. However, you usually only have the option to do a basic attack until your special is charged up (always after 3 turns) or you have a special stamp equipped. There are about ten costumes in both the normal game and the DLC, and only about half of them are worth using in combat compared to the others.\n\nOutside of combat, there are four enviroments to explore and solve puzzles in using costume abilities. You can hit basically anyone and anything with your candy pail, which is amusing. The dialogue isn't laugh out loud funny, but I smiled from time to time.\n\nThe game really shines graphically. The characters are cute, the environments are given a lot of detail, and the battles look amazing. It's all very colorful. Music is average, however.\n\nAll in all, playing this game is like playing a cartoon from Cartoon Network long ago.

See Double Fine continues to make good games, something few companies can do, much like RareWare in the 1990's, Tim Schafer's Double Fine seems to be dishing out game after game of quality. He is of course well known to the people who have heard of him, but that is shockingly few people. His games like Grim Fandango, and Phychonauts are glimmering underappreciated diamonds, and his lastest game Costume Quest does nothing to tarnish that reputation.\n\nNow why do I compare Double Fine to Rare? Easy, they both made a multitude of games that made them very popular, Double Fines biggest issue is it is still the unknown company, thier games come out, they look cool to some people, I play them, love them, then I tell other people how good they are for just being 20 bucks or less, then no one plays them. But I hold no resentment towards those people because I grew up with with Tim at my side, a man that made good games, I do hope that someday I can say 'Hey, you know that game that everyone likes that just came out, try this it's made by the same guys.' Then we get people playing Double Fines old catalog of games.\n\nBut about Costume Quest, it's good, it's charming, it has a few pop culture references, most don't seem out of place unless you know them. But the big thing is, it shows that Double Fine can make a decent Role Playing Game. Now don't get me wrong it's not as in depth as some major RPG's, but it does what you want it to do. There are no voices, just text, which is fine, the dialouge makes me chuckle, and brings out the little things in characters. It's just enough exploration, it is a little limiting, but it cuts down on annoying long term searches, and overall the game keeps at a fairly difficult stance.\n\nSee it's these types of games that I like to see game companies make, they normally make puzzle games or platformers, but then they release an explore centered RPG and then it's actually good. That is what I like to see, I like to see companies improve and expand thier game base with more than platformers, because really I will lose intrest eventually, but it is safe to say Double Fine is keeping another fan interested and excited for the future.","March 15, 2013","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a combination of an adventure type and a rpg. It is Halloween and you choose to be one kid, brother or sister. The second one is kidnapped and your job is to rescue the other one. Somehow your halloween costume of a robot happens to turn into a real robot (only during the fights, but it's still awesome) so you can fight monsters that are stealing all the candies. The most incredible thing about that game is collecting and trying all the cool costumes. Fight is turn based,  "Final Fantasy"-like conected with a little bit of agility. For me the main con of that game is lack of talk, all the dialogues are silent, comic-like. But the game itself is humorous and fun to play.

Probably more geared toward a younger audience with it's simplicity, but as a gamer that grew up on turn-based RPGs, I can still respect the game for what the devs pulled off.  I loved the concept of the costume battles, and it was very well executed.\n\nIf you're a hardcore RPG gamer, don't go into this one with high expectations of challenging combat or a deep skill tree.  Definitely a great "intro to RPG" game for the youngins :P","June 27, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I put in around 11 hours into this game and it's expansion. The theme and mechanics of the game fit together perfectly but I can see how it might get repetitive and dull for other players. There is a pretty steep difficulty curve later in the game if you don't take a well rounded party. Don't just take my word for it, I might be biased because I feel Double Fine can do not wrong but I would give this game a solid 9/10.","June 27, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It streamlines the RPG experience with a simpler exploration feel that keeps the user involved until the end.  The biggest drawbacks are the repetive, three button combat and length.  Sadly, you can 100% this game in less than 8 hours if you care to.  What it DOES provide though, is a unique take on a RPG system that does not really require grinding.  The game does a great job of facilitating just enough combat to keep you at the appropriate level without the need to do extra legwork.
