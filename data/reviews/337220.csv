While I will insist that the concept is pretty good and can work to become a very good game, full of interesting interactions, intrigue, and many enjoyable hours, this is not the game that will do justice to the concept of managing an adventurer's guild.\n\nWhile the graphics are pretty good looking, and I am a sucker for isometric stuff that also manages to look pretty decent, there are a few too many problems with this game to make it worth spending time, money, and effort on. To continue on with graphics, your entire gameplay area is your guild hall. No, you can not build the building itself, you only have the rooms there which you can fill up in different, but still pre-determined ways.  Characters do not move around in your guild either, they merely teleport to their destination. You can not zoom out to see your entire guild hall at once, and to find anyone in it is a pain due to how close the camera is. This is less about being a guild commander, and more about being the guy who rents a pre-made guild house and then just waits for something to happen.\n\nIn short, there is no interaction.\nYou can send out your adventurers to other regions, but at no point are you shown any of this. You do not even have a map of the place, and the explanation on how to do things has basically shown you the entire game. There is only so long that you can look at a building in which nothing changes before you become bored, and while the vaguely humourous adventurer names and tooltips help you dull the monotony of not doing anything, they do not solve the problem.\nI was reminded of Progressquest, the game about waiting. Except in this game your adventurers do not even level up. Aside from their equipment, nothing about them changes.\n\nThe list of things that could have gone so much better just goes on and on. Equipment is useless, especially if you consider making some yourself. You have no control over your adventurers aside from sending them out once or twice a month, and even that takes 3 or more clicks if you want to send them to some place that can actually use them. Adventurer's stats recover both too fast and too slow, depending on the situation, and it overall just lacks gameplay.\nThis is more of a waiting game, or perhaps an interactive screensaver, which requires that you keep clicking it or it will give you a gameover.\n\nInteresting concept, but sadly it is all just squandered potential. Guild Commander is not something I would recommend to anyone. Not to people who are fans of strategy, nor to simulation fans, and most certainly not to anyone who wants to build or be creative. This game does not offer that - though I am still not sure what it *does* offer.","January 24, 2015","false","2.4"," 68 of 77 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","68","77","2","0"

I was in no hurry to get back to the game.\n\nI'm at week 37 day 1. And all heroes maxxed out, so mutch gold i don't know what to do with it, so i haven't finished the game yet, and i don't know if i will. It seems it's just a waiting game at this point. Waiting for the last wave so the game can finaly end.\n\nI would not recomend this game if you want more then a couple hours of fun from it.\nSimple mechanics, provinces have different states. Your goal is to get them all to prosperous and survive a last wave that attacks a province i guess. (haven't finished yet)\n\nYou can upgrade your heroes by telling your blacksmith to craft weapons and armor, that you can equip on your heroes. And there is a genereal training for them aswell in a few steps that improves stats, not that mutch i maxxed out training in the first minutes of gameplay. The heroes have no exp, levels only items that improves stats.\n\nYou wait and send some heroes to provinces not nowing what you are doing in the beginning, and later you build a few trade guilds. The game gets easy with the cash flowing in, you start getting better eq for your heroes and after a while all is good. You sit around and wait and once in a while a province gets attacked. You send your heroes there by selecting locations in a drop down meny for each of the heroes you want to send. Then you can enjoy watching a green 3 digit number increase from a few hundred to 1000.\n\nRepeat watching the digit slowly increase, and click on all of the drop down boxes to send each individual hero, and thats the game.\n\nThe character depth is a few lines that heroes randomly say from time to time, most of the time, your heroes are represented by a digit next next to the province name. Mechanics are not that good, if you want to let your heroes chill at the base then all your healing facilities are occupied and the heroes you need to use will take ages to recover, so you are forced to send your hereos to provinces all the time to keep the guild empy for the ones that return and need healing.\n\nThe game needs more dept, it might be something you can play on your tablet while being forced to watch a bad movie or something. But i would not recomend a buy if you don't have the money to spare.","January 23, 2015","false","15.1"," 59 of 81 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","59","81","6","0"

It's a very unique management game that makes me recall the recent 'RPG Manager' except that this one is far more polished. The graphics are exceedingly pleasant to the eye, especially that of the 'Kitchen' and 'Mess Hall' which look outstanding when positioned next to each other. You manage the heroes and send them out to different provinces to adventure and bring back the loot which you use to pay wages and expenses. There is a small amount of micromanagement in terms of economics and producing items etc and the rooms you can build vary between about 8 or so different types so I assure you there is allot of replayability but the icing on the cake has to be the games sountrack which comprises of some well crafted middle ages folk music which I will have to aquire as background music for later DnD sessions with my mates.

That sums up the game in a nutshell, a resource management game which has been reduced to small simple task causing gameplay to become tedious in large portions and while you could say to take it in small steps, with playthroughs lasting for 2-3 hours it’s a hard game to come back to.\n\nIt suffers from limited options when it comes to what you can do for your heroes and the control you have over your guild. There are no internal guild strifes, no camaraderie between guild members and what you end up with is a blank slate of stats in which you push the square peg through the square hole to get the optimal result.\n\nIt also has a huge amount of RNG similar to something you’d see in a roguelike. The difference here being that you have so little control over your actions and because the RNG is non-reactable it causes more pain than it does pleasure, entire playthroughs can be ruined depending on where and when the calamities hit and the type of heroes your Guild can recruit.\n\nThe high points would include such things such as a good though generic graphical style and tooltips for everything so you’re never lost, though they get overshadowed by a repetitive experience which while unique isn’t as stimulating as I would have hoped for.\n\nIn a way it’s like a cake without flavour, it has the right stuff in it to make a suitable cake but lacks all the extra flavour that makes the cake stand out from the rest and making me come back for more. I just hope this style of game is expanded upon through this developer or another, management of people in a guild/fantasy setting is a game grouping we barely see and really has unlimited potential.","January 23, 2015","false","6.6"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","25","40","3","0"

Then, I stopped thinking about any RPG-Stuff and just focused on not loosing to much money. Also I sent my members to one province at a time until the enemies were defeated.\n\nAfter rescuing 2-3 provinces you should be out of trouble and might establish your first trade guild. Then it's just "repeat, repeat, repeat" and you will win the game.\n\nSadly you don't get enough explanation: how does equipment, armor, etc. "really" affect ... what exactly. Does it give you an extra on strength or health (you can't see a change in the bars of your characters). Does it help refreshing the skills? I don't know. Also: how do equipment, status of the province etc. effect the gold your members are making ... and so on. You have several ideas what might have an effect on something, but you don't know noting John Snow.\n\nConcering the gameplay experience: At first it's just stress and you are just clicking as fast as you can to send your members to the next province without any thinking (which is boring...). Then, after getting the heroic status and defeating enemies as soon as they appear, you are just waiting for something to happen and it is boring again. Now, I am waiting for the Necro Lord to attack, but I am under the impression that my stabilisation of the provinces was too good, as there is a 0.0% probability of a calamity and nothing happened for ~20-30 minutes. I reasearched everything, I recruited everybody, every province has maximum status and there is nothing much to do, except for sending 1 or 2 guys to every province every 2-4 minutes.\n\nI bought the game because I was somewhat curious. I expected nothing more than I finally got. The game isn't expensive and does not promise more than it will keep. If you don't mind to pay 5€ you might buy it and have a look at it, but if you  have to really think about which game you might afford and which not... just don't buy it.","January 26, 2015","false","4.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

You can construct rooms which, in turn, produce an imaginary resource (strength, energy, etc.) which is then distributed amongst all your guild members.  There are some other hidden mechanics not explained all that well and you'll probably fail horribly your first time out like I did.  Assuming the game takes two-three hours as advertised, I do believe $5 is a fair price to ask considering that some $60 FPS's feature 4-5 hour linear campaigns. Your guild hall will have the same layout from game to game, so there's not a lot of replayability (though I would probably still enjoy coming back anyway from time to time).  Had this game been any more than $5, I wouldn't have been able to recommend it.

If you want to challenge yourself with hard difficulty and such you will be looking at about 5-7 hours of gameplay which is about average for a 5-6 dollar game.\n\nThe game itself is mostly a strategic accounting style of guild management the little bit of voice work can be amusing at times and after losing your first few campaign attempts (you will lose your first few) it is satisfying enough to beat the game.\n\nThe only cons I would truely be throwing out on this game is your inability to control who you recruit (they just kind of show up and you take them or wait), your inability to remove people from your guild, and the time it takes to actually reach the last boss. The last about 15 minutes of the campaign waiting for the boss will mostly be pistol whipping people you are used to beating by that point while you build up your campaign meter. (Thankfully however there is a button recently put in to allow you to just attempt fighting the final boss...make sure you are ready!)\n\nAll in all I found this game to be enjoyable enough for the cost I am probably going to give it another playthrough on hard at a later date I would like to see more from it but it is at least worth the cost of admittance.","April 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here I didn't. Says something, at least for me.\n\nCONs\n- Lack of variety - it feels kind of repetitive to organize your heroes and thus makes the game very shallow\n- Becomes a drag after the early game - after you research everything and equip your heroes, you spend most of your time waiting for the next thing to happen. Which often felt to be too long.\n- The end - while I didn't expect much of a story (and didn't get one), the end was very... unsatisfying, especially after the long and forced wait until it actually triggered.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIt actually feels difficult to give a simple "yes or no" answer to the question whether I recommend this game.\nIt has its weaknesses. Annoying and very time-consuming weeknesses. It lacks depth in terms of content and possibilities. If you're into complex simulations, steer clear of this, you'd be disappointed.\nHowever, if you're looking for a quite entertaining simple little pastime in a unique setting, you'll probably get your money's worth. I feel like I did. That's why it gets a thumbs-up from me.\n","January 24, 2015","true","8.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

At first, when you aren't sure exactly what to do, this game is hard, way too hard, in a way that can only be attributed to sheer randomness. Sometimes you won't have any calamities, sometimes you will get a new calamity each day. Your soldiers regain stats far, far too slowly, and you just don't make enough money to support full room quality.\n\nBut then you play for a bit, get a handle on things, buy the (small quantity) of training and items, get all your heroes, and then.... nothing. There is nothing to do but sit around and wait. Wait for your heroes to come back, wait for the next calamity, wait for whatever brings the end of the game (I got bored and stopped waiting, honestly.)\n\nSo much potential in this premise, and this game has done nothing to reach for that potential. Why can't you customize heroes? Why are there no real animations? Why is there no story? Why is there no anything? Why does the gamer experience center around sitting back and twiddling your thumbs?\n\n","January 31, 2015","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unless a large DLC then I say charge 1/3 the price for it. This game though being fun can use some needed additions to gameplay.\n\nThe game can often be waiting doing nothing or throwing guild members at armies hoping to topple them. This works and with the addition of creating trade guilds, training, making items, and supporting local guilds it adds more layers and play. But sadly this all feeds back to improving the same aspect. In the future I would say the developer should look into board/card games like dominion for ideas to add more flair and possibly more mechanics to keep the player engaged without pushing them to hard. I would say the game reminds me of a board game, and even know it needs more content the price currently as of posting $5 is worth what you get currently and there will I hope be more to come.","March 28","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
