That said, it's got some very favorable and well written reviews thus far, so go check 'em out!\n\nTropico the first's a classic. Having been a huge fan of Sim City and Tropico games (SC4/2000 and original Tropico) for years, I keep coming back to those games at least once in a couple of years just for nostalgia's sake.\n\nTropico 1 possesses that unique charm that nearly all the other installations, sadly, lack, alongside with some great tongue-in-cheek humor. I can say with certainty however that Tropico 4 more than made up for it and it's probably the only game out of the entire franchise worth purchasing (besides the very first one of course), seeing as T3 is just a watered down version of T4. Trust me, if you just skip on T3 you won't be missing ANYTHING. Kalypso really dropped the ball on that one.\n\nSo if you're looking to jump into the franchise, I recommend starting with either the 1st or the 4th installation, or better yet both. If you just want a fancy looking and relatively new city-building game in the spirit of SimCity, Anno and Cities XL, just skip this bundle entirely and buy T4.\n\nLong story short: T1 started it all, T2 has pirates, T3 is an attempted but shallow reboot and T4 is an upgraded version of the previous game and what T3 should have been in the first place. Take your pick.","December 6, 2013","true","29.8"," 90 of 99 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","90","99","0","0"

I've been playing this game for many years and although it may be no where near as glossy as it's newer cousins in the series it still has a nice bit of depth to it, a superb soundtrack and a wicked sense of humour.\nI love this game.

I played the crap out of this game when I was a kid, and upon rediscovering it, proceeded to continue to play the crap out of it.  If you're unfamiliar, this is a simulation where you play a dictator of a small caribbean island.  The plots and themes are all very cliche'd, but humorously delivered by a suck-up lackey of yours, Penultimo ("the second to last," if you're keeping up with your spanish).  You can be kind or ruthless, out for a buck or for glory, but in the end, this is a solid, interesting game worthy, I think, of a modern gamer's time.  HOWEVER... if you have played the newest Tropico (4, at this point), I would not recommend this one to you.  The gameplay is more or less identical, but the options are significantly fewer and the graphics aren't remotely of the caliber of modern games. Additionally, it should be noted that this game relies very heavily on latino sterotypes, and while I (a Latin American History major, but with no soul) found it amusing, many of the japes could be found highly offensive.  So, in essence:\n\nRecommended for: players of strategy simulations, people who enjoy latin american history in a comical simulated retelling, or those who are interested to see how a game series has evolved from it's origins.\n\nNot recommended for:  Enthusiasts of the newest games, those demanding high quality graphics, or folk who will be easily offended by latino sterotypes.","January 12, 2014","true","41.9"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

Tropico allows you to unleash your inner dictator (of cause you can also lead you island in a fair and democratic way, but what’s the fun in that?). Tropico is an awesome game in the way it manages to capture that "el presidente"-feeling.\n\nThe game is really a sort of “Banana republics for dummies” in the way it quite humorously touches serious matters such as totalitarianism, corruption (for instance hinted through the role that the Swiss bank plays), election fraud, and the interventions the Cold War superpowers (the United States and Soviet Union).\n\nThe primary goal in Tropico is to stay in power! If you can manage this you’re on the right track. You can play a “Scenario” in which staying in power alone isn’t enough to grant you the victory. The scenarios will challenge different aspects of your leadership and somewhat improve your skills. If you don’t feel like play a scenario, the “Custom game”-mode allows you to set the goal and premises of the game.\n\nAll in all, it’s just a brilliant game! Great humour and the music is awesome, it really helps setting the mood!\n\nIf you’re a fan of the Tropico-series and you somehow haven’t yet played the first title, you should really consider buying this game. Also, it delivers great entertainment without demanding to much of your computer (which makes it ideal for older computers).\n\nThe entire series is really great fun, but this game is really a must have!","June 6, 2014","true","37.9"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/33520/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Tropico Reloaded is a pack that contains 2 first games of Tropico series, all of which are town-managment games. Tropico 1 makes you a dictator of tropical island during cold war. It also comes with Paradise Island expansion pack already patched in, which adds random storms and more buildings for tourists. And Tropico 2 makes you manage a pirate haven, with captives doing main force. No, you don't control fleet when they are out on the mission. They all came out in 2001-2003, used engine of Railroad Tycoon 2 and made by PopTop.\n\nNow, technical side, how do these old games work now. Well, none support widescreen, as you guessed.\nI had almost no trouble with Tropico 1. It just ran in full-screen in Software mode by default. It refused to switch to Hardware mode. The only shame is that because of that Steam overlay was not working.\nTropico 2 gave much more resistance, being filthy pirate and all. It would crash when it loaded any level. I had to go to game's folder, open Tropico2.ini file and enable "SoftwareDevice". After that, it still was unfriendly, as not only Steam overlay did not work, but Alt-Tab would cause annoying graphical bugs in game's interface.\n\n\nTropico 1 should be familiar to you if you played T3 or T4. You are Dictator who controls small island. The game is noted for combining SimCity with micromanagement elements. This game is much smaller scale of having around 100 persons in a town. As results it simulates every person indicidually, much less abstract than in SimCity. They got needs, wants, they need to travel distances to work, or wander around for enternainment. And yea, thus you get to get more personal. Ordering to take out individual person. Or having pain of making sure that they live nearby work.\n\nAnd well, one of a flaw of a game is that it sometimes requires you to micromanage some stuff that you don't have good tools for. What I am mostly talking about is making sure that person lives in the best house, that is closest to work. The only thing you can do is firing person from work or such and that puts them into bad mood. Heck, one of the way you can fail in this game is by overextending. Most often you will end up taking only 1/3 of the island, otherwise you tend to drop into negative balance. The only thing that building road do is to make it easier to go up the hill.\n\nYou can order people to build, you can make edits or you can tweak wages and options of each building. You have to make your town work. Also, it's a very slow paced game. And it shows, like constructing can be a pain there. First workers will have to clean the land of shacks/trees by destroying them, then clean rubble, then they have to work on ground to put it into same level and only then they will start to actually build. Airport can end up being less worth than the time it takes, for example. Still enjoyable to watch people work.\n\nYou also have many political sides to satisfy. You can either build economy on tourists or industy. And you can be either more people-caring dictator or a forceful evil one with military might. It's fun as it's not so single-pathed. Though to be honest, it leans more toward satisfying needs of religious people, easier and more beneficial to appeal toward Soviets, tourists don't give much of strong economy and it's better to be more democratical than actually use edits for evil.\n\nPretty nice game, though I wish it made us use more dictatorship tools. And a bit clunky nowdays.\n\n\nTropico 2 is more pirate-themed though. It's quite unique, but it's also less fun somehow. You got two kind of people who do their own jobs and must be kept in separate zones of comfort. Captives work on industry and require fear and order. Pirates just satisfy their needs on lands and work on the ships, they need zones of defence and anarchy. And sadly pirate job is handled on a map and is mostly a game of chance where you can get screwed up. If you do screw up, well, you may not get out if you run out of gold. Though main recource there is lumber for buildings.\n\nIt's more linear game too. Some buildings produce certain recources for other buildings, all to satisfy pirates. You need industry from captives, you build ships, you send them and hope for the best. Every building needs to be made near road. Edics feel more like general orders. And you just need to keep happyness above middle, it doesn't feel as much of motivating to grow as in Tropico 1.\nOn good side, stats book was improved, letting you choose and control much easier. And to analyze.\n\nIt also got a campaign, though it still feels like just series of separate islands one after another. Still nice.\n\nIt doesn't really feel exciting for me for some reason. Kinda more one-lined. But some will love it. Makes a good bonus with Tropico 1.\n\nOh, and important thing to note: both Tropico games have simple yet catchy music. T1 has tons of them! There.","September 5, 2015","true","29.8"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

I cannot for the life of me get into Tropico, and that is a shame. There is nothing wrong with either of them, and one can argue that compared to the newer iterations the first tropico contains just as much, if not more depth to its mechanics. There are more of everything. More edicts, more graphs, information I'd really had liked playing Tropico 4 laying in the open.. And i still can't get into it. Mostly it is due to the clunkyness, newer games will spoil you like that .)\nHowever, for what it is, and for what it should be expected to be when going into it, the first tropico really acts and feels like the later games, so much in fact that the later games feel kinda lazy for ripping so much of the old content rigth of. And for this it should be respected. If you want to experience the genesis of the series then get this, but be prepared that even if it is the same old Tropico you love and like, the keyword here is old. :)\n\nHowever, that says nothing for the second game of the pack, Tropico 2: pirate cove!\nIt is completely different from all others of the series, not only due to its pirate themes, but due to significant changes to gameplay as well. Instead of factions such as nationalists and environmentalists the island populace is now divided into enslaved workers and pirate overlords (Note that some subgroups such as hedonists and gentry exist among the pirates, but it is very much streamlined between the groups).\nTrade is marginalized in favour of raiding and rather than creating a self-sufficient island you now need to focus on getting piratically powerfull enough to take what you need through raids and buccaneering. It is a fresh and different playstyle compared to the other tropicos and making your island run effectively, juggling worker repression and pirate happiness is very different from the teasing and pleasing of different political factions and building effectively now has an element of demography to it as well since pirates enjoy anarchic environments and abhore order, while workers on the other hand need orderly environments to work effectively and escape easier when anarchy is high. It is great, and in itself a very solid strategy game. Also, good pirate-themed games are rare, so giving it a spin just for that is justified.\n\nAs you can see, my view of these games differ quite a lot, and this brings me back to the first point of the text; that emotions can make or break the experience. I never played Tropico 1, it is old and clunky and i cannot appreciate it properly. I did on the other hand play Tropico 2 as a kid. It is old and clunky, and I love it.\n\nThus: While I can reccomend Tropico reloaded for what it is, an old but iconic forerunner to a good franchise and a nice island management game with a pirate twist, i can only on a personal level recommend it for Tropico 2. Make of that what you will :)","November 22, 2014","true","1.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

It's not beautiful by any means, but it's not without its charm either.\n\nGameplay is pretty straight forward: you're the dictator of an island and you need to keep your people happy while balancing politics and economics. There isn't a lot of micromanagement like the Sim City games, and the entire experience feels pretty relaxed and entertaining.\n\nThere isn't a huge diversity of buildings available, but there are enough to feel like the game has sufficient content. There are also various scenareos all featuring different maps, and if that's not enough, you can generate a random map to your own specifications.\n\nThe only complaint I have against Tropico is that there are some resolution issues, and the information tab kept opening itself every few minutes. The tab may have been a local issue, or it may have been a glitch. Not game-breaking, but still annoying.\n\nAll in all, Tropico is still a very playable game even today. That said, I don't know if it's worth investing your time and money unless you're nostalgic or looking to experience the series as it aged (like I was). I only say this because the newer games in the series have all received mostly positive reviews, and there really isn't any reason to take two steps back unless its an experience you're exclusively looking for.\n\nTo all the citizens of Tropico I failed: lo siento, mi amigos - no soy un buen dictador.","March 24","true","4.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So, at the time, I deleted it, and always thought of how angry it made me.\n\nFourscore years into the future, out of sheer curiosity, I started researching whether the game could be found on the net, so I could play. At first, I thought I was going to find it under DOS-Box, and have to run a Win 98 emulator, etc. but Steam has purchased it, so it runs on my Win 8.1 and Win 7 platforms, without issue. Thank you to them for that.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, this is about as good as PC games ever were. No silly ads to deal with. No DLC to muck up gameplay. It runs fast and clean, and you don't have to buy any u/g to move through the campaign and beat the game. The good thing about this pack, is you get the original game, and Tropico 2: Pirate's Cove, for the low price of $6.99. Old cheat codes work, and I am sure if that isn't enough, the 'Extras' menu allowing you to edit built-in scenarios, as well as build your own scenarios, is gonna keep you busy.\n\nI think the only thing I've got to say negative, and it's probably the design of the game, is I never get attacked at my base by the other nations. I hardly can get them mad enough, I guess, although, after attacking them mercilously for years on end in the game, they amass enormous fleets that pretty much desimate any ships I send to the busy regions. I would like to actually have to defend myself.\n\nIf you like older games, and loathe the way newer games are chock full of DLC and ads and freemium crap, then get this game and refresh your cache!","October 2, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/33520/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","Tropico is an oldie but a goodie if you're interested in strategy, citybuilding and/or politics. You're the dictator of a Latin American banana republic during the Cold War, one that's small enough that you order the placement of every individual building. Depending on the conditions you set, your tenure can be anywhere from a sleepily relaxing downtime - the sort you play between other games - to an extremely violent and possibly short challenge.\n\nNo matter your preference, the game is tinged with black comedy, as befitting a game where you basically play as Tiny Cuba and lose whenever ousted from power. The Tropico Reloaded pack you buy this in also contains Tropico's only expansion, Paradise Island, as well as Tropico 2, a less-than-stellar pirate-based sequel. I would at least recommend the first Tropico for strategy buffs interested in a novel offshoot of the genre, and retro fans who liked Tropico 3/4 (which were essentially remakes of this game anyway).\n\n\nTropico was released in 2001 by my favorite defunct strategy developer, PopTop Studios. You might know that the series was picked up later by Haemimont Games and turned into a veritable franchise. Don't let the charming Y2K-era graphics fool you here: Tropico may be the most laid-back game in the series, but it's also the hardest in the series. You don't get quick construction, or a raft of DLC buildings to supercharge your economy, or for that matter paved roads.\n\nIn fact, the most difficult aspect is arguably construction workers needing to manually clear and level the terrain for everything you build. This means you'll need to do some logistical planning before you want that airport built, and the sooner the better. The increased difficulty is mitigated by the fact that you can still choose what traits your Presidente has, the political and physical climate of the island, and how often random events happen.\n\nThe 60-odd included scenarios, like the game itself, range from pretty easy to almost stupidly hard. If the base game starts to wear thin for you, you'll probably like the challenges they have to offer. You don't get to choose your Presidente's stats or island conditions for a scenario, though, and they will often force your ruling hand whether you like it or not.\n\n\nIf there's anything to criticize, it's that the UI is somewhat dated, at least by the standards of Haemimont's sequels. It's more or less lifted from PopTop's earlier title Railroad Tycoon II, where it shared the same characteristic of being a somewhat archaic interface in a classic genre game. Tropico also progresses more slowly than its modern sequels, but that's not a big deal if you're patient.\n\nThe biggest flaw in the whole series (and something I'm told Tropico 5 perhaps remedies, but I still need to play it) is that if you just focus on profitable industry early on, providing everything else you need and that your citizens want becomes much, much easier once the money starts rolling in. The solution here is to increase the challenge for yourself, whether by playing a scenario or generating a barren rock of an island.\n\nIn theory, the feeling you get from balancing all the national concerns would make up for that problem, but that's still kind of predicated on making mistakes every so often and dealing with the consequences. Every choice here has a consequence, big or small, whether you know it or not - and on a related tangent I would say Tropico is perhaps the most sim-like of the series. My advice is to try roleplaying if you need an extra challenge and haven't been doing so already; one of the other strengths of the series in my opinion is the dynamic between a player's ideals (or designs) and the gameplay reality they have to deal with.\n\n\nAt least Tropico's Latin soundtrack is just really, really nice. It's certainly the most bucolic and varied in the series. Best part is, it's still for[www.amazon.com] sale[www.amazon.com]. It even makes military coups seem...well, okay, not as stressful.\n\n\nA bit of advice for new Presidentes. Citizens put satisfaction of needs above work in terms of importance in every Tropico game, but here it's especially important to make sure you build with that in mind. Also, don't be afraid to play nasty if you're about to be kicked out while still learning the ropes.\n\nThe included Gold Edition manual promises a number of goodies, but you don't get any in the Steam download. So, I'll give you some instead. You can read a series of development columns for the game here[web.archive.org] download the making-of movie here, the old BradyGames strategy guide here[www.replacementdocs.com], a copy of every single official and usermade scenario here[steamcommunity.com] (thanks to Steam user Reformed Pirate), and you can view another bonus movie on YouTube here.\n\n\nReview of Tropico 2 forthcoming.","August 6, 2011","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For instance, you aren't blockaded just because you decide not to be a puppet for the US,  I owned this game since it originally came out and now have the Steam version.

But if you just want a great Tropico game just get 3. 4 added some Sim City aspects I hated and was a step backwards even from the default Tropico formula. 4 also lacked a likable announcer, 3s Juanito was comedic and really made the game had atmosphere.\n\n","July 7, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The English narrator has a bit exaggerated performance, but it's otherwise fitting to the game.\nThe game is quite difficult by today's standards - even on very easy modes if I want my population to be happy, it wrecks my economy :D\nThere are weird gender restrictions on some of the jobs, eg. bureaucrats, engineers, teachers and waiters can only be women, while soldiers, police officers and professors can only be men.Overall I recommend this game if you want to see the classic roots of the Tropico series or just want to try a difficult country-building & politics simulator.\n\nTropico 2 - Not Recommended\nThe game is crashing a lot on Windows 7 x64, basically unplayable.\n\nBut even when it worked before crashing it was kinda a horrible experience. I didn't quite think about what a pirate simulator would entail, but this game is basically a slavery simulator. Most of the people you rule are slaves, and you have to keep them constantly oppressed and terrified to stop them from fleeing or rising up against you. Most of the economy are run by these slaves - as far as I see you can't build an island only with free pirates. To make it worse the (always female) prost!tutes in the game are also slaves - which evokes the still existing parallel of sex trafficking.\n\nThe game also has some other gender stereotypes going on, like male pirates have a "wenching" need bar (ew), while female pirates have a "preening" bar. (Apparently women don't have sex drives and men don't mind living in filth.) Both these needs can be satisfied at the same place, by female slaves. Also I can kinda understand why lumberjacks can only be men, but why can cooks only be women? O.o\n\nOn the technical side - the game mostly has the same graphics as Tropico 1, the music is a lot less catchy and the UI feels less intuitive too.\n\nSo yeah, pass this game on, unless you don't mind oppressing and exploiting innocent captives, with added sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","July 28, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is very different than games like Sim City and Cities XL. Those two games are more macro city builders, where in two or three mouse clicks you can make city blocks where 1,000 people might live. With Tropico and the Tropico series in general, you need to place each building, each road and your island along with the time it takes your construction company to build it. Your entire island might get to be 200 - 500 'Tropicans.'\n\nEach Tropican has needs... Food, religion, job, healthcare, entertainment, safety and so on. The catch is every Tropican's needs have a certain weight to them based on what political party / faction they believe in. Each faction has major and minor demands. The military will want more soldiers, so you need to build an army base. The religious faction will want a church or cathedral. The capitalist party will want privatization or upscale entertainment. The communist party will want you to enable the free public housing edict or have etiquette healthcare.\n\nThe real main objective in the game is to get re-elected. If you don't, its game over. So to get re-elected, you need to keep your Tropicans happy. You don't have to have elections even. You're in charge. If you don't want an election, you don't need to have them, but eventually your Tropicans will rebel against you and make it game over! You can see preliminary poll results and you can even sway (cheat) elections. Tropico 1 seems extremely difficult to win an election compared to later Tropico games. On top of that, you balance political relations with the USA and USSR. If they get too bad, one of the two will basically take over your country and it will be game over. It is interesting how many ways that you can get game over.\n\nWhen citizens hate you, and there will be plenty that do, they will either peacefully protest or become rebels. Once you have enough rebels against you, they will attack your most remote buildings. Your army will then go fight them, but if the rebels outnumber your army, the rebel will win and the buildings will be destroyed. The rebels can attack your palace or flat out assassinate you for a game over.\n\nTropico has a lot of scenarios, but it is not a campaign and the game doesn't check off completed scenarios. Some scenarios last 30 minutes, others a few hours as you take an island from 1950 - 1990 or so. At the start of each scenario you can pick a player character from historical tropican dictators or make your own avatar. You can even make personality traits that will result in pros and cons. It can drastically change your play style if you are incorruptible and never have any crime or have a green thumb and have high farm yields at the cost of low factory production.\n\nThe controls feel cumbersome compared to later Tropico games. You need to click something to open the building menu, then select the type of building, then click the rotate building button. Then plop the building down. Sure that's 4 clicks, but 4 clicks of specific areas and it could have been streamlined more maybe even with keyboard controls or having right mouse button or mouse wheel rotate the building as it does with later Tropico games.\n\nThe game feels a lot slower than later versions of Tropico, such as making buildings, you'll need to wait for your builders to clear the land of shacks, demolish them, clean up the rubble, then clear the land of trees, then actually construct the building. Later versions of Tropico merely have it all instantly done, but tell you that it will take 20% longer.\n\nAnother problem with Tropico 1 is there's not an easy way to tell what to do next. Sure every scenario has a major goal and clicking the almanac and looking through page after page can tell you statistical information and clicking every Tropican can show you their specific needs, but I never get an overall conscensus, your people want a church or whatever they need. Instead it feels like a 1 by 1 search basis. You can see an overall Tropican pay chart, but not a religious satasfaction chart. Even if the game tells you how many people believe in a religious faction or a military faction.\n\nWith all of that in mind, I can't really recommend Tropico 1 compared to Tropicos 3, 4 or 5. However, Tropico 1 is still a classic for an old PC and there is still a lot of fun and enjoyment here. If it was the year 2002 I would recommend this game. Also there are several cheap bundles where you can buy the first 3 Tropicos for $5 or so.","May 9, 2014","false","4.2"," 36 of 77 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","36","77","0","0"

The game is OK at best, bad at worst with two game bundled into one (seems like a good deal right?) [Tropico & Tropico 2: Pirate Cove].\n\nWhen I first got into them, the intro seemed promising with characters that I'd normally see in a Tropico game (excluding hookers, that was kinda a first) and the game begins with a cool, yet awkward title screen. It also was hard to move around, however, I've gotten through it. Eventually, I get to the scenario screen and I can choose a pre-created character. It's slightly dissappointing that I can only pick characters the programmers created and not create your own dictator of Tropico, however, it makes up for it by choosing to be either Fidel Castro or Che Guevara.\n\nEventually, you load the game and you can create your nation. This is where it begins to fall apart, it feels kinda clunky and stiff. It still has the mechanics of Tropico, it just feels awkward coming from me. Anyways, my score for this game is a:\n\n6/10\n\nIt's above average, it's ok and it would've been lower if they haven't had my favorite revolutionaries like Che or Castro.","November 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

Tropico 3 is certainty more friendly than the original. However, Tropico 2 and even Tropico 3 refuses to run in a window. I can't possibly recommend this with such a standard feature in PC games missing.","February 12, 2014","false","9.9"," 2 of 21 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","2","21","0","0"

You can try to please everyone with limited success or pick certain groups to make really happy at the price of angering a different group. Of course you have help, soldiers, state run media and a few other things.\n\nBuilding space is limited by the size of your island. There is some customization of your starting resources and island.

(but i liked tropico 2!)\n\n\nI do have three things though:\n\n1) new glitches i've never seen before. when i say i played this a ton as a kid, i mean it was one of the three games i had when i was 10 on my macbook. and boy did i push what i had to it's limits. maybe the original mac version was just made of better stuff, but it was one of the sturdiest games i've still ever played. This copy from Steam though has a number of little things - sometimes when construction starts, the building instantly appears in the process of demolition; graphical errors; dropped/lagged mouse inputs; etc - nothing big or really damaging, just odd. didn't stop me from enjoying it. i sware the AI pathing is somehow worse though.\n\n2) Full screen = 1600x800 with a black boarder around the whole game. no adjustmant. didn't stop me from playing, just seems kinda stupid.\n\n3) no 'P' for pause. not 'esc' for menu. these might be, for somereason, only on mac releases, but seriously? it's an old game, i get it, but its not so old that its keybindings have to be frustrating. and i remember them being completely intuitive as a kid. this is just weird.\n\nPS. again, maybe just a difference between the Mac and PC releases, but the intro video is different.\n\nTL;DR - Amazing game, play it. want it perfect? get it on mac in 2002.","April 25","true","9.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
