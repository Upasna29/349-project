First, the Tiger tanks are rendered without their turrets in both games. I can't believe that wasn't caught in their quality checks. Second, the tank physics in several missions is like more like a beach ball than a multi-ton armored vehicle. If a tank from your squad runs into you, your tank is bounced off the ground or spun around like a beach ball. In one mission I was bounced into a mine field and blew up. In the D-Day mission, the Sherman rolls over easily at the slightest slope of beach. Third, the tank treads are not animated. Let me also summarize every mission: Shoot waves of enemy tanks. Expect anti-tank guns to ambush you around every corner. Find health. Find ammo. Repeat endlessly. If you are looking for strategy or variation this is not your game. Gameplay gets really tedious, especially in Dunes of War. It becomes a question of "Can I find health?" not "How can I out-think my enemy?" It's a shame really because the graphics are not bad. The voice actors are pretty good. The historical vignettes with old movie footage are pretty good too. Gameplay is OK. There are no on-screen instructions in Dunes of War so play Fields of Glory first so you learn the keyboard commands. I am still looking for that magic, amazing, well-conceived tank game you can play over and over. This is not it.","June 22, 2014","false","8.4"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","37","45","0","0"

I'm guessing the creators were counting on that. The turret model rendering for the Tiger Tank is broken, meaning no turret graphic when you're driving the Tiger. (maybe this won't apply to you?)This game would be fun but the physics of driving the tank are very poor. The Pz II in FoG is so hard to drive, it is almost unplayable at points. Since the physics are off, the tank driving is "unique" at best, and the "Tiger Bug" has no patch or any ETA on one, I'll have to give this 2 stars. No something I would recommend for fans of WoT, Pz. Elite, etc.","June 3, 2015","false","3.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Every shell also appears to be HE, which is something that drives me away from liking the tank combat.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the part of your tank that a shell hits has an effect on how much damage you take. However, many times the AI tanks will charge you, then immidiatly turn around, exposing their engine (which is a 1-shot kill) and running away.\n\nIt's worth noting that in-game models seem to be made with care, as I was quickly able to distinguish a ZiS gun from a PaK gun. You can also see the differences between infantry models, as well as the weapons they carry. The tank models, however, look made in a 640x400 resolution. Seeing as how the game can run in 1366x768, they just plain look ugly.\n\nThe missions aren't very diverse. It's always a mix of "kill everything that moves," "go here," and "don't die." Thus the game gets boring very quickly. The few siege missions are set up very, very poorly. They allow you to camp around your repair and ammo supplies and kill the oncoming enemies as quickly or slowly as your little heart desires.\n\nOverall, this isn't necessarily a bad game, but it's most certainly not a good one either.","August 30, 2014","false","1.9"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","23","32","2","1"

The game isn't too bad and seeing as you get both the game and its expansion there isn't much to complain about regarding the cost.There is three factions in the main game, Soviets,Americans,and Germans.There isn't THAT much tank diversity and a lot of the    models are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking. The game's graphics serve their purpose but are by no means great. The Tiger tank models,for example,are abysmal. The turret on the tigers isn't even there. This is a pretty noticable problem seeing as you will be fighting a LOT of these and in one mission you play as one.Also,the tank treads are not even animated.They're static textures. One thing this game does incredibly well,however, is the environments. You fight in a multitude of battlegrounds such as invading the dunes of Africa all the way to helping out the 101st in Bastogne.The AI is abysmal. The friendly tanks will just run into you and,on occasion,shoot you in the back. The enemy AI will sometimes just sit there as you obliterate them. Another problem is the tank handling. The tanks handle like Go-Karts. You may be trying to round a corner and then all the sudden you flip over. The voice acting is suprisingly good. There is absolutely no strategy involved in the game. The battles are just a rush for the repair station and then you deal with the enemies.You are able to use commands and order friendly tanks around. However,these are never very well explained even in the manual.\nTL;DR\nLots of potential here but between terrible handling,graphics that leave much to desire,abhorrent AI,and the repair-rush battles this game was quite the let down.Dont buy unless you are extremely tolerant.","June 2, 2015","false","9.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

As i play through more, diffrent tanks are arrive so that compleant is gone, now i see somthing that is really...quite amazing, the voice actors TRY. your Russian crew sounds diffrent from your German crew (mind blown). Even better are a few changes in the missions (which are long BTW which is fun) in one of the German missions you encounter KV-1s, which are difficult to kill, but they do NOT become the main tank for the rest of the mission (like most games would do) because, as your crew says, they are expermental and not 'battle ready' yet, which is really cool. still, i love this game, and i want modders to find this and make it even better than it already is\nlets break down the review\n\ngameplay-9/10\nStory- (its WWII and you are common tankers, so) N/A\nCharicters- 7/10\ngraphics- 6/10 (2007, i can't blame it too much but, it could be better)\nDifficulty-8/10(can be changed)\namount of tanks 9/10 (no game can be perfect)\noverall-8.44300194/10\nThis is not a game changer in the world of tank  games, this is fun, simple and great worth grabbing just for some tank action (or Panzer action, or for those that are good at tanks, panzer elite action)","May 19, 2014","true","8.4"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

You drive along, you shoot at the enemy in a very arcade style manner.\nThe voice acting is not bad, and there's an attempt to make you feel you are part of a tank crew.\nThe main, and unforgivable problem, is the physics are absurd. Your tank can't go up an incline, you will roll over your tank so often, the game actually has built in code to flip your tank back upright automatically. You aren't rolling your tank because you approached an angle incorrectly, but because you turned on flat ground too fast and rolled your tank over. Your squad will also accidentally ram your tank and flip you over.\nYou can run over any tree in existence and barely slow down, but you can't travese the smallest of steps.\nI finally had to stop "playing" to see if it could get any better, when my force of tanks was spread out and we were being attacked (as usual) by overwhelming numbers of enemy tanks (that never do anything other than drive straight toward you, then turn to create rear kill shots) and one the tanks in my group clipped me, that bounced me into another one of my units tanks, which bounced me into another one of my units tanks, which bounced me into another tank, and because I'm not driving forward, all the tanks stop, so my command tank is literally bouncing around like a pinball off of one tank to another tank, while spinning like a made top.\n","January 26","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
