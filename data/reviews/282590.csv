"http://steamcommunity.com/id/d996m/recommended/282590/","d996m","Xangi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/d996m/","261 products in account","There are two types of people who play Star Ruler 2.\n\nThe first type are the kind of people who will not like this game. These people generally will lodge complaints including but not limited to:\n\n- Not as complicated as the first game\n- Art style differs from my preference\n- I dislike the economy system\n- Combat is too hands-off\n- There is no "soul"\n- The menus don't look like the first game\n- Research sucks\n- Diplomacy is confusing/useless\n\nThese people also often do not have more than a few hours in game time. I'll tell you right now, at 5 hours in I had exactly the same complaints. The problem is that SR2 doesn't have a very good tutorial and that a lot of the complexity is somewhat hidden. Some of those complaints are also purely subjective and therefore cannot be addressed beyond "Yep, ok". For the rest of them, see below.\n\nTo a person who hasn't played more than one or two games against some regular AIs, the combat would most certainly appear to be blob vs. blob. However once you realize how damage works and how to effectively utilize the support AI patterns it becomes obvious that, while not micro intensive, the combat is far from hands-off. It's just that the hands-on part happens in the preparation. Armor type makes a HUGE difference. Taking a torpedo on reactive armor will produce very different results that taking it on ablative. Neutronium may seem like an uber-armor but since it's so heavy and expensive it's rarely cost-effective. Weapon types are very important, the difference in effectiveness between a railgun and a laser depending on the situation can be vast. Ship speed is vital to not only engaging in time but fleeing as well, especially if you have no hyperdrive. Speaking of FTL, the type you have plays a big role in how you approach combat. Pinpoint Hyperdrive strikes are certainly effective, but fling beacons are far superior for offense (due to their speed and usually lower cost vs distance) though they lack easy-retreat capability. Gates are usually only used for turtling, but a gate in deep space can attack an opponent at points and from directions they don't expect. Slipstream can be used the same way except with less setup and more risk (since the enemy can also use your slipstream tears). There is a ton of depth, but again most (though not all) of it is in the setup.\n\nThe economy would certainly seem strange and stupid, after all you can't stockpile resources and have to expand. Except that the cycle system discourages inactive play and actually results in the player actually making MORE ships and improvements than they would otherwise. Dry Docks can help you build ships that you couldn't otherwise afford. The forced expansion eliminates AI abuse strategies and also makes empire defense more of a priority. Even the smallest world can be a critical component in the supply chain for your L5 forge world. Losing a link in the chain doesn't have immediate crippling effects but it's certainly not something to ignore. The pressure system eliminates the need to micromanage planets beyond choosing good supplies and letting the system do its work. The level 0 resources (they don't contribute to planetary development) provide a variety of useful effects and if used correctly can provide a significant advantage. Terraforming can help provide more L1 resources for extra income and Artifacts/building/diplomacy can provide food and water if there is a shortage.\n\nResearch would seem like a step back from the first game until you realize that SR1's research system, while unique, was inherently broken. Ships were outdated before they were even finished being built and the effectiveness of subsystems grew to such absurdities that tech advantages were instant-win conditions. The new tree applies passives automatically without the need for retrofit except if new systems are to be applied, and while not infinitely scalable is not the silver bullet in engagements that it was in SR1. Good tactics and planning can easily defeat fleets of twice the strength of what you're throwing at them. However it's fairly obvious why a lot of people would fail at this, since if you believe the combat to be DeathBlob Fights 2015 you wouldn't think of using any flanking or varied fleet makeups.\n\nVery few people complain about the diplomacy beyond "I don't like it" but the solution is simple. Add "Influence Peddling" to the main screen by clicking the "...". Keep track of who votes where and USE THE SYSTEM. It's incredibly effective if you put some time into it. Save some cards in case you need them. If you ignore it you're inevitably going to get screwed by it at some point. Oh and for god's sake read the Zeitgeist cards. Zealotry can be game changing and so can Co-operation.\n\nWell that was longer than I expected.\n\nThe second kind of person is the type that will buy this game and enjoy it because they aren't looking for MOO2 Remake #232432 and are willing to put some time in to truly appreciate its uniqueness. If you read this far without downvoting this review you're probably in the latter category. Bear in mind that this is by no means a perfect game, but it is certainly worth the money. I paid full price for this game, and that is not something I do very often.","June 8, 2015","true","139.2"," 535 of 554 people (97%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","97","535","554","15","7"

There are some amazing ideas in this game, and it seems a lot of polish even during early access.  The diplomacy is unique and very complex, with influence and interactions that feel very very real.  The planetary resource systems are fascinating to me, as is the resulting trade networks that grow organically.  The ship builder is actually better than the first Star Ruler, which had an amazing ship builder.  FTL was weak in Star Ruler 1, here there are 5 different methods each unique and tactical.  Combat seems solid, manageable, and interesting.  The flagship system means that you are ordering around fleets, not ships, but you still have a nice amount of control and the ship numbers are amazing.   Everything is . . . perfect.\n\nI'm a highly critical gamer with jaded tastes.  I've been disappointed by one 4x game after another.  MoO3, Endless Space, Sword of the Stars 2, all sad memories.  Even Galciv and Distant Worlds weren't quite good enough for me.  I have never been so completely blown away just playing a tutorial, realizing the depth of the systems I'm seeing laid out in front of me.  Assuming there is nothing horribly wrong with this game that is hidden from me currently . . . well damn, I'll say it, this might be the game that surpasses Master of Orion 2.\n\nIt's an overused cliche, but it fits with this game.  Things could go wrong, the AI may turn out to be useless, or some other chronic mistake, but I don't think so.  Star Ruler 1 was visionary and flawed, fascinating but clunky.  It seems they learned a lot from that game.  Seeing this come from a small studio . . . I hope it gains the accolades it deserves.  I also suspect modding will be amazing, since Star Ruler 1 had a wonderful modding scope, and I suspect they did the same here.\n\nBuy this game.  No seriously, if you like 4x gaming at all, buy Star Ruler 2.  This isn't a game you buy just to support the ideas of the devs, though those ideas are amazing.  This is the game I wish I had paid more for, because I think I cheated the devs and got way more than I paid for.\n\n:::Post-release:::\n\nThe game remains very strong, with several major improvements over the beta.  The ship design remains the high point of the game, and sadly the AI remains a little weak.  The AI is competent, certainly.  It does know how to play the game properly, but it lacks aggression.  On the other hand, it is smart enough to know when it has lost.\n\nI won a game recently without actually taking a single enemy planet.  I out-expanded them slightly, and while they fought wars against each other, I offered surrender to whichever side was near to losing.  Most of them accepted subjugation, since I was a friendly power that was roughly 10 times their strength.  After I did this three times, I turned on the one remaining AI.  I declared war, sent my massive ships.  Three of my ships arrived in their systems and I received an offer of surrender before they could reach the planet.  I think they just saw the ships blotting out the sun and said "Nope, this is not winnable."  That is smart design and saved me a long slog to a certain victory.\n\nRecent improvements to the tech tree have made it far more understandable and elegant.  Technology in general seems far more unique and useful as compared to the beta tech tree, which was somewhat repetitive.  Performance remains very good, I've yet to see a bug or crash in any of my games.  The races and various FTL methods have vastly improved from the beta, and the AI knows how to play every combination without error.\n\nThe modding community is rapidly expanding, as predicted, and has already furnished several very solid mods.  The devs have already incorporated some of the best additions as core gameplay, which does not surprise me.  I still recommend this game highly, it remains a very original and solid 4x game.  I have high hopes for the future, and I do feel they have delivered a solid game as it currently stands.  Of course, I always yearn for more.","January 26, 2015","true","47.6"," 95 of 100 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","95","100","8","8"

Space 4x is my favorite genre and I've plaved many of them, and this game comes off as  a very original and innovative game to me (have not played Star Ruler 1).\n\nFirst off, the game is an RTS, but its really meant to be paused...a lot (early on at least), and thats ok.  It takes quite some time to get the hang of how colonizing works, what to build, what orbitals do, how pressue works, etc.  There is a wiki to help you with most things, and some things you have to figure out by trial and error.  I've restarted quite a lot of games because I'd always realize something new I wasn't doing.  Main thing is if it seems too complex, just hang in there, read the wiki, experiment and you will figure it out, and its well worth it, trust me!\n\n-Research is nice, but the research screen could of been better.  Easy to get lost, but it works.\n\n-Ship design is daunting(for me).  Others I'm sure will enjoy it.  Thankfully you can have the AI design any size ship you want, or you can see what other players have designed and just use their ship!\n\n-Diplomacy is unique, but good.  Has a system where you can vote on certain propositions using cards and influence points.  Has your standared treaties as well (don't need cards), like Alliance, Trade Treaty, Mutual Defense, etc.\n\n-Exploration is nicely done as well.  When you start exploring you can run into multiple things, like Debris Fields,  which you can scan to bring up events in which you choose what you want to do.  You can find Pirate ships guarding special items which will give you certain bonuses. There is also Artifacts to find in which you can spend energy to activate whatever bonuses they hold.\n\n-Colonization is uniqe in this game as well, in which you constantly need to colonize planets for their resources in order to export them to planets you want to grow.  It can get confusing, but pretty much how it goes is, growing a planet needs resoucres, and those resources need resources, and those resources need resources.  Just pause the game, look at your surroundings, look at the planet you want to upgrade and it will tell you exactally what you need.\n\n-Buildings can be constructed on each planet by the AI and user.  The user can build things like Research complexes, Labor Factories, Megafarms, and more, the AI builds smaller buildings helpling the planet as it grows.  You can also build Orbital structures that go in space, like shipyards, supply stations, outposts, etc.  Careful on what you build though, they come at a hefty maintaince cost.\n\n-Economy is done well in this game.  You get income from population and "Income Pressue" and you have maintaince costs from buildings and ships.  Every 3 minutes you will get cash based on the difference in your income and maintaince.  So you can spend all your money and once the 3 minutes is up you will get another sum of money to spend in that time, based off the difference in Income and Maintanice.  Seems confusing but it works nicely.\n\n-Combat consists of having a flagship with multiple support ships under its wing.  Those support ships can specialize in missles, rail guns, lasers, rockets, etc. The flagship has a certain amount of support capacity, which means you can only carry so many support ships.  Your ships move in which your flagship is in the middle and the support ships make a big circle around it, so its like a circle of death.  Combat is real time and you can zoom in to see the action, but its pretty much just a bunch of balls of death shooting at one another, but it works for me.  Although ship building and making your fleets can be confusing.\n\n-UI is only ok in this game for there are many things I wish they would of done.  Can easily lose track of what you have building.\n\n-Graphics and Sound are just average, if not below par.  Graphics never mean much to me in these types of games, and the soundtrack didnt do anything for me.  Effect sounds are ok at best.\n\n-Scale can be whatever you want to be.  You can choose from multiple types of universes and even ones with multiple universes, so you can make a game however big or small you want.\n\nOverall this is a solid game that id give an 7.5/10.    It might take a bit of getting used to, but its really fun once you get the hang of it.  One of the better space RTS games to come along since Sins of a Solar Empire.","March 27, 2015","true","138.2"," 89 of 94 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","89","94","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnnus/recommended/282590/","magnnus","Magnnus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnnus/","199 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has the single best diplomacy system I've ever seen in a strategy game. The diplomacy revolves around influence and influence cards. Influence ticks up depending on the resources and research your empire has aquired, and can be spent on cards such as "negotiate", "annex planet", "protect system". These cards appear in a queue, and every empire has the option of spending influence to snag the card for themself, or to keep it away from someone else. Cards refresh quickly, so keep an eye on the queue if you're playing the diplomacy game. Some cards can be played for immediate effects, such a "protect system" protecting a system from hostile takover for some number of minutes. Other cards, such as "annex planet" require a vote in the galactic senate before they can take effect. Each empire can then play cards for or against the proposition. "negotiate" simply provides direct support or opposition, while cards like "rhetoric" have a greater magniture of support or opposition, but provide benefits to anyone who takes your side. This can lead to interesting situations where two empires you really don't care about are duking it out in the galactic senate, but you want to get in on the action to get the benefit of a "rhetoric" or "bribe" card. Overall, the system is fun, and gives diplomacy some real teeth, without it being overpowered.\n\nAnother system that is done very well is the economy. Every planet has a core resource that it can export to other planets, and every planet needs resources to grow and level up. Some resources need a certain level planet to be utilized. So the economy game revolves around creating chains of trade to funnel the right resources to the right planets. It's very steamlined, and provides tangible effects without much micromanagement. Additionally, most resources have secondary effects that can interact without other resources. So while it's easy to just get a planet up to a high level by giving it whatever it needs, you may want to save that grain for your homeworld, and find some fish for your asteroid mining planet. On the downside, the game currently lacks any kind of filter mechanic, so it can be difficult to find that one resource you're looking for in the late game. This being an alpha/beta game, I expect the issue to be resolved before launch.\n\nThe two systems that are still farily lackluster are research and ship design. While the core mechanics of ship design are great, the game currently lacks enough variety in ship parts to make it really interesting. This ties in with the very small number of research options. Interviews from before early access seemed to indicate that the research system is still in a very early stage. However, the devs are very genuine in their desire to make a great game, and I have no concern that these features will be fleshed out significantly before release.","July 19, 2014","true","100.4"," 82 of 96 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","82","96","0","1"

The UI is intuitive and beginners can easily get into this game. Multiplayer is enjoyable and it supports over 20 players, which is mad to think about. Galaxies can have as many systems as you want and you can even build more than one galaxy. You can even blow up a blackhole!\n\nThese are my favourite features of the game.\n\nThe race and FTL you choose can drastically change how you play the game.\nShip design can be fully customized with gun, armour and engine placement and much more. Having no armour in the back will leave your ships vulnerable in the back when retreating, for example.\nShip AI can be customised, ships can be made to attack in the rear or to shoot from afar, very impressive.\nBuildings on planets can be placed but civilian buildings will automatically be generated based on the pressure of the planet (a resource to determine how much the population build)\nYou can build moon bases, halo-esk ring worlds, ship yards, customisable orbital stations and customisable  gateways. Content like this just makes it more enjoyable.\nThe resource, democracy and research mechanic is much better than it was in Star Ruler 1 and is really enjoyable.\nSome criticisms:\n\nThe AI is hard, even on easy, so I would recommend playing with passive AI first. You need to expand or you will be out-expanded by the AI, I wish you could create a more quality over quantity empire but an AI is a computer and the larger they get, the more they can do.\nIt needs to feature more modules for the ships, there were tons in Star Ruler 1 but not as many here.","March 27, 2015","true","76.5"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","58","63","3","6"

All of the basic functions are there. What really stands the game out is the innovative card system. Use influence to purchase cards to suggest new universal regulations such as annexing a rival's system or declaring your own homeworld as the home of the Galactic Senate. Buy other cards to support your own proposals while rejecting those of your rivals. Manipulate other empires to join your crusade against your enemies lest they remember your wrath in their future proposals. The possibilities are extremely deep and I'd place this as the #1 innovation for SR2.\n\n(+) Ship Building / Planet Building - Ships you build tile by tile. The larger you build a gun and it's subsystem, the stronger it'll be. Place armor around vulnerable areas such as the front but don't forget to neglect the rear lest the enemy sends in a pincer fleet. Planets have building room dependent on size. Each planet also has unique terrain features that seperate from other worlds. Depending on the terrain, buildings such as research labs and farms cost less so you'll have to plan accordingly to maximize your credits.\n\n(+) Fleets - Most games you'll command 20 ships in the late game. Some give you a hundred. Here the basic unit of combat is the fleet. You build a capital ship and then attach up to hundreds of smaller support ships to that capital ship to fight. What results is hundreds of laser beams, missiles, cannons firing off at each other. Each ship is rendered and simply put, that's just awesome.\n\n(+) Economy - I'm hesitant to label this as purely a strength. I find the economy a bit simple but more on a positive note than a negative note. For those who are used to the complexity of games such as Distant Worlds, SR2 will be a big downgrade. Each planet usually produces 1 resource. You then connect those resources to other planets that produce more complex resources to level them up and then you ship those complex resources to a major population center to level them up so they grow more and are more productive. What results is many resource worlds and a few concentrated centers in each empire. Now this does provide interesting opportunities such as allowing an apt leader to focus their attention on those major centers  to deal the biggest damage. On the other hand, perhaps the regional capital is too difficult to assault and  knocking out all of the food suppliers might be a more effective way to neutralize the population.... Overall, I'll label this a positve because for new players, it's simple enough to get into and only the most diehard captains of industry will feel bored with the economy of SR2.\n\n(+) Tutorial - There's a lot of games that do the tutorial wrong or make it super confusing. SR2 did it right. It explains all you need to know to get started and does so in a UI-friendly manner.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOut of Supplies\n\n(-) Empire Customization: Yes you can customize by assigning your empire a unique government / space travel method and a few other features. You can also give your empire a portrait and which set of ships to use but that's about it. I'd have liked to be able to pick more bonuses for each empire such as maybe I'll take +10% budget but my ships do -10% damage or some trades like that. These are usually basics and for the game not to have them available was a bit of a let down.\n\n(-) Tech Tree: The tech tree is a bit convoluted to look at. There's simply too many options being thrown onto a beehive grid that just disorients the eyes. Oh I need more budget, let me find how I can get to more business techs. Scan, scan, scan, oh there it is. Now I need more budget, oh the next tech and it's prerequisites for more budget is up here. It's just a bit too disorganized, especially for new players.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall I'd give this game 8 fleets blowing up out of 10. You'll find some new features that are unique to this game such as fleet design and diplomacy done right. I didn't touch on this but moddability will surely fix some of the weaknesses such as the lack of empire customization so that's why I didn't weigh too heavily on that part.\n\nAnyways, fleet battles are epic and hopefully we can see thousands of thousands of ships fighting one day over some backwater planet that was only made important because multiple fleets decided to clash over it. That's my dream and the dream of many 4x space lovers!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI recorded the tutorial for those who want to see some gameplay of all the features:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWXO4cpcMoc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/xBr0wnBear","March 31, 2015","true","12.2"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","54","58","8","0"

It's hard to express in a brief review what this game does and how well it does it, but suffice to say, it delivers on every promise it makes in the store page breakdown. It takes the basic 4X formula, then does so many innovative little things with it that I never once had another 4X game in my mind. As bold as it is in this regard, everything it changes WORKS, and oh so well.\n\nI'm really at a loss for how to properly lay out this review, so I'll refer you to some other users' reviews and instead touch on some of the highlights for me personally. It'll get long-winded, so if you want a summary, here it is: Star Ruler 2 is a spectacular game, both for 4X fans and sci-fi fans in general. Even RTS fans are like to find appeal. If you're on the fence, thinking, "Well it looks good, but I dunnooooo...", my advice is get it. I was, I did, and I'm not sorry.\n\nNow, to the point-by-point breakdown:\n\n- The hex-based ship design is way more fun than I'd have imagined. It really makes every ship "count". It attaches you to your creations. Furthermore, the design MATTERS. It's more than just racking up numbers and min/maxing; the combat in Star Ruler 2 actually simulates physical interactions between ships, meaning you have to take care to lay out your ship in a way that protects vital subsystems without sacrificing too much in the way of firepower and maneuvering.\n\n- The fleet system is just so great. Where most games force you to tediously build every single ship by hand and then group 4 to 12 of them to call it a "fleet", Star Ruler 2 centers fleets around one (often expensive) flagship, and has hundreds of smaller support craft attached to it. Each individual ship acts on its own in battle, but as a part of the whole the is the fleet. it's awe-inspiring to watch, and it somehow doesn't break my system, either!\n\n- One of my favorite features regarding ships is the ability to set a size. You input a size when designing ships, and that size scales everything from the health offered by each hex to the amount of damage your weapons inflict and your armor soaks.\n\nEven more impressive is that the ships ACTUALLY scale, physically, with the number you input. I was shocked when I made a copy of a size 500 battleship and set it to 5,000 as a test, to find it turned out to be bigger than the SUN. Given that you can make orbital battle stations and the like, you can literally build a Death Star; a hulking behemoth with over 8 million HP. (I am not exaggerating one bit; of course, this is if your empire can afford such a thing.)\n\n- For those who fancy ship creation and simply watching battles, there's a ship designer sandbox that allows you to create anything your heart desires, ignoring cost and all else, and spawn it in open space as an ally or enemy. If you just feel like watching ten massive fleets of your creation duke it out without all the 4X fluff, you can do that.\n\n- Empire management is meaningful. Where other 4X games just have you taking a planet and letting it get bloated with population to become a big producer of the major resources, Star Ruler 2 forces you to think. Planets require certain resources to grow, and these are supplied as exports from other planets. But a planet can only export a resource to one place. This means you have to really pour resources from several planets into one key planet, rather than just sitting idle while everything grows to insane proportions.\n\n- The 4X resources - in this case, things like wealth, influence, FTL charge, energy and research - aren't automatically produced based on abstract values attached to a planet. In general, they require pressure. Each planet can handle so much pressure, and pressure tells the planet what to produce. It's hard to explain... Here's an example. Electronics generate wealth pressure, because if electronics are being imported to a planet, this means they're being sold as a consumer product. That leads to sales tax revenue. In other words, the types of luxury resources a planet has, either natively or by export, drive the production of the major resources in your empire. It's a novel and very fun mechanic to play with.\n\n- Diplomacy matters! Influence is a resource you can generate, and you use it to pick up diplomacy cards or to play cards you possess. You can play these cards for a variety of effects, from spying on other empires to giving your flagship a name, but one key way you spend many of the cards is in diplomatic events. These are events that pop up, either organically or when played by another empire, and affect every empire equally. However, there are boons both for the empire who placed the most votes in favor of the motion and to the one who placed the most opposed votes, depending on whether the motion ends up passing or failing.\n\nThese are often significant bonuses, and thus it can be worth going after them, plus there's the matter of the actual policy being voted upon and the outcome you desire for it. It becomes a tug of war for votes one way or the other before time expires on the vote, and you can either spend Influence to cast votes with certain cards, or you can offer gifts to empires who supply at least a given number of votes for or against the motion, according to your request. It's fascinating little minigame that makes the political side of the game fun and engaging.\n\n- The creation of races is pretty fun as well, and not extremely time consuming even if you want to bring in custom portraits and flags. The latter is simply a matter of dropping PNG images in the appropriate folders. The rest is a matter of choosing options for your civilization using a point-buy system. Similar to customization in the Endless 4X games. What makes it feel cooler, however, is the fact that you get two very specific types of options that feel like they have a pretty big impact as opposed to the options in similar systems: government and FTL method. Your choice of government dictates several starting bonuses for your empire, and certain choices will even affect your play style for the rest of the game. FTL method is something I'd never have thought of myself; you pick how your race achieves faster than light travel. You can build gates that allow fleets to jump between them, similar to the FTL in Mass Effect lore, you can have your race build standard old jump drives, tear holes in time and space to achieve instantaneous travel... Or, for a huge increase in points to spend on other aspects of your civilization, you can say you haven't even achieved FTL travel.\n\nThere are several more things, and I could rant all day, but this review has already gone on far longer than I'd have liked. The summary: Star Ruler 2 innovates the genre in an astounding way, and is proving to be the most fun I've had with a 4X game since Civilization was a new series to me. It's a breath of fresh air that I feel is precisely what this genre needed. I've owned the game for around 20 hours and have been playing for nearly half of those; I can easily see myself playing for 150 more.","June 11, 2015","true","131.9"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","50","52","0","2"

This is a complex game that doesn't have a big learning curve and is extremly addictive. Below i will describe the elements I like and some improvements that could be made.\n\nEmpire Management:\nIn most space rts games your star systems are pretty much self reliant and doesnt require reasources to travel from one system to another. Here, if you want to have a powerful industrial/economic/science system you will need that primary stystem to have trade connections to other systems. Each planet can level up, increasing the population and amount of structures that can be built on them but to level up the planet must meet certain reasource requirements (example to get to level 1, a planet must import food and water from both a food and water planet). What this does is allows the player to have multiple home worlds that have a specific purpose (industrial,economic,science) thus opening up a wide range of tactics an enemy can use to damage an empire. It's difficult to explain but once you see it for yourself it makes perfect sense.\n\nFleet Management\nthe combat in this game is all about building fleets and the start of every fleet begins with a flagship. Once you have a flagship built you can link multiple support ships, the only limit being the number of support points a flagship has and that number gets bigger the larger the flagship is so a size 100 flagship may only support a size 300 support fleet whereas a size 500 flagship can support 3000 using the right modules. Which brings us to....\n\nShip Design\nLike other space RTS games you can design the internal specs of your falgships and support ships (weapons, armor, shields, command and control modules ect) which allows you to change your tactics when approaching an enemy. Maybe you want a flagship designed around amassing a huge fleet, or a flagship that is a WMD, its all whatever you make of it.\n\nCombat\nSupport ships will always stay in formation with the flagship so managing which supportships go with which flagship is not an issue as they are linked. This makes it easy to coordinate offensives and defenses with multiple flagships. in combat your flagship targets an enemy flagship (or whatever target you specify) and the fleet engages. It's very simple with the fleet management that is implemented here and it looks epic when you have massive fleets duking it out.\n\nDiplomacy\nThis is the crown jewel imo. In most space rts's diplomacy takes a backseat with very limited options. Here it's a card game.... Not kidding, it's all about using influence (a reasource you aquire from specific planets) to buy cards that pop up from time to time. Certain cards are very desirable and your enemy may buy them before you do if you aren't quick enough. For example certain cards allow you to capure an entire solar system without ever firing a shot. Such cards when you use them bring up a galactic vote where you can use negotiation cards to win favor and it turns into a game of who has the more votes wins! It's pure genius and much like how politics works in real life. (it's all about political capital)\n\nThere are some things that could use some improvement but i expect some of these things could be handled with mods. For example there could be more ship designs and different ship formations. The graphics are also not stellar (no pun intended) but that also allows for bigger fleets and smoother gameplay (I haven't run into any latency at all). A storyline would also help not only get new people into the game and learn the mechanics but also immerse people into the lore of the game.\n\nI think that's enough from me, this is a must buy for any fan of the space RTS genre that crushes others like it. I'm suprised I only heard of this after scrolling through page 10 of steam's top sellers in the strategy section.","December 29, 2014","true","52.9"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","48","50","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/recommended/282590/","doc_rock2","Doc Rock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/","485 products in account","Star Ruler 2 Review\nStar Ruler 2, a sequel to Blind Mind Studios' original Star Ruler game, is an ambitious endeavor that offers players a true 4X Space RTS experience on an enormous scale. For all of you Fleet Admirals, Squadron Commanders, X-Wing Aces, and Space Pirates who are thinking you've already been there and done that...guess again. Star Ruler 2 brings new dimensions to the sci-fi arena that will offer up exciting new challenges for even the most veteran strategy gamers.\n\nIn Star Ruler 2, players will choose a race and set out to conquer the galaxy by supreme domination. There are 7 basic races with their own unique bonuses and methods of space travel. Each race can be customized and since the game is extremely mod-friendly, its fair to say more races will likely be added by the community. Customization options range from choosing empire colors and logos to method of hyperspace travel and ship architectural style. Race bonuses can also be customized, basic ship styles can be modified, and even more can be added. In fact, most everything in this game can be changed. I did say this game is extremely mod-friendly.\n\nAfter selecting your race, there are a number of additional options offered for generating your game before you begin and this is where Star Ruler 2 should start to really impress strategy veterans. There are a number of gaming options available to allow players to set victory conditions, resource scarcity, etc and even the size of your galaxy (referenced in system size and planetary frequency). Galaxies are then randomly generated and can range from a few dozen to a seemingly infinite number of planets based on the settings you select. But there's more. A ton of opponents can be added to your game both in single-player mode versus computer-controlled AI players and in multiplayer mode. According to Blind Mind, their custom designed Starflare Engine (built specifically to run this game) fully utilizes even multi-core cpu's so galaxies can be as big as you want up to your system's capabilities. After some experimentation of my own, I have no reason to think any different.\n\nAnother cool feature that makes Star Ruler 2 unique is how the galactic structure and planetary system works. The galaxy, regardless of size, is divided into a multitude of star systems and each system contains a number of planets and asteroids that revolve around the central star similar to how our own solar system works. The planets are random and some have added features or bonuses. All planets produce a type of resource and can be colonized, or populated, and planets can be upgraded to a maximum of five levels. Each planetary level will add more infrastructure and population. However, every level will require additional resources to be imported from other colonized planets forming a supportive network. Therefore, players must strategically choose which planets they want to further develop and decide what direction of development (also referred to as pressure) you want this planet to follow. Labor, income, or research pressures are primary examples and your planet's civilians will automatically construct production buildings to support the pressure type.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning. There are many other cool features in Star Ruler 2. The space battles will be epic - thousands of ships involved in a single fight! Asteroids can be mined for precious minerals by building a mining base on them or deploying mining ships to harvest the resources. Planets can construct entire fleets of ships, an assortment of buildings for infrastructure, and a number of space structures such as defensive platforms, outposts or even an orbital ring around a planet that can be populated. Ships are assigned to groups for simpler control. They can all be customized and upgraded in numerous ways. Players can even design their own custom ships and add them to the game or share with the community. Through space exploration, players might discover artifacts that provide powerful benefits. The unique Diplomatic System of Star Ruler 2 is an extremely powerful tool that players will want to check out. The way the budget runs in three minute cycles before resetting as opposed to trickling into a gigantic resource pool is another dimension that makes the game different from all the others on a strategic level. And naturally, there is a wide assortment of research technologies to be learned and utilized. Don't forget the multiplayer cross-platform features and remember that the game is hot-wired for modding. Players can even access the community workshop mods through the game's easy-to-use interface.\n\nStarting to get the idea? Star Ruler 2 is truly a grand strategy sci-fi adventure and offers numerous hours of gameplay with high replay value. The graphics will not blow you away, but they are solid and very well done. Zooming in using the fully rotating camera will reveal rich detailed graphics and everyone should enjoy the hyperspace jump sequence. The audio and soundtrack are quality and the overall user interface is very simple and easy to navigate. Time can be sped up or paused at will. There is a tutorial included so that players can quickly learn the basic game mechanics without being overwhelmed. Unfortunately there is no single-player campaign included though and don't expect any cut-scenes or voice-overs to provide any type of back story. The Star Ruler universe just simply is...\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Variety of races and abilities\n+  Custom ship-building\n+  Unique Diplomatic System that integrates into gameplay well\n+  Large assortment of Researches\n+  Tons of customization options\n+  Quality Graphics & Sound\n+  Single Player & Multiplayer modes\n+  Simple controls and easy-to-use UI\n+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n+  Extremely mod-friendly\n+  High Replay Value\n+  In-game access to Help, Wiki, & Workshop\n+  Tutorial included\n+  Auto-save w/ options[/i]\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  Lack of a single-player campaign or storyline\n-  Research honeycomb is a cluttered mess/confusing\n-  Mouseovers for many options and settings do not display info\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n=========== Star Ruler 2 is one of the best 4X Space RTS games out there. With a few additional tweaks and components it could possibly become one of the best all-time. It offers numerous features and a unique style compared to similar games. From a strategic perspective, it offers players a multitude of options and will challenge players on most any difficulty setting. The graphics could probably be better but I feel that it was a conscious choice to scale them down a bit in order to allow for more players to be able to enjoy the game, particularly in multiplayer which is really what this game is built for, although it can still be a lot of fun in single-player mode. Whatever your preference, I strongly recommend this game to all space strategy fans!\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","April 15, 2015","true","34.2"," 64 of 77 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","64","77","0","3"

It also has some elements that are very different and unique, which take some getting used to but I think are things that I would really like to see future 4x games model themselves on.\n\nI really like how SR2 handles the economy model. Each planet has a resource token, and you improve planets by connecting them with supply lines to other planets. So for example to get a level 2 planet you will need to connect it to a level 1 planet, and a level 0 planet. And that level 1 planet will itself need to be connected to two level 0 planets. Leveling up your planets allows them to generate more player resources (money initially, and then the other resources too as the civilian economy builds up), which you then use to spend on stuff like normal.\n\nUnlike other 4x games where building your economy means collecting resources from the environment and spending them on upgrades, in SR2 you essentially build your economy by gaining access to planets (by colonization or by force) which you then use to create a web of supply lines. There's a lot more depth to it than that, but there's the basic idea.\n\nIt's very different from other 4x games and kind of board-game like. It also takes some getting used to, but I love it. Supply lines REALLY MATTER in this game, and it makes strategic warfare really interesting. While in other 4x games you kind of just build the biggest stacks you can and throw them at your enemy's homeworld, in SR2 it really pays off to figure out what systems form the "critical link" in your enemy's supply chain, and strike there. While likewise protecting your own critical systems.\n\nSure you can try smashing your fleets into the enemy's home planets, but generally highly developed worlds also have large automatically generated defense fleets to go with them. Meanwhile, breaking that link could cause those powerhouse level 4 or 5 planets to start turning back into level 2s or 1s!\n\nThere's also lots more about this game that I really like, the diplomacy system, the ship building system. It's really fun watching the back-and-forth on a contentious issue in a diplomacy vote, or trying to push your side of a vote with the right use of diplomacy cards. Diplomacy is another one of the game's strong points, but this review is already long enough.  I've also spent hours in the ship design sandbox playing with designs, it's a fairly solid system, even if the hex grid causes ships to be a bit oddly shaped sometimes.\n\nAnd now to the minuses. The game REALLY needs better documentation. While the tutorials and tooltips do an adequate job, it takes some time to get the gist of things, and there are a few UI tricks (like using the mousewheel when transferring ships between fleets) that you can only find out about by searching online. It took me several hours into my second game before the philosophy behind the economy in this game really clicked (which is why I made sure to describe it above, once I realized the idea behind it, my enjoyment of the game literally went up an order of magnitude). Other things like how damage penetrates into the insides of ships along lines on the ship's blueprint's hex grid (which has a big impact on how you design ships), you can only find out through playing the game, really. The default race portraits are kind of bland looking, but that was easily solved by picking up a portrait pack from the Workshop.\n\nEven if everything was well documented, the game still has a fairly steep learning curve. Even if you are a 4x veteran, I highly recommend starting your first game with all AIs on the lowest possible difficulty setting. Yes, the one lower than "easy," and starting a new game once you've mastered the basics of building an economy up to at least the tier III level. It does take some time to get used to SR2's way of doing things, but once you do I really think there is a lot to like about it.","February 8","true","50.1"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","45","49","0","1"

I must admit I am positively impressed by this game, in fact, so much, that it convinced me to write my first steam review.\n\nDisclaimer: I won the game in a contest organized by spacesector.com I try to be as objective as possible but the fact that I didn't pay for the game might affect my judgement, therefore I mention that, just to be honest.\n\nThe positives:\n- Hands down the best diplomacy/politics system in 4x game I've seen. The diplomacy and politics is conducted via cards that you can buy or use with influence (which is an in-game resource). The cards can be used to various benefits, like buffing your planets or ships, or getting a short term empire-wide bonuses, or even forcing opponents to cede their planets or systems. This system is surprisingly deep and enjoyable and really makes you feel like a leader of an empire, mettling with galaxywide affairs.\n- Great sense of scale. The empires are big and depending on map, they can spread across several galaxies. You can build a battleship the size of a star. Nothing holds you really.\n- Clear and interesting economy system. Economy in SR2 is all about creating a supply chain of goods, to develop your planets. While your empire might consist of hundreds of planets, just a couple of them can get developed to a high level and be really relevant as commerce hubs, research centers or factory worlds. That system is both deep and not too overwhelming. There is a degree of automation, and while you have means to affect that, the worlds mostly develop by themselves. Considering the scale, the management of your empire is rather intuitive and pleasant.\n- The degree of freedom. You can create planets and even whole solar systems. You can design your ships freely.\n\nThe ones that depend on your perspective:\n- The game can become complicated. It streamlines and automates plenty of things, but sheer scale might be overwhelming at times, especially that it is not turn-based but real time. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of everything. That might however not be a problem to veterans of the genre.\n- Technologies are mostly passive upgrades. It has a big advantage, because that means you don't have to refit your ships everytime you research something new, however they are by no means as interesting and meaningful as the system of MoO2.\n- The combat system is focused on macromanagement. While it's not bad as some claim, you are not just ordering 2 blobs to fight each other, you can't order singular ships. It has plenty of mechanics that must be taken into account like logistics, ship design and their orders. However the battles on tactical level fight by themselves. You are just dispatching fleets, not really fighting battles.\n- Some aspects of the game are not explained well. The game is deep as I said and there are a lot of underlying mechanics, just some of which are covered in tutorial. It has a steep learning curve (which I guess should be expected) and in your first matches you'll probably don't know what you are doing. Not a big deal for vets I guess though.\n\nThe negatives:\n- The game lacks personality of lets say MoO2. I feel the races are dull and not distinctive. While they differ a lot when it comes to mechanics and are interesting on that level, all have access to the same ship designs and technology, they don't communicate with you, don't taunt you. Also there are no admirals or governors.\n\n\nAll in all I wholeheartedly recommend it. It's pretty stellar :)","July 10, 2015","true","21.1"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","45","50","0","2"

I've played virtually every 4X ever released for the PC, starting with the original Civilization all the way to the newest releases such as Endless Space. None of those games have come close adding the same amount innovation as Star Ruler 2, and I'm afraid I won't enjoy any other other 4X from here on out. Why? Because Star Ruler 2 breaks the old rules, distilling the genre down to what is fun, and minimizing what is not.\n\neXplore: You are rewarded for early exploration, just as in many of the modern 4x titles. However, In Star Ruler 2 this is particually important and exiting because you need certain types of planets to have an effective empire - money, labor, research. High-grade planets of these types can be rare to find, and may result in early conflict. The AI also does a great job of\n\neXpand: In a typical 4X expansion is a multi-step, time consuming, and once the shooting starts - tedious process. I want to focus on combat, not on building a new granary out on an island somewhere. Large empires becomes an especially annoying chore; turn after turn going through dozens of cities / colonies, with only a few actually contributing to the war effort. Star Ruler 2 requires literally less than one click to colonize in some cases. Planets require no management. Furthermore, which planets to expand to is a strategic decision based on income, boundary disputes with other empires, future expected resources, and strategic / tactical value.\n\neXploit: Planets typically only have one resource. Lesser resources are exported to planets with greater resources, forming supply chains. You can build structures on your planets, but mostly you don't need to; structures are built automatically based on the type of resources supplied to the planet. If you do build, it's not usually for the benefit of the planet itself (the granary example), but to address higher level tactical concerns such as increasing your combat reserve cap. This is a more fun and direct expression of what you do in other 4x games anyway, with a few key colonies contributing to the war effort.\n\neXterminate: Star Ruler 2 lets you build your own ships from the hex-up. This directly ties into the combat system, with a hex-based damage system. You can place weapons on the sides of your ship to make them less vulnerable to being disabled by frontal attacks. You can add interior armor to protect your reactor from going offline. You can add bulkheads to internal systems to increase their toughness, at at greater cost. There's no limit to the number or size of ships in a fleet. And for the first time I've ever seen, larger ships are not automatically better for the cost, such that a mixed fleet is superior to a single large ship.\n\nThe diplomacy system feels like actual diplomacy, with an intelligent AI making good decisions behind it. You use a resource called influence to buy cards, which you spend for various effects such as negotiation points, planet annexation, or becoming the galactic senator. Use too much influence on one measure and you may not be able to get your way on a later more important measure.\n\nUp until about 20 hours in I lost the majority of my battles because the AI just plays that well. It does a great job at picking when to attack, attacking with coordinated fleets, and responding to your own attacks.\n\nIn summary, I don't usually spend this much time on a Steam review but Star Ruler 2 wasn't even reviewed at all by the major gaming outlets. It's true that many aspects of the game could be explained better given how complex the game is. Still, the developer did an overall excellent job on all aspects of the development and I feel deserves more credit.","April 25","true","67.8"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","37","39","0","0"

If you didn't spend your budget then the excess will be transfered to either diplomacy, science, labor, energy or defense. You can also spend all your money for each budget but it means that you won't boost one of the resource listed above.\n\n2) Diplomacy is played through cards. Each card is an action, a vote or a proposition. All these cards are purchased with the diplomacy resource from a global pool showing who purchased what. The cards are sold in a kind of auction system so if you have a strategy and you really need to purchase a specific card then you will have to pay early and pay more for it. You can also purchase the leftovers and try a more defensive diplomatic approach while you beat your enemy with military.\n\n3) You cannot just colonize each planet as soon as you discover them.. This is how the game limits the "rush to expansion". If you just rush and colonize every planet you will find that your planets won't produce any money and will in fact cost you money. Planets have level, ranging from 0 (colony) to 5 (huge metropol).  For a planet to produce money you have to upgrade it (starting from a L0 colony) by providing it with resources from other planets. In the end your empire will look like a pyramid of planets, a lot of small planets providing food, water and material to bigger and bigger planets. This works well, you can choose to auto-upgrade your planets and the game will make the import/export of resources for you. Some people prefer to optimize it and do everything by themselves.If you are a min-maxer you will find plenty of mechanism to keep you busy. For example the game let you unlock new systems for your ships through the research tree and then it's up to you to come with a new design including what you just discovered. (You can also download new designs from the workshop if you are uninspired). Nearly each planet comes with a specific resource which will boost something in your empire (production,research,diplomacy,etc) of unique features so if you enjoy fine tuning things you will be fine.\n\nOn the downside, the research tree is a mess, it's difficult to find which technology you are currently researching but it makes the job. The main map can also be a mess when many races have overlapping systems, the frontiers become nearly impossible to read. But all of this is cosmetic and the core of the game is really good. The AI also tends to surrender too easily to another AI, which makes the endgame snowballing against you if you are too cautious.\n\nTL;DR\nThe game needs more polish but this is a very solid, features filled RTS game.","June 7, 2015","true","196.4"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"

I like the diplomacy part of the game, it's better with more participants. I have won matches without firing a shot just due to good diplomacy. The card system is perfect.\n\nThe tech tree is a mess. The developers may have had a logical flow in mind but whatever they were thinking I don't see it. The tech upgrades go all over the place and don't seem to fall in a logically linear order that we see in many other similar games.\n\nThe planet management portion is probably the biggest part of the game. Upgrades to make planets more capable require certain planet types. The level five planets require a huge chain of planets. Lose a planet at the bottom of the chain and a large portion of your chain of upgrades comes slowly crashing down, along with your income.\n\nFleet management is rather easy, the flag ship-support ship relationship is ingenious.\n\nShip design is an art form. Literally. It's like a mini-game in itself, just trying to get the most effective ship design with what tech you have, interior space and funding available. The more you design and test in battle the better you'll get. Note that the support ships can perform certain roles within the fleet, like protecting the flagship, killing the opposing flagship, etc. So you can design support ships to fit those roles.\n\nThe only thing i've not really figured out is the rate at which you gain anything other than money... influence, energy, FTL, etc.\n\nOtherwise I like the game.","October 14, 2015","true","81.5"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","1"

I will release a new one when the game comes out. Ps. It's awesome buy it if you like RTS's or if you like fun.\n_____________________________________________________________________\n(Edits now at the bottem of the review)\n\n(Excuse the terrible grammer and such.) (12am and I'm tired.)\n\nSince this game seems to be getting more hate than love I thought I'd throw in my two logical cents in, and take a real look at this game.\n\nIn it's current state (7/21/2014) the game is playable and very enjoyable. Im not a big fan of Rts games when it comes to space. I've played sins and AI war, neither seemed to grasp me as this game has. Sins is certainly enjoyable, and has a slight one up when it comes to combat. However sins is a fully realized game and is complete. This isnt, and thats what people need to realize when it comes to early access games. AI war in my oppinion was a mess. I'm sure it was a great game but the UI just made my mind explode. Star Ruler 2 has a fantasic UI and an awesome alert system on the right side of the screen. The UI reminds me a bit of paradox's games, CK2, and Europa. In regards to visablity and ease of access that is.\n\nComparasins aside:\n\nThe diplomacy, from what I've seen, Is very orginal and fun. It keeps you on your toes and makes diplomacy a real part of the game, and not so much as a side mechanic. It has you buying cards. The cards are used in a multitude of ways, from an eco boost, to the annexation of an entire star system.\n\nEconomy is in my oppinion very fun. Planets need resources from other planets to help your population grow and become more andvanced. There are tierd resources that go up to 3 and range from common to uncommon. There are even special resources that you can export to certain planets for an added boost to a certain stat. Aside from planets you can also mine comets and astroids to gain more reasources.\n\nResearch is a bit lack luster. Dev's can correct me if im wrong, but I've heard that they will be working on it more and making it more intresting. As it is now, you pick a catagory to research and depending on your science per minute you will accumulate points in that catagory until its complete. With ceratin tech, you will get these other things that go with them. (I'm %0 sure on what these are or how that work) From what I've seen, you get a point to spend after youve researched 4 peices of tech. That point is random in its specialty, but with that point you can spend it in the special things youve gotten from past tech. (If this review gets popular, the devs might want to put in how it actually works, otherwise I can edit this once I figure more out.)\n\nI also can't really speak for the ship building as I havn't really used it. I've heard that the ship building will also be worked on extensivly. (I may be wrong on this too.)\n\nThe combat is not special but has potential. You can do cool moves with the FTL drives but besides that, you kinda just build your ships and throw them at the enemy.\n\nMy favorite things about this game:\n\n-You can explore space in anyway you like (Sub-light, FTL, there are no set paths)\n\n-THE ♥♥♥♥ING PLANETS DONT ALL ROTATE AROUND ONE STAR (♥♥♥♥ really bugged my about sins)\n\n-You can manage buildings on your planets\n\n\nThings I don't really like:\n\n-The 2D artwork is a bit nasty. I really hope it's a place holder (profiles, buildings on the planet view)\n\n-The lack of races to choose from. (betting that there will be more)\n\n-Combat could be a little more interactive. Rather than just throw stuff at eachother\n-I would like to see maybe some fleet formations that you could set\n-Maybe some sepical heavy weapons\n-Really you can do a lot with combat\n\n\n(This review will be edited in the future) (Prolly left some stuff out by mistake)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEdit 1:\n\nI forgot to say that there's also an ingame wiki that works really well!\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI would really love to see some patch notes on the game. Like an archive. I do realize that there is a live patch notes discussion on the steam fourms. However thats only talking about up coming patches, and isn't reported down somewhere after it goes live. (There might already be something like this, I could be really blind)\n\nEdit 3:\n\nSadly I've gotten two crashes now, once when first starting a game and the second was during a game in which I had put in good couple of hours into. Save often if you dont wanna end up like me ;_;. Dev's Please fix.","July 22, 2014","true","19.5"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","45","54","0","0"

Nope your planets basically run themselves without the need for these in fact what they need are items you have to import from others in a glorified connect the dots experiment.\n\nYour income doesn't pool up instead your on a budget that resets after every cycle.\n\nResearch is capped in that you cannot level a type of research over and over instead there are x amount of research options with x amount cost involved in unlocking them.\n\nSome changes in shipbuilding schematics:\n\nFirstly now most support ships don’t have a power requirement unless you research shields and give them those.\n\nSchematics now called designs abandon the old way of doing it and now use hexes that you place on a hex grid. While this sounds good at first you will quickly be asking yourself, why can I specify size of my ship then still have to scale things on the hex-grid compared to adding different size components in like in Star Ruler 1.\n\nAdditionally this system is a bit strange in my opinion. If you create a probe using 3 hexes it will cost more than a fully fledged out scout ship?\n\nMining asteroids is your fancy? Well give up here you wont be making civilian ships anyway... yip no more miners, traders, colonizers, repair ships, scanning ships, heck military vessels don’t even have boarding parties.\n\nAll this aside the game gets you in combat quickly and fleets are controlled by flag ships that replenish their support ships which make the game allot easier to micromanage so you can get straight to the combat.\n\nOverall I understand many gamers are put off by StarRuler 1 however Star Ruler 1 is the most unique game in its genre and the most complicated. Its  a jewel that this game is not even close to.\n\nAs for this game I personally think Sins of the solar empire is more fun. Want space combat? That game has awesome graphics too!\n\nNow only if Star Ruler 1 was on linux like this game is I'd play so much more. 1 up to the developors for supporting another OS in this build!","January 7, 2015","false","63.3"," 135 of 200 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","135","200","6","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/acepilotf14/recommended/282590/","acepilotf14","Ace♡","http://steamcommunity.com/id/acepilotf14/","604 products in account","First of all, I'm a fan of 4x games. Now, I've somewhat strayed away from them over time; I've found a differing love for grand strat in the vein of Paradox games, specifically the economical and political ones such as Victoria 2. I ended up having a distaste for civ 5 and certain other new games (the endless bunch, etc) because they were just.. well, either too easy, or too messy. Several decent ideas wrapped in a gross tortilla, or something like that. I started to dislike how board-gamey they got to cater to the people who couldn't stand micro. I hadn't even really heard of Star Ruler 2(SR2) until earlier today, when I saw Scott Manley blow up a black hole. I pretty much bought it on the spot.\n\nI've not played SR1.\n\nSteam says I've played almost 8 hours of this game. An hour of that was in the tutorial and a 'practice' game I played, and the other seven hours were in a full game I did. The full game took place in two galaxies of 40 and 30 planets respectively, with myself and 4 AIs. I used a custom race.\n\nI will go through each of what I feel are the main elements of a 4x game, rate them, compare them, and write criticisms.\n\n--- The UI ---\nPositives: One of the biggest dinks that most 4x games get- the user-friendliness of the UI. It is understandable, as pushing enough information to the user that's required can sometimes leave the UI cluttered, with too many buttons, too many numbers, etc.. SR2 does both extremely well and somewhat poorly in this regard, neutralizing out to it having a decent UI. The big pluses are fantastic- the game operates in a tabbed format with different types of windows, so if you want to have four tabs for your best planets, you can. You can customize your different views of the galaxy, zoom to them at will, etc- keep a tab open for research, keep a tab open for whatever you want, really. The quick-ui that shows fast info on the side of the screen is also fairly informative, and makes it easy to do things at a glance.\n\nIt also doesn't restrict much of what you can do, as you can affect the game using the UI (tethering planets for trade is one of the most important game mechanics as I will explain later, and you can tether a planet from its notice on the ui, for example). For what it does, the UI is extremely functional, and superior to its competitors. The built-in wiki that runs very well and the IRC to get quick help/talk to other players is also very nice, as while I may not want to play multiplayer at this time, I do still like talking to other players.\n\nNegatives: On even a medium sized map, the UI gets extremely cluttered near the end of the game. You get lost in a sea of information that takes quite a while to discern exactly what you want to do. A lot of the 'resource icons' on planets are fairly small, so when I'm looking at 20 unused resources I seriously have to mouse over to see what each one is, unless it's something very easy to remember and see like water. There are quite a few resources, so I can't imagine how to fix this without shafting users with a lower resolution.\n\nThe technology grid is a chore. It's somewhat difficult at a glance to tell what is researched and what isn't, what is available and what is. It took me much longer than it should have to even find the starting point of the grid. In most other 4x games, even Distant Worlds, the research grid/chart is extremely easy to understand, though the actual contents of it may not be. Greying out techs you can't even possibly buy yet(but you can still mouse over for info) would be a huge step in the right direction. It's also sometimes hard to tell where the tech grid is going.. it will end up in weird places that aren't really logically conducive to itself. Overall, the grid isn't very nice to look at. I'm sure familiarization with it would help, but compared to something like Endless Legend which has a pretty good tech grid system, this is just a bit too ambiguous.\n\nThe technology grid has been redone to be easier to understand and find what you're looking for.\n\n--- Core Mechanics ---\n\nJust like every other 4x game, the core mechanics are to build your empire, strengthen your military, create a massive economy, protect your borders or crush your enemies, and be the dominant empire on the map. SR2 uses some traditional 4x systems (such as the building construction), some things of its own design, and things from other genres. The game, first of all, runs in real time. You can slow down, speed up, and pause the game. It is not the pseudo-realtime of Paradox games- it is true real time. Thankfully, everything happens slow enough at 1x speed that it is not much of an issue. The most imporatant part of the game is managing your resources, colonizing useful planets, leveling up your core worlds, and making economic powerhouses. The game REQUIRES expansion; you cannot support a huge economy by trade alone, and there is no way to turtle. I think it is one of the few games where I got to the end of my expansion and truly started eyeing my neighbors for what they have, rather than being content with my borders while being able to endlessly improve on itself. You 'tether' trade from worlds to other worlds, leveling them up by tethering a certain amount of resources to a specific world. For example, it takes merely food and water to level a planet up to level 1. After that, it requires more food to sustain the higher population, plus raw materials of some kind to create planetary 'production' which is reflected in a higher population, level, labour (production), and more things.\n\nEach colonized planet has a single resource, and rarely two (typically one that it supplies to itself for free). Some resources have extra special effects, such as increasing research, influence (to be explained), or your 'energy'(also to be explained).\n\nThis leads to feeding all your expansion planets into one of your core worlds to make a few very powerful economic powerhouses; managing all your resources to efficiently make as many strong planets as possible to support a larger military and production base. No longer can one create a Venice and protect it only; you MUST keep your logisitical supply lanes protected, as one lost system can break your whole economic structure down and require a full restructuring. This is the core, and the essence of the game. It reminds me very dsitinctly of the Anno series, though you do not specifically need certain resources to enhance planets.\n\nAlthough you may find yourself strained for resources, there are ways to increase your number of planets without conquest. There are a few 'relic' type things scattered around the map which let you do things like create new stars, new planets, etc etc. There are lots of cool things. Using one of these requires energy, which is gained via research and resources. Energy is simply a 'mana' type substance which is used to activate these abilities and certain extra special abilities ships have that can be equipped later via technology, such as blink. These types of abilities are very cool, and you definitely start to feel like an interstellar god as your empire grows bigger.\nConstruction is based on the civilian sector. Much like Distant Worlds, you, as a federal government, have little control over your civilian sector. It automatically constructs cities and improvements on your planets as long as you supply them correctly. There are buildings you can put on planets which are expensive and cost upkeep, but for the most part, civilians and the AI take care of everything on the surface. Orbital space stations are player-built, at least.\n\nSteam reviews has a limit on characters, so please go here to continue reading:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/282590/discussions/1/611703999978496608/\nThanks if you got this far already!","April 20, 2015","true","18.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","3"

Redone and changed entirely from the now 'staple' civilization-style diplomacy system, for the better in the extreme.\nShip Design? Early in its design but the overall idea is far better and really only needs more hull types and subsystems to be better than SR1's system.\nEconomy? Truly beautiful. Possibly complicated or difficult to manage for some, but they are definitely adding things to streamline it- from autoimporting resources at the click of a mouse to a "Planets" tab that lets you glance at the page and see your entire economic trade network instantly. A breath of fresh air from the fragility and unimportance of the planets in SR1, the planets in SR2 are very important especially when you take the time to upgrade their Tier.\n\nI realize this review is rather unspecific regarding the game mechanics, but I feel a lot of the other reviews cover them well enough and the nuances of the mechanics are technically still liable to change anyway.

Thankfully, after playing the game, I can say that the loyalty was well deserved. Where Star Ruler was a game of potential, but lacking little polish, Star Ruler 2 is a game that has ample servings of both. Wether you are looking to build a massive empire, or just see glorious battles of sheer carnage, Star Ruler 2 will sate your cravings.\n\nStill in Beta, the game already has most of the groundwork that will enable it to be played for hours on end. Be it the designing of ships from the bottom up, the beatiful beams of light sending ships to their oblivion, or the much more accessible UI, the game is a testament to developers who have a vision, and though they have made mistakes along the way, aren't above learning from their mistakes to create a better game. They have taken what works from the original game and worked it into a much higher quality version.\n\nThe accessibility of the developers is also a huge plus to this game. Whereas many titles on early access have a hit or miss relationship with the developers, often times devolving into sporadic comments on a monthly basis, the Star Ruler 2 team has taken the initiative to integrate an IRC into the game, allowing instantaneous, or near to depending on work/sleep schedules, interaction with the developers.\n\nIf you are interested in playing an Early Access game done right, and want to see your own ships, or the enemies, blowing up in the process, Star Ruler 2 is the game for you.","October 30, 2014","true","36.4"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","25","27","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weenp/recommended/282590/","weenp","Dalo Lorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weenp/","13 products in account","Well, this is long overdue, and I still feel I'm going to do it wrong, but... better do it now and try to help out, I guess.\n\nSo, I'm going to start this review off with a bit of background information to explain just why I think this game, despite some shortcomings, might be the best thing that has happened to the 4X genre since its equivalent of sliced bread:\n\nIts predecessor, Star Ruler, was characterized by the devs as 'a mod for its engine', with SR2 being said to be even more so. Indeed, if you stripped away all the stuff that could be read in a human-comprehensible form by something as simple as Notepad, the only thing left aside from the core engine's binaries (which presumably handle files, graphics, sounds and all that backend stuff no sane or insane modder would need to tamper with) would be textures, models, sounds and particle systems. (And you can change those, too - you just need proper tools to handle all of those except the particles, which are handled by a built-in particle editor.)\n\nAll of the game's logic and mechanics are exposed to anyone with an understanding of AngelScript - starship movement, AI, the Senate, even the code responsible for displaying the main menu instead of an empty black screen, for crying out loud! If Space Empires 4 and 5, Star Wars: Empire at War (not a 4X, but it gets some pretty significant mods anyway, and some of the teams there moved on to SOASE) or Sins of a Solar Empire could have been considered 'very moddable', SR2  probably goes off the scale.\n\nModding enthusiast's ranting aside, the base game is nice:\n\nCustomization: While it lacks the ability to write up your own lore for custom races (something that I admit I never took advantage of in Space Empires), racial customization is fairly meaningful, with 7 (more with mods) lifestyles which change the way the race plays in large or small ways, depending on the lifestyle. Governments have more of an early-game impact, while your choice of FTL method, like your choice of lifestyle, necessarily affects the way you run your empire. Another more subtle way of making your race stand out has yet to be released, and will (if the devs' plans don't deviate from my current observations) be arriving with the free DLC or whatever they called it, somewhere during this summer.\n\nCustomizing ships is much more detailed. With a number of subsystems to choose from, you literally paint the layout of your ship (not entirely unlike Space Empires 5, though more free-form), which is then reflected on the ship's icon on the galactic map. Needless to say, the design of your ship also affects its combat performance in ways both subtle and overt alike.\n\nDiplomacy: The diplomatic system is simultaneously fairly underdeveloped (treaties and stuff) and quite well-developed. You only have a handful of treaty clauses with which to sign treaties, and you can go to war, make peace, surrender (doesn't remove you from the game, you now become a vassal and help your master win), and give various gifts. The main part of the game's diplomacy, however, revolves around obtaining various cards representing political actions - negotiation, abusing leverage, annexing planets... Doing all this stuff costs Influence, a resource which is generated in a fixed quantity and spread out amongst the empires based on their 'Influence Stake'. The more stake an empire has, the more influential it is, meaning one could hypothetically win a game through sheer power of influence. Bit of a long-term goal, though.\n\nEconomy: Past the initial stage of setting up your trade network, the micromanagement involved in running a star system is fairly minimal. Pressure from resources automatically instructs populations what 'civilian' buildings to use, and 'imperial' buildings are not something you simply spam whenever you can. There's a bunch of different planetary resources which contribute in different ways to leveling up your planets or producing global resources such as money, energy or influence.\n\nResearch: The somewhat chaotic, buff-driven (as opposed to giving new toys to play with) nature of the research grid has been criticized by some reviewers. I don't particularly have any feelings in either direction, and there are mods out there that attempt to change this, with Alarcarr's work on the grid in the 'Alternate Balance Expansion Mod' even being praised by at least one player.\n\nModdability: See the top of the review.\n\nScalability: With anywhere between 4 (or was it 5?) to over 1000+ star systems, and 2-28 (don't quote me on the upper limit, I just think I heard it somewhere) empires, the scale of the game depends solely on the desired duration and pace of the game, and the strength of your hardware. (I'm not from the fuuuuuture, and more than 8 empires in a game is not recommended except on a LAN.)\n\nThe game is not without its drawbacks, though, as is always the case:\n\nCombat: Yes, you can control your fleets in combat. (Which already tops all the Galactic Civilizations games! :P) You don't really get much out of it in most cases, though, as 'fleets' consist of an independent flagship and its armada of support ships, chained to the flagship. This is one of the things I dislike most about the game, really - it tends to just wind up as one supersized blob of ships flying in and fighting another supersized blob of ships until the bigger (or occasionally significantly better-designed) blob wins.\n\nUnfortunately, it's too late to make it a turn-based game with real-time tactical combat, so there's (relatively) little that can be done to improve it, but I think making the combat closer to SOASE would already have been an improvement.\n\nShip customization: Well, one thing that people might complain about is that the layout of your ship doesn't entirely matter when determining the ship's physical appearance. This isn't Galactic Civilizations 2 with its 3D ship designer. :P (Such a thing was considered, if I'm not mistaken, but was scrapped in favor of optimization, multiplying the maximum ship count by a factor of 1000. I kind of have mixed feelings about that, as there are already more than enough ships to go around, but I must confess that a full 3D designer would make shipsets much harder to create.)\n\nThe vanilla game only has 4 shipsets, one of which is older and lower in quality than the others. (Also, it's the smallest one there is, with only a handful of hulls.) Some have said that there aren't enough shipsets/hulls to go around. This, for one, has already been corrected by various modders and their shipsets, and yet more shipsets seem inevitable.\n\nDiplomacy: Like I said, the treaty side of SR2's diplomacy system is shallow compared to games like Space Empires 5. This, in my opinion, is still compensated for by the card side, but I felt I'd mention it anyway. (My pet peeve with it, though, is that you can only rename an object once. I have to find a way to make that work better. <.<)","May 5, 2015","true","734.7"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","4"

I'm not going to condemn it quite yet because I understand it is effectively in beta the same way Star Ruler 1 was when I purchased that game, but even in its beta I absolutely LOVED Star Ruler 1.  In comparison Star Ruler 2 just feels like a step backwards in several departments but I will try to sum up my opinions in point format.\n\nPros:\n1.  So far the audio that I've heard makes the audio in SR1 look like completel garbage, awesome job guys.\n2.  The graphics are current about on par with SR1, better in some regards, worse in others but I'm sure after they refine everything this will be like the audio making the graphics of SR1 look like crap.\n3.  Ship movement seems to be better in SR2 thatn SR1 so far and I can only assume it will improve.  I liked ship movement in SR1 but sometimes whatever controlled ship movement in SR1 would do silly amusing things that would require intervention.\n4.  While I've never been big on dealing with the diplomacy side of games as it isn't my thing, I can say thus far SR1 practically has no diplomacy in comparison to SR2.\n5.  Ability to not only add additional systems to a galaxy but to have multiple galaxies! I wanted this in SR1 so badly!\n\nCons:\n1.  Ship design - Okay, maybe I will condemn SR2 just a little bit.  SR2 has a ship design similar to other games I've played in the past and I absolutely hate this style.  SR2's ship design feels like the beta for a game that came out 10 years prior to SR1.  I'm sorry, I absolutely hate this new ship design method.  In my opinion you guys nearly had it perfect in SR1 and has been the best method I've used in any game to date.\n2.  Colonization & Planet development - I spend far more time in SR2 finding the planets I need and setting up routes than I would ever care to, this is such a huge complaint for me as it is a massive boring time waste to me and I don't to customize my planets nearly to the extent I could in SR1.  I end up searching through multiple systems on a constant basis trying to find all the requirements I need to set up a trade route to level up a planet and on a regular basis end up never colonizing some planets simply because I can't use the single resource they have and don't want to pay any upkeep for the stupid planet.  In SR1 no matter how small the planet was I could find some use for it, I could make a planet dedicated to research or producing food for my empire or just make a multi-purpose planet, I was truely the ruler of an empire where as in SR2 a planet is marked as 'fish' and that is all it can and ever will be.  I could go on about all the flaws of this system but suffice it to say I am seriously let down by it in comparison to SR1.\n3.  The research page is just bleh, I wish I could give more constructive examples/reasonings as to why I dislike it or how it could be improved but I honestly don't know at the moment.\n\nOthers: (I'm like 99% sure these will be resolved overtime but I feel I should mention them anyways)\n1.  Race portraits - Small selection and no where near as good as SR1 in my personal opinion, way to cartoonie\n2.  Racial traits - Very small selection limiting your ability to create a custom race\n3.  Unless I'm missing something I don't see anywhere to pick a ship set (what your ships will look like)\n4.  Very few sub systems to put in your ship designs\n5.  Lack of detailed descriptions for various items/objects\n\nI am still hoping with all my heart that SR2 will be a great successor to SR1 and will keep playing SR2 throughout its development, but as it stands right now I honestly couldn't reccomend this game to anyone as I just don't see the designers completely redesigning key parts of its system that I have such strong dislikes for such as the new ship designer.","July 24, 2014","false","21.9"," 72 of 110 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","72","110","0","0"

Really easy to manage without getting lost.\n+++++ The fact that you have a budget that you can spend and not treasury. It's indeed so in the real life macro economics.\n+++++ Planetary buildings and the fact that you have developed and non developed areas. very cool! Not so many choices for buildings, but that is ok it brings the complexity down.\n+++ You don't get lost in micromanaging your colonies, it's fairly easy and straightforward, you do not lose time with it.\n+++ Ship designer is pretty cool, not as cool as SD1 though, but still\n+++ The fact that you have resources, but not how you use them. Will get back to that.\n+++ Galactic senate and the voting and influencing principles. Extremely cool, Could be more developed, so that there are more economic decisions and things that affect your gameplay more directly, but the idea is perfect.\n+++ Artefacts, and anomalies. Niiice.\n+++ Multiple galaxies\n+++ Asteroids which you can mine\n\nWhat wasn't quite like what I would have liked:\n\n----- AI is not really challenging. I had 5 races in the game, one was hard. At some point I had like 25.000 points (diplomacy screen), and the hard computer had like 50.000. He started to subjugate other factions so I declared war to press the break for him. He had 0 ... none, zilch attack fleets. I conquered him in a matter of 20 minutes, bombed the planets did not want to occupy and good bye number 1...Everything he got in terms of military was stationed in orbit (only support ships) which I sniped from the distance with reaaaaally long range muon cannons. Which brings me to the next point:\n--- You can lineary increase your weapon range wihout limit by just putting more of the same weapon module next to each other. Does that mean that if the weapon is bigger will shoot farther? didn't really feel ok, you should have a limitation somewhere. I built a Titan with ONE Muon cannon that can fire across the solar system\n--- How the colonies evolve... completely dependent on one another. I think you should be able to upgrade your colonies somehow to get to level 5 on their own. Perhaps go into a direction (farming level 5, city planet level 5... and so on).\n--- How resources are used: I would imagine that for building a ship you need resources like steel, iron whatever the ship is made of. This is what I was expecting.\nI like for instance the idea in Sins of the Solar empire, where you accumulate resources and you need them to research build or as maintainance. This is something that I find realistic. Sending Explosives and Chemicals to a planet to increase it's level and still be a farming planet... well not really what I had in mind :-)\n--- Import/export : Economics and trade does not work that way. A government does not impose which resource goes where (well maybe perhaps in communism it does). However, trading should be based on demand/supply and not on what you want when you want it.\n- Diplomacy with other factions still needs work (I suppose it's beta this is why). No real espionage, and no real treaties actually. Completely non transparent on why they decline something when they do. Guess it's not ready\n\n\nSo from my point of view, on a 1 to 5 scale (1 is crap, 5 is excellent)\n\neXplore: 4.5\neXpand: 5\neXterminate: 4\neXploit: 4\n\nFrom my opinion, it's worth the 20 bucks already, really good potential, wating for the final release, I think it will be one of the big 4X Games in 2015.","March 17, 2015","true","14.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","22","25","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2k/recommended/282590/","x2k","XTRMNTR2K","http://steamcommunity.com/id/x2k/","701 products in account","A game that dares to be different that is actually good\n\nPlease note: My play time recorded by Steam is not representative; I have been testing and playing this game for at least several hundred hours on a non-Steam version of the game.\n\n\nStar Ruler 2 is a real-time 4X space strategy game. For those who do not know, the 4X stands for Explore, Expand, Exploit and Exterminate, though it wouldn't be fair to reduce the game to just these; there is much more to this game, and I would like to highlight the most important aspects:\n\nFirst off, ship design. SR1 veterans may take a bit of getting used to since it is now based on individual hexes, which definitely improves the depth and variety of the whole thing. To go a bit more into detail, ships are divided into flagships and support ships. Flagships are the big ones you give commands to and set out to explore (and conquer!) the galaxy (or multiple!) with. Support ships can then be 'attached' to these flagships (or planets / stations), depending on how much or if they have command capability to do so. Moreover, support ships are also considered sort of a 'resource' that can not just be constructed, but is also generated over time through use of the 'defense' resource; as a consequence, empires with high defense income may find it easier to replace lost support ships, though losing and replacing flagships will still put a strain on your economy and industry.\n\nAs for the blueprint design, flagship designs can be pretty complex - though not overly so - with subsystems that provide power, control, protection, firepower and various abilities. Support ships are designed in the same way, the difference being that they are not quite as complex. It is perfectly possible to play and win the game without ever changing existing designs or adding new ones however, though in that case you would limit your own fun as well as the chance to get more bang for your buck. Oh, and your ships and stations can be as numerous and big as your economy and industry can afford to build - can you say "Death Star"?\n\nAnother rather unique design feature of the game is the way that your economy is handled. Instead of continuously generating a steady stream of income that piles up until used, you get budget cycles. Each budget cycle lasts for several minutes, at the end of which the next one becomes active. Your budget does have an upper limit (depending on your economical power as well as research), so it makes sense to spend at least some of your budget before the next cycle begins; inversely, you may also watch your spending lest you accumulate debt - debt will reduce your growth in many aspects and is to be avoided.\nHowever, unspent budget is not simply lost but can be assigned to the generation of your other primary resources (influence, energy, defense, research), and you can actually go over your budget restriction through various means (i.e. the 'Profiteering' diplomacy card).\n\nAh, diplomacy... One of the most neglected and seldom well-done aspects of many, many 4X games. This is where Star Ruler 2 really dares to be different - and actually succeeds in making it a fun and important aspect of the game! Diplomacy plays out similar to a card game. The most basic things like treaties, alliances and war declarations aside, diplomatic actions are performed through the use of cards, which players can buy from a shared pool using influence or gain through other means. These cards can range from 'Name Flagship' (which grants a bonus to a flagship and its fleet) to other actions such as spying on other players for a limited amount of time or even annexing planets and whole systems!\nActivating these cards also costs influence points, and many of these proposals, like the annexation of star systems, are put before the galactic senate (of which all players are part of) and voted for or against, which also costs cards and influence points. This can make for some really interesting diplomatic power struggles, with favors swinging back and forth, backstabbing, bribing other players and more!\n\nAnother core part of the game is the way planets and infrastructure are handled. Planets usually have one resource, which can which can be used by said planet or exported somewhere else. Planets need a certain number of food, water and level 1 and 2 resources in order to increase their level. Increasing the level unlocks more of that planets potential, i.e. increasing the maximum population as well as the maximum economic 'pressure'. Simply put, pressure tells people what stuff to build (i.e. markets or research labs), and is gained through the import of resources. This means that in order to get the most out of your (inter)galactic empire, you will need to build a trade network numbering many planets, most of which will be exporting their resources in order to strengthen a few high-level ones. All planets are important, though, since losing even that puny little level 1 world can have devastating effects on your empire!\n\nThe scale of the game also deserves to be mentioned. In theory, the amount of planets, galaxies and other things in a game is unlimited. The only real limitation is your hardware. Playing a multi-galaxy game with hundreds of star systems per galaxy will surely put a strain on your CPU and RAM!\n\nThe massive scale of the game also holds true when it comes to battles. The game can easily handle ridiculous amounts of ships and effects both on- and off-screen. Whereas other games limit battles to a few dozen ships duking it out - at most - it is perfectly possible in Star Ruler 2 to have large-scale engagements with hundreds or even thousands of ships at the same time (without your computer exploding!). Epic space battles ahoy!\n\nWhile expanding your (inter)galactic empire, you will discover that space is not just an empty place; it is filled with mysterious anomalies, powerful artifacts and dangerous secrets worth protecting and fighting over. Seed ships will even spawn new artifacts in ongoing games, and the mighty Dread Pirate will swoop in, attack civilian merchants and claim his booty from undefended planets!\n\nAs for the races/factions in this game you get several distinctly different ones out of the box to play with. These range from hyperdrive-using Humans to plant-creatures that grow everything from a "mother stalk" to Borg-like hivemind people as well as space nomads. Even better yet, you get to customize your own race by combining a range of different traits and properties. And if that's not enough to satisfy your needs, there is always the option to mod new races and traits into the game!\n\nSR2, much like the first game, is extremely moddable and very accessible on top of that. Various mods are already available, and the number, quality and extent of mods is bound to grow over time. The possibilities modding this game are near limitless!\n\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you like 4X games, real-time strategy or just watching epic battles in space you should definitely give Star Ruler 2 a chance. While it is a game that does a number of things very differently compared to genre standards, it never does so without a good reason. Play a few games, learn the ropes of the game and you'll be well-rewarded by one of the most interesting, fun and deep games out there - not to mention the HUGE potential when it comes to mods (and the developers have actively been supporting the modding community ever since SR1 came out)!\n\n\nOh, and if you are going to buy this game, please buy it at full price; it may seem counterintuitive to buy non-discounted games these days - with a sale or two around every corner - but small indie developers like Blind Mind Studios depend on this to survive; these guys are as indie as it gets, and discounted sales just won't pay the bills. Please support them if you believe in what they are doing and want to see them make more games in the future; I know I do.","May 11, 2015","true","28.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

It looked promising, and was on special, so I said, why not, I have a good 10 days to kill waiting for Stellaris. That is why and how I purchased this game. So I got to play 32 hours before Stellaris hit. For comparison, I have 36 hours in the Paradox space strategy game. So yeah, I'll do some comparions but first, let's talk about Star Ruler 2,\n\nThe first thing that hit me is that it was intriguing from the start. It has its own flavor, its own style. The graphics are actually very nice, and you can zoom in to see the details of a ship, or zoom out until the whole galaxy takes up a third of your screen. You can make the galaxy humongous, over two thousand systems. You can design your own ships, it's easy, fun, AND effective.\n\nAnd this game is complex. If you want a challenge to wrap your brain around, then this is it, because it has empire-building, resource exploitation, warfare, piracy, technology, and last but not least, galactic politics, where grievances such as "he took a system in my arm of the galaxy, make him give it back!" can be put forth and voted on by the various empires.\n\nOf course, there is no voice acting. The menus and interface look somewhat primitive. Obviously the game is from a small studio and they didn't have a million bucks to throw at these very secondary considerations. If you prefer a very glitzy production, you'll be disappointed in this title. However, if you are looking for a space 4X with infinite replay value, then this is probably your ticket.\n\nSo while Stellaris is basically Europa Universalis IV dressed up as a space 4X with some glitz on top, this is a unique, engaging, intriguing, and yes, complex space game that can have you coming back for more and more.\n\nMany a time during my 36 hours of Stellaris my thoughts went to this game instead...  A year from now, I believe I will have many more hours playing Star Ruler 2.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThis game gets a 9/10 from me. Looks good, runs great, fun to play, game style is fairly unique, discovery and mystery abound, the replay value is infinite, the only thing missing is some more refinement on the UI.","May 13","true","105.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","2"

Massivie galaxies. Detailed solar systems, down to planetary surface maps. Huge fleets and epic space battles.\nAddicting gameplay.\nNovel game mechanics.\n\nCons:\nThe devs closed down their studio.

I did not play the original, but I have played most of the big name 4X games since M.U.L.E. (if you consider that 4X).  The main concepts I like:\n\n- Planet development is both hands off and hands on...you can spend dollars to accelerate your empire growth, but growing it by developing a good trade network is more efficient and effective.\n- Research is a tool for refining your empire and improving efficiency, but does not provide a huge competitive edge over other empires on the battlefield\n- Fleet based combat provides ample room for tactical depth but without overcomplicating the game\n- Diplomacy is fun against the AI.  When is the last time you said that?  You can actually brow beat the enemy just with diplomacy alone.  This would be a blast against others but haven't tried it yet.\n- Variation in start-up settings would seem to provide a lot of replayability.\n- FTL is a cacheable resource, meaning that you don't have infinite tactical flexibility.  You may have to make a decision to either warp a new fleet in as reinforcement OR retreat your languishing fleet...but not both.\n\nThings I think could be better:\n- With a spread out empire, combat can be swift and fierce and there is no warning that your fleet is getting destroyed while you aren't watching.  There could be a warning so you could FTL out.\n- The AI doesn't put up an awesome fight when you are eating up his worlds.\n- The AI doesn't protect critical parts of his trade network very well.\n\nOverall, I think it's fun and definitely worth the price.","April 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It is very satisfying to conquer galaxy without firing a single shot, or forcing AI into perpetual servitude after blowing up his fleet.\n\nShip design is probably most OP fun right now, that will need to be fixed in the future. It is too easy to make a doom-mobile that clears whole star system at a time; hint - race to titan and antimater tech, then make an antimater beam titan of 2500 size, with only engines, beams and antimatter to power said beams (no supply or support modules).  IT'll cost ~6M to make, and only 500k to maintain, use next to no supply, and beams will have range spaning full star system. Make 2 or 3, park them at the edge of the systems, and watch them wiping floor with any fleet that tries to engage.

The game, and perhaps the genre, is better for it. While at its core Star Ruler 2 is a game about building an economy through linking resources and exporting/importing them, the game is fun at every level of its mechanics.\n\nThe alien races are all varied and play very differently. From a race that focuses on its mothership to a race that requires network nodes to be close by to be at top strength, they are all different enough to provide very different gameplay and that offers significant replayability.\n\nThe diplomacy offers something new, and at times very exciting, with its card system, with which you buy cards and subsequently play them with accumluated influence points. The combat is fun and strategically engaging as you must determine proper balances/roles of your support ships and balance fighting enemy fleets with using your ships to invade and takeover enemy planets.\n\nThere's much more to like here and I could go on and on about how each of its facets are well balanced and fun, but at the end of the day if you like 4X games that offer strategic depth and unique gameplay styles with their various races and like/don't mind pausable real-time gameplay, then you shouldn't be reading this review anymore.

My full 2900-word review can be found here: http://www.mercedesmace.com/blog/review-for-star-ruler-2\n\nHighlights:\n\nWhat I appreciate about SR2 is what I loved about Endless Space, SoSE, Star Drive: it's the sci-fi 4x that we love, but the mechanics are different at a fundamental level. I'm not sure I've played a game before SR2 in which the varied win-conditions are so integrated. The "currencies" of the game are effective at all stages of play: some technologies can be researched using energy, cash, or influence; artifacts and some ship components require excess energy to activate/build; cash can be used on the diplomacy screen, energy during some diplomatic actions; some combat modules require energy to activate; diplomatic actions allow access to some resources (not currencies; see below), or enable actions that affect currencies; currency, resources, and diplomacy can all facilitate system defense.\n\n4x:\n\n-Explore: You have the option to either have all stars' locations revealed, or the opportunity to discover connections one system makes with another. Personally, I prefer the latter. All ships in the game have the option to travel in normal space between star systems or galaxies. The alternate forms of FTL travel make it faster, at the expense of a currency (FTL points), requiring a station, or the use of energy.\n\n-Expand: You can't just expand willy-nilly; it costs money to provide the colony ships, then it costs money to maintain low-level worlds. The higher level worlds more than make up this difference, and clever management can minimize the time between having your colonies work against your budget and having them work for it. Most structures require some sort of upkeep, so when you're not using those buildings anymore, feel free to scuttle them. However, your populace will slowly "develop" their planets, one tile at a time; structures built upon developed land have lower costs and upkeep. Some planets have moons that can be developed for a high, one-time cost to expand their developed land; some artifacts can perform a similar function.\n\n-Exploit: Most planets have an exportable resource, which can be used to create "pressure" on the planet to which it is traded. My strongest negative criticism of this game is the use of the term "pressure".  :P  Think of it as "capability": 1 X "pressure" allows a planet the capability to build a one-tile-sized structure that produces some resource/currency related to that pressure--economic pressure creates markets which provide money; energy pressure creates power plants which provide energy, etc. "Pressure" capacity is capability capacity: a planet with 6 pressure cap can build up to six of these small buildings.\n\nSomething pretty cool: your empire only starts with a single planet, labor and cash on that planet, but that's it; all other currencies/resources require you to get out there and find them, or build them on your planets.\n\nEach planet begins at level 0 when first colonized, and can hold just 1 billion people--the smallest useful population level. Planets can, via the importation of resources, level up to level 5. Because the amount of resources increase at each level, your empire of 100 planets may be entirely focused on leveling up enough level 1's and 2's in order to level all of your level 3 resources to level 3, and a select handful of planets up to levels 4/5. Leveling a planet to level 1 requires food and water, so early in the game you're on the lookout for these resources, and eventually your empire becomes, in-part, a balance between which planets get the water/food resources, and which planets have the land upon which to build expensive hydrogenerators and mega-farms--which provide an innate water/food resource, respectively.\n\n-Exterminate: I love the fleet system: it's yet another small mechanistic change that provides SR2 its unique playstyle. Each fleet is headed by a Flagship--the only kind of ship that can keep care of itself. Your flagships are then provided Support ships--much smaller ships which you may not directly command, but which can share the propulsion (e.g. FTL) of their flagship. Once a flagship goes down, any remaining support ships effectively become automated: they will join your local support fleets if automated in one of your systems, or will simply float in space until destroyed.\n\nI'm still getting a handle on custom ship creation, which basically goes like this: Hull Size ~= internal space. Want a more effective subsystem: literally devote more internal space to it. The ship design screen is abstract, so the "shape" of your design has little effect on the visual representation of a ship on the map, though it strongly affects the order in which subsystem hexes are destroyed, and if the "core" of a subsystem is destroyed, the subsystem fails until repaired. Some players don't particularly care for support fleets, though, but it's an easy fix: just don't include any support command in your ship designs. Also, look out for the "create random blueprint for this ship" button; when I first dared to create ships, I pressed this button a lot.\n-Diplomacy: why isn't this an "X" in "4x"? As stated above, this might be the first game in which diplomacy feels like a legitimate win-condition, primarily because part of it is mechanized to annex planets/star systems. That's right: if your influence is too low, you may not be able to prevent an opponent from just claiming one of your systems in a vote! But you can do the same, and *this* is why you've been sinking energy into intelligence drone artifacts, claiming leverage action cards, building influence pressure structures, etc. Diplomacy is a fundamental mechanic of the game: you can use influence to purchase certain upgrades in the research tree; some diplomatic actions will allow you to provide food resources to planets; influence can be used to "name" ships, planets, and systems, increasing their effectiveness. Some people feel that the diplomacy system isn't "diplomatic" enough; personally, the SR2 devs have given diplomacy a new kind of mechanistic weight such that it *feels* weird, but performs like it actually matters in all stages of the game.\n\nMy first couple of games were on 50-60 star maps, because I was afraid my Dell gaming laptop would lag; it did with Star Drive 1, though it's my understanding the new Star Drive is better optimized. Haven't had any lag issues with SR2 thus far. My fourth game, currently on-going, has nearly 200 star systems (~800 planets) in three galaxies with five AI--no lag, no bugs. It's a well-optimized game.\n\nThe tutorial tells you *how* to play the game: you move the screen like so, order around units and manage resources like so, etc. But it doesn't explain much of the kinds of strategies you can use to win, perhaps because the strategy is simple: "master all of the mechanics, micromanage for efficiency." In that sense, it is a "medium to learn, difficult to master" game; I'm still learning how to maximize the efficiency of my empire. The game doesn't penalize you for low efficiency...at the lower AI difficulties.\n\nIt's a phenomenal game, with layers. At first, it was an intimidating process, but that wanes quickly, helped along by the intuitive user-interface. The lower AI difficulties will challenge you while you learn, and the advanced difficulties will challenge you when you feel like you've "mastered" the game. It's your fault for being so presumptuous. SR2 is a highly stream-lined, optimized, and mechanically inter-dependent system that will test your micromanagement skills without taxing them for the sake of "challenging" you simply by giving you too much to consider. As far as an indie game/developer goes, SR2 places as highly as any you care to name.","June 1, 2015","true","141.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I mean that in a positive sense. If you are into 4x you definately shouldnt sit out on this.\n\nPro:\n\n+ the card based diplomacy system is so epic (buying cards for influence either to use on your own empire [renaming planets, flagships, cultivating planets etc..] or to use in interstellar senate votes [Negotiate, leverage, attach rider etc]\n+ the combat system just feels so good... you build fleets with a flagship, and tons of smaller support vessels\n+great music and sounds (the music in SR1 was great aswell, but its SFX were not too good... in SR2 both is awesome)\n+ the colonizing system is well balanced. instead of having tons of well developed worlds, in SR 2 you have just a few, maybe even just 1\n\nNeutral/to do/ to implement/ whatever:\n\n0 The game is in early stages I know, thats why I put it in here and not into negative: It needs more ship systems\n0 The tech tree could need more tech\n0 More buildings\n0 maybe more ressources\n\nNegative:\n\n-the techtree is Finite (Unlike in SR1, where you could research forever. I think that is a step back)\n-you cant design support ships smaller than 1 .... I want my drones and fighters and such. :V\n- too little traffic in between planets. we are talking about billions of population here.  I know that this isnt gameplay relevant but it would be nice to actually have space roads full of civilians, traveling in between planets. ( In SR1 you could design automated ships that would do this,if you wanted, but in SR2 you cant.)\n\nDont get me wrong. The Negative aspects dont mean you shouldnt get the game. Its great, very playable, especially in Multiplayer with your friends. Its very stable and I hadnt even one bug or a crash or something like that.\n\nIf you are into 4x, give it a try.\n","December 20, 2014","true","23.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tarax00/recommended/282590/","Tarax00","Tarax00","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tarax00/","205 products in account","Hello there!\n\nSo, Star ruler 2... You know, when i saw this game on steam the first time i got really excited, for good reasons.\nI loved the first game and this game was a nice face-lift for sure by the looks of things (and it is) when i looked it up.\n\nSo the moment i was able to i bought it and joined the game in EA. And at first I was actually a little disapointed,\nit was kinda different from the first game. If you as me played star ruler 1,\nI really liked commanding large fleets or big and small ships induvidually.\nAnd the fact that you can't do that in the same manner in this game is what caused that disapointment.\nIt scared me, because i felt it could potentially make the game "to easy" to control.\n\nIn time however, I honestly can say i changed my opinion rather quickly,\nby the simple fact and realization that playing a game of star ruler 2. Especially multiplayer against/with\nthe devs, aka devastation fridays & of course normal multiplayer.\nThings can quickly get not only complex but a bit hectic lol (in a good and satisfying way!!).\n\nWhat you will get is this;\n- From management of planets on a macro level, import/export of wares from planet to planet\n(To gain more resources, population buy leveling up planets and their population cap etc)\n\n- Planet managing on the micro level, Building planet structures, ships, stations etc.\n(To improve everything from construction capacity, research gain, resource control etc)\n\n- The new (and awesome) diplomacy card integration. There is a lot to this in the game.\nBasically this is a card mini game where you aquire all kinds of diplomatic cards/powers\nby spending diplomatic points your empire generates. Cards varies from influence cards that gives you more\nof a say "say" or power in voting. For excample - if you want to annex a planet (or a whole system!),\nfrom another player "legaly" without an actual war declared.  You can do that!\nBut only if you have the stronger diplomatic strength than the other guy.\nSo if player A wants player B's planet and A has the diplomatic advantage. He or she would get the planet.\nHowever everyone in the game can vote. So if player C, D, E etc. decides to mess up players A's plan,\nthey could vote in Favor of player B - and thus denying player A's campaign to capture player B's planet.\nThere are also other things like adding food production to a planet, renaming planets (gaining bonuses doing so) etc etc.\n\n- Ship designing, as before you can design ships but this time around its more fleshed out. And beyond the fact\nthey are using a hexagonic design system. whatever you design and built - the icons for the ships will look exactly\nlike the designs you make from above. Though the ship graphical models themselves are "preset" to whatever\nYou chose when the game starts, which is fine in my opinion.\nDo note there is a random ship generator for certain ship types too!\n\n!! Keep in mind, you can design ships "out of game" with the design editor, you can find this in the main menu.\nYou can even test your designs there as well!.\n\n- And back to my innitial dislike of the ship management... lol Im honestly greatful the way it is. It would have been\njust be to much (for me) to handle if you had the ability to control every single ship manually.\nThe way it is now. you have Flagships, support ships and stations. Flagships and stations controls the support ships.\nTo a point as they are limited to support command point limits and ammo storage (if you dont have enough ammo\nyou'll find yourself with a fleet that cant shoot rather quickly xD). Flagships are basically the only controllable and\nmovable ship you have. That's the core of your fleets, when you add support ships (smaller ships typically),\nthey simply follow the flagship around until it's destroyed (where any surviving support ships either flies to the\nnearest planet or sits still in space till they are killed (or another friendly flagship arrives).\nSimilar setup for stations, but yea, they are stations so you don't move them around exactly.\n\n- And lastly the economics and research. There are 5 types of economical resources. First of which i mentioned,\nthe diplomatic power. We also have money, energy, research and FTL.\n\nStarting with the money system. Although the game is in real time. The money is gained on a turn kind of basis.\nThe economics of money cycles around via a timer. Every time the timer runs out,\nthe current state of your coffers updates with it.\nSo if you are supposed to gain more money then you will by the end of "it's turn".\nBut if you lets say start to colonize planets, your income will also take a downward turn as you basically take population\nfrom established planets (and thus resource generation). And place it somewhere else.\nAt which point the old things needs to recover slowly and regain the population back up again.\nOr maybe you built a new ship with high maintainence (or station etc)\n\nThe other 4 resources are realtime generated.\n* FTL is used by your FTL method of travling. If you use a hyperdrive - the hyperdrive will take its power from your FTL storage.\nIf you build a stargate it will cost FTL to activate/build it (but not using it).\n* Energy is used by various ship modules and world artifacts to activate.\nSome artifacts for excample will require 900 energy for you to convert one artifact planetoid to a random resource.\nBut is also used in various research techs and diplomatic actions as an alternative to the "normal" methods.\n* Research ... Enough said\n* Influence ... With small addition: can be used in some research techs as well\n\n---------------\n\nAll in all, I cant think of much else to say. My innitial fears about this game being "to simple", haha boy was i wrong.\nI just love how it turned out! It's deep, detailed and the costumization power you end up having is really great and\nfun to play around with for sure! No game ends up the same really if you start playing around with the different\nfactions, make your own races, set up different world gen parameters. etc etc.\n\nhaha I've lost a few games (and won) now due to the fact i just could not keep up with the other players in some areas.\nOnce I had a vast economic strenght, that i was able to build large and many fleets with. But in the end i lost because my\nenemies had a strong diplomatic power (that i greatly lacked), they basically took my economy away and thus my feets.\n\nIt is sooo easy to make mistakes and that's honestly what i also think is a bonus in a game like this.\nThe cold war aspect is amazing. And sometimes where you start out in the game can ditermen the entire game\nand how you yourself end up playing. It makes things more interesting and fun and this really has been a blast playing so far!\nAnd i would love to see this franchise grow even further in the future!\n\nI have played a lot of games, been in several betas, alphas and EA games now (as you can see in my library)\nAnd this has definitly been one of the best EA games ive had the pleassures of playing along side its development.\nAnd now when its released, I can full-heartedly say i love the end product! :)\n\nThis 4x space empire game I highly recomend!\n\nDo note, there is a lot of fun to be had with other players!\nSo dont be afraid to talk with others on the IRC chat.\nPeople have been really friendly there so far and there is always someone willing to play.\n\nHave fun and fly safe o7 !\n\n","May 15, 2015","true","173.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atomica/recommended/282590/","atomica","Hoss Porkchops","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atomica/","297 products in account","TL;DR: This is a great game and a breath of much-needed fresh air in the 4X genre. Unlike most other 4X games, it has its own DNA and doesn't rely on the Civilization tropes that have come to define the genre. While it's a RTS game, this is much more of a strategy game (think a Paradox title like EU4) as opposed to something like Starcraft or Company of Heroes. It has variable speed settings and can be paused. This game has a very unique take on several mechanics such as diplomacy, expansion/economy, and ship design.\n\nExpansion: Typically in 4X games, you colonize a planet/city/whatever and acquire Food (population growth), Hammers (production capacity), and Science (research), then build structures that provide multipliers to those values (libraries for science, for example). Things are different in this game. It reminds me a bit of the Anno series, where you need access to resources in order for your city (or in this game, planet) to grow.\n\nA planet's population is determined by planet level, which ranges from 0 to 5. In order to level up a planet, one must acquire sufficient resources. For a planet to reach Level 1, it only needs food and water. In order to reach Level 2, it not only needs additional food but also needs access to Tier 1 resources. Later levels require additional Tier 1 resources as well as Tier 2 resources. What this means is colonizing isn't just about spamming settles and running through the same build order for each planet. Instead, you are looking to acquire particular resources in order to create a trade network which can support high-level worlds.\n\nI should talk a bit more about resources, since they also relate to another mechanic of the game: Pressure. Unlike the Civ games, you typically don't build things like Libraries or Factories directly. Instead, your civilian population does. That's not to say that you don't have any control over this, it's just a little more direct. The mechanism used to push your citizens into building certain kinds of economies is Pressure, and Pressure comes from Resources. For example, Textiles are a Tier 1 resource, so this will be important in order for you to level up your planet past a certain point. Beyond fulfilling that requirement, _what_ resources you get also matters. Textiles produce Money pressure. What this means is if you import this T1 resource to your planet, your civilians will be more likely to build things like Markets that will generate money for your empire. If instead you import Chemicals, a T1 resource that provides Research pressure, they'd build more Universities that provide you with research.\n\nThis game also has the hands-down best Diplomacy system I've seen. It functions almost like a card game and uses it's own resource (Influence). Influence, like Money or Research, is produced by your civilian economy, and there are several resources that provide Influence pressure. You use these Influence points to both purchase and play diplomatic Cards. Diplomacy here isn't limited to War/Peace/Trade Agreement, you can do all sorts of things such as hosting the Galactic Senate on your homeworld (providing diplomatic advantages), annexing other players' planets or star systems, provide bonuses to planets and fleets, etc.\n\nWhen you first play a diplomatic card, you need to have enough Influence to get it to pass. You and your opponents then play various cards in order to pass (or stop) the diplomatic faction. You can also offer bribes to other factions to throw their lot in with you. For example, you could offer a large sum of money, some of your diplomatic  cards, or even one of your fleets or planets in order to enlish their diplomatic support for your proposition. This ends up being a fascinating and deep system to play with. It's much more involved and interesting than your typical War/Peace/Ally toggle that most other 4X games have.\n\nLastly, another area this game excels at is ship design. There are a host of interesting weapons, modules, and augmentations you can make to ships perform exactly how you want them to. Even better, the game ships with a Design Sandbox which lets you create and test your designs outside of a regular game. You can save these designs and they will be immediately available in every game you play. The game is also integrated with Steam Workshop, which means you can browse and import other players' designs with a click of a button. It's really slick and is a great option for those that might want to use additional ship designs but don't feel like creating them themselves.\n\nThis review is already way too lengthy so I'll wrap it up here. Suffice it to say that this is a unique and compellling 4X game. There's really nothing out there that plays like it, from my experience. Because it has it's own unique DNA there is a bit of a learning curve involved, but the game does ship with a helpful and easy to follow tutorial. It won't make you a master of the game, but it'll teach you all the basics that you need to dive in and get geting.","April 15, 2015","true","99.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Colonel_Ninja/recommended/282590/","Colonel_Ninja","Colonel Ninja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Colonel_Ninja/","405 products in account","This game is one of the most unique 4X games out there. It truly has some of the most interesting systems that ive ever experienced in a 4X.\n\nThe ship builder brings a great new element to combat, as to win you dont just need good tactics, you also need to have a good strategy when you design the ships. Do you want to focus on beams or projectiles? Do you want to have Normal or Heavy armour, do you want to have an armour with a special resistance? Where do you even want to put your armour? Frontal? The Sides? Make weird ship that aggros then fires most of its stuff as it retreats? Where will your guns poke out of the armour to minimize weakspots? How much of each internal system do you want and which should be closest to the armour because its the least valuable when the armour breaks. Do you want to make a big ship of the line battleship with massive firepower, or do you want to make a giant carrier with a huge support fleet or something in between? Theres intricacys to this I havent even mentioned, and you also have to factor in what the enemy has in your designs to exploit theirs. This gives great importance to planning for future wars /  defence.\n\nHowever, if that sounds like to much effort / stress you can mostly ignore it, and use randomly generated ships or downloaded ones. You can also just use old designs and resize them when you need more firepower.\n\nThe diplomacy system is card based and it means that you can always do something with it. Unlike in CIV where enemies can just refuse to negotiate and vote down everything you want. In SR2 you can force things through (with enough investment in diplomacy of course) meaning that theres never a time when diplomacy is useless. Stuff like being able to annex planets or systems, buy up valuable buffs before the enemy and more.\n\nThe economy is also a really unique idea. As you go through the game you end up building up a resource network. What this means is that you have low level resource planets which ship materials to more developed planets, which can then ship their materials to more developed planets and so on and so forth. What this means is that large empires are usually as easy to manage overall as small ones, as once you setup your network you can mostly forget it unless you want to change something or an enemy captures / destroys a critical link in your supply chain. This also factors into the combat as if you are at war its much easier to perform tactical strikes to take out key enemy planets rather than just capturing everything. Theres the all important capital but it may be worth capturing a less well defended level 2 or 3 planet that will reduce the level of planets higher up the chain when captured. This system does mean that empires with more planets are better off in terms of economy, theres very little wide vs tall strategic depth, but you must make sure you never expand too fast otherwise you may shoot yourself in the foot economically by being unable to support new aquisitions.\n\nThe races themselves are also very distinct. Your not quite playing a new game every time but options like FTL type and traits make a huge difference in how you will end up playing a full game of star ruler. Each race also has a unique feature that will usually completely change one or more aspects of their play. For example there is a race of robots which do not require food but have to produce their population rather than grow naturally. There is a race that are sentient trees, which have a unique ship design rule where each ship tile must have at least one 'tree cell' next to it and the 'tree cells' must all be connected continuously. This makes for some really unique designs and they get very cheap armour around most of their ship.\n\nTheres a fair bit more to the game than what I listed, but this is the stuff that stood out to me. Its a great game and its also hugely modable, which means that you can usually find a mod to change a feature you dont like.","April 24","true","148.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

They changed a lot of the mechanics of the game so when I first picked it up it felt like a completly new game. The way this game does fleets and fleet managment is in my opinion the best I have ever seen in any space RTS and I play a lot of space RTS games. The biggest issue in so many space RTS is that when battles start it always just a huge confusing mess, where as the flag ship/support ship mechanic solves this and keeps your ships in formation very well during massive battles. The customization in this game is spectacular as well. If you like building your own ships from scrap this is the game for you, while at the same time the base ship designs are viable though out the game and easy to update when you unlock new technologies. The trading system is also a lot of fun and gets you very invested in the expansion of your empire and looks amazing as you expand outward.\nI highly recomend this game to any fans of space RTS, it is a lot of fun and only gets better with each patch.\n","December 6, 2014","true","55.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

They are almost two different games entirely, of which both have merits. Personally I favor this one.\n\nTo me, this is good. It reminds me of a refurbished Space Empires, but toned down in a rather unique, yet rewarding way.\n\nThe empire structure and development leads to an impressive way to build and manage your empire, leaving many questions to how to balance your Diplomacy, Research and finaces for Fleets and Defense well. All and all, I think it is a good way to limit and balance the game to which its not easy to be overpowered without paying for it - and it rewards you well once you are. It also alows basic levels of Terraforming from worlds that produce Labor, letting you determine a sizeable portion of that empire's structure, but the biggest and key parts still get left to fall under RNG and planet generation to actually make those particular worlds so you can use them. Sometimes the RNG doesn't let a game have many of certain higher level world resource types be around, making the game slant some in its gameplay, but that's really a minor gripe in smaller matches with less systems and worlds. The more planets availible, the more options so its kind of a moot point - but it does bring up performance issues in the game if oyu have TOO much around.\n\nDiplomacy here is also done with a bit of a unique twist, using cards to determine actions and votes in a galactic senate that follow a simple yes-no flip. The Diplomatic actions are determined by a resource earned that needs to be spent to use it. That resource is determined by your empire's worlds and you can help determine how well it is. Its part of that determining faction to your empire if you focus on it being more influential, warlike or economic. But you need to find a balance so its not overwhelmed if you break out in war with another empire that outseps you on another front.\n\nThe ship/station design mechanic has been heavily refurbished since the first SR, and I would argue also in a much better way. Ship classes are either Support or Flagships leading the supports in default fleets. Each ship has limited Internal Component totals you need to balance how you build it. Do you make it a massive, slow-moving single weapon, split up for variety of damage types or build it to speed across the galaxy at will? You need to balance that as it limits how much room you have left for other parts. Armor is largely left out, so long as its external, letting you make really tough vessels, but that weight has its own costs. Flagships also need to manage supplies for themselves and the fleet, as well as control to keep and maange support ships for additional firepower. Stations are much like that, but can also have their own defese forces and fleets. Each ship aslo comes with their own patterns for attack strategys and behaviors, letting you mix and manage how your fleets are built and operate. Close quarters brawling with alot of firepower? Or do you skirmish as a whole, just out of the enemy main weapons range? I just love the whole list of options here.\n\nEven with its restrictions, it is balanced remarkably well. But you need to udnerstand that there are limits. You can't go all out, you have to play by the game's rules and learn them well. But it does reward you well for getting it.\n\nI think its a good game, well done and crafted to its own well-balanced rules and gameplay. One I can enjoy and regard well for doing it so. A definite reccomendation from me.","April 3, 2015","true","32.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

The Tech tree is an interesting glob of techs in all direction which makes you think where you really want to focus during the early / mid game.\n\nOne special note for players that want to experience the race (or custom race) that uses mother ships / pods... Make sure any ore ships you create are set to drop off their ore to the mother ship. I say this because in the the games current state, there is no way to take any resources such as ore off a planet, which can ruin said race if you don't ensure the mining ships are set to the mothership for drop off point.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to the continued progress of the game as well as community mods.

Races are alright, and provide decent variety, but I suspect mods will greatly expand on the 'life style' system they developed.\n\nBefore release they removed both the bonuses from food/water, and faction customization, but this is worth it for all the other features they added. I feel the game was rushed abit out of the beta stage (with very huge updates back to back then release) but it's quite polished, and plays well so while it isn't as fleshed out as it could be it's quite enjoyable.\n\nThe political system ensures that even a tiny empire can have a serious impact on politics/gameplay, and allows for cunning/sneaky moves, as well as interesting meta developments like system names and the like.\n\nArtifacts are interesting, worth fighting over, and game changing, and due to the way tractor beams work can be stolen/moved allowing for yet more cunning ploys.\n\nOverall I'd say this is the Space RTS with the most overall features in terms of both variety, and impact in that politics, artifact hunting, research, ship design etc. all come together and blend seamlessly.\n\nEdits will be made from this point forward to account for mods n such.\n\nThe ABEM mod or alternative balance mod adds more research options, and improves the game experience in general so it's highly recommended, and easy to download on the steamworkshop.","March 31, 2015","true","159.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

It plays out on a scale as yet unrivaled - you can have thousands of stars, planets, ships, and even have multiple galaxies! You're limited only by your hardware. The battles are typically large scale and have an epic feel reminescent of the best sci-fi anime - complete with hundreds (thousands!) of beam weapons crisscrossing the starry vista, explosions lighting off like firecrackers, enormous flagships leading massive fleets... it's great!\n\nThis is not just another MoO clone. The economy and diplomacy are both fresh takes, and have severe repercussions. Economically you must chain your worlds together in a series of import/export links to support your most prized worlds - and should those supporting worlds fall, it will have a dire effect on the world they were supporting. Supply chain management is very important in Star Ruler 2 (although there is an automated option for those who prefer it), and this opens up a lot of tactical options when invading an enemy or defending your territory. Also fresh is that your monetary budget operates on 3-minute cycles, excess that you do not spend is shunted into one of several projects that increase certain galactic resources. Spending beyond your budget is possible, but doing so charges interest and slows your planetary growth. There are also "pay as you go" almost lay-away systems available for building enormous projects (drydocks) without breaking the bank all at once.\n\nDiplomacy takes place by utilizing an interesting card-based system. You generate influence via resources and buildings you acquire/build on your worlds, and you spend that influence to acquire political cards (which are varied and many), and further spend influence to use them. These cards can be used for effects that directly relate to your empire, as well as to lobby events in the galactic senate. These events range from generating empire-boosting zeitgeist effects, to sabotaging your rivals, to becoming elected leader of the galactic senate or even annexing systems your rivals hold. The cards shift about each minute, and as they rotate out become cheaper to purchase - but beware! Your rivals are trying to purchase them, too.\n\nThe game plays out in real time across the entire spectrum, and battles are on the main map - they are not instanced. However, you may speed up or slow down the game to your heart's content, and even pause and issue as many orders as you would like. The ability to pause and queue orders (in all areas of the game) allows you to effectively play the game as though it were turn based, if you so desire.\n\nThe combat is a mixture of automation and direct control. You directly control your flagship, which is typically the largest and most powerful vessel in your fleet. This vessel can gain veterancy, have special trigger-able abilities, and be upgraded with artifacts. The rest of your fleep are support ships - which operate based on an AI behavior that you assign them while designing them. Speaking of ship design - the system is incredibly robust and allows for extensive customization using a hex-based system that allows you to effectively draw your ship. Alas, what you draw is not what is displayed on screen, each empire chooses a shipset, and the game will determine which model your design most closely matches visually. The designs do look quite nice however, and the battles look spectacular. Clever design and wise choosing of ship behavior AI combined with your direct command of your flagship (including maneuvering around to spread the damage across different armor segments or ship systems) can and will make all the difference in your playthrough.\n\nStar Ruler 2 has an assortment of aliens, with interesting differences in gameplay. There are also many forms of faster-than-light travel to take advantage of, and your race can be fully customized. The game is highly conducive to modding, and runs very smoothly even on older hardware. The community is also of excellent quality and quite friendly and helpful. The recent expansion, Wake of the Heralds, adds two new races with new mechanics for them, as well as a host of additions to it and the original game.\n\nThe real time aspect, the budget based income, the massive fleets... if you enjoyed Sins of a Solar Empire or the Supreme Commander series, I highly expect you may well enjoy Star Ruler 2 as well. It also scratches all the right 4X itches, without being a clone of any of them.\n\nAll and all, I highly recommend this gem of a game.","May 1","true","150.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Solar systems feeding planets several solar systems away in order to bulk them up to a point where they’re able to plough gold reserves into your homeworld. Sometimes, you can mine asteroids for valuable substances and bypass that whole colonisation nonsense. Sometimes, if you have more power than love for the planets, you can destroy an entire system and, in the splintered rubbles of worlds that once were, construct a shiny ringworld and insist that people start recognising you as a God.\n\nI could not have been further away from this point when, upon exploring my second cluster in the hopes of finding more food planets to feed my starving empire, I stumbled across a scout ship belonging to the Hoonan, a race of Borg-like computer people who didn’t seem to be doing much harm; just trying to expand their network of planets, much like myself. We both received slight economic bonuses for making contact, and then got on with building up our territory.\n\nSoon, I would burn their worlds to the core.\n\nFull review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12559/miscellaneous/star-ruler-2/review.html","May 17, 2015","true","9.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","2"

The scales in which the game operated would put SupCom to shame.  Thousands and thousands of ships.  Capital ships the size of galaxies.  Ring worlds.  Hell yeah!\n\nThe 2nd release in the series reigns in those extremes a bit and shows a lot more polish and nuanced gameplay.  Before you had 1 goal, to build the biggest ship or the most ships and end the other guys.  In Star Ruler 2 you have one of the most ingenius and original Empire building mechanics I've seen.  They've added several unique methods of FTL.  A massive technology tree, and a robust political mechanism that allows a smart player to soften the grounds of invasion with subtlety and guile.\n\nThey kept the amazing shipbuilder from the original series, but now they have focused it strictly on capital ships.  In the original game the player designed hundreds of designs for everything from fighters to freighters to frigates.  Now you can focus on optimizing a handful of capital ships that serve as the core of their own fleet.\n\nMod Support:  Heck yes.   Unfortunately the amazing group who worked on the Galactic Armory mod never managed to get going on the sequel, but with Workshop support the community has really come together to add some really great content for SR2.  Lots of ship designs are out there for every concievable scenario, letting those who prefer to focus on the big picture to download designs and skip the builder entirely.\n\nThe 4x community has been stagnant the last few years, with dozens of ill-designed or uninspired games littering our Steam libraries like some awful testiment to our desire to find that one perfect challenge.  This little indie game managed to take over the top spot previously held by GalCiv 2, and it did so by taking big risks on design.

This is the most fun I've had in a long time.\n\nThe game is deceptively simple: colonize a planet, link it's resource, repeat and gain affinity. Design and build ships to defend and attack. It's easy to get started and fun to  explore and fight. It's top down universe management is excellent for controlling your empire, but the ability to zoom in on ships makes battles rewarding and exciting. It's a blast to call fleets from the four corners of your empire to jump through FTL gates and converge on an enemy capital ship, then zoom in and watch them get annihilated.\n\nBut there's a very complex under belly to SR2. resources create pressure on a planet, and pressure limits are controlled by population. Building up your planets is necesarry to make sure you are utilizing your resources effectively. In order to build large, awesome fleets you're going to have to utilize labor and research at the cost of cash generation. The game is all about balance and macro-management.\n\nThat being said, it's not a spread-sheet manager. The interface is intuitive and nicely done. The hud is customizable and the ship design is exciting (especially in multiplayer!) and well thought out. Every ship I've made is different, with researched techs enabling more specific purposes for the ship's systems.\n\nThere's so much to explore. The diplomacy is inventive and I'll admit at first I wasn't interested in it but after a couple games I realized how powerful it can be. Being able to annex an enemy system once you win the vote in the senate is rewarding and fun. Calling for a patriotic surge from a planet under siege can buy you the time to get your capital ship into it's gravity well.\n\nThen there's energy, the wildcard affinity. It's used to activate awesome artifacts, cloak ships, prevent enemy escapes and a ton of other really cool abilities.\n\nThe races are varied and unique. The way they utilize things like orbitals and FTL tech make every game feel special. One race requires a special material to build ships out of, another race can't grow population, only build it. There's a race that can't build on planets, but instead lives on orbitals in the gravity well. Each one is different and worth playing.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you like strategy games, you can't miss this. If you like space games, get it now. If you like massive battles, they got em. If you like sandbox games with a focus on building and design, this is probably for you.\n\nThe game's so good I bought a copy for two friends. Get it. Get it now.\n\nOne last note: The devs are awesome. This is by far the best early-access development I've seen. They listen to feedback, constantly push out new features and have an awesome vision for what a 4x RTS should be. I'm very excited for the public release and subsequent patches, updates and whatever else they have up their sleeves. They deserve the success I'm sure this game will have.","March 15, 2015","true","427.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","1"

I thought the original SR was alright and entertaining when I had nothing else to do, but SR2 is perfect. It is what I've been looking for in a Sci fi 4x game. It's crazy that this is still under development. Can't wait to see the new features they release.\n\nI haven't made it to EndGame material yet, but from everything I've experienced so far, this is the one. I have played every big 4X space game out there and this one takes the cake.\n\nPROS:\n+Entirely unique diplomacy feature. It is complex and a little difficult to pick up at first, but it is very unique and advanced. Have only discovered a couple of games with this amount of diplomacy actions.\n+graphics. Very smooth graphics. I have a lower-end PC and I haven't experienced below 40 fps even with 10x speed on.\n+Interface is great and easy to use. The game is built on tabs now, for major interactions at least. There is the visual galaxy tab, diplomacy, research, designs, planets, and a community tab (which allows you to view the game's wiki and player-submitted ship designs). The overall flow of the interface is great, allowing you to jump between these tabs without losing where you left off in them.\n+Combat and fleet management is much smoother than the first SR. Instead of building a large number of different ships and assigning them to a fleet that then gets deleted whenever you retrofit or do anything out of the ordinary, you build a single flagship. Once you have that flagship you start building support ships, which you can customize and design like a normal ship. You can then recruit them using the flagship and it'll automatically add them to your fleet. I very much enjoy this.\n+Ship design system is amazing and very user friendly. The process is more visual now and is even better than the previous SR. I have only played with it a little at this time but from what I've seen so far it is very nice.\n+New Planet Management system is unique. Have not experienced it before in a 4X game. Planets now use a hierarchy system, allowing them to level up and down depending on what resources the planet has access to. This allows for a more complicated gameplay and using real strategy when it comes to planet management. In a terrority of 5 systems with roughly 4-5 planets in each system you'll only be able to maintain 1-2 Level 4 planets (0 being worst; 4 being best). It is very easy to learn as well.\n\nNeutral:\n--Sound needs some work. The sounds are good and the music is good, but it is all pretty limited and gets a little repetitive.\n--Research I feel is limited. I like the new system and how it works, but there doesn't appear to be many technologies you can unlock at this point. Many of them are just repeats that stack. Looking forward to new additions as development progresses.\n\nCons:\nNONE! I'll let you know if I find any.","February 2, 2015","true","15.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","1"

Although, the Devs are very approachable and the IRC makes for a good read even while playing solo.\n\nOverall though, if like me you have fond memories of SupCom Lan parties and the like, this game is an absolute "Must Have" in your library.

This system encourages constant empire expansion that many other 4X titles do not.\n\nDiplomacy has also radically changed, and is also very different from any other 4X title that I am aware of. It uses a card mechanic in where you can put into play a card that will force another empire to cede one of their planets to your control. To do this however, you will need a certain number of votes in the senate to have the motion pass. During this phase you can play additional cards (which cost influence to purchase) to boost your cause, while other empires can also play their own cards for or against your motion. It is again abstract, and looses some of the nuance that a straight diplomatic system has in most 4x games but gains an additional means of mechanically expanding your empire and punishing those who threaten you. The AI right now does seem to have a hard time playing with the system, but I think the devs will continue to develop how they interact with it.\n\nShip building has the same feel as the first Star Ruler, but feels more fine tuned this time around. Ships are build on a hexagonal grid where components are placed. Weapons have firing arcs and must be on the exterior of the hull. How you build your ship does determine how well you do in battle, as incoming damage is directional. Fleets have changed in that Capital ships are the primary units of a fleet, and lead support ships with them. When designing ships your design Capital ships and support ships. Capital ships are full sized ships with all of the components you have researched and can fit on them, while support ships are limited to engines, weapons, armor/shields, and a few other systems. Support ships are designed to add fire power and tank to the Capital ship of the fleet.\n\nAs with any early access game here on Steam its always a concern regarding how active the developers are in continuing their project. Here with Star Ruler 2 I've been happy, as the Devs have been releasing new updates very regularly. These updates have included new components, inclusion of races, improvements on mechanics and bug fixes. I fully expect that they will fulfill their goal with this game.","February 20, 2015","true","98.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

However, this particular game I got on day 1, it had zero bugs, was polished and had pretty good gameplay.\n\nThe engine itself even is great.\n\nDo you remember playing games like Sins of a Solar Empire ? Where you'd tell the computer "Hey make me like 1000 planets to fight over." And the game would completely crap itself once you colonised them because nothing was properly threaded ? The interface would lock up and god help you if you went carriers and had 1000 fighters on screen at the same time.\n\nWell this has none of that.\n\nGameplay wise the design of the game I might've changed here or there, however as a whole the game is great. It's interesting and fun, you can design your own ships down to where to put each piece of armor (I hope there'll be more skins for the ships in future).\n\nThe only really serious problem the game has in my opinion is the strategy map and attacking worlds.

The main game concepts - player-designed ships, the economy system, and the unique diplomacy - all work great.\nThe AI is not so great, but that's about the only bad thing about this game. It can be a bit difficult to analyse the user interface to manage planets once you have loads of them, but the UI is mostly good.\n\nTo explain some game concepts:\n- Ships are built using subsystems, placed on a grid of hexes. Every ship has a limited ammount of internal space, so you can only have either big engines, or big weapons.\nIt actually matters where you place subsystems - rail cannons and lasers can only fire some directions, all weapons need to be placed on the outside, most engines need to placed on the outside on the rear, importand stuff should be placed where it's hard to hit, etc.\nDamage passes through the hexes of the ship from the direction the hit came from, usually moving in a straight line. That enables you to armor importand stuff (like the bridge(s)) even more, and also makes your weapons weak-points on your ship - unless you use internal armor, or something similar - as a hit on your weapons won't need to pierce the armor.\n\n- Planets have a resource they produce, population, a pressure limit, and a level.\nPopulation is pretty straight forward - the higher the planet level, the more population the planet can hold.\nResources do several things - some (like food, water, tier I and II resources) are required to level a planet up. Some add pressure, some add special effects. Sending resources from one planet to another is the only way to get a decent economy going.\nPressure capacity increases with population, and some player-build "imperial" buildings.\nPressure makes your planet build "civilian" structures - labour pressure -> industry buildings, money pressure -> markets, etc. You have little influence on that, which makes managing planets easier. Pressure above pressure capacity is not used as efficiently.\nAll that stuff combined (especially the need to gather food, water, and tier I and II resources) makes sure that people expand (turtle-ing is still possible, but even then you need room to breathe), while the fact that level 0 planets cost money to sustain makes sure it isnt just rushing as many planets as possible.\n\n- Diplomacy usually is treaties with other players - which is possible in SR2 as well. However, there is also a "card game" - you play a card that starts a vote, lets say about whether you can annect a planet or system, and everyone can play cards to weigh in on that vote in support, or opposition. Playing and buying cards costs influence. It works pretty well, and it simulates some aspects of diplomacy better than any other system I've seen so far.","June 12, 2015","true","226.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

If you loved Master of Orion, Sins of a Solar Empire or (particularly) Stardrive - you will love this unique take on RTS space sandbox!\n\nThis game manages to let you delve as far into the complexity as you want - customized ships, micro-managing every level 1+ planet, fleet management, etc. without forcing you to do really any of it that doesn't interest you. Some elements will be familiar - research, ship design and combat - but others are innovative and strangely rewarding - particularly the somewhat simplified planet level / pressure system.\n\nThis totally unprecedented approach avoids the common pitfall of having dozens of mediocre planets with long build queues to manage by linking multiple systems together to develop regional powerhouse worlds (a la Trantor from the Federation books). You could manage an empire of 25 - 50 systems that all feed into just 2-4 strategically critical commerce, research and production meccas. It takes a while to understand how to properly connect your web of worlds, but nothing matches the feeling of finally getting that level 5 capital pumping out the cash, research and *most importantly* giant behemoth led fleets.\n\nSpeaking of fleets - the ship design is both deep and rewarding - balancing many different combat roles in a somewhat simplified flagship + supports system. If you don't want to design your own ships, you can download interesting and unique creations built by the community. And the size and scale of the ships and systems is only limited by the size of your empire - with an infinitely scalable (and ingeniuosly "economies of scale" based) size system. Combat is aesthetically beautiful, if tactically thin - but certainly rewards players for careful combination of forces and flanking / disabling manuevres (nothing like hitting a flagship with a disabling ion cannon blast while your backup warps in behind them for the kill!).\n\nMy only gripe is that the AI is unpredictable at best, and downright "unfair" at higher difficulties - and the diplomacy system is only ok. It throws out the Civilization style trading and (most) agreements for an influence based card game where you can bid for and against certain empire and universe wide perks/debuffs. It's pretty easy to ignore - at least in single player. Victory conditions are also lacking, but I could see more paths to victory added in the future (activating the revenant is pretty much a sure thing as I discovered in my last playthrough - how much is 1.6G in supplies anyways...)\n\nOverall this is a huge imrpovement on the original (which I tossed out pretty quickly due to its unapproachable complexity) and really a new game that stands well on its own. Worth the price of entry for any 4X or space buff that wants a fresh take on ruling a massive intergalactic empire!\n\n","April 7, 2015","true","39.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I'd say much more so than Star Ruler 1 ever accomplished.\n\nThe game focuses on the macro side of empire maangement but you can still build key facilities on planets and plan out your empire in some detail. The best new feature of the game is definitely the empire growth side of things. In essence, you are trying to advance a few key planets by supporting them with many less developed ones. It creates a very intricate chain of supply and demand that is also nicely automated enough that it doesn't get tedious.\n\nDiplomacy is very well done and actually a big part of the game. This is the first diplomacy system in a long time that I wanted to dig into. There are diplomatic actions not only by competing empires, but by the general galactic community as a whole. And each faction gets to vote, and attempt to sway votes from other factions as well.\n\nThe combat and ship building have been redone and are now very much more coherent. Combat hinges on massive flagships supported by multiple smaller ships which can play differing roles and tactics in combat.\n\nThere is a lot more to the game, but I'll just stop here and say that this is a title very much worth checking out if you like 4x RTS games or just space empire games in general.

Instead here you don't have a tech tree with weapons and sub-systems coming out of the wazoo (While more veriety would be extremely welcome as in large battles you will just see a modern art piece with all the pretty colours and lines and such).\n\nFlagships need support ships, this forms a fleet. The tech web makes use of links that provide improvements to pre-existing things. You must create a trade network to support your empire. This game has many good things about it that many just ignore because they are so acustomed to the typical stuff we know from other 4X Games, simplicity.\n\n\nBut here are the Pro's and Con's of this game in my honest and unbiased opinion.\n\nPro's:-\n*Deep and meaningful management of your colonies\n*Beautiful space battles in their own right.\n*Unique Race Options\n*Fracking Ring Worlds and Planet Thrusters!\n*Interesting take on the Tech Tree, making it more of a Web.\n*Multiple methods of FTL, making for a unique way to play each time.\n\nCon's:-\n*Limited choice of Sub-Systems can make space battles a little stagnant and ship design a little pointless after a while, offering no adaptation to the enemy.\n*Trade System can be a little too complex at times for some.\n*No Empire Wide management options at the political level\n*No Govenors to automatically manage worlds, a must have feature for anyone playing on larger maps or multi-galaxy ones.\n*Sadly the FTL effect could use some changes, right now it is a little... too much.

This means no SR3 or any further stuff for SR2. SR2 has A LOT of potential. As such it would be a massive shame to see Blindman Studio's close their door's.\n\nThis game is only £18.99 in the UK, I would say it's worth it, oh so worth it. Even if you feel it's too rough right now or dosn't have enough shiny things in it to be worth of your money, just buy it. Get stuck into the game and enjoy it.\nThis is not a AAA company making Star Ruler 2, they are just normal people who made two great games out of passion. Please consider either donating to them or just buying this, or even buying a copy for a friend, the multiplayer in this game can get really fun and intense when you go on a star killing bender!.\n\nI am in no way affiliated with BMS.

The idea itself seems brilliant and fun, however there seems to be insufficient gain from a leveled up planet. Basically all that a higher level planet gives is more money, and i wonder if the extra trade route planning isn't too complicated for the task (although i really like the idea).\n\nTalking combat, it feels strange and detached. Ship design use a wierd hex system instead of nice component pictures, meaning that yes, the ship can be completely customized, but it's so much more complicated compared to star ruler 1, while it seems to achieve the same thing. After the design is done, the fleet gets these ships built *somewhere* within the system and placed around a flagship.\n\nOne problem i have with combat, apart design, is the fact that there is no way to see a fleet's strength by looking at the screen. In order to determine strength, one has to mouse over a fleet to see it's estimated strength. But in battles with more fleets involved i really missed some overall strength information provided without the need to click everything.\n\nPros:\nRegardless of my negative reccomendation, this game is full of great ideas, some of which it managed to capitalize on. Namely:\n- The pressure system. This basically means that when a resource is imported to a planet, it generates pressure for the civilians to build according refinement structures (research labs for research resources, etc.).\n- Diplomacy. I have never seen such a useful diplomacy in space games - buying and playing cards with influence, where the cards can range from improving player's fleet or planet, to annexing an entire enemy system if the vote passes in the galactic senate. The diplomacy seems like a much better version of galactic civilizations.\n- Defense resources (allowing to construct defensive ships anywhere), and many, *many* other resources which do interesting things. This game have many interesting mechanics.\n\nIn conclusion, i think this is a game worth waiting for. The mechanics are very complex, and once they get balanced out into a fun and playable mix, then it will be time to get this game.","March 8, 2015","false","13.9"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","22","39","2","9"

Currently, my descriptive thoughts of this game are "messy, non-intuitive, some innovative concepts, 4x strategy space sim".\n\nThe game suffers from developers with great ideas, but perhaps too many.  I know 4x titles, and what works, and what doesn't.  Many features in this game are new and innovative, like diplomacy.  However, I think that some of these innovations, like diplomacy, could have been executed differently.  Some of the greatest features of the titles predecessor, Star Ruler 1, such as research and ship design, were completely replaced.\n\nWhile, after playing 100 hours now, I think the new ship design system has some interesting aspects, and does require good understanding of the battle system mechanics to build an effective ship, it lacks the quick adjustment that I prefered in the old system.  I also have little care for firing arcs, and how armor blocks the firing arcs of systems... sort of.  If you understand the mechanics, you can build infront of the firing arc, with out obstructing it.  This is a pretty big oversite.\n\nI hate research webs.  Therefore, perhaps I am biased, but I think even a research tree would have been preferable to this new research system.  I simply prefered their old system, even with its draw backs, which could have been worked on rather than gutting the whole system.\n\nThe closest thing I can compare this game to is Distant Worlds (DW), as that is also played in real time, i.e. not turned base.  Both have some similar economic models in they have planets with resources that have to be transfered around the empire, but that is done very differently in each game.  The automation systems of DW would help SR2 greatly.  The high level of macro the game requires can be distracting, and results in a multitude of tedious tasks that have to be done, but are not fun in the process.\n\nConclusion:  The developers of SR2 have a great game in SR1, and I think they should have kept more of the originals features.  They changed some systems that I felt needed only improvements, not replacements.  The addition of the diplomacy minigame that has major game impacts also just becomes tedious quite quickly into the game as there is zero automation for it.  It feels they thought it would be fun and interesting in multiplayer games, and it probably is.  However, that is one feature I won't be testing, as I never play any MP that may take more than an hour at a time, (this game could take days depending on player count and galaxy size)\n\nStar Ruler 2 has some potential to be fun if you really like to have heavy macro in real time.  However, there are many tedious tasks that are unnecessary, and would be better left to automation.  Distant Worlds, while more expensive, and not as innovative or interesting, is a much more solid RTS 4x space sim title with a trustworthy AI that can be automated.\n\nIf you decide to purchase the game expect a high learning curve, and to search on the forums to answer many of your questions.  There are many features of the game not listed in the wiki, or explained in the very short tutorial.  I will give this game a tentative recommendation, but with the reservation that it may not be for those who want a traditional 4x title.\n\nSome features I would like to see improved on,\n\n1.	Savable new game settings, to include AI empire settings (Behavior, color, flag, etc..)\n\n2.	Diplomacy:  A sound to let you know when the cards are about to switch, or when someone is starting to beat your vote\n\n3.	Research:  I hate the web, but less random placement of certain techs would be prefered such that you can specialize better.\n4.	Scouting:  This needs to be automated for auto surveying of anomalies (a fun minigame actually)\n5.	Expansion:  Colonization, and conquering is very tedious, the latter more so than the former.  An automated, claim system for an entire system of colonizing or conquering would be nice.\n6.	Economy:  Needs more automation of planets.  I miss governers.\n7.	Fighting and Fleet Management:  Need preset saved layouts of support ships done in ratios as support capacity will change from ship to ship.  Takes too much time to set up supports.","April 26","true","156.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","21"

The developer took risks by using unfamiliar mechanics with the planet resource chaining system. I love this because it allowed me to stimulate my brain by figuring out the best strategies with these new rules.\n\nIt's also very fun messing around with the ship designer as well. You can place either one huge engine, or multiple smaller engines to get the same propulsion. However, with multiple engines, your ships will turn faster. However, it requires more control points and you have to put down more command modules. The same goes with your guns. You can have one huge gun that only takes one control point, or a lot of smaller ones requiring lots of command points. The disadvantage to having one huge gun is that it might fire at a small ship, which is a waste of its firepower. Your ship will target multiple enemies when there are multiple guns, reducing the chance that you will waste firepower on smaller enemies.\n\nThe placement of your modules and armor also factors in. Your guns have a firing arc and if the enemy is not within that arc, they cannot fire. So you can flank enemy fleets to get the first few initial shots. Engines also tend to be unarmored so if you flank directly from behind, your fire will damage the enemy engines which slows down their turning rate, allowing you to get even more shots before they are able to fire back.\n\nIt's definitely worth the price tag and I highly recommend it.","April 27","true","65.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

While there are a few bugs here and there, for an Early Access game Star Ruler 2 is a very solid experience with some unique innovations on a genre that only occasionally releases games that attempt to climb out of the established tropes and mechanics. The dev team is also very active, friendly and easily reachable through the in-game IRC client. Their dedication to keeping a line open to the community is very clear, just from a few hours of having spoken with them today.  If you like RTS / 4X style games, I would recommend Star Ruler 2 to you, but I would also say that you should be prepared to share any bugs you might find, and not expect a finished product like many gamers seem to expect unfairly from early access releases.","July 19, 2014","true","16.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","2"

This game seems to be a expanded varient of a game series called Endless Space. While Endless space is mostly just stats and either winning or losing (yes there is minor battle scenes which all play out almost the same) Star Ruler 2 seems to illustrate every part of space colonization with realtime battles consisting of different sized ships controlled in by a capital ship. I will hopefully write more after I have thoroughly played, but for now I would highly recommend this game if space x4's are your thing.\n\nEdit 1: After more play, the colonization, ship building, budget system are all flawless and work well. Unlike Endless Space, Pandora: First Contact and other x4's this game finds a good balance for needing to expand and having the capability without being slammed with unhappyness, diplomatic nonsense and general unrealism (I mean come one ES, an empire being unhappy for expansion?).

Sins of a Solar Empire was ok not great and trend setting like Homeworld was at its breakout. I have no idea why I finally decided to buy Star Ruler 2 and try it, I have a lot of games which I barely even played after purchase. This game "Star Ruler 2" got me hooked really quickly. I really like the interface it seems very well thought out and fairly intuitive. I did go through the tutorial, unlike most games where I just dive in and play. It took me a few run thru's to figure out most of the game mechanics. I love the sandbox that lets us build and test designs outside a game. I do think the cost/performace ratios of implementing new support ships need a bit of tweaking. Seems a bit expensive for just a few minor improvements in weapon hitting power.  That may just be a noob complaint tho. I have not played Star Ruler 1 so I don't have it to compare against. Overall I give it my reccomendation as a game to pick up and play, well worth the price for the amount of time I will end up playing this game.\n\nWell I have played the game a few more days, still totally exhausted from lack of sleep right now. I think the best feature of the game right now is the diplomacy system. Playing the cards you have to obtain an advantage from buffs to your systems and ships, to annexing a planet or system next or stealing an artifact from out of someone eles's territory can be fun all by itself. I spent some time exchaning cards/votes over a planet and won. It was all backroom deals, blackmail, bribery, outright bribery won the planet for me. Then I lost in another bid for a star system because I had exhausted my cards, ie run out of things to blackmail, bribe or negotiate the votes to my advantage. So I got mad declared war and took the system. I felt all high from my victory until the enemy showed up with some darned ship with what looked like a couple of million hit points and crushed all my fleets. :p The most fun I have had losing ever!\n\nI have been trying various things out in terms of how I set things up as far as my colonies go. I found out NOT to use megafarms and those water makers for every occasion. I went broke real fast doing that.\n\nI found that using two scouts early on worked better for me. One I set to auto explore and the second I used to scan all the debris the first one found.\n\nIn one game I kept using the long range telescope/spy artifacts near me to seek out artifacts in alien territory so I could use political intrigue to sneak out the artifacts I needed. Genesis devices and star makers are what you should really spend your political clout on, All the other benefits from artifacts you can gain from research.  I used starmakers to create bridge systems between distant clusters of stars I have colonized.\n\nIt seems most battles are one on one straight slugging matches with opponents facing each other.  It seemed to me that the computer fires to center of mass of each ship. So I placed bridges and power systems in the middle slightly off center, with heavy frontal armor and using supplies, weapons, controls etc to act as protection for the bridges. Worked great until the last game where the AI sent in flanking attacks with additional fleets after I engaged two of his fleets with two frontal and one rear attack. I had to send in 5 other fleets to win the engagement. It was a very pretty battle! :D\n\nHeheh, today I found out that the guys/gals who developed this game have a sense of humor. I was curious and tried to create a galaxxy with 6000 star systems. The game had no issue generating the map, just a statement that I found hilarious. :D","March 24, 2015","true","183.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Stable, fun to play, and has a neat and unique twist of strategies for a 4x game.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n-Game is pretty stable for being early stages. Though I did not have any crashes or show stopping events, I did notice a few places where the UI could be corrected. Nothing major and I am sure the developers will solve this in time\n\n- You will either absolutely love or loathe the planet resource sharing system. It is very unique and different from anything that I have played. In their current version you must obtain a bunch of smaller, low level planets and share a single resource per planet in a web that eventually all points to a main planet. (The tutorial really helps explain this more)\n\n-Research, research, research. Though I can see the cause and effects of the different system, I really enjoyed the system from SR1. I personally love LOTS of research, unlocking all kinds of new stuff, being able to do super awesome things. Again this is early access, so I am sure there will be more things to come.\n\n- Though the game is good AND in early stages I feel like the game is missing a deep element. Space. I use to love being able to build a legit mining fleet, sending them to an asteroid belt, build an outpost and send those resources back to my empire. I loved the idea of building the space stations that had different features and reasons to be built. I loved the immense depth of SR1 with all of the things you could (or could not) do. I feel that even though this game is still in early stages it is missing some fundamentally sound building blocks. Everything has been streamlined, we took the ability to micromanage away and replaced it with a simple ‘Right Click – Build mining outpost – walk away and never think about that asteroid again’ mentality.\n\nOverall I think it’s going to shape out to be a great game. It has many new and exciting features and in time will turn into something as fun as SR1\n","December 1, 2014","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While many of the systems are not fully completed (graphics aren't final, some UI quirks etc) this game definately has the trappings of greatness. In particular, I like the new planetary leveling system. Each planet has 1 resource and they require a combination of resources to level up. So you might have 1 or 2 crown worlds at level 4 (the max) and several smaller worlds which are supplying the goods to those planets. This type of internal trading simply doesn't exist in other 4x games.\n\nIn addition to the internal trade routes, there is a pressure system. If I supply a planet with materials for energy (plutonium etc), then small civilian structures will be built based upon energy production. So some of your planet's construction is done automatically based upon what resources you supply. This gives a very organic feel to the planet's developments.","August 11, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Stop, and read this review, typically I look for negative reviews for games I am borderline on. However, Star Ruler 2 is better than that.

The AI is still pretty dull but it's "okay enough, I guess". It's worth knowing that multiplayer is solid and has an interesting feature: just go host a game and throw in a bunch of AI and start playing as if it was single-player. Other players will see your game in the list (unless you specifically lock it) and they can just join in, taking over for an AI. It means you can sit down for a single-player game and have a chance for some real brains to show up, which is a nice way to do it, versus having to sit around and hope people join at the start.\n\nAnyway, the game is a real-time, space-based 4X with a focus on high level strategy. Battles occur somewhat like they would in Sins of a Solar Empire, but with less control -- you aren't meant to intensely focus on a particular battle. You are meant to primarily command the comings and goings of fleets as a whole, and flanking does matter (as many people design ships with most armor and guns to the front). This type of combat is what lets the real-time strategy component work and stay integrated into the main game (as opposed to some mini-game that it tosses you into, as in the old MOO games.)\n\nShip design is a primary focus and one of the most interesting aspects of the game. How you design your ship can impact how they will fight. You can get some pretty diverse ship styles.\n\nPlanetary management can seem complex at first but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty simple to work on the fly. Planets have resources that require a certain "planet level" to work. Raising the planet level involves importing resources, so you end up with a sort of support pyramid of minor planets exporting their goods to better planets which in turn export their goods to support a bustling capital, of sorts.\n\nReally the two biggest problems I have with the game is that I wish the AI was more of a challenge and I wish more people played multiplayer! I think "early access" hurt the game because some aspects were very under-developed for a long time and people got bored. The 1.0.0 release added tons of new stuff, really fleshed out the tech tree and made the races distinct but for a majority of the early-buyers I think it was too late -- even though they mostly liked the game, they felt they played it out already and probably never even noticed 1.0.0 came out with so many changes.\n\nAnyway, I think it's great. I'll be looking for you in multiplayer.\n","April 25, 2015","true","136.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

A nice change of pace from the very heavy and loud brass section and symphonic feel of Star Wars and its imitators.\n-The game seems extremely deep-it's hard to tell because it's also very dense, to the point that I've barely scratched the surface of what I can do in the game. I've barely tapped into the gameplay of even the "default" terrakin, and my short poke at the Oko feels totally different. I had to rethink a great deal about how I was going to do exploration, expansion, all that stuff.\n-The senate system feels a lot like playing munchkin or a similar party game, with little cards you play to do stuff.\n-import/export system leads to entire systems of planets just to provide the infrastructure for a few. It's very interesting.\n-Real-time progression with pausability means you have the time to learn at your own pace, queue up orders and the like at your leisure, then unpause the game and let it progress. No frantic clicking and timed build orders here, although I'm sure there are optimal procedures for the first few minutes of the game.\n-Yes, you can design and build your own ships.

Many games claim to be "easy to learn, hard to master" - this game actually fulfills that more than any other game I've ever played.\n\nAs for giving an idea of what this game brings to the 4x genre:\n1. Economy - in most 4x games you just build basically everything you can on every planet you can to maximize production across the board and then spam fleets from everywhere.  Star Ruler couldn't be further from that - instead you funnel resources to planets so that you end up with only a couple advanced planets, with most others either providing the resources or supporting your empire in other ways.\n\nIs it difficult to do this?  No.  You simply right click on your planet and tell it to level up if you wish to develop it further than it is.  The game will automatically find available resources and route them.  There is a simple to understand chart showing which resources you have excess of, which you need, which you are currently acquiring, and which planets are having problems.\n\n2. Diplomacy. Most 4x games you talk to each of the other empires individually and try to set up trade agreements or other political standings.  In this game... Diplomacy is a minigame which every government plays. Over time, Governments acquire influence points and then use those influence points for Politics cards which are used in this minigame. This model for Diplomacy completely blows away any other Diplomacy model I've seen in a 4x game before.\n\n3. Customizing ships.  Most 4x Games have some means for customizing their units based upon the technology they acquire through the game.  This one is no different - except where most 4x games simply allow you to swap modules, this one lets you completely design every aspect of the ship.    for a first time player, this may seem overwhelming when faced with the prospect of having to continuously redesign ships every time they get new technology or become richer...   Never fear - there is a scaling mechanism where you can simply modify a single value for your design, and the ship becomes more powerful and costs more - that way you can focus upon simply making tweaks to a ship design that you are fond of.\n\nNot only can you custom build your own ships - but Star Ruler allows you to share those designs with other people in the community by uploading and downloading the designs within the game interface.\n\n4. Combat - THIS is what fleet battles in a 4x game should be like.  You quickly end up with fights where there are hundreds of individual ships duking it out - and taking down capital ships, is pretty satisfying.

Even the method of colonizing planets can seem backwards.\n\nIn truth however Star Ruler 2 (even still in Beta) has a play mechanic that is more suited to Multi-Player Online mechanics then the coveted original 4x Space Sims.\n\nTake it from a veteran Master of Orion player like myself. Balancing a game like Masters of Orion for online use has been tried many times but IMHO no one has gotten it to work out well. Part of the inventiveness of this Real Time 4x system is the use of influence points that are used in Diplomacy. Add the 'Pressure' mechanic along with auto colony ships and you have the closest thing to a Masters of Orion-Real Time mechanic. It feels like my 100+ hours of playing Maters of Orion but with better graphics.\n\nA note on the  Pressure mechanic: You can just think of it like seeing someone who has 3 tons of lemons and is screaming about it to you (the Boss.) Pressure amounts the computer deciding to make lemon aid without screaming to you about it or worse just letting them rot. A welcome and novel idea that balances out the Real Time while keeping to the origins of 4x.\n\nIt's still in Beta but this is the 4x to watch","July 31, 2014","true","78.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

That is just how good this game is. I'll keep this short and sweet since so many have given far greater depth in their reviews.\n\nI played SR1 and loved the concept, but it felt cubersome and quite frankly the micromanaging could be a pain. SR2 has the same depth but it is so much more smooth, even though there is still quite a bit of logistics the way it is done makes it a painless experience.\n\nDespite how intuitive the gameplay feels underneath the surface is a great degree of depth and complexity. Some might ♥♥♥♥♥ about the diplomacy system, but is fun and deep once you get used to it. Honestly it opens up far more interesting interactions than conventional 4x titles.\n\nIn summary I would say everything in the game just works, every system has a purpose and meshes well into the overall gameplay. Have't had the pleasure of multiplayer yet but given how the systems work it would work well. Also the AI is quite decent, good expansion and overall a challenge for the uninitiated.\n\nThis is the best 4x game I have played with a great mix between scale and depth.

And I think because of that, I am disappointed with the sequel.\n\nThe original game had nearly endless control and personalization.  You made everything the way you wanted.  From the ships to the size of the universe, it was all yours to make the way you wanted it.  In SR 2, there is a certain level of customization, but it feels dumbed down.  Like they gave you control of things, but put pre-school style bumper protectors on all the sharp corners of the customizing tools.\n\nEven the visuals seem dumbed down to those childish levels.  Instead of the original control theme and layout, that wasn't particularly flashy, but not at all lacking, we are given a theme following in the footsteps of Apple products and the Windows 8.  As if it expects the players of today are all mindless zombies that lack the knowledge to understand any UI that isn’t made with giant colorful icons that feel like they were plagiarized out of a toddler’s learning book.\n\nThe saving grace I would have to say is the unique diplomacy game play, but even that portion suffers from a “card Game” interface.  In my opinion, random generated cards you have to grab; a good gameplay system, does not make.\nThe fleet system is a huge step backward in my opinion as well.  Now, instead of making and controlling each individual ships, you just build a fleet.  Now, that ship is many individual ships that you can design, but you control the fleet as one giant unit, effectively making it really just one ship with the sum of powers from the ships within it.  I prefer the original games take on ships.  It might be more cumbersome to manage battles, but I like the challenge.\n\nStar Ruler 2 is not a terrible game.  I just feel it doesn’t even come close to being a worthy successor to the original game.\n","April 2, 2015","false","2.7"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","16","31","0","0"

This is the best 4x space strategy I have ever played. It is only limited by what your computer can handle. Unlike SOASE your fleet size is unlimited, along with galaxy size/number. You can also create war machines the size of the galaxy, although that would probably take a year to build in real time, you can do it! There have been major improvements since Star Ruler 1 that make this game easier to play. One thing I hated about the first one is the AI players would always out expand me and therefor wipe me out after about 4 hours of playing. This one encourages rapid expansions and makes it fun and not just something you have to do to keep up with the AI. It also gives you a home base to build the best stuff instead of having many home bases to protect your systems. From what I have seen so far you really only need one or two massive armies to protect yourself with the FTL system. Instead of spending 20 minutes watching your ships snail their way through space you can just have them warp and be there in a few seconds.\n\nIt is very hard to learn at first but becomes easy after you understand the basics. The tutorial is not very instructive when it comes to resources and planet leveling and I had to watch a youtube video to understand it. I honestly do not know why this game is not as popular as some of the other 4x games out there. I think this game would rival Civilization in terms of enjoyment.","September 26, 2014","true","127.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd say you might like the first one even if you don't like this, or that you might not like this one if you liked the first. Although this game is not complete, I think they won't change the idea of the game that much, regardless of how much people cry about it.\n\nI'd say this game is more oriented towards the multiplayer experience than the first one.\n\nBeing different doesn't make it bad though and although seemingly simplistic, it doesn't lack in depth in most aspects of the game. In combat micro management is almost non-existent though, But there is lots of other stuff to do.\n\nPlanetary management seems simple, link planets to make resources to turn your homeworld to level 4 and get the wonder thing. But the game does become quite complex when you start to think about what each resource does and how to best use it. Stacking every kind of resource on a single planet quickly fills the planet and you can't use all of the Pressure to you advantage. The game at it's current state doesn't try to make the resources too different, but I could see how the devs might start messing around with them to make them more varied. Maybe more can be added via modding at some later date? Also note that it seems to be possible to have multiple resources on a single planet. You really have to know how the game works in order to understand what this means, but don't worry if you don't.\n\nDiplomacy is quite unique in this game, best described as a card game. Already there are quite lots of different cards you can play in the diplomacy game, but as same with the resources, I think the devs have made a choice to only add the ones that are quite balanced. More might come later, and maybe even modded ones? Inter - racial diplomacy seemed a bit lacking, peace or war seemed to be the only choices? Maybe I somehow missed it?\n\nShip design has been simplified in this game, I think it makes for a better multiplayer experience, since designing ships is a bit faster now. I rarely made mining ships in the first game because designing a balanced ship required quite a lot of tweaking I would never have had the time to make them in a multiplayer match. And note that when you research upgrades to components, you need to design it again to get the optimal design, in the first game. In this one the ship components don't change in the various resource consumption ways, such as power and command. This makes it so that the ship designs stay optimal. I play kerbal space program, but in a game like this, I actually prefer simplistic ship design mechanisms. The game might need a few more components, but I don't see the point in having weapons (or other components) that are just better in every way to others.\n\nCombat is the one area I find a bit lacking, The visual effects currently clutter everything and the only thing you can make out is two blobs diminishing in size. There isn't any combat micromanagement to do either. Two blobs go in, one leaves. But this is not that big of an issue since the game provides other stuff for you to do. If you like space combat micromanagement games, you should really check out "Nexus: The Jupiter Incident".\n\nResearch is quite boring right now, but I hope it's due to the fact that the game is still in development, although I quite like the Insight mechanism.\n\nExploration of the map is quite interesting since you are looking for artifacts and resources. For quite a while 4x games haven't really made a big deal about the exploration.\n\nSo all in all, this isn't a space 4x simulation game, but I don't think that it's bad because of it. I'm really waiting for them to finish it an try the multiplayer.\n\nI bought it to support the development and because I had the loose money to do so. Don't buy it to play it, yet.","July 25, 2014","true","134.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

(as of now since it is a beta). Star Ruler the original is still installed on my system and still gets some play time. I love that game, it is awesome. All this said, I do recommend Star Ruler 2, however, I hope they make a few more changes.\n\nPros:\n\nDiplomacy, the “buy a card, play a card” system is actually rather interesting\n\nFTL, there are several FTL technologies, each race dependant.\n\nGraphics, ships and weapons fire looks amazing.\n\nTerritory and FoW, both systems are done quite well.\n\nMixed:\n\nBudget system, everything is built using “money”. It is a little simple for my personal tastes.\n\nPlanet management, (I don’t hate it… completely) some planets have food, some have water and some have a resource. For a planet to grow at all, it has to have food AND water. You have a few options to do this, build a farm or hydro collector, which normally costs more to maintain than the planet makes in income, or trade it from one planet to the next. Here is the clincher, if you trade off a resource, that planet can no longer use it. The way it is tiered, once you have a level 3 or 4 planet, you have about 10 level 0s trading their resources off to support it. This does keep the computer from colonizing everything, but it still feels strange to me.\n\nPower, Energy, FTL and Research, the way you stockpile and earn these is a pain. Power is used to buy and play diplomacy cards. Energy is used to activate artifacts. FTL is your empire’s pool of FTL crystals, any ship using FTL will deplete from this pool. Research is … for research. There are bonus ways to get points in these categories but the basic way is from left over “budget” allocation.\n\nCons:\n\nShip control, capital ships … that’s all you can control … Well, capital ships and scouts, but that is seriously it. You build a capital ship, tell it what to do, and it is followed around by “support” ships. A few of my largest battles to date were between a handful of ships and their supports. To me, this system is somewhat lack luster.\n\nShip design, do you like rail guns, lasers and missiles? I sure hope so, because that’s pretty much all the weapons there are. There are only about a dozen modules total and you only have to research a few of them.\n","September 23, 2014","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First impressions though: I REALLY like the navigation/FTL system. There are no rigid "lanes" like in Sins, at least not for Terrans. The Galaxy is continuous and each race traverses it in their own unique way. I've only tried Terrakin so far, who use hyperdrive, but other races use gates. There may be more forms I haven't seen.\n\nGraphics are good enough, nothing to write home about. The ship battles are spectacles, though, compared to Sins. I also really really like the fleet system- capital ships form the backbone of fleets and automatically issue orders to their escort frigates and whatnot. You can have 60-120 small ships in formation and only worry about giving orders to the flagship unless you want to micro. They can also be set to auto-replenish with new recruits.\n\nI also like the colonization system, you pick the planet and your homeworld automatically sends convoys of colony ships instead of one unit like most games use. I'm barely scratched the surface of planet development and economics but from what I can tell it's pretty in depth.\n\nI'll probably have to post a more thorough review tomorrow when I have a better handle on the gameplay but my first impression is definitely very positive. Put simply it seems like it's a thinking person's Sins of a Solar Empire- besides having deeper 4X features basic things are also improved. For instance, you can actually do things while paused and the galaxy is more scientifically accurate and interesting to explore.\n\nI can't wait to play more, it feels fresh and promising and I predict sinking a good bit of time into it.","December 23, 2015","true","89.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The interconnectedness of all of your planets is super fun and maximizing the flow of resources to a single capital planet is really creative, believable, and adds a nice element of challenege to the game. Eventually, though, micromanaging your empire and scouring the map for water and food is a pain in the butt (but also very believable!).\n\nCombat in this game is really cool and the ship building system is very cool, though can be intimidating. The movement of units on the map is also really well done.\n\nThe Bad:\nI'd say the area this game is the weakest the abysmal tech tree (even after the update), and also the diplomacy. Honestly I didn't really care for the card system, but I give it up to the devs for doing something out of the box and unique from other similar titles.","February 1","true","10.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyndonguitar/recommended/282590/","lyndonguitar","lyndonguitar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyndonguitar/","309 products in account","First of all, It's not your typical 4X game like Distant Worlds, GalCiv, Endless Space, Space Empires, Sins of a Solar Empire, and not even Star Ruler 1.\n\nEverything is different, the resources, diplomacy, the tech tree, the unit system. But they still got some nice cool things similar to other space 4x games.  The battle system is similar to Sins of a Solar Empire(which was great), the planet management is similar to GalCiv, in which the planets have tiles, ship builder is similar to StarDrive(the only thing good about that game imo)\n\nIt's a very complex game to learn and yet there is simplicity in it, it just departs so much from the typical 4X formula that it has a very steep learning curve, but once you completely learn the mechanics(including learning some weird new terms like 'pressure') you'll find the simplicity and awesomeness of the game.\n\nEmpire building is epic as there is a lot of end game options. You can make artificial planets, ring worlds surrounding a whole star, star/planet destroying machines/ships. Factories that harvest the star itself(and damages it to destruction), ships are basically only limited by your empire's economy. Build the biggest ship that you can, or the most powerful ship in the galaxy, or the universe(you can play multiple galaxies)\n\n\nResourcesResources are two different things, the planets' resources in which you control the imports and exports, it will affect the level of the planets depending on the trade route that you create in your empire. Funnel all resources into one planet and that planet becomes a big powerhouse.\n\nand the Empire resources, you can't stockpile money now unlike other 4x games but you are given a budget cycle(which is 3 minutes long, comparable to one turn in 4x TBS games, you would think it's short, but you'll find that 3 mins is already a long time once you play this game). The budget cycle works great imo because it limits your spending and realistically approaches your empire spending. For example in GalCiv, once you have stockpiled a lot of credits you can just binge-buy every ship to completion and have an huge army in a few turns. You also generate overtime resources like, FTL as fuel for your ships. Energy, to power artifacts and devices. Research, to buy new techs. and Influence, to make diplomacy moves.\n\nDiplomacyDiplomacy is great because it is very different and more complex than other 4x games. It's not your typical, 'offer system', where you offer things and hope the AI accepts while sometimes the AI offers hoping that you accept.\n\nIt uses a 'card deck' system where cards can be acquired by the empires to advance their interests that costs influence points to activate, most cards you activate are presented to the Galactic Senate where other empires including you can impact(by activating more cards) if it will be accepted or not.  Some example of cards are 'Infiltrate', 'Protect System', 'Annex Planet', 'Host Senate Building'. It's like playing a trading card game. It needs more options though.\n\nTech TreeThe tech tree is awesome, most of the upgrades are scalar in which your ship's stats themselves get more powerful, and you don't need to replace the parts of ships every so often. although there are a lot of unlockable ship parts as well, but It's so balanced that you won't always resort into using that part you just unlocked. There's lots of pros and cons to each and every ship part and it's well balanced.\n\nDifferent ways to travel in space are also here. Stargates like the Xseries/Galciv games, Hyperdrive like star wars, Slipstream like Halo, or Fling Beacons like Mass Relays in Mass Effect. You can even go sublight and not use FTL tech. Ships don't have constant speed as well, they accelerate. They will go faster the longer the trip.\n\nUnit SystemFor me it's the best feature in the game. You only need to manage fleets, not single ships that you make individually and manually group into fleets. There are two types of ships. Flagships and support ships. You only need to make flagships, depending on the design, flagships can support a max number of support ships, and you don't need to create the support ship. The flagships will automatically 'order' support ships in order to fill the max number. Allows you to have an epic number of units around without having the usual unit cluster♥♥♥♥ associated with it.\n\nPerformance and bugsThe runs smooth on my rig even while playing huge maps and thousands of units that would otherwise run poorly if it were another game, it suffers some minor bugs though and the occasional crashing, but the game loads fast anyway that I didn't care if it crashed, I just clicked play on steam and I'm playing in no time, just be sure to save often and keep backups.\n\n8/10","January 1","true","79.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has an interesting diplomacy system that, unlike most strategy games, has a major impact on gameplay.\n\nThe empire management takes a bit of getting used too but once you are used to it it becomes a fun logistical puzzle and because of the way the worlds are dependant on eachother losing any one world even the smallest and most insignificant has a huge impact on your empire that forces you to react quickly to any threat or loss.\n\nThe ship customization if genius and fun, you will come up with countless clever designs to meet different needs you come across as you progress. This leads to a constantly evolving rock, paper, scisscors game when playing against other people as you are constantly unlocking new tech and adapting your designs to deal with your enemies own adaptations.\n\nThe final positive I will talk about, and I mentioned it at the start, the scale of this game is incredible in my most recent game upon writing this review I had a max size Titan that had well over 3000 support ships in a single fleet bare in mind I had another three at about 1/8th the size that had almost a thousand each and another two titans of varying sizes with between 1000 and 2000. All this and it had very little impact on the games performance, my system is only a mid range gaming PC and it ran surpisingly well, the battles are absurd and what it lacks in graphical fidelity the scale more than makes up for.\n\nThere game isn't perfect however, I can always think of more additions and a greater variation between races, the addition of ground combat and a proper boarding/ship capturing system would be very welcome, and just a general expansion to the tech tree a greater range of technologies and a greater impact on your race. It could also do with increasing the impact on your empire rather than just unlocking new structures and have these technologies need to spread throughout your empire before they take effect.\n\nLastly and this is a very minor negative but might be something scaring off a lot of people, the graphics for this game aren't great I've mentioned this before and I've also mentioned the reason for it in passing. The scale of this game is incredible and I can honestly say I'm glad the graphics are where they chose to limit themselves, if they were any better you couldn't have as many different stars and worlds and ships flying around them as you do now and that freedom is really what set's this game apart from other 4x strategy games.","December 30, 2015","true","89.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Combining the 4x-style grand empire building of greats like the Galactic Civilizations and Space Empires franchises with the deep tactical fleet combat and real-time of Sins of a Solar Empire, at a very affordable cost.\n\nDiplomacy is like a Magic: The Gathering card minigame, using your Influence resource to purchase and use cards of various abilities and strengths against rival empires to vy for special bonuses. Perform too many diplomacy actions that rival empires don't like, such as annexing their planets or systems, and they'll declare war. Very refreshing take, I like it.\n\nThe really big negative I've seen early, that I found was echoed by many, is the AI. Of the 7 available factions to choose from the AI is a master at one(The Oko), and will dominate with it everytime. Whereas with another faction (The Mono) the AI has no idea how to use it, and it will basically surrender to the first empire that sneezes at it. Best bet is to play without those 2 factions.\n\nI haven't done the multiplayer yet, but I'm told it is rather brutal. Looking forward to it.\n\nOverall 8/10, really great job from such a small developer. Though their studio is closing down, the devteam has promised to finish deploying an expansion that should add and fix a lot of things.","January 4","true","93.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

SR2 easily my favorite space 4x. If you've played other 4x space games, here are the main draws:\n\n* Properly 3d space, that is, things can be above or below\n* Actually interesting and useful diplomacy!\n* Civilian ships! You can actually do real commerce raiding, and you blockade by actually attacking shipping\n* Very good ship design, but ships can be any size you think you can build. Placement location matters! Where you place armor and so on is important to combat.\n* Very unique and interesting FTL that can vary between empires and act quite differently\n* Battles are interesting, and not too fast\n* Multiplayer!\n* Native Linux support!\n* Reasonable pricetag!\n\nThe tech tree is the weakest part of the game, but compared to the standard 4x these days its not "weak". There are some fantastically cool things deep in that tech tree but I haven't got them yet. :(\n\nThis game plays a lot differently than others, you spend a lot of time moving resources, colonizing worlds because you need the resources of that world rather than "just places to put things" like other 4x games. By that I mean worlds have different "exportable resouces" that you can ship to other worlds, that they'll need to become bigger and better.\n\nNow, this game is really good -- but its complex to play. Expect to spend your first few games just trying to figure out how it all works before you really get a handle on it. The AI is challenging.\n\nBottom line, this is the 4x to get, the rest are fluff compared to this one.\n\nPS. Check out the growing modding community!

Well that changed with this game.\n\nWhat I like about this game is that there is always something going on, always something to do:\n\n1) Combats: You have to keep on eye on your fleets, as setting up flanks and double teams can take out lesser foes.\n\n2) Infrastructure. The infrastructure in the game is just enough to keep things interesting. This is probably the area I'd like to see more in, but its still good.\n\n3) Influence: The influence game is the most revolutionary aspect, and is very well done. You can conquer entire systems right from the Senate floor, and it pays to switch attention to this from time to time.\n\n4) Artifacts: There are some great artifacts in the game you can activate from time to time, that do everything from give your ships a boost to generate an entire new star!!! This is where a lot of those legendary things you always wanted to do in a space game (create a new star, immediately terraform a planet, build a machine that will destroy a planet!) can be found.\n\n5) Ship Design: I generally ignore custom ship designing, its just not for me. However, this system provides a good blend of form and function. Its fast to make new models, and the lack of artist in me can still feel like I made something neat, that also has function in combat.\n\n\nOverall this game has got me sucked in, and really given me that "one more minute" feeling that I like in a 4xer.

The planet management is (at least to me) fresh and I like the different approach which removes the need for micromanagement (in most cases). Getting your planets set up and producing labour, money, energy, etc is challenging but enjoyable. I like this aspect of the game the most closely followed by the ship designer with it's hex tiles and novel way of handling ship damage (knowing how damage is applied is key to designing good ships). Graphics are great, fleet battles look fantastic.

It might be overwhelming at first, but the tutorial covers the most important stuff and the reward is huge, as the possibilities for building your empire and your fleet are extremely versatile, even for a 4X game.\n\nI'm an old-school MOO2 fan and this is the first game since then, that really makes me want to try out all the different races and crush those pesky AI rivals, which by the way seem like pretty decent opponents (for my difficulty anyway, it's on hard!).\n\nThe fact that it's real time doesn't seem to bother me as much as I thought it would, sadly I am not very good at games like Star Craft or Company of Heroes. This however is more of a relaxed game like Sins of a Solar Empire, but with much more interesting opportunities opening up at every given moment. I thought it was strange that there isn't really a specific victory condition, although you can set a timer to determine the civilization with the highest overall score.\nSpeaking of which - the level of customization and game options is amazing! We can create multiple galaxies in different shapes and forms and there are percentage sliders for almost anything of importance.\n\nYes it takes a little bit of dedication to get into, the UI isn't up to scratch, player feedback is bare bones and there seem to be lag issues in Multiplayer over internet connections that aren't very fast (LAN seems to work fine though). Yet I can only hope this gets a lot more attention than it currently does with Star Drive and the new Gal Civ taking the spotlight.\n\nIf you like MOO or GalCiv, you will probably enjoy this!","June 22, 2015","true","25.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But they still got some nice cool things similar to other space 4x games.  The battle system is similar to Sins of a Solar Empire(which was great), the planet management is similar to GalCiv, in which the planets have tiles, ship builder is similar to StarDrive(the only thing good about that game imo)\n\nIt's a very complex game to learn and yet there is simplicity in it, it just departs so much from the typical 4X formula that it has a very steep learning curve, but once you completely learn the mechanics(including learning some weird new terms like 'pressure') you'll find the simplicity and awesomeness of the game.\n\nEmpire building is epic as there is a lot of end game options. You can make artificial planets, ring worlds surrounding a whole star, star/planet destroying machines/ships. Factories that harvest the star itself(and damages it to destruction), ships are basically only limited by your empire's economy. Build the biggest ship that you can, or the most powerful ship in the galaxy, or the universe(you can play multiple galaxies)\n\n\nResourcesResources are two different things, the planets' resources in which you control the imports and exports, it will affect the level of the planets depending on the trade route that you create in your empire. Funnel all resources into one planet and that planet becomes a big powerhouse.\n\nand the Empire resources, you can't stockpile money now unlike other 4x games but you are given a budget cycle(which is 3 minutes long, comparable to one turn in 4x TBS games, you would think it's short, but you'll find that 3 mins is already a long time once you play this game). The budget cycle works great imo because it limits your spending and realistically approaches your empire spending. For example in GalCiv, once you have stockpiled a lot of credits you can just binge-buy every ship to completion and have an huge army in a few turns. You also generate overtime resources like, FTL as fuel for your ships. Energy, to power artifacts and devices. Research, to buy new techs. and Influence, to make diplomacy moves.\n\nDiplomacyDiplomacy is great because it is very different and more complex than other 4x games. It's not your typical, 'offer system', where you offer things and hope the AI accepts while sometimes the AI offers hoping that you accept.\n\nIt uses a 'card deck' system where cards can be acquired by the empires to advance their interests that costs influence points to activate, most cards you activate are presented to the Galactic Senate where other empires including you can impact(by activating more cards) if it will be accepted or not.  Some example of cards are 'Infiltrate', 'Protect System', 'Annex Planet', 'Host Senate Building'. It's like playing a trading card game. It needs more options though.\n\nTech TreeThe tech tree is awesome, most of the upgrades are scalar in which your ship's stats themselves get more powerful, and you don't need to replace the parts of ships every so often. although there are a lot of unlockable ship parts as well, but It's so balanced that you won't always resort into using that part you just unlocked. There's lots of pros and cons to each and every ship part and it's well balanced.\n\nDifferent ways to travel in space are also here. Stargates like the Xseries/Galciv games, Hyperdrive like star wars, Slipstream like Halo, or Fling Beacons like Mass Relays in Mass Effect. You can even go sublight and not use FTL tech. Ships don't have constant speed as well, they accelerate. They will go faster the longer the trip.\n\nUnit SystemFor me it's the best feature in the game. You only need to manage fleets, not single ships that you make individually and manually group into fleets. There are two types of ships. Flagships and support ships. You only need to make flagships, depending on the design, flagships can support a max number of support ships, and you don't need to create the support ship. The flagships will automatically 'order' support ships in order to fill the max number. Allows you to have an epic number of units around without having the usual unit cluster♥♥♥♥ associated with it.\n\nPerformance and bugsThe runs smooth on my rig even while playing huge maps and thousands of units that would otherwise run poorly if it were another game, it suffers some minor bugs though and the occasional crashing, but the game loads fast anyway that I didn't care if it crashed, I just clicked play on steam and I'm playing in no time, just be sure to save often and keep backups.\n\n8/10","January 1","true","79.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

First impressions though: I REALLY like the navigation/FTL system. There are no rigid "lanes" like in Sins, at least not for Terrans. The Galaxy is continuous and each race traverses it in their own unique way. I've only tried Terrakin so far, who use hyperdrive, but other races use gates. There may be more forms I haven't seen.\n\nGraphics are good enough, nothing to write home about. The ship battles are spectacles, though, compared to Sins. I also really really like the fleet system- capital ships form the backbone of fleets and automatically issue orders to their escort frigates and whatnot. You can have 60-120 small ships in formation and only worry about giving orders to the flagship unless you want to micro. They can also be set to auto-replenish with new recruits.\n\nI also like the colonization system, you pick the planet and your homeworld automatically sends convoys of colony ships instead of one unit like most games use. I'm barely scratched the surface of planet development and economics but from what I can tell it's pretty in depth.\n\nI'll probably have to post a more thorough review tomorrow when I have a better handle on the gameplay but my first impression is definitely very positive. Put simply it seems like it's a thinking person's Sins of a Solar Empire- besides having deeper 4X features basic things are also improved. For instance, you can actually do things while paused and the galaxy is more scientifically accurate and interesting to explore.\n\nI can't wait to play more, it feels fresh and promising and I predict sinking a good bit of time into it.","December 23, 2015","true","89.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The interconnectedness of all of your planets is super fun and maximizing the flow of resources to a single capital planet is really creative, believable, and adds a nice element of challenege to the game. Eventually, though, micromanaging your empire and scouring the map for water and food is a pain in the butt (but also very believable!).\n\nCombat in this game is really cool and the ship building system is very cool, though can be intimidating. The movement of units on the map is also really well done.\n\nThe Bad:\nI'd say the area this game is the weakest the abysmal tech tree (even after the update), and also the diplomacy. Honestly I didn't really care for the card system, but I give it up to the devs for doing something out of the box and unique from other similar titles.","February 1","true","10.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

That hope has dwindled and died over the development, and I can safely say that Star Ruler 2 is far less complex, interesting, and capable of holding attention than the first.\n\nProsMultiplayer has better netcode\nVisuals are somewhat improved\nSteam workshop\n\nConsThe race creation is far less in-depth and interesting\nGameplay feels stagnant and more like a series of checkboxes\nLess punishment for failures\nShip creation feels far more dead\nCombat is more RNG focused and less interesting\nAnd many, many more\n\nContinued...Where do I start? The first Star Ruler was extremely complex, and it could take hours to figure out just how everything worked, even with the tutorial attempting to help. It had immense depth, and mistakes in that game were punished quite hard. Didn't set up your economy well? You'd better untangle the mess quickly. Your ship design missing some critical component? Better learn fast.\n\nNow, the shipbuilding options have been incredibly narrowed down, and it feels as though there are only a few viable designs while anything interesting or outlandish other than bland boxes with guns and armor is impossible.\n\nThe research feels far less interesting and organic, having been spun out into a web that feels incredibly drawn-out. Varied resources have been replaced by an incredibly boring and arbitrary 'budget' system, along with planets that have thrown out the interesting conditions that SR1 had and replaced them with resourses that give fixed stat bonuses and are absolutely vital. Whereas in the first game, expansion carried risks and making a compressed, smaller empire was a perfectly viable option, in this the only 'option' is EXPANDEXPANDEXPAND, along with a supply mechanic that actively discourages you from making far-flung outposts in favor of grabbing every single planet in an arbitrary line between systems.\n\nNone of the zany stuff that I recall from SR1 is relevent. Planetary thrusters that can turn any planet into a mobile fortress /factory? That's right out, especially the factory part. Extensive asteroid mining that actually makes an impact? Nope, tossed right out in favor of a system that is barely worth it. Wierd frankenstien ships that reproduce and store more of themselves inside? Nopenopenope, replaced by a fleet and mantinence system that discourages innovation and interesting tactics in favor of 'make big ship with lots of little ships'. The FTL mechanic could have been nice in concept, but a lot of it just feels... Mechanical, boring. FTL travel is no longer something you have to work towards and that has consequences, like the Jump Drives of SR1. It's now bog-standard.\n\nThe battles are similarly boring. Long-gone are the massive conflicts with thousands of individually-moving ships, among them fighters, bombers, capital ships of all classifications, carriers, and so on. Now lots of little ships surrounded a big ship and trade fire with a big ship surrounded by little ships, with little-to-no manuvering or... Really, anything interesting. There are no superweapons, no purpose in anything interesting. Just bland, generic combat.\n\nAlso, there's no Galactic Armory. Gotta remember the important things, as well as the thing that made SR1 great.\n\nDiplomacy is slightly improved, although any change at all would be better than SR1's Diplomacy. Now it's all about spamming cards in useless actions to influence things in a tiny way. Horray!\n\nI could mention thousands of things, from destroying stars no longer being a valid options or an option, period, to the dull endgame where you can no longer make a ship the size of three solar systems and send it running towards the enemy. The music is bland compared to the previous game's epic score, and overall, I'd rate this game...\n\n3/10 - It made an attempt\nYou tried, publishers, but you tried to innovate too much.","May 22","false","46.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","1"

Now, I must say I am deeply disappointed with it.\n\nThe interface is the primary suspect here, and it is completely horrendous. It makes the UI of Distant Worlds look really clean and efficient. Blood, sweat and tears must be pumped into this game just to get your head around the UI. The game isn't overly complex, it's just really bad at feeding you essential information.\n\nEssential information like current research and completion of research, the display of upcoming budget changes which you have to actively hover the income symbol just to display a single line of code that is vital information and should be displayed constantly. Even ship management is a complete mess, with trying to figure out how to best select your ships and in quick fashion.\n\nThe management of planet system, at first, seems like a great idea, but ends up being a unnessary convoluted system of connect the dots and doing so in a way that makes sense for your productivity.\n\nDiplomacy was something that I was looking forward to, and sadly that also suffers with UI problems and also a mechanic that on the outset seems like a good idea, but really ends up being implemented very badly. You have these 'cards' that you can use for diplomatic options and these cards are pretty much random which leads to a inconsistent diplomatic system that makes no sense. Just gone to war with a civ on first contact but would like to know why, such as current relation stats? Well... good luck finding that out!\n\nI can say the only aspect that I liked about this game was the ship design which I absoloutely love, and would love to see more games use this design. While it lacks the cosmetic appeal of GalCiv3 ship design, it is superior in every way as it actually matters where you put your systems/sub-systems and layout of the ship. Everything has an impact. Having played Star Ruler 1, a game I must say with a far cleaner UI than what is presented here, I'm glad they've kept the design system but improved upon it greatly.\n\nWith that in mind, I can't recommend a game that struggles to tell the player about vital information they need for the running of their Empire. If you can get your head around the UI and put up with it's rather obtuse method of giving you information, then you'll likely enjoy the game, cause I feel Star Ruler 2 is trying to be a good game underneath the mess that is the UI and it's strange mechanics concerning diplomacy.\n\nOtherwise I'd recommend waiting for Stellaris.","March 3","false","3.0"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

This means you can't save up money for later use and really limits your building capabilities. I have no idea why the thought this will be a good thing...\n\n- Instead of mining metal, making electronics, goods, luxury stuff, every planet has a special exportable resource (ranging from food, water to rare materials) that it can export to 1! other planet (basically you just link the planets together).\nTo increas income, productivity and population you have to upgrade the planet by linking different resources to it from other planets, higher level requires higher level resources so this leads up to a long chain of planets. If you loose the necessary resource your planet gets downgraded. I think this was suppose to add some strategic depth (you have to protect the rare, high level resources if you want to have high level planets) but in truth it's a boring pain in the ♥♥♥.","January 19","false","5.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

There is no empire building as such - it is kept at kindergarden level, which is sad.\n2. There are still crashes from time to time, which is sad - but game is playable this time.\n3. Diplimacy seems to be a Pollock's painting - there is no logic to it, which ruins immersion slightly.\n4. There are not enough artistry in this game.

My favorite thing in this game so far is designing my own ships, it's extremely addictive to test out new designs in the sandbox!","May 25, 2015","true","85.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I recommend trying out both if you can -- the first is rougher around the edges, with more complicated mechanics and a more difficult learning curve, while this one is streamlined in intelligent ways. Although there are a few options that aren't on the table in SR2 as a result, SR2's still got plenty of scope for unique and interesting ship design and fleet combat, which is now based around a 'Command' flagship, of any design you like, and a support fleet of smaller ships, which is a wonderful way of simplifying the control of complex fleet combat.","June 2, 2015","true","17.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I love how you pillage resources from smaller planets to fuel (level up) the ones you care about.  It really makes your lv4 homeworld feel powerful when it's connected to ~15 subordinate planets.  It also gives importance to those outskirt planets.  Once they start going down it can really wreak havoc on your economy.\n\nI also really like how civilian infrastructure builds itself based on economy 'pressure' (which is derived from what elements you've got).  It really cuts through the majority of the bs micromanagement which is much appreciated!  The same system is used on 'defense pressure' which is an easy, and micro free, way to give your planets some defense.  In this way you are only ever controling a handful of fleets which keeps things elegantly manageable.\n\nThe last thing I'll touch on is the diplomacy system.  While 1-on-1 diplomacy is pretty rudimentary (a couple treaty options but that's about it), the galactic senate system is something I really enjoy.  You basically develop a resource called 'influence' which is used to buy and activate diplomacy cards.  They have a wide range of effects, some of which require a senate vote to pass.  It's all very well done and I get some real enjoyment out of dominating the senate.  You can annex planets and system this way, stealing them w/o going to war (or losing units).\n\nAll-in-all I think it's a very cleverly designed 4x game that does some new things.","June 2, 2015","true","70.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I could go on in detail about what makes it so awesome, but unfortunately I have more to say about, what I humbaly consider, design flaws.\nThe entire game falls apart due to the use of "scaling" mechanic. When you go to design a ship, you mst select the scale of it. There is no tool provided that gives you any indication of what scale would be appropriate at the current time. (I personally would like to see an exampele of how long it would take to build at highest production shipyard at the time, without having to go back-and-forth through multipule management screens with a calculator doing the math)\nWhy is this a problem? In every game I have played thus far, eventualy the AI, with its perfect mathamatic abilities, does know exactly what scale it should use. Eventualy this gets to be very big. (I.E. capital ships scale value of 700 to my 200) This desparity is far greater advantage than even several tech levels of ship equipment. In short, The combat mechanics reduce from potentially balanced, to a game of who has the bigest multiplier.\nSecond, the Tech Tree feels incomplete, or hurried. It seems like the start of a potentially good system, but just falls apart due to lack of attention and polish. There's proabbaly a little mor eroom for content as well; currently I count a total of 3 (4?) new weapons techs in the entire game. This is a far cray from the menagire of techs we're used to in 4x games like this.\nOther than those 2 points, it's a very good 4x game, and there is so much potential. Its still fun to play over-all, so I give it a thumbs up, but only by a hair.

Until you get to the point that you have all of the concepts working together, you do not see the strengths they provide each other.  Once you see how everyone works together, and learn to try to take advantages of the different systems, I think this game has more depth and more replayability than SR1.

What a change to the genre norm.\n\nGreat refresh on the 4X them.  The Diplomacy system is the best I have seen in any game and the Ship building experience is on the right track (a few quality of life changes away from being epic).  The planet management, both micro (city development) and macro (planet resource graph), is held back by its UI.  Once war hits, it is also hard to figure out what broke and most of my games end with being too lazy to figure out how to fix my network of resources so I live with a negative budget and try to end the game with whatever fleet I have.\n\nI enjoy the early game so much that I don't mind that the end game is made unmanagable because of the UI.  I hope the next version puts its focus on improving the UI and adding more auto-management tools *while* sticking with their current machanincs (city development being the exception that could use a redesign).\n\n\n\n","June 21, 2015","true","71.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are passable, but the UI lacks a lot of relevant information and the alerts for important events are far too easy to notice. I found myself losing fights that should have been easy only to later find that the enemy had multiple fleets stacked, but I couldn't tell that from how the game presented the information to me. At other times, I've had fleets seemingly unwilling to build support ships, which led to further losses.

This game isn't complex in any way, it's just really repetitive. I'd rather spend my time building a pyramid of empy coca-cola cans than building a pyramid with worlds.\nIt doesn't even give the possibility to go for different strategies, just the same old pyramid structure.\n\nThe graphics of the game is totally satisfying, I have nothing to complain about the soundtrack or sound effects. Even the story and the setting is somewhat nice. What I really have to complain about is just simply the question of complexity.\nIn basicly all other 4x games you have the option to go for different strategies, like trade, influence, technology, warfare etc. Thus making it possible to opt for a somewhat slower territorial expansion while researching or getting you economy going.\nIn this game you simply cannot achieve much research or economy without expanding, thus making the colonization of new planets manditory. This is because a planet cannot progress without having new planets to support it, which leads back to the pyramid concept.

I won't make this review too long so I will just list the biggest pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n\n-Large scale with lots of units.\n-You can design your own ships.\n-Interesting diplomacy system.\n\nCons:\n\n-Extremely bland and soulless which means there is zero immersion in the game.\n-Economic system is rather tedious.\n-Combat while cool to watch is mostly devoid of strategy and thus dull (it's one of those games where the army with the highest numbers and stats just wins by default).\n-Tech tree is a total mess that is impossible to understand.\n-Menus are mediocre.\n\nOverall this game just doesn't do it for me. I think I will rather just wait for Stardrive 2 which will come out in about a weeks time.\n\n","April 3, 2015","false","16.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","3"

The tutorial is ok but a hell uva lot of reading needs done before really understanding this game.  I played homeworld alot and really enjoyed that and was looking for a more recent space rts.  Star Ruler is a strange one .. it tries to be a political space trading game with battles but in all honesty its more of a space battles game with politics and a bit of trading.  Trading at this point is between your own planets and when I say between I mean one way .. so you colonize a planet then need to find a resource to upgrade it so you go to anothe rplanet and import that resource and so on and so fourth.  I assume in multiplayer it gets more interesting as you fight over a planet with that resource.. the issue is the logistical management of it all.  You need a pen and paper to track a single planatery upgrade .. i.e  planet is 0 level it needs two resources to upgrade to level 1.. one of those resources is on a level 0 planet which also needs to level to 1 which needs two resources to upgrade.. and so on it goes... for me not particularly fun.   Building space craft could be interesting but their research matrix is so confused your not quite clear what direction your going in.. again pen and paper handy to map your research table .. again reading needs done (which I have not done admittedly).. perhaps I just dont have the patience I used to.. lastly the politcal side of the game could be quite interesting in Multiplayer with the ability to buy specific political cards to play and then bid on whether the rule is enforced.  In single player I have kinda just ignored it.","March 31, 2015","false","17.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

Replayable many times with ma ny difficulties, and races that have inherently different mechanics.  Reasonable learning curve, and a sense of scale unattainable in any other space game I have played!\n\nTWO THUMBS UP!\n\nSome of the badassness of this game:\n- It is actually easy to put together a fleet of 1000 ships, 5 different ship types each with individual behavior (bomber, shield the mothership, anti-capital, anti-fighter). You can make a 1000 ship fleet with, lets see.... 13 clicks. and DONE!\n- Its actualy easy to fight with your 1000 ship fleet - since the individual ships have their own behavior you dont need to micromanage them. This game is delicious strategy without bogging down in pew pew tactics.\n- you can build PLANETARY THRUSTERS and fly your planet around!  WIth missles on it!  You can basically make your own death star!!\n- you can build a RINGWORLD! It looks beautiful too.\n- you can do all this with just some experimentation with the game.

I had been looking for a good 4x game with a modern spin, but the current batch of popular 4x games just re-hash the same old mechanics that have been around since the dawn of 4x; the constant min-maxing, end-turn clicking, and save/reload experience that, to me, turn 4x games into something other than a game. They lose any kind of action feel and quickly the ADD kicks in; I'm moving on to something else.\n\nAlong comes Star Ruler 2, a 4x game in a sense, but more, with an additional RTS element allowing you to fully control time. It sounds novel and has probably been done in some other game(s) I'm not aware of. But it is expertly done in this game, to the point that I would like to tip my hat to the developers with a rare post of admiration. Truly, the thought put into the overall design is pretty genius. From the endless setup options, fully 3D galaxies, orbiting planets, ship designer and sandbox tester, the built in community page and IRC, tab UI functions, to the very awesome, imo, space battles. And even better, it all seems to be coded well; I have yet to experience any issues.\n\nIn the end it appears this game was put together by gamers and lovers of 4x, RTS, and space sims; they melded those genres very well into the fabric of this game.\n\nADD will not affect this one for quite some time...lol.","May 9, 2015","true","409.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There are choices, but they are illusionary don't work. Between Door A, Door B and Door C, only Door A is valid, weapon A is useful.\n\nGameplay: Like Star Ruler 1, economy stalls very easily and it becomes impossible to catch up. The game devs don't know where they're headed, or what they want to add but want to release in 2-3 months. They don't have good vision and perspective on where they're going and what they're going to do, but somehow expect to release. this fall/winter 2014. That does not raise confidence with incomplete game development.\n\nSingle Player: The enemy AI is currently about as effective as stock cartoon villains. They will research only additional ship hp / armor technology (metallurgy), and as the game progresses the player will greatly outstrip the enemy ships both in scale, life and damage. In short, they cannot hurt you and only annoy at best.\n\nIn short, don't buy this game. At the very least, wait until this game gets on sale a six months to a year after release for more reviews and patches.","September 15, 2014","false","566.3"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","7","17","2","0"

What was the point of the ship-designer if you're going to rub the "logistics" of your Empire into the player's face constantly?\n\nHere's the TL;DR pros/cons:\n\nPros\nDiplomacy System is a fresh take on the concept in RTS games.\nShip design system is robust\nCombat is nice to watch\n\nCons\nFeels like it emphasizes the economic side of things far too much\nFeels a bit too clicky for a game that's supposed to be 4X, for me anyway.\n\nLike I said before, the economy system is a big hassle for me to work with, and it's not my thing at all. Let's say you wanna upgrade this planet to Level 2? You're gonna need to get several other level 1 planets supplied with the things they need, and then have them export their goods to your targeted system in order to get it to level 2.\n\nNow imagine this workload increasing almost exponentially with each level up to level 4. As a level 3 planet, you've already got a fistful of Level 1 and level 2 systems connected to it, but it's already asking for even MORE level 1 and level 2 systems before it can get upgraded to level 4. You're looking at over 15 direct connected planets to your level 4 planet, and that's not counting their subordinate feeder planets.\n\nAfter a couple of hours of trying to get a hang of this, my wrist is already hurting from all the clicking. NOT FUN.\n\nI bought and enjoyed the first Star Ruler because it took a more simplistic approach to the economy system, and gave me control over what kind of resource exports I wanted to produce. Star Ruler 2 completely takes that out of your hands, and instead demands that you set up a logistical network to feed your empire's needs. All of the planets are randomized in what they can produce, but you can't change what they produce at all.\n\nThe result? Your empire is a lot, LOT more vulnerable to having its supply lines cut. While that's certainly nice, I'm a player that likes to be able to control the circumstances of his Empire, and that means consolidating key, valuable production facilities within pockets of my Empire that can be protected. Star Ruler 2 does not allow for this.\n\nThis is a 4X game, and it puts a bigger emphasis on the economic side of things. While a nice change from the average space RTS, I feel that they could have done a better job with the design. The way it is now, it creates that perception that it involves a bit more management than it should require.\n\nIt sucks that the Star Ruler series is almost practically the ONLY series with the ability for you to custom-design your ships' capabilities. Now, if it were Sins of a Solar Empire with your own ship-designer element to it, I would be loving it to pieces.","December 28, 2014","false","3.1"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","4"

Im unsure about the whole politics. I'm voting on things with other races that havent been found yet.\n\nSR1 had a much better planet system this one is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. Gone are all the resorces you used to produce, like labour, goods, food, minerals, electronics and exotic goods. SR2 has nothing you produce other then labour/research. Each planet has only 1 resorce. So you could have a planet like earth rich in water, but it has food as its resorce. In order to level up a planet you need to have x resorces. You can make food and water from a building but can't export it. So gone are the days of having a farming rich planet exporting to a overpopulated planet.\n\nThe research system to me seems to be a step backward. I liked the old system where you can research the same thing mulitple times and at sertan levels it unlocks stuff, with some items being only unlocked when 2~4 different technoilgies rearch level X, Y and Z. The new system is hex based like the older one but a large map, but you only research a hex once before unlocking the abridging technoliges. So you could research say computer 2 before computer 1 because how the hex map is made.","March 30, 2015","false","2.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Has great potential but is excessively unpolished and has no story-telling or narrative. Planet management is unique, but not engaging. Mostly this game is about combat, which is not unique or engaging except in the fact that you may employ really really large fleets. This is inconsequential because 99% of the time your huge fleet will be acting as a single unit. Battle is not very tactical, point at the enemy fleet and wait. Are you winning? Continue to wait. Are you loosing? Run away.  Maybe there is more if you play an epically large galaxy, but after completing 3 very small galaxies nothing opened up that improved combat tactics, except for having more fleets to manage... yaaay.\n\nThe controls can be difficult and unwieldy, especially if you are trying to get cool views of ships and battle. It can be difficult to zoom in and out on ships that are above or below the default altitude.\n\nUnique diplomacy feature seems awesome at first until you realize it's simply a matter of playing higher cards than your opponent's, and then it plays out like a game of war. For this diplomacy feature there is a peculiar lack of any dialogue. No taunts, threats, nothing, just play influence cards silently and watch the meter.\n\nThere are some nasty glitches that will mess with your tactics and possibly tilt the outcome of your game.\n\nAnyhow, I could go on and on, but basically I have too many better games to play. This game is delivered with very little fanfare or flash and because of this and a few other reasons I don't think it competes very well with other games in the genre.

It's fun for a bit but it's very formulaic.  Ever empire is pretty much the same and the game goal is expand as quickly as possible, biggest empire wins.  The planets are managed in a cool way but after a certain small size, the system breaks down and just becomes annoying.  Not a grand 4x strategy game.  But if you're lookingn for something to play for a few nights, this will do the trick.  You'll quickly figure out the sequence you need to do to win.  No real strategy in it, more hack and slash.  Oh and no instructions what so ever.","April 23","false","44.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I would like to see more ship designs added they dont have many models as well as the upgrade chart change it doesn't do the game justice.

Diplomacy is done via the usage of cards. Furthermore planet building has stopped following the MOO formula and now depends on finding the right planets and linking their trade routes to other planets. What type of empire you make is then up to you. Do you want a large planet whose massive population and large production capabilities spell out "all trade routes link to [insert your homeworld name here]". Where mighty ships are build and fleets are launched from. Perhaps you want a more balanced galaxy, with strategic planets of a certain population placed around?It's all up to you.\n\nIn addition, the fleet system is quite interesting as now the core of the fleet is the largest ship. Supports are there to support the larger ship,so having a well varied fleet is quite important. Even if having fleets is not to your liking and you prefer just having larger powerful capital ships, then do so. Ship building is as important as ever, with great control over where you wish to place certain weapons and defenses at.\n\nIn game there are a few major races to choose from, or you can create your own. What's most striking is that all the races have different propulsion technologies, some use hyperspace while others use gates. Then even others tear a fabric in space time to create a slipstream tear to travel through instantly to their location. Each race also plays differently, some living in space,others connected to a central computer that ups their combat abilities. Won't spoil anymore though, play the game to see even more.\n\nMod support is a 'click and subscribe' experience, and a menu pops up at the start asking you whether  you wish to activate them. There are already mods out there where you can control Asgard fleets from the Stargate series,and even custom player made models. Lots of tweaks to gameplay as well. It really is thriving, and quite well documented.\n\n\nMultiplayer , now this game is very multiplayer friendly. with more than 12/18 players being able to play within one universe.\n\n\nGraphically, the game is very pretty to look at. Zooming into the sun you can see those shaders at work. You can create pretty amazing screenshots with this game. Even with all the action on screens-thousands of ships firing at eachother, the performance remains stable and top notch.\n\nDev-community relations: devs are pretty open to all questions you ask them, they lurk the forum day and night and are always online at the irc channel. So yes, they are pretty cool.\n\nLastly, it has gnu/linux support which is an OS pretty starved for 4x games. So thanks for supporting it devs!\n\nThe Bad:\nResearch could be improved, by making it even larger. I'm not really a big fan of being able to see where your current research might lead. It also would be nice to see an event system in the game, to add to the lore and allow perhaps players to create interesting  campaigns.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGreat game,doesn't follow the staple 4x formula we have been used to, it brings something fresh and new to the table.\n\nAlso has gnu/linux support,so that's a plus. It's a very fun game so far.Not to mention that it certainly has lots, and lots of potential, and it would be nice to see more expansions coming out!\n\n\n\n","April 16, 2015","true","82.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a fairly steep learning curve due to how different the game's mechanics are from those of a typical 4x; I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits before I got any good. Once you get the hang of it, though, it's a lot of fun. Ship design and combat are complex but rewarding. Your empires' economy requires little intervention once you've got things up and running. The diplomacy system is novel and interesting. Again and again, I find that the systems in this game require some work to master, but are simple and easy to use once you have.\n\nI have a couple of minor gripes.

Diplomacy is done via the usage of cards. Furthermore planet building has stopped following the MOO formula and now depends on finding the right planets and linking their trade routes to other planets. What type of empire you make is then up to you. Do you want a large planet whose massive population and large production capabilities spell out "all trade routes link to [insert your homeworld name here]". Where mighty ships are build and fleets are launched from. Perhaps you want a more balanced galaxy, with strategic planets of a certain population placed around?It's all up to you.\n\nIn addition, the fleet system is quite interesting as now the core of the fleet is the largest ship. Supports are there to support the larger ship,so having a well varied fleet is quite important. Even if having fleets is not to your liking and you prefer just having larger powerful capital ships, then do so. Ship building is as important as ever, with great control over where you wish to place certain weapons and defenses at.\n\nIn game there are a few major races to choose from, or you can create your own. What's most striking is that all the races have different propulsion technologies, some use hyperspace while others use gates. Then even others tear a fabric in space time to create a slipstream tear to travel through instantly to their location. Each race also plays differently, some living in space,others connected to a central computer that ups their combat abilities. Won't spoil anymore though, play the game to see even more.\n\nMod support is a 'click and subscribe' experience, and a menu pops up at the start asking you whether  you wish to activate them. There are already mods out there where you can control Asgard fleets from the Stargate series,and even custom player made models. Lots of tweaks to gameplay as well. It really is thriving, and quite well documented.\n\n\nMultiplayer , now this game is very multiplayer friendly. with more than 12/18 players being able to play within one universe.\n\n\nGraphically, the game is very pretty to look at. Zooming into the sun you can see those shaders at work. You can create pretty amazing screenshots with this game. Even with all the action on screens-thousands of ships firing at eachother, the performance remains stable and top notch.\n\nDev-community relations: devs are pretty open to all questions you ask them, they lurk the forum day and night and are always online at the irc channel. So yes, they are pretty cool.\n\nLastly, it has gnu/linux support which is an OS pretty starved for 4x games. So thanks for supporting it devs!\n\nThe Bad:\nResearch could be improved, by making it even larger. I'm not really a big fan of being able to see where your current research might lead. It also would be nice to see an event system in the game, to add to the lore and allow perhaps players to create interesting  campaigns.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGreat game,doesn't follow the staple 4x formula we have been used to, it brings something fresh and new to the table.\n\nAlso has gnu/linux support,so that's a plus. It's a very fun game so far.Not to mention that it certainly has lots, and lots of potential, and it would be nice to see more expansions coming out!\n\n\n\n","April 16, 2015","true","82.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like sci-fi empire building games this is one you will enjoy. So of this review will be things that I think the game needs and other complaints that is because the game is early access. First with the things I liked.\n\nThe galactic senate is an excellent addition to the game. It adds the ability to have tons of different options and effect. A creative change from just the simple allience and war options.\n\nI like the fleet setup, which works around a flag ship that does not force me to command each unit individually. Creating your own ships has kind of lost some charm for me now that it is becomming more common, but I still welcome the feature.\n\nThe colonial developement system is cleaver. In a way it reminds me of the anno games but a bit simplified. In order to level up a planet you need to import specific resources. Depending on the variety of resources depends on what the consumers produce. But because a resource cannot be used on the same planet that exports it you will develope major centers. This helps differentiate one territory from another, something many games lack.\n\nNow for the things I need to see changed:\n\nI need a way to tell which empire is which. The empires are identified on the map with colors and that is it. In a game with more than just 3 or 4 players this becomes very confusing very fast. There are not enough colors or portraits to identify all the players. I need names to display on the planets when I hold over them and and maybe large names over the empires when I zoom out.\n\nI have never seen the AI accept a trade agreement or allience or anything. The game lets you give treaties fancy names, but gives you next to no options with them. The do have a vassal status, which I see more and more. But like games such as space empires V or europa universalis I want some neat terms. Creating neutral zone, creating new states and trade tarriffs, and long term payments.  While I do not see it happening I always like it when games differentiate between occupations and integrations. I just am happy in a game where there are other resolution to war other than the endless conflict untill one empire completely conquors the other.\n\nIn the senate I'd like to see more options that could be tacked onto a vote. You have the rider, but I like to see some larger item that could be tacted on like the annex planet. It should be exspensive but interesting. I'd also like to see the option to force a player to release a system to be a new player. The new player of course would be their vassal. I also like an option to push for a vassal to become independent.\n\nI would like to establish more uniqueness between the various player. This could be in the form of more race trait or in the form of different technological paths. The players just do not feel different enough to me.\n\nI know this game is early access, so I should comment on bugs. Occasion I have more influence than my maximum, but I've encountered almost no bugginess. Although the AI may do all kind of weirdness I do not know about.","January 23, 2015","true","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

One main ship with support ships attatched to them make up a fleet which means less microing the smaller ships and more seeing them blow each other up. Diplomacy is based on cards/influence. You use influence to play/use/obtain cards and pretty much to actually influence things while the crads have effects like push a galatic goal you want such an economic HQ for the known races on your HW and such.

Well, in short, it’s not “yet another bad Masters of Orion clone”, It’s not “Civilization IN SPACE!” and it's not Sword of the Stars 2.\n\nWhat this game is, and I really stress this, is unique. While I have had a hard time getting into it (a fault of my own as you can’t simply zone out and play this like any other space 4x), it’s by far the most refreshing take on the genre yet. To go into great depth about why it's unique would make for a very long review but to have a few examples:\n\n* You can rebuild ancient wrecks and turn the war around, as if you were playing a space RPG from the perspective of the ragtag empire suddenly getting the heroic lead character’s assistance with the Ancient Relic Warship of Destruction.\n\n* And following on with that thought, said warship can then be used to blow up the supermassive black hole at the heart of a galaxy, obliterating the galactic core. Rival empire spiraling out of control? Not anymore.\n\n* You can spend political capital to rename your flagship. This inspires your people. Yes, renaming your flagship to “LongflongActual.” is inspiring.\n\n* You can convince the galactic council that a planet inside a rival empire should belong to you, and they will vote and agree on it, even as the rival in question desperately tries to stop it going through.\n\n* Someone put a bill into the galactic council encouraging research? The highest voter gets an extra bonus ontop of it. Watch as all the players race to be the most supportive of a bill that already helps them because only one can be at the top.\n\nAll this, and more, because the core product has modding support and steam workshop integration. These are both great for the longevity of Star Ruler 2, and I'm certain this expansion will be the same.\n\nNow, you might be asking, what’s bad about Star Ruler 2? By being unique you will need to learn, and it can be a steep climb at that. You will need to be patient and want to explore something new but the wonderful dev’s behind this game have extensive tooltips and help to smooth that over. Can’t get the help you need or find it not enough? There is even an ingame IRC client you can connect to with no fuss from within game and ask.\n\nGet Star Ruler 2, and while it might date this review to say this, get it even with Stellaris on the horizon if you are comparing the two. This is A Good Game right now. A pleasant, solid reimagining of a genre filled with the wrecks and broken remains of so many alternatives.\n\nAnd it really never gets old to turn galactic politics into a wonderful game of “who’s bill do I ruin next?”","April 15, 2015","true","37.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
