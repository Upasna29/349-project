I am undecided if I would recomed this game at this time but I will definately check back soon.","May 18","true","0.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

There are hardly any options for setup and I believe the price is to high even with the 20% discount but other than that it works well.  It looks good but not great I get a constant 60 fps with an amd 7870 it looks kinda washed like most unity games. The combat is fun the mechanics are great. I wish other space shooters worked like this, I believe thats why I like it so much. Nothing complicated like alot of the use the whole dam keyboard space games.     .EDIT: While I enjoyed it up to a certain point after getting to A certain point the game now suffers from massive frame drops and Im playing it on 2 pc's so with no cloud saving I had to do it all twice just to see if it was my setup or their problem..It's their problem..later in the game as difficulty amps up many ships  start to come into play during combat and this game just tanks..I have tried to reach out to them and have received no answer.\n\nA 15.9 mb patch was put out with 0 patch notes ..After asking what it was my answer from im guessing a dev was something at the end of the game...wtf  thats it???It's a shame as I was enjoying the simple but very entertaining game (to me anyway) But having ample time to answer a simple question about game breaking bugs and no attempt to either fix it or communicate I can't reccomend this game...it's a shame","May 18","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
