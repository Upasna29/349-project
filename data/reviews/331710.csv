One of the most amazing things about this game is that I'm at Level 49/50 on Practice Mode with around 2794 deaths. Why on practice mode you may ask? Well if I wasn't I'd probably have 10000-100000 deaths, because everytime you die in the other modes you get sent back to Level 1 and there's some ridiculous level design in this game and you will always be fighting the controls. The graphics are awful maybe just barely hitting the PSX mark and with bare bones textures at that. Nothing in this game looks visually appealing in anyway shape or form and it's using a barebones Unity Engine that doesn't even work properly. I literally think with all this it's pretty much impossible to beat the game on anything other than Practice Mode. For anyone curious where I gave up or why I gave up  here you go:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87l9Eisr5t4","December 17, 2014","false","28.4"," 169 of 185 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","169","185","23","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ironleonem/recommended/331710/","ironleonem","Iron Leonem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ironleonem/","308 products in account","Why We Can't Have Nice Things, or Tragedy of the Commons: Steam Edition\n\nWhen Why So Evil was on Steam Greenlight, I voiced my concerns politely, but clearly. The developers did little to assuage my concerns, but I am nothing if not forgiving, so I decided to pick this title up and give it a fair shake. This game goes to show exactly what purpose Steam Greenlight served, because now that the gate has been torn asunder and the guardian slain, all manner of hellspawn issueth. And I don't mean in a good way.\n\nThis game has a 3D take on the Super Meat Boy style of challenge: unforgiving difficulty with unrelenting learning curve. I ended my first playthrough at Level 9, and I feel like, even in my short time with the game, I got a fair feel for how I'm going to like it long term.\n\nFirst, the good: The designers show a good head for iteration. Each level (from 1 to 9 admittedly) showed decent improvement challenge-wise from the last. The game was, indeed, challenging, but with a game like this, being unable to beat it is not a fair argument for it being TOO challenging. For now, I will say that I got to level 9, and that level was too frustrating for me to beat at this time.\n\nNow, the bad. The user interface on this game is bare bones, to say the least. Think "Air Control", but slightly better organized. There is no title screen, no introduction, just gameplay. While I can appreciate a minimalist approach to fluff before gameplay, one should seek to emulate Super Crate Box, not SkiFree. The physics in the game are very easily identifiable as Unity's base physics engine, with little safeguards applied to ensure regulation of movement. To be clear, I'm not complaining that the game is hard, I'm complaining that the controls are sloppy.\n\nNow, we move on to the "Ugly". There's a "2P" button which doesn't actually function or do anything, though I don't know if I'd be willing to subject a friend to this experience anyway. The assets in this game seem thrown together, and prebought. I would have appreciated primary colors and shading more than neon floors in a winter background.\n\nNow, let's talk about "no saving, no check points." When I asked the developers about this design decision, they told me they had decided it would make the game harder. This is, ladies and gentlemen, an example of "artificial difficulty". Level design done properly is "real difficulty". Making a player lose all of their progress for a small misstep is just frustrating. A game should be fun to play, even if it's hard or challenging. Now, some people enjoy the concept of hard core, permadeath style gameplay, and I can appreciate that. That's why you add a MODE for no check points and no saving, not make it central to the game. Hell, give people a special achievement for finishing in one go!\n\nMy real quandry with this game is I actually want to like it. The level designs I actually experienced seemed pretty interesting, but the thought of starting over at level one again didn't so much as frustrate me as it bored me.\n\nUltimately, whether or not I will recommend a game comes down to one question. If the developers offered me a refund and I never got to play the game again, would I take the refund? With this game, I would say "Absolutely." Take your $5.00 (Or 2.50 if it's still on sale) to greener pastures. Hopefully the devs will come to their senses and patch this game, and should they do so, I would be happy to revise my review.\n","November 15, 2014","false","2.0"," 124 of 139 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","124","139","4","7"

This makes movement extremely luck based, due to your edges causing you to ricochet in random directions. You basically have two control schemes, one for if your corner is facing the way you intend to move, and the other for your face. If you are moving with your face first, you will roll your box, which causes a ton of rng for exactly where you will go. If you move with your corner first, you kinda just slide in that general direction.\n\nThere are also plenty of bugs and bad texture mapping randomly throughout, though you probably will quit before encountering too many. The most noticeable bug is the fact you can climb up over some walls or moving objects if you hit it just right, which happens more often than not. Alas, other moving enemies can also utilize this (e.g. a "chaser" type of enemy climbing over locked doors before you even open them).\n\nEarnestly, this feels like someone's first attempt at a game, and decided to try to actually sell it. That is considered a huge taboo in the design world, it is always said "Create and trash a few projects before you start on a real one, it will come out a lot more polished.","February 21, 2015","false","3.0"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","45","49","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/331710/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Very often I’ve asked myself why I have such an addiction to “rage” games. I suppose because being challenged to a point of frustration by a video game leads to a greater sense of accomplishment when you are finally able to conquer it. It’s also what attracts me to rogue-likes. When it’s always do or die, you need to be in top form in order to even get close to the finish. Why So Evil? wants to be both of these, but ends up coming close to neither. The game opens to a startup launcher that allows you to pick your resolution/graphics, a “windowed” checkbox, and a controls tab. The launcher is my favorite part of this game. Almost nothing in the game feels as well made as the launcher. I could end the review there, but my masochism won’t let me, so let’s look at this game a bit more in-depth, and ask ourselves the question, Why So Awful?\n\nThe game is launched without a menu. No tutorial, no further options, just a room with a green cube, a blue cube, a bouncing red cube, and a horrible-looking default Unity UI. Now, I understand the difference between a AAA title and something from an indie studio… But to leave the default buttons and text on a UI that can’t be turned off? Pure laziness. Anyways, WASD appears on the screen, and you will find that you are the green cube. If you are intuitive, you will avoid the red cube and head towards the blue. If you’re curious you will test the red one. This sends you back to stage one. Which you were already on. Okay, no harm, no foul. We now know that red cubes can kill us. So you roll past the red cube, everything lights on “fire”… (Which, for a game that touts its realistic weather effects, look exceptionally unfinished) and in that horrible default text it asks “Are You Ready For Hell?” Whereupon touching the blue cube, you will be forced to complete the first stage for a third time. Leading me to believe that the blue cube isn’t my friend at all. Everything in this game seems to kill me, lets be smart, shut it off, 3evil5me. Am I ready for hell? Probably. But that still didn’t prepare me for this game.\n\nThe first few stages aren’t really hard, the hardest thing about them being getting used to the wonky physics of this game. Sometimes moving left or right will cause you to roll, but it usually doesn’t… This leads to a game that feels clunky and cumbersome instead of the death-defying action game it advertises itself as. Around level five or six, the game will start punishing you for making it to new levels. You’re placed in a big blank level, with the exit nowhere in sight, and suddenly platforms start flying every which way to knock you off the edge… If it were a well made game, you might be able to roll toward the edge of the platform and save yourself. Instead, you’ll usually end up stuck inside of it and swept off the edge. Then you get to go back to level one again, and play through 20 stages, all so you can get a few more seconds learning which way the platforms come from on that last stage you died at. Are we having fun yet? Yaaawn. This is simply a glorified memorization game, and I understand it calls itself evil, but I think the most evil thing about this game is its lack of effort.\n\nEven if you can undergo the kind of repetition that Why So Evil? will force upon you, you will inevitably ask yourself “Why?” There is no sense of progression… There’s no sense of enjoyment. There’s no sense of accomplishment. The only thing this game was able to deliver was artificial difficulty, and monotony. I think I gave this game a fair shake. Its not as if I dislike this sort of game, I raved to my friends about EDGE. But this lacks any of the inspiration EDGE had. It physically pained me to see that they thought this game was good enough to not require any updating (as stated on their store page), because in order for this game to be worth any amount of money it will require quite an overhaul. It isn’t all doom and gloom though, some of the weather effects are done quite well… Well, the rain looks good at least. The soundtrack might also be enjoyable for some people too, if you enjoy techno or house. Also on a positive note, most things about the game are passable, and the level designs that aren’t unfair can sometimes be quite clever, but to me it isn’t worth the pain because there is no reward except for more pain. If you need to fulfill some masochistic tendencies, pick this game up… Otherwise, buggy physics and unfair level design will drive you off the deep end.\n\nSummary: A neverending masochistic “adventure” that tests the limits of human endurance.\n\nFinal Score: 4/10 for weather and soundtrack. Could be brought up to 8/10 with major physics/level design overhauls.","November 16, 2014","false","1.7"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","44","56","2","0"

They made it very easy for mediocre people to do mediocre things, and the people at Valve gave them an outlet to thrust mediocre things to millions of people who frankly deserve better.\n\nIn this case, "Why So Evil" is a very poor puzzler/timed obstacle game with really terrible highschool student graphics and an even less imaginative premise.   Roll the green cube to the cyan cube, watch out for all the things that kill you or push you off the edge of the map.  If you do die, the worst possible thing imaginable happens - you have to play a level of "Why So Evil".   Thankfully the developers added a very welcome feature to the game - the option to quit.\n\nThis is a bad puzzler.   The people at Unity probably had no idea their tools would be used to create such pollution.

Rolling a cube adds a large factor of luck, which should not dominate a game of skill.  There is one level you have to move in a straight line across the board, the path is fairly wide.  If you hold down one direction you will not make it more than half way without falling off, it bounces around so much.  It also feels like they throw cheap shots in.  They will design a board that has effects or decorations block the veiw of the board.  Also in larger boards the frame of view makes it difficult to see what you are doing.  If they were to make the cube into a sphere, and add  the ability to change camera angles this game would be a lot better.  45/50 level complete, around 650 lives.","June 12, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Instead the developers decided for these levels to just push you off so the second time you play that level you just move out of the way and wait for the push to miss then carry on. It's incredible lazy design wih nothing interesting about it.\n\nI forgot to add how clunky trying to roll a cube around feels, you could argue this is part of the difficulty if you wanted, or just that sometimes you feel the cube isnt really in your control and its not your fault. It's also a cheap way to make the game seem harder.","June 12, 2015","false","41.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anderberserk/recommended/331710/","anderberserk","Lincoln","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anderberserk/","39 products in account","The game has two problems: the control and physics.\nControl: The cube which you try to control not move (ok, move just a little) when you push the button. You have to hold a little to get it to move. You do not feel like you're controlling the cube, and this hinders when you're trying to dodge some obstacles, mainly because of ...\nPhysics: Sometimes the cube rolls, sometimes it slides. I didn't understand why, but apparently has to do with the cube angle in relation to the direction you want to go. This apparent randomness brings a bit of confusion when trying to guide the cube for areas where there is little room for him to pass. And the cube gains momentum easily, looks like you're trying to control it on ice.\nIn short, I do not recommend this game.

Instead the developers decided for these levels to just push you off so the second time you play that level you just move out of the way and wait for the push to miss then carry on. It's incredible lazy design wih nothing interesting about it.\n\nI forgot to add how clunky trying to roll a cube around feels, you could argue this is part of the difficulty if you wanted, or just that sometimes you feel the cube isnt really in your control and its not your fault. It's also a cheap way to make the game seem harder.","June 12, 2015","false","41.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anderberserk/recommended/331710/","anderberserk","Lincoln","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anderberserk/","39 products in account","The game has two problems: the control and physics.\nControl: The cube which you try to control not move (ok, move just a little) when you push the button. You have to hold a little to get it to move. You do not feel like you're controlling the cube, and this hinders when you're trying to dodge some obstacles, mainly because of ...\nPhysics: Sometimes the cube rolls, sometimes it slides. I didn't understand why, but apparently has to do with the cube angle in relation to the direction you want to go. This apparent randomness brings a bit of confusion when trying to guide the cube for areas where there is little room for him to pass. And the cube gains momentum easily, looks like you're trying to control it on ice.\nIn short, I do not recommend this game.

The menu can definitely use some love, as it's literally buttons, standing there, but let's face it, it's all about the gameplay. And boy does this game live up to it's name! You will die, A LOT, but it feels so good when you complete a level ;)\nThe game has 3 difficulty settings - "normal" should actually be called HELL, as that is the hardest setting available. I still haven't found what exactly is the difference between normal and noob settings, but trust me as I tell you, that you will be playing on practice mode - the lowest settings, at least in the foreseeable feature :p Practice mode is the only one that gives you unlimited tries to complete a level, and just silently tracks the times you've failed ... you know , just fyi ;p\nThe goal of the game is to move your cube /dice around the map / level until you hit / touch the blue one. You have to dodge wooden planks, that try to push you off the map, red cubes that incinerate you on touch, yellow cubes, that follow in your tracks, rotating planks that demolish you on collision, weather and well placed obstacles will obscure your vision - and this has been my experience up to level 25, can only imagine what comes the last 25 levels :p\nSo yea ... if you don't like a challenge, this game is definitely not for you. You are literally moving a cube around - and that movement is realistic - so not in a straight line. You have to learn to maneuver your dice like a pro - knowing when to roll and when to drag. Patience is required, but it really feels good when you complete a level!\nThe game has local multiplayer and when one of the player dies, the game is over - so that can be fun :p\nEven with the current state of the menu ( and that can easily be updated in the future), I think the game is worth it, especially now, when's on sale 50% off.\n\nTL:DR or wanna see me fail in the first 25 levels - check my overview video :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340107101","November 10, 2014","true","3.7"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

It is very hard to move diagonally and when you do it is hard to stabilise because of the weird avatar physics. There is also no save.\nIt's like the world's hardest game (flash game) in glitchy 3D, I guess it's ok for a speedrun if you're bored but I've never liked rage games where it wasn't the levels that are difficult, rather the movement system.","June 3, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game is an interesting challenge, but it's not that great.\n\nMechanically, it's broken. For instance, if you hit a wall, you'll either slide off of it, go through it, fly over it, or merge with it and fall off the board. If you press and hold the forward key without touching anything else and while being perfectly straight, you might slide along gently, roll quickly like a die, or go off at an angle. The game really just does whatever it feels like doing, and it's sloppy as ever.\n\nOh, and even though the game says no saves, checkpoints, etc., that's a bunch of bull. If you die, you just restart that level. If you quit the game, you can pick up where you left off.\n\nThe music is also annoying as it is just loops. Thankfully, there is a mute button, so I'll give it that (I guess).\n\nVisually, the game looks good despite some little things here and there.\n\nReally, this game is just the broken, slightly easier, pay-to play-version of The Impossible Game, and I can't recommend it even if you just want it for the trading cards. 4/10","June 11, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is very hard to move diagonally and when you do it is hard to stabilise because of the weird avatar physics. There is also no save.\nIt's like the world's hardest game (flash game) in glitchy 3D, I guess it's ok for a speedrun if you're bored but I've never liked rage games where it wasn't the levels that are difficult, rather the movement system.","June 3, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovesparkle/recommended/331710/","lovesparkle","LoveSparkle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovesparkle/","66 products in account","Why So Evil is a rage inducing game, that tries to sell itself as a 3d difficult puzzle style game.   The name is a poor choice, unless it was what the Devs think the players who bought the game would be thinking about when thinking of the devs who made the game.\n\nThat being said:  I do not like leaving negative feedback that is hurtful.  But I would feel sad if someone bought this game at full price.\n\nTo the devs and players:  I want to first state that the Unity engine, is at best used for "flash style" games.   Sites like Kongregate actually launched full MOBAs (Vorp!) using Unity.  And that play was beautiful, yet it died (due to low player base) because it was on Unity.   Unity can do some amazing things if programmed right.   That game, like this one, should also be Free to Play.   Or tremendously patched with massive improvements.  There IS a lot of potential here.\n\nI love Puzzle games, I actually have 50+ hours on Hunie Pop.   Which brings a solid point to this game.   This game doesnt have any of the anime, "plot", or pretty pastal colors to get people playing.   The focus on this game went into the game.  And that, is something that should be commended.\n\nThe reality though, is that there is "difficult" and there is "false difficulty".  There are levels with "fog" or a "cement wall" in which you can't see what you're doing.  Playing blind folded is not difficulty for a puzzle.   It has no actual complication to the puzzle other than: we don't want you see what's going on.   These types of levels are extremely poor design.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't talk about the controls.  Controls are not "sexy"  they don't sell a game.   But they are what determines reviews.   I would recommend a patch making the controls much more fluid, and more user friendly.   Bluntly, ♥♥♥♥ tier controls, is also not "difficulty" but poor design.\n\nThis game however does have some strong points.  Namely the atmosphere of the puzzles.  The docks, the tron world, the jungle for instance.   Solid Early 2000s graphics, which is not bad for Unity.\n\nI bought this during the Summer Steam sale.  So the cards will pay for it.  And that's okay.  This game really should be on a website like Armor Games or Kongregate instead of Steam.\n\nI am going to give this a thumbs down, but I hope I can revisit this post and change my rating.   And change my recommendation and comments as the dev works on this game.\n\nBut as of now, this game needs work.  And it should not be puchased for anything higher than the value of the card drops.   I'm sorry, but as of now, that is where this game lies.\n\nBuyer Beware, and Good Luck Devs you do have a great concept here that could be made into a fantastic puzzler.","June 22, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The developer probably coded it in an hour. Everything about this game is poorly done: poor physics that one can manipulate to solve puzzles (the cube seems to stick to walls, which sometimes will allow you to climb over them), poorly textured objects, levels whose difficulty relies on cheap tricks rather than good design, no sound effects (or any effects for that matter), ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music, and collectible diamonds that are more pleasing to look at than to actually collect, as they don't seem to do anything, and you lose them upon death. And you WILL die. Alot.\n\nHowever, it does have a 2 player mode, in which the developer implements the awesome mechanic of if one player dies both die (in other words, it's ♥♥♥♥), and I only paid a quarter for it; plus it's so amusingly bad that it compells me to complete it. And complete it I SHALL! Plus my kids seem to like it, so there's that. Definitely NOT for the impatient though.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, have a quarter to waste, and want a perfect textbook example of how not to make a game, get this; all in all, I think it was worth the price I paid for it; hell for 50 cents you can buy this AND its ♥♥♥♥ sequel for double the fun!","January 14","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","April 28","false","0.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

There's really nothing wrong with it, but at the same time, there's really not much reason to keep playing. There's nothing to really change up the gameplay. Each puzzle is a bit different, but they seem very repetitive. The developer seemed to make a basic game mechanic and did nothing else.

While it's a bit minimalistic, it's still good in it's own right and it's several times more fun than the sequel.

It wasn't tested enough before release, for example to select 2 players you must actually deselect 1 player, and if I'm not mistaken you cannot even go back to the main menu once you start playing, cannot configure anything in the game, and so on. Not to mention the messy control you have on the cube and the lack of rewards or diversity that make you want to keep playing. So... it might have been worth getting if it was free, to give the developer some feedback. Otherwise I'm not sure why someone would buy it when there are better alternatives at the same price.","January 5","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my opinion the dev only made this to get money. It's badly made. Thats it really. Controls are crap. Mechanics are crap. Only challenge is usually whether or not your cube does what you tell it too and whether or not the "Fog" or "clouds" let you see the end of the level. Graphics are ok but not really that good still. Interface is terrible and some buttons doen't even work. Getting stuck on walls usually means you have to restart. Or hitting forward a little bit late or early means your dead. This game has amazing speedrun potential if it was better made. Sadly I'm going to force myself to beat this because i'm a completionist and I want the cards.

In fact, I might even make a bit of money from the 4 trading cards worth 5 cents each in the community market. Of course, Valve is greedy, so after they take their cut, I will end up with a total of 12 cents from all 4 trading cards, so I could go buy a terrible CS:GO Skin! Yay! Now THAT is worth all the power that my pc sucked up just to run Steam Idle Master(link below) to get the card drops..... after all, there is no way that I am playing till all the cards drop.\n\nHonestly, I had some fun in the first 5 levels, but then it started getting difficult-ish. I say ish because it was more stupid than truly frustrating. You are a cube tumbling between different cubes moving in patterns. Neat, but I would rather have been a sphere. That way, I could roll, and not tumble awkwardly and occasionally slide because of Unity's interesting physics.\n\nSteam Idle Master: Best way to get card drops without having to play the terrible or boring games that you wasted your money or time getting a key for free on.

Interface is terrible and some buttons doen't even work. Getting stuck on walls usually means you have to restart. Or hitting forward a little bit late or early means your dead.

I belive this game is aspiring to be a tough game, but that still doesn't even begin to describe it. You move around from a top-view perspective, avoiding obstacles. Eventually the game tries to get tougher, as the levels go on. But, other than this, it's hard to describe this ♥♥♥♥-show.\n\nThe High Points (Pros)If you're playing on a keyboard, this is kinda tough in a way... but I'll get to that later.\nOther than this, I don't really have many high points.\n\nIn summary:\n-Hard if you don't use a keyboard... kinda\n\nThe Low Points (cons)Okay, here's where I'm going to drop the ball, and give you all my thoughts about this game in just a few words:\n"Wow! This game really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks!". There.\nWords cannot describe the intense mediocrity on display here. For a game that aspires to be "hard", it really isn't techinically, unless you use a keyboard, where you begin to realize just how awful the controls are. The top down perspective kinda works, but it can't hide the fact that this game looks like ♥♥♥♥, with stretched-out textures, and blocky items that would barely be acceptable on the PS2, let alone the PS1!\nAnother thing to note is the endless loop that's considered to be "music" here.\nFinally, for a game that looks THIS abysmal, it runs like ♥♥♥♥ most of the time! 4 out of the 8 minutes I sacrificed in order to play this dogshit were me stuck with a low framerate, quitting and restarting the game! Also, this game has NO MENU. You start the game, and BAM! Bad music, standard Unity buttons, and a bad game right in front of you.\nI have respect for the devs, because its hard work, but there are far better first games by other developers that DON'T cost you actual money.\n\nIn summary:\n-Terrible controls\n-Easy, despite being advertised as "HARD"\n-Blocky objects, with stretched out textures\n-Abysmal "Music"\n-Bad preformance\n-No menu\n\nIN CONCLUSION (verdict)\nI couldn't imagine a game to ruin anyone's day faster than Why So Evil. Originally I payed for the bundle because it was dirt cheap, then refunded it because both games sucked ♥♥♥. THEN, Indiegala had a giveaway, and I had a change of heart and decided to grab a key, and I STILL hate this game! The clunky keyboard controls are the only thing that could be considered "diffcult" here, because what little difficulty there is is cheap and done in a way that doesn't feel rewarding after overcoming it... it just feels mundane. It doesn't help that this game runs like ♥♥♥♥, LOOKS like ♥♥♥♥, and has no menu, either.\n\nFINAL GRADE: F","May 16","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
