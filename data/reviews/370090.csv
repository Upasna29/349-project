Passing is rough, its much easier to run currently as they can basically pick you off quite easily 1 on 1, as you can on defense.\n2. Running is very fun, however they need to add some of Maddens ideas such as, Hitstick, Stiffarm, Spin and overall more balance towards all running styles Offensive and Defensive.\n3. The rubberbanding that currently is in-game will I am sure be fixed sooner later, however it really causes some issues when your playing the game, mostly on offensive side however it makes it rough to make plays on defense aswell.\n4. The AI on passing is amazing, AI QB's are very accurate and this not only causes issues because they can just bomb it everytime if they wanted, they can hit their screens very quickly on the move with 95% accuracy. This should be looked into as it can unbalance the game in serious need-to-win games.\n5. Fantasy draft and other goodies that are planned to be added would make this game have so much more to offer, I hope they release a huge content patch in August like they have planned as this game has so much potential being one of the only Football games on PC and new.\n\nI recommend this game because I am a diehard football fan, however if you easily are butthurt over AI kicking your teams butt, you may want to avoid this game currently and look it up after a year or so of patching.\n\nMight have been a little to early release, but we need to support games that we like, specially rare Football ones. :)","July 15, 2015","true","242.5"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","44","54","3","0"

I stopped playing VERY quickly. The play selection is basic at best, the control is stiff and janky, the menus are glitchy on high resolutions, the visual presentation is on-par with games from 2007, and the sound assets are absolutely horrible. There's no crowd noise, no music and the announcer sounds like a 1940s radio announcer with really bad, cheesy lines. The only redeeming quality I can think of for this title is the aimed passing, which is neat.

And that's not a bad thing. This is a budget title, and it shows. The graphics, animations, and audio (namely the commentator) are terrible. There is a serious lack of depth, with each game in the franchise mode feeling like random exhibitions. But Axis Football 2015 shows a lot of potential. I dare say that I actually enjoy the passing system in this game over modern day Madden titles.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty fun. If it should go on sale for $4 or less, I'd highly recommend checking it out.","November 24, 2015","true","13.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

I just wish that the rest of the game was as well fleshed out. Don't get me wrong, I've had fun with the game, but it feels like it should be in early access or a promotional tool to get a kick-stater going and not something being sold as a finished retail product. Also, it's awesome that this game supports Xbox One controllers.\n\nFor me it just has too many issues to recommend it at $20, which puts it in the same class of competition as games like Rocket League and SuperMega Baseball. But at a discount it is worth checking out but bear in mind it does have a few glitches and bugs here and there.\n\nA few of those that I've encountered are:\n\nI've had multiple instances of kickoffs out of bounds resulting in touchdowns being awarded to the AI. I've been rewarded touchdowns on successful two point conversion tries. Dropped lateral passes aren't counted as fumbles. There are some ballance issues with certain teams being pretty OP (you can easily run for 1,000 yds a game with Seattle). The A.I. throws far too many interceptions (I've had as many as 12 in a single game) and takes too many sacks (I've had as many as 39 in a single game) on higher difficulty levels.\n\nI hate having to give this a negative review. I think this is a great starting point, the dev has some really good ideas, I'd love to see him get a serious backer because with proper resources and a team he could make an amazing game, but this isn't a $20 product. Again if you can get it at a lower price, you should give it a try, just have level headed expectations. This isn't a Madden-killer yet. Maybe in 2016.\n\nHere is my detailed review of v 2.0 featuring video footage of the kickoff touchdown glitch. Most of what I say in it still holds true though a few of the gameplay elements such as defensive line shifts have since been patched into the game) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSE-ghbwqho","September 15, 2015","false","11.3"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","26","36","2","0"

It's a solid Indie effort which currently highlights a great aimed passing feature.\n\nPros:\n- All 'official' pro cities represented but for obvious copyright reasons, I thought the dev was very clever with each team name.  You will have no trouble identifying each game team's counterpart in the big leagues.\n- As mentioned before, the aimed passing feature\n- on easy, the AI is too easy but seemed to get challenging on the harder levels\n\nCons:\n- On all levels AI needs a little more beefing up.  Have AI adjust to player's preferential play style during the game which would force the player to quit using plays that 'always work'\n*Rather than list the below items as 'Cons', I understand the game is still being developed so...\n\nNeeding:\n- At 1920 x 1080, I feel the status bar gets 'in the way' of the view during the receiving portion of a kickoff or punt return.  A way to alleviate this would be to get dev to move the bar down a little bit.  Have not tried lower resolutions\n- Color blind features needed - namely for the ground 'target' circles. Being partially color blind myself, I have gotten used to noticing the circle during passing plays but still have a hard time seeing the target circle when about to recv. from a kickoff or punt.\n- REAL time 4 qtrs of play.  Maybe have a mode where one could do a quick game (the way it's set now) then have a more official mode using the official clock times\n- Some of the Madden features for being able to throw off blockers - hitstick, etc  Maybe a quick view change once a pass or kick is caught or after a ball is handed off where one could look from the player's POV while running the play after the catch or hand. *OR*\n- Keep the same view since I get that you want 2 players to be able to share the same screen (friend at a friend's house sort of thing) then maybe slow the game down a little bit.  I think all the AI players noticeably all run around the same speed >> FAST.  Greater variability on each individual AI and player controllered players so that some run faster, some slower.  Some defenders block and pass rush better, some don't.  etc..  By slowing the game down some, a player can read the defense a little more, maybe find the holes to run through.\n\nOtherwise it's a FOOTBALL GAME FOR THE PC!  I think it's worth it.  If you're tight with the money, maybe hold out to see what the new 2016 version will be about.  I bought in now because the dev needs to earn a living too, and so I gladly supported his efforts for this 2015 edition and will most likely shell out some more moola for the 2016 version.  I'll become a 'lifer' supporter if I see great improvements in the 2016 version because that's usually a good sign that the dev is in it to win it!\n\n","December 2, 2015","true","1.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I will be happy to turn this review into a positive when these core issues are fixed by the devs.  At such an early stage in a franchise it is definately not a good sign they are going the way of EA/Madden with "wait til next years version for this basic feature".","November 6, 2015","false","3.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

And yet, this review, at best, is a neutral review.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it can be entertaining! And I dont regret the purchase. And the dev is great! Very friendly, and seems really dedicated to the game. Its just so....lacking. Literally.\n\nI'll list the cons first, then the pros, to end the review on a good note!\n\nThe season mode feels so basic. There is no stats, schedule, nothing. In fact, it feels more like it just randomly generates a matchup to play after each game played. To show what I mean by generating a matchup after each game, this is an experience I had in my season. I was the New England Volunteers( New England Patriots, fyi) and I had to play the New Orleans Crusaders( New Orleans Saints.) I played them as the road team, on, Week 4. On Week 6, I again played the Crusaders, in the Crusaders stadium. The endzones had the Crusaders name in both games. One was played in clear weather, the next in the rain.\n\nNext, the playbooks. Ok I love to strategize about football. One thing I love about Madden video games, is to look at the playbooks to see all the different plays, formations, etc. Axis football, instead has a tiny playbook. I counted the plays. Offensively, there is 45 plays, counting Speacial Teams plays. There are 45 defensive plays, counting the special teams, again. Not much variety. The game is broke down into two(2) 5 minute halves. With limited plays, you'll probably use the same play anywhere between 5-20 times A GAME. For me, most second halves are dull. But, hey, thats just me. Just needed to point it out.\n\nThe Ai needs a whole new overhaul. Really.\nThere isn't probably, a game that you dont eventually know how to defeat and counter the Ai. But this, this Ai is so simple and easy to beat. Even on the hardest setting, I still won and even earned an achievement from it! In this case, it was for the Comeback Kids achievement. Gotta overcome a 21+ halftime deficit. Even on the hardest possible difficulty, I  had to goof off for the first half, just to ensure the Ai was ahead by 21+ points. I won 36-35, even with the clock bugging out, and not stopping when it should have! On another football game, I would've lost. On Axis Football 2015, I dont think its possible for the Ai to win, unless you play horribly, or your team's ratings are lower than the Ai, but thats still winnable.\n\nNext the price. For what they're asking for it, this game lacks in. I bought the game during the promo sale, with 10% off. The game is not worth $20. Given the current state its in, 5-7 bucks is its worth at max. Maybe $10 since its the only one on Steam.\n\nBugs abound, but none seem to be game-breaking, thankfully. How many times has the playbook glitched after an interception, or kickoff, showing offensive plays, when Im on defense? Its super annoying. And, the worst case of it struck AFTER 1.4 came out! Most of the second half for me, I was stuck using my Nickel formation, since every other formation showed my offensive playbook. Still won, and not game breaking, but still.\n\nI'll now list the few pros:\nCreative take on the team names.\nA step up from Backyard football.\nGood dev, even if experience is a little lacking.\n\nFinal thoughts.\nNot a bad game, not a great game. Way too easy, even with the new passing mechanic. The game also lacks way to much in game modes. Not even a practice mode(greatly needed) kicking game is wild, and even the roster modding seems to have gotten off to a rocky start, according to some comments in the community hub.\nThe store page says this is a great alternative to playing Madden. Playing this, it greatly increases my desire to dig out any of my Madden games and play them. Or any of my other football games, for that matter, though none are on the PC and obviously not on Steam.\nThe dev also says hes in this for the long haul. However, its already been noted that next year, Axis Football 2016 will be available for purchase, so its up to you to decide if the long haul means this game, or if whether in a few years Madden will have a rival football game to compete with. Actually, I believe when I saw game play of this game, it was on Axis Football 2014, so it would seem each year equals a new release, with, presumably, more game modes, etc.\nThe achievements are also easy to achieve. My first game with 100% achievements, and I earned them all in 9.0 hours of gameplay exactly, according to Steam.\n\nThere are plenty of cons, yes. But, I still recommend to at least try it out. If anything, you can learn about the game of football. Or experience a decent dev. Or relive the early days of football video games.\n","July 25, 2015","true","9.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

Is it the greatest? No. Does it provide the basic elements of football? To an extremely basic extent. Does it have local co-op to justify a purchase? Yes, at a price. Is this a game of football you can enjoy for at least a bit? Yes.\n\nAxis Football 2015 could have maybe been quite the miniature football game. Though simplistic in nature, the game does provide for an arcade experience. I absolutely love how they made throws possible (even though it is supposed to be done with a keyboard, a game pad works just as well). Holding down "throw" will bring up a circle in the middle of the field just above the touch line. This white circle can be moved towards any player you wish. Alternatively, you can press Y to zoom out and see which player is assigned which button (such as RB, B, A etc...). The players catching ability varies and some players will actually fumble the ball if their not on a proper path to catching it.\n\nThe game play itself is relatively smooth and decent, but it's the specifics where this game lacks. Take tackling for instance, there is no specific button to tackle. You simply run into another individual to take them down. This bothers me the most as the timing of a tackle and where a player makes contact with another players is extremely important. Furthermore, there is no sprint button. I'd like to assume all players run as fast as they can but having that little feature can get anyone out of a tight spot. Another issue : there isn't anyway to incorporate tricks or moves around opponents. Off a kick-off, your player will receive the ball. A second or two later, you'll notice every moves as if it's Play Action Football for the original GameBoy. Instead of spreading out, everyone forms into a cone, then into a line to make their tackle. Sometimes it'll be easy to bypass the entire team while other times you'll have the ENTIRE team chasing you. On defense, you are able to move some of the defensive lines around. On offense, there are ample amount of plays to choose from which are actually quite decent. There is a seasons mode but it is nothing extremely substantial. Some players may find the halves a bit too long.\n\nThe visuals are not bad but the crowd is horrible. The sound is at best decent and the announcer is okay. Extremely neutral on this topic as some of the yelling from the players is nice. Although, they just end up standing there like pylons with no attitude after a play. The menu may be a bit difficult to navigate at first as the player may have no idea how to. You really need to pay attention to what the screen is telling you as pressing start simply won't stop the game.\n\nAlthough the game does a good knockoff teams of NFL teams, it just doesn't hit the spot when it comes to a proper game of (American) football. This game, more or less, is for someone who would like a football game on their library list and have a bit of a breakaway from traditional gaming. It has it's moments where it will entrap you. Soon enough, you'll be wanting more and Axis simply cannot deliver it.\n\nDefinitely not worth $17 but on a sale under $5... probably.\n\nRATING : 6.1/10\n\nScreenShots :\nMy absolute (and probably) only favorite feature in the game\n\nDon't get too crazy with your plays and drive the crowd wild\n\nField goals are at best, OK\n\nI always choose any play that has to do with a hail mary in any football game","December 9, 2015","false","1.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

It has 32 teams with 8 teams that make the playoffs all in 1 division which is kind of a nice twist. The teams resemble the NFL in that one of my players for example is #24 which resembles Marshawn and runs like him (Seahawks). I'm sure someone will release a mod with all the rosters soon. It's a 12 game season.\n-Announcer is both good and bad. The announcer can be turned off. It's sort of like the announcer on Backyard Football, but not as good.\n\nCons:\nI can't get my Dual Action Logitech to work with this yet so far. I downloaded a 360 emulator, but not sure how to get the game to recognize the gamepad.\n\nSummary:\nBuy if you liked Backyard Football, or Madden. This isn't anything close to Madden, but it's fun to play and on the PC. It's a good price, and definitely worth supporting the developers.","July 15, 2015","true","13.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

This is at best an early access pickup, so if you are looking for a well polished football game this is defenetly not for you. It does have potetial and if the developers offer it the attention it needs and are not in it just to make a quick money they can do something interesting with it.\n\nPros:\n1) The manual aiming of passes is an interesting idea\n2) I absolutly have to mention the names of the teams which have nothing to do with the NFL teams like the Indianapolis Broncos, Seattle warhawks, Kensas City Indians and the fact that the teams are from the exact US cities is just clearly a coinsidence :)\n3) It has gamepad support which works fine with my 360 controller\n\nCons:\n1) Totaly unpolished:\n- the tackles and player movements are not even close to real\n- there are a lot of rules missing (holdings, interference etc) - but at least they make fun of that in the commentary\n- some of the available plays can't be selected for some reason\n- the menu ui and interacton while in a game is horible\n- do not expect any cutscenes for replays, gamestarts, etc\n- very limited commentary - at most 20 different lines\n2) Graphics with the settings set to maximum is really bad\n3) Some plays will never get you yards because the players don't react as they should - my wr was realeasing the corner just as my rb was getting there and I got takled 3 consecutive times in the same way\n4) The aimed pass with a controller will defenetly be hard to get used to\n5) No options menu and volume contol. I had to lower the volume from the windows mixer.\n\nSummary: Buy this game only to support the devs in the hopes they will continue with it and for some fun from time to time.

This would be a better price considering this game still has a lot of work to do.\nNot balanced, there are a few teams where you can easily beat the AI with.\nTerrible graphics and animations.\nAI's always use the same strategy, the player is not motivated to experiment with other strategies.\nGlitchy graphics on high resolutions.\nBlocking is too simple and there is no way to avoid tackles or jump.\nOverall experience:\n\nI would recommend Axis Football 2015 for any American Football lover, it's a great game to practice the American Football game.\nI am aware of the fact that I stated about twice the amount of cons then the amount of pros but there is a 2016 coming out with bugfixes and better user interface.\nConsidering the price I would recommend not to buy this game, but this can change in the future!\n\n\nRating:\n\nI would rate the game "Axis Football 2015" a 6.5/10.\n\n\nWant more recommendations?

Ummm, I guess "spirit" of having more sports games on PC. But this game is, well, rough. That's about the nicest way I can put it.\n\nA quick note; I only played single player, and only played with mouse and keyboard.\n\nIt took a single game to learn the passing mechanics which is far and away the highlight of this game. Using mouse for passing like it does with something as simple as "short click lob" and "long click bullet" is brilliant. You can lead your receivers and all that fun stuff. It feels great and intuitive. Once I figured it out though, I won my second game 62-14 and unlocked most of the achievements. By the end of this second game I had also figured out how to return kicks for TDs with relative regularity, thoroughly exploit things on defense, and found a kickoff glitch to almost always recover the ball. And this was on the hardest difficulty.\n\nSimply put, if you have put any serious time into football console games in your life you will absolutely murderously dominate the computer in this game within a single game. Two max. I'm years and years removed from owning a console and this was never a challenge. There's games of the 8bit and 16bit eras with much more depth and AI than what you'll get here.\n\nBut there is still some fun to be had if you don't expect anything. Hunting down the achievements got me to week 3 of the season. The names of the players are phenomenal. You'll spot anything from a LB for New England named T.Castle with #54 (Obviously a Blue Mountain State graduate) to A. Silva and a bunch of other MMA names. Ran into a Falkner and Romanov too. The announcing is bad in a good way but then bad again. I had to mute it after a half. None of these things bring any substance to the shallow gameplay but made the experience worthwhile and made me feel like I like the developer. The game feels like something my buddies and I would end up with if any of us had an ounce of talent or knowledge to make a game. It was fun in that regard. If that makes sense.\n\nLike I said, this is just a thumbs up in the "spirit" of more sports games on PC. I miiight finish out the season just to get the championship achievement but the game really doesn't offer much past a game or two. I feel like there's something here though. Especially the mouse passing. It has great potential. As far as I can tell poking around the forums, the developer is planning a sequel and while I still wouldn't set my sights high or get hopeful in it taking the leaps and bounds it needs... Who knows! This could evolve. It pretty much only has one direction it can go; up! I got it in a bundle but think its worth supporting.\n\nEnd of the day, I've seen worse. Don't expect much.

My most significant complaint is the very poor player controls.  I played with a controller and it was very difficult to move with any precision.  It was nearly impossible to avoid being blocked on defense.  There is no tutorial.  The interface is basic.  Graphics are acceptable for a low budget game, though the camera zooms in at times during plays, making it difficult to see much of the field.  There are no "bells and whistles" and it is not a very "polished" game.  There is limited announcer voiceover, which becomes repetitive very quickly.  In summary, I would say only play this game if you are aching to play an American football game and can't get hold of a higher quality game.","May 7","false","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

An itch to play a decent football game on the PC. When the original Front Page Sports football faded away many years ago, I thought that some other title would carry on the torch. It just didn't happen.\n\nNow we have this entry. We are instructed by other reviewers not to compare this to Madden. Unfortunately however this is exactly what this game tries to be, an "arcady" twitch game. Since this game cannot compete on this level with the aforementioned game, one would expect other areas to be better developed, but sadly this is not the case. If this game had tried to be more of a Front Office football with graphics, it would have fared much better.\n\nThere is simply no simulation value to this game whatsoever. There is a "coach" mode, but this is simply the same game only you do not control one of the players. Since this game is all about action, this mode makes no sense. The action itself is not very satisfying. Often, players being blocked will just stand there, not moving. You can find the one or two plays that will always work, regardless of how good or bad the team you are playing is. As an example, after 4 games, my team's rushing defence has given up negative yardage. My opponents simply cannot run the ball against my team. However, once in a while they will get off an 80+ pass play since their receivers can always outrun my defenders (again - regardless of how good or bad the opponent team is). So every team you play feels exactly like the previous team you just played, only with a different coat of paint.\n\nThere's also alot of missing elements from actual football. There are no leagues or divisions. All teams are thrown into the same standings with the top 12 teams going to some sort of post season play. There are no quarters in games, only 2 five minute halves and there is no changing this. Stat enthusiasts will be very dissapointed as there are no league leader displays. While in a game, you can see the stats of your individual players, but outside of a game, all you can do is view team totals.\n\nIf you want to support one of the only options in PC football, then by all means do so.  I wished I hadn't however. We do have a very large hole in the PC Football genre, but this offering does nothing to scratch that football itch. If I enter a fruit cake into the county fair, and my entry is the only entry in the fruit cake division, of course I'll win the medal, but that doesn't mean it's a good fruitcake. Same can be said of this title.","January 11","false","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

They seem to have a lot of free up-dates with a lot of new features coming to this game. The price isn't too bad for a new game.\n\nCons:\nThe obvious it isn't Madden: graphics are almost Madden 98, you can't do swim moves, a lot of game modes are missing from Madden, However this isn't EA and that is a good thing.\n\nSo I have played two games on here so far, but thus far I have only compelted one pass (a screeen) out of around 20. However, I have thrown incterceptions around 90% of the time (in Madden I might throw one, maybe two on a bad day per game). Even if my guy is closer and it is really close the defender flys and catches it. If I am extremely lucky my guy will have no defender, the ball will hit him head on and he will just drop it. Another issue is that the kicking mechanic that will go from left to right is way too fast. I have to YET make an extra point.\n\nOverall is they made it so passing was actually an option and kicking extra points was a give-me like in real life, and you had a decent shot at field goals I might actually start to enjoy this title. If they do that and add multiplayer (not local), add the mode where you are one player and progress (like in Madden), and release their new models as they say it might actually be a decent game. I honestly think right now it is just a small developer and this is a diamond in the rough. However there seems to me a Joe Montanna 16 football game which is expected to hit PC.\n\nBottom Line: If you have a major itch for american football, and some extra cash and are willing to gamble it on this title being fun (it could be, I can see it) then go for it and support these very friendly and responsive developers. I "wasted" my money on the game, but I am still okay with it because I like them. However, for MOST consumers I would stay away and wait for Joe Montanna 16.","July 18, 2015","false","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Moreover, while you can control a player using the direction keys, there are no special moves (e.g. juke, stiff arm, hard tacklee, etc.) a la Madden.\n---There are no NFL teams, despite marketing to the contrary....I played the 'Green Bay "IceMen"\n---On offense, there is limited play selection; without the ability to design routes, the selection is actually rather limited.   There are an impressive number of defense plays available, based on the number of linemen you put up front.\n---The clock/clock management is a mess (no hurry up, each play takes only a few seconds off the clock,)\n---since it is an arcade type game, there are waaaaay too many big plays---it's all sacks, interceptions, bombs and long breakaway runs....in one game, my HB had runs of 88, 49 and 38 yards---IN ONE HALF.\n---Penalties...: there are none.\n---Fumbles...:way too few; Interceptions: way too many\n---Injuries: none\n\n\nA few other observations:\n---The graphics are upgradeable, and on my high-end MacPro at maximum resolution, the animations are pretty good\n---There is a live announcer, although his calls are limited and quickly become repetitive,\n---There is a 'Season' mode, including single-game elimination Play-offs, but no career mode.\n---The AI is too easy to beat. There are four difficulty levels; after two "practice" games I started an entire season and went 8-1 before getting bored and giving up.\n---There is local multiplayer support (good) but no online MP (bad)\n\nThere are so many absent or missing features I would personally consider this an early beta.  To emphasize,the game is strictly  an arcade-y experience---there is no "coaching mode" available---and so perhaps some of the missing features mentioned above are less important---but this is no Madden, and given the availability of other, better American football simulations on other platforms I can not recommend the game in its current state.\n\nBottom line:  the game costs about a third of what EA chareges for each Madden seasonal title, and has about the commensurate level of quality.\n\nBTW, for those people who, like me, love American football and have been yearning for a realistic and fun coaching sim. game, the best football game I have "ever" played---going back 40+ years to the board-game days of All-Pro Football, Strategy, Scrimmage; through the days of MircoLeague and Playmaker, to NFL Quarterback Club and Blitz; to the modern era and the yearly incarnations of NCAA and Madden---is "Pro Strategy Football," which is (unfortunately) still only available for the iPhone and iPad...if you have never tried it, you owe it to yourself to play it, then bug its devs. to port it to the PC.","July 19, 2015","false","5.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Super Temo Bowl for the Snes had more options  then this game does.\n\nIt don't look to great which i would be fine with if their was some other game play modes, put a custon team into a fran mode and i would play it even with the low end look and clunky game play.\n\nI guess buy it if you wnat to give them $20 for the chance to buy a better game next year but i doubt you will get more then an hour or two out of the game play.","September 16, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I heard this game was built on a 500 dollar budget, the game was very robotic and seemed like it was simply made. I then launched the game and played, it's what I expected basically, no NFL licensed official teams, unis, stadiums etc. But I was shocked on the lack of modes in this game, yes Seasons and Head to Head is nice, but where is the Online and Roster Editing and a place where you can share your mods (ala 2k share) When I first played I noticed the Controller controls were stiff, and the passing with the controller was hell, it is a great feature but just doesn't go with the controller(hard to get used to) The running was another thing, the players just took off, it didn't even look like the center hiked the ball to the qb to hand off to the rb, it was like that animation was skipped, I always noticed how the players ran moving awkwardly, and again stiff. I always have had problems with defenders teleporting to my QB, and On Kick Return there is another player who stands out of bounds (KR2?) The graphics are like Madden 01. It lacks a soundtrack, and most importantly CREATE A PLAYER MODE. The commentary is not very exciting, with it's repetitive lines, and in fact it's very cheesy, but what do we expect from 1 guy producing all of this game. I believe that this game has potential, but definitely should be treated as a beta, not as a finished product. This game is a flop but definitely has some potential to become a big hit on the pc if it fulfills its flaws and the developer puts in some more money into the game. I cannot recommend this game, but I do recommend you keep an eye out for future games. 30/100 but has potential for upcoming games","November 1, 2015","false","3.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It could be a decent base game for the ambitious developer to build on, but right now it feels far from a finished product in it's current state.\n\nPasses tend to bounce off receiver's heads.  The running game is all or nothing as it seems impossible to break a tackle, could definitely benefit from a spin or juke button.  Pretty easy to rack up 20 or more sacks in a 10 min game(quarters cannot be changed from two 5 minute halves.)  Player speed seems to be too far apart.  I was literally able to run circles around the other team on kick returns like Bo Jackson in Tecmo.  Keep in mind I was playing on all-star, did not try hall of fame difficulty.\n\nNow I know this isn't madden but even with really low expectations I was still disappointed.  There's a reason madden took several million and years to get where it is.  Maybe in a couple years this can become a solid game.  Right now it's about as basic a "football" game as can be.   The price has dropped to $15 but imo it's still too high.","November 4, 2015","false","7.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The gameplay is fun, the game is simple (a good thing in my book), and the games are quick enough that you can pop in and play for 15 minutes at a time.  I enjoy the season mode a lot as it is not too complicated.  I also enjoy seeing your combined margin of victory along with your W/L record.  It's an interesting way to sort out "bubble" teams at the end of a season.\n\nMy biggest dislike is that all the teams are NOT equal.  If you want to play as your favourite NFL team (erm, city?), you're out of luck if you don't like Green Bay, Pittsburgh, or a select few others.  Only about 1/4 of the teams are actually playable - the rest are just too difficult to bother with.  I imagine this can be changed a little by modding the rosters, but it's a little silly to be forced to edit your team just to make it a viable option.\n\nOverall it's an enjoyable football game with decent AI and fun gameplay.

There aren't any official teams however they do allow you to modify the teams as you wish so it is possible to create your favourite teams if you are willing to put in the time. The gameplay itself is fairly basic, as it does not allow you to do any special moves such as juke moves or spin moves. However this means that the game leans more to a strategic style of gameplay where the plays you run matter more than the individual control of the player. The graphics aren't anything to be amazed by but they do the job well.

I would much rather have some NCAAesque menu where you choose how each team plays and has their own playbooks. Maybe they could integrate different offensive styles into the game. So something like this:\n\nOffensive Philosophy:\nAir Raid\nRun & Shoot\nPro Style\nSpread Option (wouldn't it be fun to control the pitch with the mouse? directed pitches?\nFlexbone\nMultiple\netc.\n\nDefensive Philosophy\n43\n34\n425\n335\netc.\n\nThen depending on what philosophy you pick you have various plays in the playbooks they represent. Personally I think it's really bland how every team has the same playbook and same plays.\n\nOther ways to improve the replayability and popularity would be to be able to affect the rules of the upcoming Franchise mode. Maybe have a pro mode and the college mode (that can be played separately or together) where the way you aquire players changes. Honestly I wouldn't care if the recruiting was robust or not, maybe there could be some way that the rankings from the previous year affect recruiting classes, etc. I know much of this is just wishes and dreams, and I really don't know how the software works so maybe some of what I'm asking isn't realistic, but I think this game has a ton of potential to be the PC football game everybody talks about.\n\nAlso, would be nice if the season mode recorded stats all year long.\n\nOther than all that, let us add our own logos to teams, customize jerseys, etc.","July 16, 2015","true","23.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has devs that are continuing to support the product after release.  If you're like me and you've checked every summer/fall for a PC football game, then your wait is fianlly at an end.\n\nPros:\n- Full season mode\n- The first time I've seen a sports game that is actually playable on m+kb\n- Modable rosters\n- Competitive gameplay against the AI\n- It's a new football game on PC!\n\nCons:\n- I can't seem to find any season stats in season mode.  I can only assume that it's also missing career stats as well.  That would really help the feel of continuity and give an incentive to keep playing.\n- The running game is very strong, although I'm not on the hardest difficulty (yet)\n- The passing game gets some taking used to.  In the long run it's probably more versatile than the Madden style, but at the start it's difficult and wonky.  You will throw a lot of interceptions and baffling incompletions.\n- The commentator is a total waste. Funny at first, but annoying and you'll turn it off after one game.\n\nPersonally I feel like the cons are fairly superficial and fixable.  Right now I wholeheartedly reccomend this game if you're looking for a football game on the PC.  It doesn't have every feature of past Madden games, but if you don't support developers like this it will never reach that level, and I doubt you'll ever see another action football game on the PC.","July 17, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It needs a lot of work, and I won't be playing it often until major updates come along.\n\nI love the idea of passing with the mouse, but also would want to do it the old fashioned way as an option.  I can decide at the last moment my guy isn't open but the guy all the way across the field is.  In that case a simple button press would get it done faster.  And of course the qb's stats then determine more about the throw.  I'm sure in the present control scheme you can still easily implement qb stats as how far they can throw, and how accurate it is to my requested location, so it might be the best in the end.\n\nBuy it if you want to see where it can go.  Until then I still play NFL 2k5 as the best available option, despite trying the other guy every year only to find it hasn't gotten better.

Not worth $20. But if a few things are FIXED, this game would be pretty good.\nFirst, the bugs:\n1) That little white passing target circle ("aimed pass target"), works about 50% of the time. When it doesn't work, the white circle appears STUCK about 10yds down from where ball was snapped. Moving the mouse does NOT move the aiming circle. That needs to be fixed.\n2) Kickoff the ball to the sideline; if it goes outta bounds, the opposing team gets a TD. That needs to be fixed.\n3) In 1 of 6 games I played, had to quit and restart due to a looping animated sequence; after opponent was tackled, the opponent player gets up, then falls, then gets up... repeat. It was in a loop. Had to quit and restart.\nNow for the disapointments:\n1) The side view isn't a PLAYABLE view. Only for coach mode. That needs to be fixed. Tecmo is played from a SIDE VIEW. If this game is gonna play like Tecmo, can we at least PLAY it in the Tecmo-like SIDE VIEW?\n2) More camera angles would be nice. The up-field Madden camera is fine but can we at least lower, raise or even tilt it? (Same for a playable sideline view).\n3) No defensive audibles. Wow.\n4) Some wind effects on kicking would be nice.\n5) AT LEAST have a button for SPIN (offense) and DIVE (offense and defense). Again, like TECMO, all we can to is change player and guide player. That's it! OK, if this is gonna follow the TECMO model, give us a playable SIDELINE view.\n6) Cannot exit, save and continue a saved game.\n7) Cannot change difficulty DURING A SEASON. This is really LAME. It took me nearly 3 hours of playing to discover the only realistic way to play this game is to play on the highest level, using one of the better teams. The other easier modes are just too easy. So why not let us change difficulty BEFORE EACH GAME, DURING A SEASON!?\n8) NO VIEWABLE schedules. WOW....\n9) No coin toss to determine who kicks and who receives. No big deal but found it strange I can decide to kick or receive every game.\n10). Modding; not interested in obtaining special graphical software just so I can mod this game. I guess I need cross my fingers that other people can post their modded files somewhere, that REDO the logos, making these teams look like NFL teams with correct NAMES and LOGOS.\nThat's it for me. Personally, I enjoyed the experience. I'll probably play 1 season and delete this game. Worth $20? Not really. This game plays like TECMO but sadly it's missing a playable TECMO sideline view. I do like the simplicity but nearly ALL the things I mentioned should be SIMPLE things that should've been included in this $20 game. If they get fixed someday, great. But sound like the developer already has a 2016 version in the works. Hard to beleive.. this game isn't even DONE yet. But maybe the 2016 version will be the COMPLETE version I'm hoping for.\n","August 30, 2015","false","8.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It takes the worst parts of Madden and then sprinkles its own special flavor of bad on top of it.  I wish game designers would stop trying to copy other games.  Madden is really a poor game and we're stuck with it.  But instead of trying out new concepts and aiming a little lower (think 2D animation) this game attempts to take on the giant using a small rock.  The rock misses the giant and comically bounces back to harmlessly hit the developers of this game square in the head.  There's no reason for anyone to own this game, it's not going to get better than what it currently is - a poorly designed, poorly thoughtout pile of wasted time (and my money).\n\nAdvice for the developers.  Go back and really THINK about the kind of football game you want to make.  Is a 3D animation similar to Madden really something that market needs right now?  Nope, and you're never going to comepte with them.  So why not make a game based more on strategy and less on graphics?  Why not make a thinking mans game?  Why not develop something that requires less "throwing it deep" and more "let's free the right defensive tackle and run a trap play up the middle because the guy is unblockable and is in our backfield every play anyway!".\n\nDear developers at large, THIS is what the football genre is missing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndeadRufus/recommended/370090/","UndeadRufus","Undead Rufus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndeadRufus/","358 products in account","SUMMARY:\nAxis Football 2015 might be "a great alternative to Madden" as advertised if you want an arcade experience that takes its cues from early-1990s Nintendo titles. That's fine and all, but the implication of the plug line is that this game has something to offer along the lines of Madden, and that is not even superficially true (unless you're talking about, say, Madden NFL '94). This indie effort is a game I want to like, and it is promising enough to keep an eye on future versions, but it doesn't even remotely justify its retail price in its current state.\n\nPRO:\n+ It's an American football game on PC, which is a rare species.\n\n+ The aimed passing mechanic (using right stick or mouse) is interesting and should be explored further.\n\n+ Despite many problems, the game has an undeniable retro charm that hints at some underlying potential.\n\n+ There's no NFL license, but the fake league contains clever replacements (e.g. the Pittsburgh Steelmen and the Denver Stallions).\n\n+ Flawless support for Xbox 360 controller.\n\nCON:\n- There are no blocking animations whatsoever, and ball carriers run like they're carrying an egg on a spoon. Animations overall are terrible.\n\n- Hit detection is janky. I've tackled opponents by hitting nothing but air three yards away, and I've missed opponents by having my defender run through them.\n\n- Spotty spotting. I came up a full yard short of a first down and was awarded the first anyway. On the other hand, I've clearly crossed the line a few times, only to be told I'm 4th and 1.\n\n- The only timing option is to play two five-minute halves, and there are no penalties or any particular fidelity to NCAA or NFL rules.\n\n- Season mode is just a string of quick matches that offer no semblance of excitement or progression. No franchise mode, no player creation (though players can be edited externally in a text file).\n\n- Despite the innovative passing mechanic, the actual on-screen experience of delivering the football is irritating. Defenders will routinely warp through receivers, and you can forget about rifling a pass into tight coverage. If there's a defender anywhere near the ball, it will probably be picked off. In single games, I've seen upwards of a dozen interceptions on normal difficulty.\n\n- While on defense, you can get a sack on almost every pass play by simply waiting for the offensive line to engage, and then running a delayed blitz with a linebacker. This seems to work exceptionally "well" with the MLB in dime defenses. In my last game, the AI quarterback was sacked 25 times.\n\n- There are no jukes, stutter-steps, spins, jumps or dives. No going vertical and fighting for the ball, no diving grabs or acrobatic sideline catches. You can't pump-fake. You can't run option or read plays. You can't even sprint. In fact, you can't do much of anything after the pass or handoff.\n\n- Small number of plays, and every team has the same playbook (as far as I've looked).\n\n- On-field sounds are lifeless, and the commentary is perhaps the worst I've ever heard in a sports video game. Crowd noise is present, but it sometimes drops out completely between plays.\n\n- The AI does not react well to game situations and is at times amazingly stupid.\n\n-  No online multiplayer.\n\n- The retro charm fades quickly, and what remains is a paper-thin product that I would call early access at best. The fact that buyers of AF 2015 will have to also buy AF 2016 — possibly just for some basic features that didn't make it into the first installment — does not endear me to Axis Games or this franchise, even if I'm at least happy to see someone doing a new PC football game.","February 9","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played my first game, using my Xbox 360 controller, and almost immediately fell in love with the passing controls (though my first pass awful as I tried to figure out the mechanics).  Haven't explored difficulties etc, but if they scale like I would expect, the four options should give each user the chance to find a zone they're comfortable with.\n\nVisually, the is simple.  The stadium is filled with thousands of gray and black shirts, the pink endzone is a bit of an eyesore, and the players are simplistic.  Not that it really matters.  The playcalling interface is similar to something from Madden, and the displays are pretty straightforward.\n\nThe audio.  Well, I'll give the audio a B for effort.  The end result is something that sounds like you asked you neighbor to come over and do.  It's okay, but a little distracting at first.  However, it's not like you'd expect Grade A sports announcers on an indie title, so I applaud the effort and imagine that the 2016 version will improve greatly.  I wonder if there's public domain audio that could be used for the game, like vintage stuff.  That could be cool.\n\nOne other gripe with the audio is that on four successive plays I heard the announcer talking about a facemask on the play.  And it happened way, way more than it would in a regular game, much less one time-condensed.  I don't know if it's a scripting thing or whatever, and ultimately it didn't take away from the game, but it sounds liek something that needs to be worked on for the next version.\n\nHaven't used but will the modding of rosters, of course.  This is a small thing that adds a lot to a game like this.  Hopefully the next version will allow users to mod the team names and logos as well.  And basically the more opened up for modding and the Workshop, the better.\n\nOverall, this is a very solid effort, and has the potential for some great things.  If you enjoy console football, miss playing football on your PC, or just like playing sports games, you can do a lot worse than Axis Football.  Grab a copy and support the effort for better things to come with PC football.","April 23","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
