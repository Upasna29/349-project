"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/461230/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","Dashy Square is a cute rhythm-based platformer with cute, challenging levels and a great soundtrack.\n\nIf you’ve ever played Geometry Dash you’ll feel right at home with Dashy Square as the gameplay is inspired by it and feels very similar. The idea is simply you must navigate your way to the end of each level past the various objects you’ll encounter. If you have little patience or hate cheap deaths then this game isn’t for you because without lightning fast reflexes you’ll be dying a lot; Dashy Square is HARD.\nYou constantly move through the level and must jump, slow yourself down, fly and dodge your way past the objects that’ll appear in front of you as you move. The level will often bounce, flip or disappear as you play so focus is a must! Each level is different and they continuously get harder even though the ‘Easy’ levels are pretty hard themselves but you can practice each level without the fear of dying if you’re really struggling.\n\nEach level is nicely designed and very colourful and there are a total of 16 levels currently with more coming soon so there is a nice amount of content for the price.\nDashy Square is a fairly fast paced game with a soundtrack to match each and every level which I love. I had hoped to purchase the soundtrack via Steam after playing but this isn’t an option which is a shame. There is a link in game to the soundtrack in-game where I think some of the tracks are downloadable but it is still something i’d like to see on Steam so I could easily use the tracks in other platformers that allow audio import.\n\nThere is also a nice amount of visual customization in game from all the textures of powerups and the in level background, to how your avatar looks and even the colour of the trail your produce from items. You can also choose your practice, menu and victory songs. The combination of these two stops the visuals and sound becoming repetitive and increases the replayability. You also have a massive assortment of achievements to get as well meaning even once you’ve completed all the levels there is still stuff you can do.\n\nThe game has a few cons, some levels are uncompletable without dying at least once or playing practice mode first. I’m all for difficult levels and a nice challenge but some of the deaths are unavoidable without prior knowledge of what is to come. This makes replaying a level again that you would have otherwise completed a little annoying. The only other issue is the game can seem a bit confusing first because none of the menus really explain what they do but it’ll come to you very quickly.\n\nThough I got Dashy Square in a bundle I still think $3 is still a great price for those looking for a challenging platformer with a great soundtrack to accompany it and plenty of customization. But be warned, this game is not for the impatient or those looking for an easy win.","May 17","true","5.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","3"

The graphics are pretty nice, they are 2D, with pretty decent textures. The atmosphere is basically a bunch of areas, where your square has to reach the final of the area, but he will have to repel many obstacles. The audio is nice, as well as the music is great, it’s really entertaining for an indie game. The gameplay is about repelling many obstacles, but in the same time, collecting different keys, which unlock many achievements. Once you reached the final of the area, the wave is finished. Each level has 5 waves, right now there are only 16 levels. So basically, a ton of waves. The engines and mechanics aren’t the strongest point in this game, I personally dislike the constant shacking of the map. Apart of that, the stopping and the jumping of the square are alright, as well as the moving of it. It’s pretty well-optimized even for very bad computers.\n\nStrong Points\nPretty nice graphics\nGood SFX/soundtrack\nChallenging gameplay\nFunny characters\nLevels/Endless mode\nUpcoming level editor\nPretty well-designed mechanics\nUser-friendly interface\nTutorial available\nMany achievements\nWeak Points\nA little too hard from the begging\nMight need a little more polishing\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 8.5/10\nAudio/Music: 9/10\nGameplay: 8.5/10\nStory: N/A\nEngines/Mechanics: 8/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 8.4/10","April 29","true","1.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/461230/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Product received for free\n\nDashy Squares is certainly an acquired taste in terms of video games. In theory it’s a simple game, your job is jump and dodge obstacles as you race towards the finish line. It offers different modes of gameplay and a wide variety of customizing options for your avatar as well the music. You have sixteen levels to play and plenty of in-game power ups and trophies to grab. It’s a game with a high replay value.\n\nYou can play this game with a controller, as I preferred, or your keyboard. Your avatar is always constantly moving in the levels, it’s your job to slow it down to avoid danger or time your moves right to collect bonuses. Despite being pretty simple to understand the game is very difficult. I found it frustratingly difficult. There is no story and no real goal, you play for the challenge of it and to collect things. One feature I did like was that you can play any level you like from the start with more to come, so it’s nice to have the option to bounce around try different things.\n\nThe music in the game is described as electronica/edm so I imagine club or rave type music. There are forty songs and you can pick and choose which you want to play, however, what I didn’t like is when you go to change up a song there is no sample preview of what the song will sound like so you’re left shooting in the dark. The music is also rather loud in the game and I quite frankly didn’t like the music at all. It wasn’t bad music it just wasn't my cup of tea. The graphics are alright, they’re pixels formed into shapes. They’re not horrible but they’re very simple, I feel more detail could have been added and maybe a nicer user interface.\n\nThis game really just went over my head, I didn’t like it at all. It feels like a game aimed at the meme/youtuber generation and that’s perfectly fine, just because I didn’t like the game does not make it a bad game. I feel it offers a great challenge with good controls that alone is commendable. This game also has Steam achievements and trading cards and it’s only three dollars. Look at the information, watch the trailer and make your own decision. I recommend Dashy Squares if anything in this review has caught your interest.\n\n\nThis review is exclusively written for Y.A - Yolo Army, follow the group's curations here!","May 10","true","9.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Its for those who have fast reflexes and have littile or no time to play lengthy indie action games. But be not mistaken , its not any action  game, its better. Here you methodically dodge obstacles instead of blowing them to bits. As they say -The best offence is a good defence.\n\nIts a colorful game with 16 levels with great and varied music and gameplay. Every level is almost new in content. There are five levels with waves. The game is based on a directional algorithm whose only purpose is to entertain. Even though 2d in orientation. You face seemingly different obstacles with varied difficulties. The music is actually designed to help players overcome these obstacles.\n\nThe obstacles are some designed to be jumped over , some to be flyed over,  yet some to be paused for.There are various tools ingame like the teleporter which only changes the location/height  of the player, there are some boxes which are chained, they  fall after regular intervals. Some boxes are orchestrated in such a way that you must fly over them. Even some passages are designed to increase or decrease the players momentum.\n\nLike wise there are tools provided to the player which enable the player to jump or fly. The basic mechanics of the game is simple it trys to introduce new  obstacles killing monotony of repeating a level, while it plays on directional orientations of the user within the limitations of the two dimensional computer screen.The game plays on every usable sense available to a general player, namely direction speed, audio. what more there’s a level editor coming soon which is designed to hopefully broaden the players experience even more.\nIn terms of creativity the games architect sulejmani has not only outdone himself but left room for the community as well.It may look similar to  certain games  (unmentioned here) but it really isn’t.There are many pros to this game and relatively no cons. But to mention a few\n\nPROS\n+ the levels are fun,varied and interesting\n+The game is pocket friendly at onlt $ 3 or so\n+The game has innovative music\n+ the game play is smooth\n+level editor (soon to come)\n\nCONS\n-The music is a bit too loud\n-The spatial flow of the game can be nauseating at times  and can cause a headache if not gotten used to fast.\n\nAll in all it’s a 8/10 game. The game was released on 26th April by Sulejmani. The steam version is in  five languages  till date English,Spanish,Italian,French,Portugese. It comes with steam trading cards and steam achievements\n\n(I owned the game, from Daniell and reviewed it on my own )","May 6","true","2.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ararielfett/recommended/461230/","ararielfett","[ᴸᴼᴳ] Arariel Fett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ararielfett/","285 products in account","Dashy Square is a pretty basic, but easy to pick up and play game.  Each level has different obstacles for you to pass ranging from slowing down and waiting for a timed trap, or jumping at the right moment.  It's nice that the levels aren't just the same exact thing over and over.  While we're mentioning levels, there are plans for a level editor which will really change things for this game.  When you look at games like PolyBridge, the community can certainly go wild with designs.  It's only a matter of time before that creativity is unleashed here.\n\nSomething really interesting and fun about this game is the music.  There's a variety of tracks, and the music helps you time your movement.  In fact, while it's not absolutely needed, it is advised to leave the game volume on and play with the music going.  You may end up doing a lot better than you were when it was muted.\n\nGraphically there isn't much to say.  The graphics are good for this game, but nothing too special.\n\nDashy Square was released on April 26th and goes for $3, which is a steal given how fun this game is and that it's pretty much endless.  The developers really did a good job with this game, including the music. I really tend to nitpick games on music, which you'll see below, but DS really did it perfectly.  My only issue with the game was the music being a bit too loud, and there was also no option to turn down the music.  Would be nice to have a slider in the options menu.\n\n\nPositives:\nHas different default levels.\nGood graphics.\nExcellent music choices.\nGame can be endless.\nLevel editor. (soon to come)\nAchievements\nDeveloper is active within the community\nNegatives:\nNo volume control.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curations.","May 1","true","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/461230/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1465 products in account","IntroductionDashy Square seems to have taken some inspiration from the game Geometry dash and has changed the game in such a way, with some different mechanics in the game and a few different features that doesn't make it just a clone of Geometry dash. The game is funny, can be a bit difficult at times, but overall a fun game.\n\nGameplayThis game seems to be a very nice alternative to Geometry Dash, although it seems like the game is just a clone from Geometry Dash it actually has some new and unique mechanics that make it different from Geometry Dash. It focuses upon mainly the timing in which you do all of these actions, whether it's slowing down, jumping on your board or flying with your jet pack which could ultimately mess you up at any point in the game. You don't get to see very much in front of you, so knowing what is about to come up will rely on either quick reaction times or dying and remembering what happens. This does mean that the game does have a trial and error way throughout the game as you will probably lose a lot throughout the later levels.\n\nThe game offers a tutorial that will explain how each of the mechanics work, it is well designed and explains the mechanics in a brief and easy way to understand what is going on. The game features about 16 levels for you to complete, all of them being fairly difficult and hard to complete. You will spend awhile on each level trying to get to the end and complete the level. Something that is a bit weird is the shakiness of the screen sometimes, it really puts you off and I really dislike this feature. There does seem to be a upcoming level editor feature that could be interesting to play around with, looking forward to see what that is like.\n\nThe graphics of this game are fairly simplistic, the textures are decent. This means that the game can be run on pretty much almost any computer/laptop that you own. You can change your character and your little pet thing that hovers with you as you progress through the game. There is a nice variety of colours that you can put onto your character that can make it unique.\n\nPros+ Not just a clone of Geometry Dash\n+ Unique game mechanics\n+ Nice tutorial\n+ Variety of levels\n+ Upcoming level editor\n\nCons- Can get a bit too difficult\n- Trial and Error\n- Weird screen shake at times\n\nResult / Final thoughtsDashy Square is a fun and addicting game that can get quite infuriating at times. There is a nice variety of levels and a few unique mechanics that makes it different from Geometry dash. There is a nice tutorial level that you can do, and a upcoming level editor which should be interesting to mess around with.\n\nRating: 7.8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","April 29","true","5.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"
