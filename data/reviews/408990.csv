This game is NOT Early Access in any shape or form.\n\nDo not buy this game expecting there will be many improvements/features to come because it is EA, it simply is not.   The game is playable (Windows only) but has many frustrating usability issues, but if you can see past these as it currently stands it might be worth a buy.\n\nHowever the game is already 3+ years old, I bought it a year before the Steam release.  In the past 2 years updates have occurred at about once per 6 months (see the T&S forums). The lack of communication from the main developer of T&S (the one setting the roadmap) is the worst I have ever experienced. On the forums it is almost non-existant, here on Steam, as you can see, there is no news whatsover since release.\n\nThe developer needs to move it from Early Access into a release version ASAP.  That way you as a buyer know exactly what you're getting.  Also, as a released game it is quite acceptable for 1 or 2 updates a year (or less) and minimal communication.  As Early Access it is absolutely not.\n\n\nPros:\n- Great feeling of creative freedom to build whatever style of fortress you want.\n- Nicely generated procedural landscapes to play on.\n- Ability to override AI temporarily and move people into position for combat or run away (greatly reduces frustration).\n- Excellent music soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n- Micro management is fine to some extent, but having to contiinually change professions of people to get anything built is not fun after the hundredth time.  This may be mitigated slightly once you have more people, but getting more people is not easy (see later points).  Regardless, there is no task priority system whatsoever, very poor for a game of this type.\n\n- Very poor communication of key concepts.  The in game tutorial is very basic.  For example it suggests build roads to get more workers but doesn't explain the additional conditions required to get visitors (tip: it seems to depend on your food levels).  How do you remove designations to build/mine etc, (tip: select build/mine , hold down Shift Alt, and drag over the existing designation).  Why is this not mentioned in the game at any point?\n\n- Farming is extremely confusing and counter intuitive.  In order to increase your food level there seems to be some  hidden magic balance between size and number of fields, number of farmers, skill of farmers and possibly crop type.  If you don't get this balance exactly right eg. you have say too many farmers or too large fields, your food levels will actually drop.  As food is so critical to success in this game (getting more immigrants) , this is frustrating and needs much better explanation.  I've even noticed farmers actually removing plants before they yield any food.\n\n- The game often displays quantities as a total of the mass of all items eg. 8 items with 0.5 mass each is displayed as 4.  In many screens however it often has no indication whether a number indicates mass or straight quantity.  This is ridiculously confusing. How hard is it to add just a 'mass' suffix to all relevant fields?\n\n- Road system is tedious.  You have to manually build roads to the very edge of the map, adjusting the height level for every hill you come across.  This adds nothing to the gameplay, visitors should be able to find their own way to your hall like almost every other similar game.\n\n- Mouse and keyboard view controls are unintuitive.  You scroll the view using the WASD keys with Shift to move faster.  (Default scroll is too slow so I  continually have to use Shift which is painful after a while). You rotate the view by right clicking and moving the mouse.  An improvement would be scrolling via right click on the world/drag and rotate via Q/E keys.  This is simpler,  more accurate and less tiring.\n\n- Mouse wheel zooming is also very flaky, sometimes gentle zooming-in jumps you 10 levels below the surface, zooming out puts you way out above the map.\n\n- New textures are ok for stone, rocks etc but grass is quite ugly in my opinion.  I also have to turn off shadows, not for performance but so I can more easily see elevation changes etc.\n\nI'll revise this if/when any updates occur that address any of these issues.  It's a game with plenty of potential, but it's been in "early access" for about 3 years now (way before coming to steam) and the development team seem to just disappear for months at a time.","November 10, 2015","false","22.9"," 316 of 387 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","316","387","9","27"

Fail at any of these and watch in horror as something simple like a wolf pack kills off all your settlers, or something as extreme as a horde of skeletons following an evil magician burns your world to the ground.\nIts a slow process of mining rock, shaping it and building it into your massive castle, training settlers to be knights outfited with the best armor and weapons, setting up an economy to trade for resources you dont have, and finally reaching a level of safety and refuge for your lazy/weak/overeating, worthless settlers. Its your choice whether to feed them to wolves, or let them stay in the hopes that maybe they will contribute at some point.\nThe game has a steep learning curve, you will be playing along thinking that your doing fine, then get destroyed because you didnt realize how important feathers were, or maybe you do know how important they are (key ingredient for arrows) but the damn chickens didnt want to shed any. . . either way you can invest a few hours into it, and get wrecked. But if you stick with it (meaning start over and over) for a bit, you will start to feel the satisfaction of successfully raising an army, filling your battlements with archers, polishing up your castle, and building a thriving town. Then let the hordes come, let the goblins chop the forest down, for when they approach your walls, hell will rain down from your archers. And when they charge your gates, greet them with the points of a dozen lances. When the spider monarch shruggs off your arrows, fire balistas at her until she is nothing but crumpled remains.\nThe game is still a work in progress, there are lots of little things that can irritate the crap out of you, but its worth grinding your teeth and working around them.\nThe game is very playable as is, but will only be getting better. The devs have proven their loyalty and dedication to the game and Im very excited for the finished product one day far far from now.\n","October 20, 2015","true","55.4"," 63 of 75 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","63","75","3","1"

While that phrase gets thrown about a lot,  in this case it is 100% true.    Does that mean this is a bad game?   Depends on what you like and if you are willing to accept the progress that has been made, and understand that there will be no more updates.   Are you still interested?   Then continue reading....\n\n\nIn a nutshell, its a challenging base building game that requires attention to detail, managing your villagers, and protecting them from their own stupidity.\n\nWhat there is to like about it...\n\nIt has a minecraft look and feel about it, blocks with sloped angles.\nBase building is simple to understand, and allows for infinite creativity when it comes to design.\nRecipes for crafting are explained ahead of time, no need for research.\nDefinite balance to crafting/fighting/building required,  this creates a true challenge.\nThe musical score is perfect,  varied and rich in sound.\nIt can be fast paced at times, and laid back at other times.\n\n\nWhat are its problems?\n\nTutorials are crude, almost cryptic.\nLearning curve is deceptively steep.   You can load it up, play it for a few hours, think you have a handle on it, only to watch your village get wiped within minutes by something you didn't plan for.\nBuilding menus and planning menus aren't separated, creating deep menu trees that can confuse players.\nNoticle hiccups in the camera behavior, terrain fogging over, and the camera diving below the ground level.\n\n\nWhat is it similar to?\n\nDwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Stone Hearth,  Anno series, Banished.\nIf you own any of these titles and love the genre, you may want to consider Timber and Stone.   If you've played some of those games, and found it to be tedious, or just not your kinda thing, then pass on Timber and Stone.\n\n\nThings to be concerned about...\n\nThe game has been abandoned by the developer.   So any bugs listed in the forums or mentioned in this review WILL NOT BE FIXED.    There is are no indications that anyone will take over the development of this game.\n\n\nIn conclusion...\n\nGiven the state of the game, knowing it will never be updated,  this game is worth $5 to $10 tops.   There are youtube videos that show the games content and how it plays in its current build.   Please take the time to watch some videos and consider the price point prior to purchase.\n\nIn addition, there is also the chance the developer has violated the early access agreement, and this game may be removed from the store page.","October 24, 2015","true","11.0"," 62 of 76 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","62","76","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timetravelastronaut/recommended/408990/","timetravelastronaut","TimeTravelAstronaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timetravelastronaut/","420 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhile tagged as a City Builder, Timber and Stone fits more closely into the "Stay alive as long as possible" genre, with games like Dwarf Fortress and Gnomoria. This game is attempting to kill your settlers and destroy your settlement, although the simulation isn't especially complex in its current state, so most of your failures will come from your ineptitude as an Administrator of your settlement rather than the sort of incredible disasters you may encounter in a game like Dwarf Fortress. A 3rd party mod exists to disable enemies and make the game more forgiving, but by it's nature this isn't a traditional city-builder in the vein of Simcity.\n\nDespite the fact that I've only listed cons, I've enjoyed my time with this game; I consider these to be things that may turn you off as a potential player who is used to this genre of game, but will likely improve during development.\n\nGoing with the assumption that this Early Access title continues to be improved upon, and you find the cons tolerable in the game's current state, I can reccomend purchasing this game.\n\n\nCons:\n- Many, many things are not explained in-game. You can learn much more about the game by visiting the Official Forums or the Reddit community on r/TimberAndStone.\n- Stockpile management does not exist beyond increasing your maximum capacity. Once a resource is placed in a stockpile it is available at all other stockpiles of the same type. Simply place all the relevant stockpiles next to a workshop and your Settler can craft without interruption.\n- Settlers can only perform a single job, and will not switch jobs unless you do so manually. Until you amass a larger number of Settlers this means a large amount of micromanagement switching Settlers between jobs to keep production moving forward.\n- Food production is currently very unbalanced. Livestock are incapable of breeding and produce resources at a considerably slower rate than the Farmer. Likewise, the fisherman will often wander outside the safety of your settlement  to find what he deems is an ideal fishing spot which means he also generates resources slower than the farmer. The Farmer is the only job that can reliably feed your entire settlement and generate a surplus to attract new Settlers.\n- Your Settlers have little depth. They eat only when starving, sleep only when injured, never drink, and require no shelter. A relatively safe job like the Farmer could potentially live their entire life never sleeping a wink, and never abandoning their post assuming there's always work for them to do.\n- Many Jobs have a shortage of tasks to do. As they gain experience from crafting items, some jobs (notably the blacksmith and engineer) will have nothing to do but craft low-level recipes, break the item down, and craft it again. Other jobs will have an abundance of work in the beginning, then become much less relevant as time goes on.\n- Currently the only enemies in the game are Wolves, Goblins, Skeletons, and Spiders. 2 other special types exist, but don't appear nearly as often.\n- There is no passive method of base defence currently. Even high level doors will only delay enemies briefly, and no trap system is currently implemented. One of the most effective ways to deal with attacks is to force enemies to follow a winding path to your gate while being pelted by archers.\n- Settlers will commonly let you know why they won't perform a task, but there's no feedback about what is actually causing the issue. As an example, a Builder will comment there's no Timber available for a construction job, but he won't comment that there's no carpenter in your Settlement to actually make him the timber. This means things can sit in your queue that can go unnoticed for some time.\n- It feels like steps are missing from some items in the crafting system. All settlers eat raw food, and get the same nourishment from it. Weapons and armor have no intermediate ingredients, simply various combinations of ingots and textiles. For the most part this takes away from the sense of production chains in your Settlement.","December 7, 2015","true","36.1"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","39","45","2","0"

I gave up on it for a while and then came back to give it another try once it came out on steam because I assumed it would be better than the previous version. It's not, this version just more grindy and tedious. The challenge Robert was hoping to achieve got buried under bad AI and unwinnable starting conditions. You can play the perfect game, design and build amazing fortresses with perfect vantage points for shooting and defense only to get wiped because your settler AI is so bad they don't have the sense to stay behind the castle door. There are conditions you can set to prevent this but then you have to micro manage every settler every time you're attacked. You also have to level the settlers significantly to gain access to higher tier weapons and armor. There's no way to level the blacksmith without ore, so if you haven't mined enough you're SOL. Also if you lose any higher level archers or soldiers there's no chance you'll be able to replace them before the next attack.

You get the freedom to place each block how you want it (with decent tools for creating larger buildings).  Sometimes you have to give orders to your guys one at a time, but part of the charm is the slow burn of starting with a wagon full of goods, a few settlers and getting everything set up the way you want.\n\nThe Good:\n- Nearly unlimited creativity with a great variety of resources and building materials.\n- Enough uniqueness to each villager that you are invested in their wellbeing and frustrated if they die.\n- All characters and professions are important, this isn’t just a matter of getting some max level troops and laughing as enemies break against your defenses.\n\nThe Neutral:\nThis game is tough.  Part of the fun is that it is not a pushover, but it’s worth mentioning so you know what you’re getting.  Realize that you will have some settlements wiped out as you learn how to survive.  The difficulty plus a casual pace of play means that at some point a pack of wolves or goblins will tear apart a settlement that you have really grown to like.  There will be little you can do with the frustration other than start over.\n\nThe Bad:\n- At some point you will probably get frustrated that your soldiers don’t behave like a true RTS game.  Even as you develop a large settlement, the game is still based of a group of villagers surviving and thriving in the wild, not an Age of Empires style battle of armies and the controls reflect this.\n- Surprisingly taxing on my system given the graphics level.","October 20, 2015","true","103.5"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","29","36","0","0"

I probably have around 100 hours already. Cause it was super fun.\n\nWhile the game is early access expect bugs and pathfinding problems. Selection of your people is a bit harder then other games, but hopefully you can select multiple at the same time eventually rather then just one cause fighting can get a bit tedious and frustrating.\n\nThis game is amazing with all its deep building engine and making building seem like a hard long process which building in real life is. I once made a small village and it took so long I felt like everyone mattered and every block placed on my houses felt like an accomplishment in itself. With all the skeletal and goblin bodies outside it trying to get at my villagers. The carnage was great and made me feel like my village was doing its business at keeping out invaders.\n\nWhen I lost just one member of my community I was heart broken cause thats one less villager farming, building, or making Iron tools which helps extremely. And losing someone thats good at making iron tools sucks. Or a good farmer which sucks to. The game makes your choices impact hard. And the best part is you make your own quests, decisions, choices, who gets accepted into the community. The game has lots of things you can already do. Oh and making camps and also item placing is incredible in this game. Place barrels, crates, campfires, and many things all around the place to make your own personalized areas, locations, camps. Lots of things to do.\n\nThis is just my opinion but the reason I played it this long is because there was no fog of war and bodies never disappeared unless you deleted them or gathered what was on them. Now they disappear without that which disapoints me. These two aspects of the game nailed it for me to keep on playing. As there was no annoying blanket of shadow everywhere which made the environments and your villages look amazing in pictures and just looking at it all in adventurer mode.\n\nAlthough the game itself actually used to be better with no fog of war, and no de-spawning bodies, with battles looking like battlefields. And no dark fog blanket over the world which made pictures and the land looked amazing hopefully they bring these back. Cause honestly its what made me really come back to play this game.\n\nI still recommend it but I wish they hadn't taken out two important aspects of the game out that I loved about it. If they do however bring back those two things (No fog of war and no de-spawning bodies) I'm going to be playing it again. Don't be discouraged about this review. Its personal preference with me and these two things might get added back later as options hopefully.","October 20, 2015","true","0.7"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","26","32","0","0"

I just don't understand how all these people can review a game in development this long so glowingly, when any veteran of this genre can see within a few hours of playing it is exceedingly clunky and lacking in many ways.\n\nFirst let's start with the interface.  UI is important for a game like this since so many decisions require querying a usable interface.  This interface is a throwback from more than a decade ago.  No resizable, movable windows, bizarre, clunky interface patterns, poor fonts, a lack of tooltips, and on an on.  Remove a designation?  Alt-Shift and click!  Obviously!  You will buy the game anyway, because you are a sucker for this genre like I am.  And you will say "Well, that dude was right."\n\nManagement of the AI is a lesson in frustration.  Each settler may only have one job activated at a time, and if you want to change a job on a settler, it requires a few clicks to manually change.  If you are a veteran of these genres, you certainly are wondering, "Why don't I just set the priorities for my jobs so if no orders are present for a higher priority job, I will fallback to a lower priority one?"  This doesn't exist.  One of the most fundamental concepts for this genre and it is absent.  Be prepared to be pausing and clicking until you have carpal tunnel.  You will be spending hours changing jobs on settlers as priorities shift until enough immigrants have arrived to fill your basic needs without switching them manually. At that point you will just leave your core settlers at their jobs even when they idle, because the idea of switching them manually anymore brings tears to your eyes.\n\nThere is no concept of hauling between stockpiles.  All stockpiles appear to be magical entities that transport goods across the map.  So if your farmer puts food in his nearby stockpile, someone else can grab it out of his magical stockpile four levels down immediately.  Who needs stockpile optimization in this type of game anyway?  Sigh.\n\nCombat is god awful.  Since there is not really any military organization whatsoever, when you get attacked by the three or four types of NPC groups that exist, you will need to pause, change the jobs of your settlers to soldiers / archers, and then basically micromanage them by constant moving and pausing until the fight is over.  Things get a bit better once you grow large enough, as you generally have full-time soldiers, but you will still need to micro them for battles of any size.  At that point you just draft any new immigrants into your undead army because there isn't much else for them to do.\n\nPathfinding and job fulfillment still have fundamental issues.  You will have to constantly manually path settlers so they resume what they were doing.  Want your archer to train?  Sure he will train, for a while, until he wanders off to upgrade or eat, or whatever.  After that, if he is not right next to the training dummies, he will just idle at your meeting hall.  You will need to click on him and move him back manually to his training dummies.  Get used to it - you will spend most of your game doing this in some form or another.  How does a game that has been in development for four years still have fundamental issues with the foundation on which everything else is built?\n\nThere is no point to building anything other than walls and doors.  The screenshots from the store page?  Pointless.  There are no prefab buildings and there are no game mechanics that encourage you to build them manually.  These buildings were constructed (very, very slowly and tediously), for absolutely no purpose other than a screenshot.  There is no concept of housing, or rooms, or even sleeping other than recovering from wounds.  Your settlers seem to work 24/7, they have no moods, or desires (other than food), or quirks (meaningful in this context anyway).  There are no socialization, mood, beauty, recreation, weather, seasons, temperature, or any other such mechanics expected from this genre.\n\nI played the game until day 35-40 or so, had almost every profession maxed (except for engineering, which is impossibly slow to level), had a slew of fully kitted soldiers and archers, and frankly found the game quite easy.  Any veteran of these games would find it that way.  As long as you micro combat and retreat wounded settlers, there is really no danger unless you get unlucky in the first few weeks.\n\nI have many, many games in my library, and I have never felt compelled to post a review until now.  I love this genre and wanted to love this game, but it just is not there and I'm not sure it ever will be, early access or not.  Do yourself a favor and grab Rimworld, or Gnomoria, or just re-download DF for the tenth time.  Thank me later.","November 16, 2015","false","15.4"," 54 of 82 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","54","82","2","4"

Panning is the same - not at all smooth.\n\nThere seem to be a few AI bugs; my villagers often stand around doing nothing or 'pathing' as they call it - calling out the things they can't mine amount the swathes of things they quite easily could etc.\n\nAs per the last time I tried this, you can just about get a functioning village set up - before you get over-run by a horde of wolves/goblins etc and then it's pretty much game over. I think this needs balancing. I'm not new to this sort of game, but I feel cheated when *just surviving* is pretty tough and then you're smacked down by an excession like a 6 strong pack of wolves. Villagers aren't keen on retreating to the strudy-walled 'hall' you make them build and besides, poking at attackers through the walls isn't an option so unless you somehow manage to produce a lot of archers it's going to come down to a club-vs-wolf fight of attrition.\n\nI'm still going to recommend this - BUT NOT YET. Let it get though early access and hopefully iron out the creases first then I think this will be a challenging - but fun little game.","October 24, 2015","true","23.1"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","26","33","0","0"

Don't let the graphics turn you off. Be prepared though; this game does have a bit of a steep learning curve, but is worth it! The best way to describe this game is putting Minecraft, Banished, and some other games together (build farms, build buildings, make tools/weapons, defend your settlement, build armor/weapons, get resources, etc.) You also trade with a trader than comes in; to do so you need to build roads to the edge of the map (build in all directions from your townhall); these roads also allow immigrants to join your settlement every so often. It's pretty cool that you can build buldings pretty much anyway you want provided you have the materials.\n\nYou also have to designate each type of worker; you can do this by pressing U and then assining them different tasks. The maps are HUGE if you select large; I'm amazed by how large it is. The most important thing about this game is it's a blast to play; just be prepared to learn everything as you go; it's not that difficult once you start to understand you need to assign your workers, etc.\n\nThe game will automatically pause if one or more of your workers is in range of a goblin, wolf, etc. This is a good thing.. This allows you to unpause if your think your fine, or press U and jump to the worker that is in trouble. On the top of the screen in the beginning you can click on resources, click on each resource, and build the stock level to a certain level (of course you'll need materials, but the game remembers what you set it to.).\n\nBe sure to go to options once you're in the game and change the scrolling speed when you move your mouse around; by default it's setup pretty slow, and also increase the draw distance.\n\nThis game is one of my favorites now that I'm figuring it out; keep in mind this game is more for adults whom have played other strategy games. I wouldn't recommend this for kids as it's a bit of a steep learning curve, but you can teach them as well.","October 25, 2015","true","40.5"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

I can safely say that this game is shaping up to be one of the best castle-defence games. I highly reccomend you get it at its 40% off pricepoint, If of course you take into account that it is an alpha and is unstable.\n\nMany people have compared this to Stonehearth and think its either choose one or the other. I completely disagree with that. Here's why:  Timber & Stone is a Defence and Castle building management game. It is great for having a large castle with small groups of people defending, and others creating the resources and mining/foresting, farming, even creating seige weapons such as a ballista to defend from ever - increasing hordes of monsters looking to destroy your quaint palace of death and destruction... and crops. it is also worth mentioning that getting new villagers or 'migrants' to join on this game is a bit harder, and overall you will often have less people to manage.\n\nStonehearth on the other hand is a city builder, handling large amounts of villagers to quickly create sprawling towns, with a much more relaxed feel to it in terms of combat and resource management. In other words, this game is far less punishing and challenging from this perspective.\n\nThese games are similar, but only in a few aspects. I would easily reccomend both, but if the idea of a huge castle of your exact design fending off seiges of necromancers, skeletons and goblins excites you, this is definately the game for you.\n\nMy only gripes come from it being in alpha, so the usuals apply. Go into it knowing there will be bugs! Don't judge the final game off of an early view of it!\n\nAnd remember...

It's a challenging city builder/worker management game; sort of like if Minecraft and Banished had a baby.. it would be this game.\n\nThe game is very addicting and until you are able to attract migrants to your town it is very challenging to fend off enemies while keeping your town going and growing.\n\nI love that I can design any building any way that I want out of any materials that I want and place objects anywhere in those buildings that I want. It's wonderful! I also like that I can zoom in and first person move through the town that I just built (a first person mode would be great, or POV from the workers would be cool too)\n\nI like that I can pick and choose what objects (tools, materials, weapons, etc.) I can watch or what I don't watch by adding them to the side screen. (It would be nice if you could just click on the logo of the object you are watching and bring up the "track/buy/sell" box too instead of having to scroll through the menus).\n\nWhat I would like to see though is:\n-The ability to breed domestic livestock\n-Respawning and/or the ability to grow berry bushes... it seems once you harvest all the berry bushes in the game, they don't grow back or take a very long time to do so if they do..\n-It would also be nice if the developer would create a "delete" tool or make it more user friendly for deleting stuff. I find deleting any object, wall, designated area (mining/building), military patrol routes, or roads is sort of all over the place and it would be nice to see one single tool for all of that stuff. Right now if you want to delete a road/designated area it is shift+alt+click (highlighted area) to delete.  To delete objects or objects that are designated to be built you just click on them and the option comes up to delete them. To delete a military patrol route you also click on it and you can delete the whole route or the last placed point. If I could just right click the mousekey and highlight an area for objects and all to be deleted that would be much easier.\n-An easier way to cycle through workers instead of individually clicking on them one at a time.\n\n\nAll in all I bought 3 games one day about a week ago and I've only played this one.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am updating my review to add that this game is VERY CHALLENGING. I definitey rage quit it a couple of times, but if that's what you're looking for than this is the game for you. In stating that, I would also like to see a force save option since there is only auto save and it won't help you if you're getting your butt kicked and want to go back and see what you can do differently at an earlier point in the game. It is still a great game with much potential.","November 6, 2015","true","63.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

TeoXD here to give you guys a short, but fruitful review of Timber and Stone. I have put in three years as a tester and player, if you want to descredit me that is. Now to get on to the point, "is this game worth the price? Do you reccomend it? "\n\nYes, this game is worth the price, and I reccomend it whole-heartedly. If you love rimworld, dwarf fortress, gnomoria, then I would also give you the go on buying this game because it will feel just like home.\n\n- This game is a rogue-like game that has a steep learning curve for new players. It will be challenging, and will punish you when you neglect your people. It pulls at your abiltiy to strategize, to care for your units, and make all your effort and decision meaningful. The game aims to createa story for your own settlement. You as the leader, the governor, the mayor, will decide if your story will live long, or end in a wall of flames. It is precisely becuase of this, that makes this game really interesting.\n\n- The game features:\n*Free control of constructing your base\n*Training/leveling your units through profession managament\n*Faction wars between monsters, and also against you.\n*Herding, weapons, armors, etc.\n*Bosses, trading, and more!\n\nNow, like I've said, this game has a steep learning curve, but with every mistake, you will improve, make better choices, and help your settlers survive in the hellish world they were randomly thrown into. Also, I fairly warn you, this game is created in the image Robert, the lead developer and creator, imagine it to be. This is a well-known quote around the forums from Robert:  “Deal with it, plan better, start over.” <--- This is reality encased in a game. Your choices and decision matters, and this will also include the way you fight, and survive.\n\nLike before, I highly reccomend this game, and it is worth the cost to buy. You will spend over thousands of hours playing this game, and will never notice it.\n\nHere's a screenshot of what you can do in the game (From my current project): http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=538865509\n\nHowever, I have to warn new players that it is still in developement. As a tester myself, we strive to make the game playable to before releasing it to the public. This can be agreed upon by the developer of the game. Now I digress.\n\nAlso a fair warning: This game is of yet not optimized for low-spec desktops and laptops alike. You will need a strong, or relatively new computer.","October 20, 2015","true","2.3"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

The Dev team has been dedicated, and consistently interacting with the community (on their website forum): taking feedback, adding content, polishing, squashing bugs, everything you want out of a good early access project.\n\nThe game improves in every update. Do note that updates take a while, but that's only because they're always substantial. There's a lot of content and depth to the game already, though a bit more in terms of crafting and professions would be welcome.\n\nThe only three issues I have:\n\n1) the game should have a built-in difficulty-level option. Vanilla, especially in the most recent update, it's tough. Which is great! But sometimes I just want to build, as that's a lot of fun--relaxing fun--too. My ideal case: give several options. Give an option to turn off monster spawning entirely, but allow it to be turned on later in the game (test out those defenses you've built!); give an option to have a very slow buildup; give the current difficulty level, which is tough but achievable (for a while!); give something ridiculously tough.\nNOTE: There is a mod, which can be found on their website forum, that turns off the waves of monsters so that you can build. It would just be nice to have this natively.\nDevs: consider something like Rimworld's various difficulty options.\n\n2) Once you have quite a few settlers (15+) in a big map, it starts to get sluggish, and the pathing algos stars to struggle. I don't have the newest setup, but an i7-920 + 16GB DDR3 + Radeon 280x isn't terrible. Smaller maps do a lot better. I'm sure that performance will improve as the project goes on.\n\n3) Picking the exact sort of landing site you want for your map is a pain in the butt. There NEEDS to be a search option, a-la Dwarf Fortress.\n\nBut again: highly recommended. And as I've already said twice: if you just want to build/expand, get the no-monster mod from their forum!","November 7, 2015","true","14.5"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","21","32","0","0"

I had a few technical problems with my old computer running an AMD, but since I swapped over to an I7 there has been no problem whatsoever.\n\nThe game itself has many similarities with Gnomoria, Towns, Banished and other games where you build a city/community without being able to directly control your citizens. You can however make them go to a specific point on the map, but wether he decides to fight for you or run away is up to your citizen.\n\nI have read many forum posts about how hard the game is but I disagree. The game could be even harder. In fact, after a certain point you have your guards setup on patrol routes, you produce more than you consume and your only use of merchants is to get rid of surplus items. The game is most fun before that point, when you have to struggle in order not to starve or get overrun by wolves/goblins.\n\nIn short, the game graphics are cute, the UI is ok, sound/music works very good and there seem to be very few bugs. There are some balancing issues to work out, but the game is in a very good state.\n\nIf I would wish for something it would be for a way to support save-versions of the same world. Another thing I would like to see is a setting for difficulty.","October 25, 2015","true","28.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

However, it does have a steep learning curve but once you get past that it is very enjoyable watching all your little people grow their skills. I know steam shows that I only have less than one hour of play time, but thats because I was barely given my steam key. I have put tons of hours into this game while I was doing my school. So let it run on your 2ndary monitor while your typing out your research paper and just have the game pause when enemies are seen, little people die, etc...

Unlike Dwarf Fortress you can individually direct a villager to a location instead of hoping they go there. Each villager bases it's tasks on how close they are vs some sort of priority to make it easy to speed some things along. (although an overall crafting priority/queue would be beneficial). Every villager only has one profession at a time, simplifying designations (but increases initial micro-management until you get enough villagers to properly do each job).\n\n\nI highly recommend this game as is, as it beats the previously mentioned failures out of the water already and has more to come.\n\n","October 27, 2015","true","6.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","3"

The combination of free-form castle/town building with more traditional RTS elements satifies an itch many related games can't quite scratch.\n\n\nAs of Patch 1.71, I never encountered more than a minor bug or two in ~50 hours of play. Performance was reasonable (20 to 40 FPS) on a laptop with integrated graphics (even higher on flatter maps).

It is still early access though, so I have some hope even that issue will eventually be addressed.","October 30, 2015","true","18.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I can not ignore however the issues, and judge the game as a finished game based on how long the game has been in development and the frequency of updates and the amount of content the updates includes.  To fix everything, I have issues with here based on the current development I anticipate it will take almost 3 years to never, I can faith but my money doesn't. Listed as worst to less worst of reasons why i give a bad review.\n\n*Poor Optimization\n\n-the game freezes after awhile, seems to have a memory leak, and after so many objects appear on the map it starts to freeze like clockwork every 5 seconds. I am not sure the cause of this, but this is the worst part of the game. Doubling the speed will result the freeze to half the time to every 2.5 seconds. Not sure the cause of this, restarting my computer being 8 core amd 4ghtz, 32g memory on a 760 TI nividia card didn't stop the freezing, it picked up and continuted like clockwork.  I have replicated this on a multiple games and doesn't start till after your town is somewhat established, you have a dozen peeps running around.  This alone prevents me from playing it.  As often as updates and fixes are I have no faith it will ever be fixed.  Ths is the main reason for the bad review.\n\n*Slow updates\n\n-game recieves extremely rare updates that typically are months in between, the updates themselves are minor, the last one fixed some bugs that should have been fixed a long time ago. I got this before release on steam and you have to understand it has been out already for years. Early Access is misleading.\n\n*AI\n\n-As mention above, the AI is terrible, sometimes  your workers stop working and you don't know why, one maybe cause by them getting stuck on trying to get to a block no longer accessible. Now if you don't know where this block is, it is very frustrating. Archers shooting each other while practicing. Archers suicide charge. Foragers not equiping the neccessary tools, but instead walk all the way across the map, forage berries walks back to town grabs knife walks back across the map slughters sheep...I actually avoid ever using this profession except to loot corpses, which i kinda wish was more automatic.\n\n*UI\n\n-Contruction menu is horrible, a bit clunky, disorganized, some things seem out of place. Missing hotkeys and functions listed for the game, ie holding ctrl can dezone and using arrow keys can raise and lower building levels while building, can be used to lower depth of view.  The lack of effective and clear intructions in the game sometimes made me a bit frustrated when i discovered some of them after dealing without. A ton of minor tweaks to management could improve this.\n\n*Unbalanced\n-I never felt it being balanced, without going into lengthy details, it would include monster strength/waves, economy in general, imigration, herding and mining profession.\n\nClockwork Empires is the same genre, if you haven't checked it out.","December 12, 2015","false","49.6"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","21","35","0","1"

There's quite a number of options for building too - too many to go into in a review, but think minecraft on a larger scale, at the moment they only have square blocks, but some of the basic terrain tools have triangles, slopes etc - I'm sure the other building type shapes will come into play soon.\n\nSo far they have wolves, goblins and skeletons as enemies, The skeletons are by far the worst if accompanied by a necromance, as he just raises what you kill unless you wipe him out first ... but without going into too many spolers for the game - Yes, it's well worth the price even at this early stage, and I fully recommend anyone to buy it and try it out.","November 2, 2015","true","83.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The challenge with enemies is more noticible in this game, which is great. And it is done in a passive aggressive way.  Swapping characters between jobs could be made easier with a UI feature to show all of your current settlers, but in time I'm sure that will be added.  The levels of the different jobs is very nice, and the progress of a level when swapping between jobs is not lost.  This is very useful, especially when first starting out when you do not have enough settlers to cover all jobs, or some jobs are not in high demand and the settler is idled.  Being able to change the camera angle with the mouse is much nicer than only being able to view in 4 angles.  The angling of ramps/roofing allows for some nice designing freedom when making structures.\n\nMy only complaint, so many people like to compare this game to Minecraft! Stop the insanity!  It's almost as bad as when everyone compared every MMORPG to World of Warcraft.

The updates come extremely far apart unfortunately but at the same time, this game is great but without the few mods, the end game is impossible to beat or "handle" in a manner. I own the game separate from Steam but wanted to continue to support him on steam as well ( and voice my opinion on here as well) but with the additional income from Steam I thought he would hire on help or speed up development but unfortunately neither happened.\n\nContinue reading for details of the game and a link to the Mods which help "manage" this game in my opinion for full enjoyability.\n\n\n\n\nI have been playing on and off since Kickstarter, here's the simple pros and cons:\n\nPros\n\n- In depth mechanics\n- Requires fine control over everything but not overwhelming... allows you to fine tune each structure/villager.\n- Not much of a Tutorial but if you're familiar with this genre, it'll take a few lost towns to get the hang of what to do.\n- In the game overtime, its pretty neat to watch your village evolve.\n\nCons:\n\n- Update Frequency... yes there are gaps of up to 6++ months between updates looking at the past productivity of the developer, not sure if this will change but be aware. Hotfixes are normally applied quickly though!\n- Not friendly to Noobs in this genre.\n- Sharp learning curve - meaning, you will lose your first few towns... by the way, to get more villagers, build roads from the edge of the map (N,S,E,W) to your town hall to attract more villagers (Took me a while to figure that out haha) that includes getting traders as well.\n\nMods: To control difficulty! Biggest complaint...\n\nhttp://www.timberandstonegame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=6627\n\nAdditional thoughts....\n\nDon't let the graphics fool you, this game is good and suits the game well once you start playing.\n\nIf you're still upset at Towns for dropping development, this will fill that hole in your heart. YetiChow go **** yourself.... :)\n\nSimilar games: Stonehearth, Rimworld, Towns (What it could have been) Definitely not like the Anno series, whoever says that is an idiot...\n\nMy recommendation : Get it, even with slow development, theres so much in this game already which makes the rest of "Early Access" games look like a joke.

There is no rain or coldness that would make them uncomfortable.\nThere is no positive in game effect from building a beautiful\ncastle or any of the numerous decorations like there is in games like Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria. Building anything like that is only for aesthetics, and its a resource drain and a distraction from what the game is really about. Survival!\n\nThe UI of this game has to be one of the worst ever created. The amount of clicking, button-pressing and menu-navigating necessary to do even the simplest things such as building a hammer, making your troops move to the enemy or cancel a designation is stunning and turns playing the game into a chore.\n\nYou might say that all of this is to be expected, since the game is EA. But there doesnt seem to be much -if any- development going on right now and\nthe developers seem to be extremely reclusive, none of which makes me very optimistic about the future of this game.\n\nTo be fair, despite all of these shortcomings, the game actually IS fun to play, at least for a few hours, but its certainly not worth 20 € the way it is now. There is just too much frustration and disappointment and too little hope for substantial improvement in the near future.\n\n","December 9, 2015","false","53.4"," 33 of 61 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","33","61","2","0"

You control your guys, have them craft and build and survive against enemies and starvation. Plenty of games like it, right?\n\nHowever, Timber and Stone does something wonderfully different; it does it enjoyably (something many games of this genre fail to do) but most importantly, it does it consistently.\n\nThe game is fun from beginning to end; it is insanely hard to come to grips with at first, but that challenge never quite reaches the level of frustration. As you get stronger, you start to be entranced by the desire to build the perfect castle, or town or whatever you're building, as well as fending off attacks from horrible Goblins and a myriad of Undead. When you lose your first settler... trust me, you'll feel it.\n\nThe game has been in development for a few years now, going through several iterations, but the developers have never been anything but completely transparent in their development process. We've been clued in from the start, and most of our feedback has been listened to. This is a dev team that is wholly intent on keeping their playerbase happy.\n\nTimber and Stone is both as simple as its name, yet also wonderfully complex and interesting. It's hard, it hurts you emotionally, but it's so damn rewarding to see your town grow and your settlers progress. You do require a certain self-motivation to play, as there is very, VERY little hand-holding, but you will damn well enjoy yourself.\n\nAlso, don't let my hours played fool you; I have played... just so many hours of this wonderful game, before it was released to Steam. The developers have been putting off Steam release until it was in a good enough state.","October 26, 2015","true","10.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are no scary or haunted undertones here, just bare bones sand and grit that is very punishing until you get the hang of the game.\n\nI don’t know how the community or developers feel, but I feel that this game could have easily been called ‘Towns 2’. It plays very similar to town, but with a more intuitive interface, much better graphics, and an actual way to control various jobs and individual unit movement.\n\nThe unit leveling system has received an overhaul as well, with various items not only required prerequisites, but appropriate levels in any given profession.

I will say that it is still very unbalanced. The game is incredibly fixed as in if you don’t play in a particular way, you lose. You may also find that you have to allocate all your units to farming and sitting for hours with fast forward on after getting you city wiped by random spawn's way over level. You units don’t get health as they level and you will find yourself getting killed in one or two shots by a skeleton with bows often. Or maybe it's just me and you will rock at it.\n\nThere is a lot of options for building and the building system, the path finding system and trade system are very nice but the wonderful building you see in the clips are almost unachievable to most players if you read the forums. Most players are struggling with the basic concept of food production and the randomness means hours or days of effort can instantly go to waste and is auto saved..\nIt's still early access and despite disliking the way the creatures are programmed, the mob spawn times and locations, and the wasted hours, I do still go back for more. But I would watch a let's play from at least 2015 before you buy, or you can always download one of the many many third party mods to remove mobs until you get started properly as it is a common hate for the game.\n\nThere are ways to cheat to win.

It has a lot of strategy in it and is fun to play.\n\nBUT there is also a lot to improve. The leveling of the engineer and the blacksmith is terrible. There just isnt enough work for them to level up (unless you start spamming training dummies and minecarts). Please just add a option "train while idle" and not just until level 3. I dont mind if that would take very long. Another thing that needs to be improved is that you can set in options or you guys must go running when they spot a enemy or charge. A lot of times when a bunch of skeletons comes in my farmers go charge them what results in getting them killed. Furthermore needs the tutorial way way way better. If you absolutly new to this game it takes  a lot of time until you fully unterstand all the contrtols. The last point I think needs improvement is the spawning mechanic. I think it should be like you strt with 20 points and those you can divide over different spawn things. You want copper to be frequent? 1 point. You want copper to be common? 2 point. You want to start with weatseeds? 1 point. You want medium trees? 0 points. The system how it is now results in being endless busy to find the best spot which is really frustrating. And for the developer I recommend to take a part time job so you do still have time for timber and stone. Cuz even tho I pointed a few negative things out doesnt mean it isnt a great game. I strongly recommend this game and other then this few points, I couldnt find anything bad about this game.","June 5","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes.  But with fair warning!\n\nA:  This is in early access and by no means finished.  Is it playable now?  Yes, but be prepared because there is no tutorial, no explanation of any of the mechanics, and it can be hard to learn what you are doing.     EDIT!!  In truth there is a VERY basic tutorial that simply includes tips that explain some of the mechanics when you create a new game, but you have to make sure you select it.\n\nB: The learning curve can be quite steep.  A note to all new players: Stockpiles are important.  Make sure you try to build at least the masonry and wood piles ASAP before your current ones fill up.  It is very easy to begin mining dirt and have no stone to build the stockpile with, leaving you with no space on your miner(s) for the stone they need to build the stockpile and nowhere to put it.\n\nOther than that this game is great fun.  You start out with a few settlers who are usually experienced in different things and with them you need to build a bustling town.  With the constant threat of wild animals, goblins, and skeletons attacking at night you need to balance the need for food with protection.  Hopefully after a while you can have a nicely defended castle/fort/wood hut/hole-in-the-ground/whatever you want to build, as long as you have the materials.\n\nThis game can take a while to get used to, and it will certainly take a while to build a massive town, but in my opinion it is worth it, as long as you can find a tutorial or something on Youtube or elsewhere on the internet.","October 20, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The mobs coming make no sense and having wolves chase your guy forever is stupid. They should give up after awhile. The towns folk you can not control directly other than you can tell them where to go. Once they get there, they go back to doing their job. So it is very hard to coordinate them, say for engaging enemies. And if you build a house and tell them to go in, they decide they have to go out and walk through the wolves to make tool! Give these AI some brains please.\n\nToo early for a final review, but if the God like town building - managing is your thing then this game will give you some fun. In current state I rate it 6 of 10. Hard to justify $19.99 price, but picked it up on sale for under $12 and I think it was worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crossmas/recommended/408990/","crossmas","Crossmas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crossmas/","299 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm a fan of games like Gnomoria, Terraria, Craft the World and so on, so I really enjoy playing Timber and Stone. I think you can compare it best to Gnomoria. You control your little people and let them farm, build, mine and fight to build up your own empire. It is early access so there are a few graphic bugs, which can be annoying, but they don't make the game unplayable.\n\nPros:\n+ I really like the calm soundtrack. It is no such melody which is getting annoying after you heard it several hours of gaming. :3\n+ The graphics are lovely, but I think there could be more types of roofs, walls, etc. And I would be pleased if there would be some kind of window like in every other game you can produce glas out of sand, so why not here, too?\n+ The building system is working better than I expected. For example in Gnomoria you have to build a little floor on top of a block before the gnomes can walk on it, that's why I was a little bit concered about this game, but I didn't got disappointed. In fact the building system is simple.\n+ The crafting system is also simple, because the little fellows tell you why they can't craft something :D I experienced a lot of games where they just stand there you have to guess what is wrong with them, but the little speech bubble is more than I ever wished for ;D\n\nCons:\n- The performance of the game is horrible. My CPU is a bit older, but that doesn't mean, that this game needs the whole performance of it. After a few new migrants the game is running on 20 to 30fps and sometimes it's driving me nuts. I guess it is a problem with the programming of the pathfinding, because I noticed some situations, where the little fellows where thinking abouth "pathfinding" for a few seconds(!) and the game was running really bad in these moments.\n- In my opinion the map is too small in height. In a game like this, where you need ore for nearly everything, it can not be, that you can only mine like 5 blocks under the ground.\n- The tutorial could be more "intensive". At first I was like "cool, there are little messages at the side of the screen, which tell me what to do", but I had to realise quickly that some information is missing and then you don't know, what to do next. Which brings me to my next point. For example when you press "U" there is a list of all your fellows and you can easily switch between their jobs.\n- A sandbox mode is missing. In my opinion in a game like this, it is very important to have a sandbox mode, where you can learn the game without getting run over by enemies after a few (ingame) days. It took me like 5 games until I knew what I have to do and now I'm not dying anymore. But for beginners this can be very frustrating and takes the fun out of the game.\n- I quickly reached the point where I unlocked all the skills for making the weapons, armor and other craftings and the game was only like getting new migrants and making my empire bigger. This was the point where the game got a little bit boring.\n- There is something like a skill map missing, where you can see which job can do which craftings at every level. It can be very frustrating when you have to search for the unlocked craftings everytime. Also you don't find out what the benefit is from having a level 20 farmer or builder.\n- And then there are the graphic bugs, but this is no big deal. It is only the light which isn't getting displayed correctly.\n\nAlthough I think the cons are massive, the game is really fun to play, when you are into game types like this. Don't get mislead by all the negative points which I listed before. The beginning can be hard, but if you take the time you get into the gameplay and so it can be an enjoyable gametime.","December 6, 2015","true","36.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Things do ramp up the further you go in the game, but I do believe it is based on your number of settlers.\n\nYou start with 8 Settlers and grow from there, which in turn increases the risk you have of being attacked by more numbers of NPCs which will be discouraging at first but when you start to adapt and strategize your attacks when neccessary it is a fine balance the way it currently is.\n\nTL:DR - Buy it.","November 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is quite playable at the moment, but at the moment, the game can get quite difficult as the game is largely combat based, but combat/unit controls are quite clunky ast the moment.\n\nStill great fun and quite a bit of freedom to do what you like, as long as you are willing to deal with some quirks here and there. If you are into this kind of games, buy it now. If you are interested, I recommend you follow the game and see what sort of path this game takes. The devs have been relatively quiet on Steam, and even their updates on their website seem sporadic at best so, wait to purchase if you are not sure right now.\n\n7/10 at the moment.","November 15, 2015","true","17.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So far i've seen 4 major problem:\n\n1-) Lack of Content\n\nWhich i hope updates will bring new contents. But i just hope.\n\n2-) Imbalanced Monsters\n\nWell maybe this is the only thing that makes this game a challenging one. But just for early levels. So instead of putting huge raids, producers must put different kind of challanges. Not only a military ones.\n\n3-) Morale of Settlers\n\nI've never witnessed that one becomes a problem (which is a problem). They dont feel cold, bored, stressed. As far as i know they only get hungry when you lack of food and get scared when fighting against monsters. They dont need to sleep unless they are injured.\n\n4-) Defensive Construction\n\nBuilding is kinda slow in this game. I dont think that is a problem but when you build a wall for example, to protect your village; you must put a door on that wall aswell. And it must be atleast a braced door to make defenses strong. In early phase of game, finding and processing minerals are hard to manage. Therefore building a braced door requires an effort. But when a little goblin come and destroy your braced door in a matter of seconds, that is truely annoying.","December 14, 2015","true","92.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Specifically. there is no first person mode and you cannot travel to other lands to adventure away from your home town.\n\nWith development halted with minimal word from developers, those features may never return, in addition, several persistant crashes will likely never be fixed if development does not resume.\nwhich is dissapointing because this game had heaps of promise.\n\nStill, its worth it if you like town building. especially the minecraft elements where you can dig tunnels and build things using blocks.","February 27","true","65.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

So devs, know you have lost a very devoted follower for this game, and know that you will not get my money for any more games. I sadly have to say this game will never be pulled out of the hole that is sometimes early access.","March 16","false","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

It\'s not entirely cool to release on steam knowing that if it doesn\'t go well then that\'s the end of it, which appears to be the situation here.  Release on steam a few months later stop working on it.  Kind of a shame as it is a fantastic concept and has massive potential.\n\nThis serves as another reminder to be careful when buying early access, I\'m not all that aggreived as it is still enjoyable but it does need work that is never going to happen at this point.  The rights holder really should release the rights to the developers who were woring on it for free then they could try and make it the game it deserves to be rather than some abandonware!  Oh well.  That\'s that.\n\nI really do hope this game comes back to life though, it is a cracking game that just needs to be finished!","June 1","false","35.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deterbeest/recommended/408990/","deterbeest","Deterbeest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deterbeest/","56 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review used to be a recommendation, with words of caution added later on. It's been a while since then, and I feel I have to change this review to "not recommended", if only to balance out the people who recommend it after a couple of hours of play. Don't get me wrong: discovering how the game works is fun, but after that it just falls flat and the grinding quickly becomes unbearable (to me at least). If you're the type of gamer that goes "well I got 20 hrs of play out of a €10,- game, so excellent value", you might still want to buy this. But with games like these, I'm looking for an interesting sandbox experience with a lot of replayability, and that's just not the case yet with Timber & Stone.\nSince the release on Steam, the devs have fallen almost completely silent, and everything points to development being halted indefinitely. Player complaints (either about the game itself or the lack of communication) are ignored (except by a few diehard fans who attack people for being critical) and that's basically two of the biggest sins for an "early access" title.\n\nSo. Unless you don't mind "wasting" a bit of money for a couple of hours of fun (and aftert that, likely disappointment), avoid this title in favor of early access builders that DO have an active developer behind it.\n\n(1.7 Steam release review)\n\nMy most recent settlement, called "False New Hope" (it seemed appropriate after the first few settlements I started got wiped before I even managed to build a decent town hall), fell to a horde of goblins that almost thanked me for building so many nice gates to smash through. Next time, I'm building a citadel with just one gate, and it will be heavily defended.\n\nIf you like games that mercilessly ramp up the difficulty with every small accomplishment you make, that require you to plan ahead for threats you don't even know about yet, that give you quite a lot of options to do so but don't hold your hand at any time, Timber & Stone is for you.\n\nAt this point, the interface is still quite clunky and unintuitive (well, to me at least) and there seem to be some balancing issues that could lead to frustration. Be prepared to do a lot of reading up to get started properly. On the plus side, the forums and developers seem to be very active, so I'm sure things will improve in the future. The devs also seem to have plenty more new features up their sleeve, so I don't expect to get bored with this anytime soon.\n\nJust be careful that your archers don't shoot their friends.\n\nEDIT: after more playing, and following the forums for a bit, I feel like I need to update this review:\n\n- development actually seems to be halted now, with very little communication from the developers on the forums, except for vague and slightly defensive posts indicating it's "temporary". No plans for the future have been announced since releasing the game on Steam, aside from a few remarks on feature requests (either to dismiss them, or to confirm that they're planned, whatever that means when nothing seems to be happening development-wise)\n- once you figure out the mechanics and get a handle on the clunky controls, the game isn't very deep yet. A few tech levels and a handful of enemies that become increasingly numerous and a bit tougher as your settlement grows and becomes richer/more advanced\n- I spent a good amount of time on it, while having fun, but a lot of it was getting to grips with the game's weirdness and grindyness ("teching up" is largely dependend on finding enough appropriate ores or repeatedly building the same objects over and over again)\n- now that it looks like I won't be encountering fresh challenges, my urge to play is largely absent because of poor controls (both for building and for managing large numbers of settlers/soldiers), low fps and general annoyances (i.e. archers shooting their infantry buddies half the time, having to manually click individual enemies to target them and then again to loot their corpses)\n- judging by the people running "old" settlements with intricate, large builds and big populations, some gamers will obviously still find it worth their time despite the aforementioned shortcomings. I guess it depends on how much time you're willing to spend, whether you're a hardcore builder or not, etc.\n- in short: this game will probably still entertain you for a few good days if you're into survival/crafting/base building, but there's a good chance it'll start to disappoint further down the line, with little in the way of a development plan (even one without specific promises and deadlines) to keep you interested","October 29, 2015","false","48.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

People are dying from Necromancers, wolves hunts in packs, and the random goblin tribe?\n\nGit gud scrub.\n\nIt's not hard to build moats and castle walls then have your archers have a kill zone. At most, I just lose doors. Or if your still too casual for that, grab a mod. There's mods out there that lets your people be invulnerable or lets you change the doors health.\n\nGame is great as a "build your town" game. Can get maximum comfy with it. You could say it's simialr to Dwarf Fortress if you ever played it.\n\nAlthough, there's a problem with the game that it takes a while to get anywhere as, when you just start, you get a small amount of settlers and only until you're swimming in food and resources do other towns folk start joining your settlement.\n\nResources can be plentiful. It's not random. You pick and choose the land you start on and see whether it has enough animals/trees/ores/etc. in it. You just have to be smart on where you build your town, or whether you have a basic 3 blocks high wall to keep the monsters out and whether you were smart enough to have a kill zone for your archers and had EVERYONE carry a weapon and actually acted like a militia. Seriously. The game isn't hard, BUT it WILL kick your ♥♥♥♥ in if your not planning ahead, which, again, isn't hard since the AI's only function is to go at you.","January 14","true","38.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Generally, it is a relaxing game where you slowly get to buildup your town and people.  Now and then you'll get hit with a wave of enemies and you'll need to jump in to switch your townsfolk to military roles which added some excitement now and then.  I'm sad that it looks like it isn't getting developed further.  There are some micromanagement aspects that I think they would have been able to smooth out.  And I think the developers had some ideas that would have made it even better.  But, with that said, for the amount of money I put into it, and for the hours of play I received from that, it was worth the purchase.

The dev has never once updated or communicated since it was released on steam and now the website is offline - seems abandoned, another EA fail.\n\nHowever! The rest of my original review is below and it still holds true. The game is great as it is, but it will likely not get any more updates, so I HAVE to thumbs down in good concience.\n\nI have somewhere between 200-3oo hours into T&S over the last few months, and i really do love to play the game. It's one of those games I should set an alarm because 5 hours can go by and i will not even notice until I am parched and my stomach is growling.\n\nCurrently it is very playable and stable. The systems are all there and work quite well, as an EA game, it's in great shape technically and gameplay-wise.\n\nMod friendly - install mods if you want no enemies, kill enemies, permanent daylight, you name it. Copy a .dll to your save folder and that's it to install mods.\n\nSo you juggle professions, resources, defences, weapons, walls, increasingly dangerous hostiles in the wild who want to slaughter you all. A trader comes by now and then randomly, and depending on a bunch of factors (food, wealth etc) a new migrant may show up and join the town if you let them.\n\nSettlers have random traits both good and bad (strong back, bad vision, etc) that make them a little better for certain jobs. You mine, farm, craft, build structures and walls, herd animals, all while keeping a sharp eye on the surroundings\n\nProtip: Game start; make sure your miners mine stone very first thing, not dirt. Make the Stonemason build pick axes very first thing. reason is the picks will break randomly, and if you haven't got more, you're screwed somewhat. Get stone, make several picks, then make stone tools or storage or whatever you want.\n\nPros:\n-Planning is key\n-Massive replayablility & restarting is fun to try new ideas.\n-Surviving a nasty Necromancer attack is a great feeling!\n-Soundtrack is beautiful; sounds of chopping, hoeing, digging, combat etc all sound great.\n-How each game plays out is really up to the player. Fortify and turtle? Go underground for a network of caves? Build in the sky? You can go nuts with creativity, check screenshots tab above!\n-Each game you can do a little better as you fail, adapt and try again with what you learn, it's great.\n-There is a definite learning curve, some people like this (I do)\n\nCons:\n-Still needs optimization, late game the fps can suffer with many settlers\n-Occasional bugs here and there that may require a reload, but nothing major/gamebreaking type.\n-There is a definite learning curve, some people like this (I do), but the learning curve is a part of the game, you learn and do better next time.\n-An entire day can disappear while you play (yep one of those games that can eat a whole Saturday no problem ;)","October 20, 2015","false","97.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But this is not the (main) reason why I give my positive / negative recommendation (I will come back to this review and change that if necessary and also edit / add to my written part, as new editions come out).\n\nI'll post what I found out (and my own thoughts, but based on facts) as bullet points next, take them as positive or negative, that's up to everyone's taste (at least to some part).\n\nFirst off, some general info:\n\nThis game project has originally started as a Kickstarter (Sep 26 2012 - Oct 26 2012) - 3,368 backers pledged $88,577\nof $50,000 goal.\n\nThis is a one-person project ("Robert"), who says (on the Kickstarter "about the creator" page) that he is a self-taught artist / programmer with no formal education in those areas.\n\nThe screenshots of the game on the Kickstarter page show very blocky graphics (trees and terrain) - this has improved drastically since then, overall I like the graphics very much (although I have all settings on their highest levels with so far no major performance issues, and that running on three monitors AKA triple-head - however, I have a high-end gaming system - latest Intel CPU, 32 GB RAM, ROG mobo and a GTX Titan X).\n\nThe dev's stance is to not post any timeline of milestones and in general is vague / unsure when and what new features will be implemented.\n\nThe dev's overall stance is that the project / game will never be finished as such, which means that either he'll continue working on it for as long as his health allows him to, or that he will just stop working on it whenever he feels like it - this was supposedly a commend he made, plus "Robert"'s signature slogan on the forum is "Art is never finished, only abandoned. -Leonardo da Vinci".\n\nWhich by itself is not necessarily something that should raise concern, however it took six (6) months for the latest update (v1.7), despite that the majority has requested in a poll made mid-2013 to receive updates every two to three weeks.\n\nThere's an outdated "dev roadmap" from Aug this year (2015) posted on the website's forum (again, not on Steam, as the dev, "Robert", refuses to interact with "the Steam community" / to post on Steam) for up to v1.7 (the current release). The last post from someone was made in mid-October asking for what's next and when, with no response almost a month later.\n\nPosting on the forum at timberandstonegame.com requires creating an account, which requires email verification that is sent to the email address entered during registration - I, for my part, never received that email. Trying to log in only displays that I need to contact the forum administrator, but no link / email address is displayed and as a result I can not do.\n\nAs a result, reading posts is possible without log-in to an active account on the site's forum, but posting there is not possible.\n\nGame mechanics related:\n\nHowever, blocks and "float" and as such, there is no physics (at least no gravity) in the game - all moving objects (creatures) are bound to the ground (or swim in water), but trees, if dug underneath, can "float", AKA "minecraft experience".\n\nFrom what I could gather, the "end game" mechanics have changed from version to version (at least from the previous 1.6 to this latest one, 1.7) - right now, and this seems to be the stance of the dev "Robert", is that, due to more and more enemies and stronger ones spawn as in-game time passes, eventually all your virtual people in the game will get killed and you will have to start all over again.\n\nI have read that there is a mod out that can change that (or at least it has difficulty settings), but AFAIK that mod is not maintained by the dev and as such might not work anymore when a newer version of the game is released and if the mod dev ceases to update the mod to keep it working with newer versions of the game.\n\nThe path-finding is quite good, and you can have events displayed to various degrees that you can define, also you can have the thoughts / responses  of your virtual displayed, to help you understand and react to if something doesn't work or if there's something you need to change, according to a situation.\n\nYou select what every few of the virtual person should focus on (their profession) but you don't have to (but you can, to a certain level but it works well) what every single one should actually be doing at any given point in time. Yet even though, you have to switch around professions quite often, to satisfy supply and demand of resources and tools required. Which in the end does result in quite a bit of micro-management (note: the dev stated that the professions will be replaced with a skills system, to reduce / eliminate micro-management - which was supposed to have happened already in this current version, 1.7).\n\nYou can manually set a location for a virtual person to move to and then, if set correctly / accordingly, will perform its actions there (they perform actions as per their set profession and closest to their current location). That way you have quite a high amount of control, if needed, to prioritize where work should be performed.\n\nThere is a few things here and there, but this is overall what the game is about.\n\nVerdict:\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a game where you can temporarily build a virtual civilization and design somewhat interesting structures via A LOT OF micro-managing, no physics (AKA floating in mid-air of trees and other resources) and time-pressure due to getting attacked in steady intervals and by increasingly stronger opponents (some have complained that they get too strong too soon, AKA the game has a too high of a difficulty level - but again, there's currently a working mod for that) to the point of where they will overwhelm and extinguish your virtual civilization and you then have to start all over again - then this is the game for you.\n\nSo basically, if you don't mind restarting over again after a few hours (but that is dependent on how long you pause the game) and overall a fairly steep difficulty (at least without mod) then this is a game for you. If you look for something where you don't have to do that, then this is not the game for you.\n\nHowever, if you want to focus on designing block-by-block and manually building interesting virtual structures and keep those as long as you wish, but you lack the ability to build a virtual civilization and as such you are doing all the work yourself, in first-person - and, AFAIK, no physics (AKA floating trees and parts of trees and terrain) - then you're better off with something like Minecraft. Or "7 Days to Die" (which has physics but that can be buggy, yet so far not game-breaking and still gives hours and hours of fun).\n\nSo my recommendation (or lack of it) is based on all of the above - again, this might change from version-to-version.","November 9, 2015","false","29.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

It turns out you leave off in the lands of Timber and Stone. I've tried other city builders (I'm looking at you Dwarf Fortress) and while I found them fun they lacked direction (and what exactly is ,,@''' mean?), T&S so far has added direction, an easy learning curve that ramps up to harder things (four hours in my first village was wiped by a pack of wolves, next round definitely need to skip heavier duty walls and just get anything up).\n\nI'm only 4 hours into playing this, but so far have enjoyed it emensily (so much so that I bothered for the first time to write a review).\n\n*** 64 Hour Update, Problems, so many problems ***\n\nCombat AI has to get fixed to maintain a recommendation. Once you're day 40+ in the game can quickly grind to a hault. Sure you loose a few people, it happens, it sucks, but try recovering....\n\nHere's the problem:\n\n1) Your troop AI is stupid, for lots of reasons mentioned. Let alone non-combat townfolk who appear to be suicidal. So they easily get slaughtered.\n\n2) You can't keep your troops together, so they easily get slaughtered.\n\n3) You can't put them on a specific patrol route, to try to keep them together, so they easily get slaughtered.\n\n4) You can't escort new villagers who come into the area, so they get slaughtered. And now you can't rebuild your population.\n\n5) You can't escort traders, so they get slaughtered. And now your economy crumbles.\n\nEssentially, because the combat AI is so poor the game hits a total roadblock. I managed to get up to 12 townfolk. Learned that you need an army, built it up, trained it (5 guys, nice armor, all lvl 11+ infrantry), and because of all the above randomness dropped down to 2.\n\nThankfully my core tradesman are safe inside the walls, but with only two guards left they'll only be that way until the next necromancer comes to town since I can no longer get citizens to come my town safely.\n\nIn short, the game is lots of fun at first, then you're toast unless you enjoy micro-micro-micro managing (e.g. pause the game, set your troop movement for a few tiles, play, pause, rinse-repeat).","December 29, 2015","false","64.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

About 2 years ago the game was a very challenging and slow paced RTS. I'm glad to say the game has changed from that for the better, while sticking to its roots. At its core the game is still a Survival RTS (though RTS is debatable due to the much appreciated inclusion of time control) Your party of units can all cycle through every different class, which is something that's very nice. It's still very challenging, but not player hostile. From day 1 you begin encountering easy to kill mobs, Wolves, Goblins, Skeletons, things of that sort. Learning how the combat works is something extremely important, otherwise you will fail very early. To get through the earlygame you will need 3 main things, a source of food (Farmers, Fishers, Herders, and Foragers on larger maps) an income of construction resources (Wood, stone, ores) and an understanding of preplanning. More or less you'll spend your first few ingame days digging, obtaining food, and building 1 main shelter, the location of which will be very important. You need to keep all of your units alive until you get a road setup, when you'll start getting travelers to join your party. This point is where the midgame starts. You get more and more settlers, and start expanding your settlement. Mobs spawn rates will become much higher as the game goes on, and until you get to the very lategame when you practically have armies of units, it's not worth the loss in productivity to kill off the mobs. It still has a rather steep learning curve, but the ingame tutorials will teach you everything you need to know (something very welcome in an RTS) and it's rather encouraging of trial and error. One of my few complaints is that the game is slow paced by design, which makes earlygame very tedious as you have typically 1 miner, 2 foodgatherers, 1 lumberjack, and 3 units rotating between Blacksmith/Stone Mason/Carpenter/Builder/Engineer.","November 19, 2015","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a post, not a tweet, nothing to even indicate that the devs are still alive.\n\nBecause of this, I must change my review to reflect the game as it is right now and not as it potentially could be.\n\nRight now, it is worth $4.99 so if you see it on sale for less than 5 dollars, get it and enjoy it for about 3 days before you are done with it.

It turns out you leave off in the lands of Timber and Stone. I've tried other city builders (I'm looking at you Dwarf Fortress) and while I found them fun they lacked direction (and what exactly is ,,@''' mean?), T&S so far has added direction, an easy learning curve that ramps up to harder things (four hours in my first village was wiped by a pack of wolves, next round definitely need to skip heavier duty walls and just get anything up).\n\nI'm only 4 hours into playing this, but so far have enjoyed it emensily (so much so that I bothered for the first time to write a review).\n\n*** 64 Hour Update, Problems, so many problems ***\n\nCombat AI has to get fixed to maintain a recommendation. Once you're day 40+ in the game can quickly grind to a hault. Sure you loose a few people, it happens, it sucks, but try recovering....\n\nHere's the problem:\n\n1) Your troop AI is stupid, for lots of reasons mentioned.

So they easily get slaughtered.\n\n2) You can't keep your troops together, so they easily get slaughtered.\n\n3) You can't put them on a specific patrol route, to try to keep them together, so they easily get slaughtered.\n\n4) You can't escort new villagers who come into the area, so they get slaughtered. And now you can't rebuild your population.\n\n5) You can't escort traders, so they get slaughtered. And now your economy crumbles.\n\nEssentially, because the combat AI is so poor the game hits a total roadblock. I managed to get up to 12 townfolk. Learned that you need an army, built it up, trained it (5 guys, nice armor, all lvl 11+ infrantry), and because of all the above randomness dropped down to 2.\n\nThankfully my core tradesman are safe inside the walls, but with only two guards left they'll only be that way until the next necromancer comes to town since I can no longer get citizens to come my town safely.\n\nIn short, the game is lots of fun at first, then you're toast unless you enjoy micro-micro-micro managing (e.g. pause the game, set your troop movement for a few tiles, play, pause, rinse-repeat).","December 29, 2015","false","64.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is the game abandoned? I hope not but it does appear that way, but with that said I still think the game is worth every 12 dollars that is being asked. For me I had no major issues and everything that was promised as far as I am concerned was delivered on. Would I like to see more done? Of Corse I would, but all the negative reviews and accusations folks made in the post are completely unfounded. The game starts, it runs with no crashes (for me at list), and I put in 17 hours over 2 -3 days of playing it on steam. I gotten less time from so called tipple A titles which cost a lot more than 12 dollars. What the game delivers and delivers is well is a sandbox experience to build your own community from scratch. I have not experience this level of freedom ever before in my games and I played a great deal of the. I did play populist, and dungeon keeper titles, and many more but none have come this close to giving you ultimate freedom. The only “bug” I did run in to is the lack of villagers. I have a game on day 43 and not a single villager has joined me yet. Now here is a work around for this I found that seems to work. It appears villagers will not join till you lose one character at list. Once one of your villagers die and you get the replacement your population will start to grow as intended after that. Not sure if this works for others or not but it seems to be a solution in my case.","April 19","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
