As leader of the remnants of humanity, you make an FTL jump across space to a new sector, then hold off attacks as you recharge your engine for 5 (real-time) minutes. Repeat many times.\n\nThe controls are numerous but intuitive, although moving around the battlefield and switching camera modes can leave you stranded awkwardly at times, unsure what's happening. Deploying ships is straightforward, using Homeworld-style control where you click once to move ships horizontally, then optionally hold shift to change height.\n\nGameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50x2fOvNXlY\n\nThere are a few different kinds of combat scenarios to encounter - simple ambushes where you need to defend your main ship from attackers, guarded resources where to do any serious resource collection you'll have to take on a fleet defending them, one where you convince a neutral fleet to join yours by helping them defeat their enemy, etc. Each require slightly different tactics. There are occasional trade encounters too.\n\nThe randomness of the type of encounter you'll get after every jump is essential to the game, so you can do FTL-style runs and never quite know what's going to happen. But the game definitely needs more (galaxy) maps, at the moment there's only one with limited choice of route. And there's no huge reason to veer off the shortest path as yet.\n\nAs it stands (July 2015) this is a solid, enjoyable proof of concept that begs for more content - more maps, more types of encounter and more fightin' ship types to add tactical depth.","July 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","35","39","0","0"

As many have pointed out its a cross between Homeworld and FTL.\n\nThings that will really make this game shine is fleshing out the ships better. While you have many to build most feel .. lacking and without a uniqueness. In the end it becomes just a build quick and toss em at the enemy styled game. Much similiar to the tank rush tactics of the Command and Conquer Series.\n\nThe individual systems end up being repetitive. Within a few battles as you jump around the map you can tell upon landing what scenario it chose for you. The Randomness is also missing in these scenarios. You wind up ahead of time knowing where the enemy will jump into and having pilots and caps positioned at each point and waiting.\n\nI have yet to see third unlockable fleet, But the second fleet "The Lost fleet" was deffinately better looking then your starting nomad fleet. The only downsides I was never able to get the siege canon to fire... no matter what, I was always out of range.\n\nThe Technologies to unlock and research in the unlocked fleet are the Technologies you used to find it. I found that extremely dissapointing. I felt if you are piloting this cutting edge battle group that researching older technologies is counter productive.\n\nThe Controls need some TLC. bringing in existing models from homeworld, Sins, Anno and other RTS games would be a vast improvement. The 3D grid combat is great, but fine tuning and restyling the way its done would be an amazing improvement alone for the game.\n\nThe game overall so far is fun to play, Its nothing story wise that will have you grinding hours to unlock each part. But the missions are quick enough that you can sit down and run a few before work. With more time put into fleshing out the games scenarios, randomizing the spawn points of reinforcement waves better and expanding/improving technology trees this game can bloom easily into a good Space RTS competitor against the AAA's.\n\nAs the Developer is working alone on this, it is amazing in itself. If the comunity does get involved and assist its collective knowledge or even skills, this will be an amazing product. I would open the game up for modding and tweaking by the community. Opening up the vast tools and skills of its playerbase can push the game to new bounderies as experienced moders and coders start adding its collective weight in mods. Perfect Example is Kotor being redone in Unreal 4 engine or the Open X-Com series (all 3 being done) project. Developing a game alone is daunting but if you get your current fanbase involved it might lighten the load with the simple payment of knowing they were involved helping expand what they got hooked into.","February 20","true","20.2"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","0"

It lacks the polish you would expect from a finished game.\n\nCamera controls are god awful.\n- Panning is extremely slow.  Going from one side of the map to another is an exercise in frustration.  And it doesn't help that the enemies can pop up miles away.  Your best best is to just wait for them to come to you.  After reading the forums, it looks like holding [shift] will accelerate the camera's movements.  I think it could be a bit faster, but its useable.  Now if only the functionality was flipped since it's a bit awkward on the fingers.\n- Your camera is fixed at a specified height above the plane.  Which makes things frustrating when you're trying to zoom in and out for a better look.  Either to get a closer look at a unit or to zoom out so that you can see what's going on around the operational area.  Found out on the forums that you can use the C and V keys to adjust the camera height.\n- In order to zoom in on a ship, you need to have it focused.  Otherwise your zoom is limited to "really far" and "far" in strategic view or "isn't space pretty" in normal view.\n\n== You're forced to use certain views to perform certain tasks ==\n- The normal view tells you absolutely nothing about the positions of ships and their heights.  Which sucks because this is how you're able to actually zoom in closer.  So without this information, you can't finely manuever the resource corvette to the nearest asteroid so that your resource harvesters would only need to travel mere meters to deposit their inventory.\n- The strategic view doesn't let you click on the enemy.  So you generally don't know how much health it has, or what it even is until you flip to the normal view.  Then you're able to select it, and then mouse over the icon to view the tooltip.\n\n== What the hell? ==\n- Why isn't there a position indicator for the salvageable stuff?  Whenever I try to send resource corvettes closer to the harvesters, they tend to dive down and run far away from the nearest asteroids and derelicts because I can't get a good view angle.  (A recent patch has added this feature.  This point is now moot)\n\n- When you have units selected, they blink in and out.  When you have a ton of units, it's hard to tell what's selected since everything else is blinking to notify you of events like attacking targets and all that.  Couldn't unit selection have a different color?\n\n- It's like there isn't a select all of one unit type command.  I try double-clicking a specific unit.  Nope, it selects that one unit.  To get this to work, you have to select everything.  Then scroll through the list until you find the one type of unit that you want.  Waste of time and forces you to keep your groups up to date.\n\n- The icons are too small and they rely on tooltips to tell you what ship is what.  At one point I just stopped scrolling through the list of selected ships and just looked for the unit with the 8 sided enclosement box.  That was usually the dreadnought and that was all that I needed.   As a sidenote, there is a setting in the options box to scale up the UI, so you can get larger icons.  Useful for a higher resolution I guess.\n\n- I can't select enemy fighters.  It would help if I can tell how much hp they have left so that I can figure out which ships are effective against them.\n\n- The AI is...stupid.  It generally just rushes.   No real strategy whatsoever.  Once I researched the upgrade to perform a localized jump, I just sent a dreadnought behind the enemy capital ships.  One or two just-launched fighters would usually flip back around to intercept, but everything else continued forward.  Easy way to blow up the spawning ship and save myself the hassle of fighting hundreds of snubfighters.\n\n- Why is nearly every jump point a battle?  Some allow me to bribe or trade, but aside from that everything else has me fighting waves of incoming hostiles.  In one game, I had to fight through 10 warp points in a row before deciding that I had had enough and beelined for a known trade point.\n\n- Why doesn't the jump point ever seem to change?  I landed on an asteroid square.  Mined everything.  Jumped out, then jumped back in.  More stuff to mine.  It was a really easy way to rack up the credits.  By jumping in and out and dealing with the interfering ships, I soon had enough money for all of the upgrades after repeating this like 10 times.\n\n- Limited tech tree?  I kind of wish the larger ships had more upgrades besides strategic jump.  Better weapons and the like.  Only the fighters get this upgrade.\n\n- Poor unit info.  It's limited to a question mark and a general description.  For these types of games, you would have a far more detailed entry with speeds / weapon damage / strengths and weaknesses plus a description for immersive purposes.  At one point I had experimental dreadnoughts.  Was there something special about them?  I don't know, there wasn't even a question mark and a general description for it.  Nevermind obtaining detailed info.\n\nThat said, the game has potential...maybe...depends on how much support the developer is going to lend to it now that it's been released in an unfinished state.","April 20","false","7.1"," 47 of 61 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","47","61","0","0"

I bought it at a discount, and would suggest that if the high concepts of the game sound interesting that you do the same.\n\nThis is a game developed by one guy as his first attempt. Is it a game for the ages? No. Is it a game with an interesting concept? For me, it is. I like the mashup of the concept of Homeworld with FTL style random missions. That's an interesting amalgamation of concepts from my point of view. I'd love it if Mission 8 in HW isn't always going to be the Cathedral of Kadesh. Maybe, like in FTL, it's just some traders, maybe it's an overwhelming fleet of implacable foes that you have to make a fight or flight decision about. Who knows? Not knowing is the cool bit. The Nomad Fleet dev felt the same way and made a game based around that. And I applaud him for it.\n\nIs it as awesome as either Homeworld and FTL in its final presentation? Not for me. In both the technical and aesthetic departments I find it falls short. But should it be? Could it be, given the hoops that one person would have to jump through to make it happen? Well that's up to you. I have to say I can't see how one person could have done it all though. I will say I’m not going to hold one person to the standards of the combined works of the teams he drew from just to mark it… uh, Facebook “thumbs down” or whatever. I’m not buying into that Cluster B binary thing.\n\nAgain, this is one guy who wanted to mash together two games, one of which was done by a full-fledged game dev apparatus, with a programming department, an art dev department, with sub departments consisting of 3d, music, Voice, Texturing, Backgrounds and the like, (not to mention Admin, PR, legal and, of course, Management.) FTL was done, albeit by an "Indy" team, but it was just that, a TEAM. And it was a 2D game.\n\nGiven that this was made by one guy I thought it was amazing that he had the balls to do a concept of a HW/FTL mash-up and take on ALL the work (or buy the assets on a budget) to make it happen like it did. That's the type of crazy I applaud, and that’s why I give it a thumbs up.\n\nThere are *gasp* bugs and such. None of them were "show stoppers" for me. Still, I would watch to see if the developer Is going to patch the game now that it has been fully released.","April 23","true","6.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","1"

Most of the time you don't know what you're getting yourself into when you enter a sector. Sometimes you find a nice little debris field. After you wipe out a few enemies, you can sit back and relax with a nice cup of tea as your harvesters gather up the resources.\n\nOther times you're sitting on the edge of your seat counting down every second 'til the hyperdrive charges up, so you can haul your butt out of there. Meanwhile, you fend off the hordes of encroaching foes as best as you can, cringing with each lost ship.\n\nEarly on in the game, you enter each sector with a bit of trepidation. You're low on resources, low on tech, low on ships... and sometimes you find yourself facing insurmountable odds, and you'll have to cut and run. But as you build up your fleet, you have the potential to become a force to be reckoned with. It's a pretty good feeling when you return to beat the snot out of a sector that sent you packing earlier on. You can build your fleet into an unstoppable war machine and crush foes with overwhelming might, or emphasize a strategic conservation of force and defeat your foes with sound tactics like approaching from blindspots and utilizing each vessel's inherent strengths.\n\nMake sure you're prepared for the final battle. Even with the most massive fleet and sound tactics, it can push you to your limits.\n\nThe game isn't linear. You can return to any sector as often as you want. Resources and enemies respawn, but the type of encounter and class of enemy vessels varies when you reenter most tiles. The game autosaves every time you jump out of a system, and you have the option of saving between sectors as well. You can easily pick up where you left off - making this a great game to play on busy days when you only have 10-15 minutes here and there. There are three play speeds - normal, 2x speed, and 4x speed.\n\nGameplay\nStraight forward tactics in real time - you consider the best combination of ship types and number to intercept hostile contigents. At a distance, they're designated with geometric symbols - triangles for fighter class ships, squares for corvettes... pentagons for frigates, octagons for dreadnoughts... There are destroyers, battleships, carriers, heavy carriers, and a variety of corvettes and frigates - all sorts of ships in this game - each with its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nControls\nThere's always a bit of a learning curve when it comes to mastering the controls of tactical games like this. If you're familiar with the genre, you'll pick it up fairly quickly. WASD, C&V to move the camera about; mouse buttons to change the viewing angle or direction and to select and direct ships. At times you have to make adjustments for the third dimension when directing ships. This may seem tricky at first, but it's actually quite simple. There's a real time tactical map which is very useful. You can enter and exit it easily. You can zoom in on groups and individuals to see what they're up to, and to take a front row seat as the action unfolds.\n\nMiscellany\n- The enemy isn't particularly clever - usually just bears down on you, but some of the vessels it sends at you are no less of a threat despite their lack of tactics. I've lost valuable ships, even my mothership on more than one occasion.\n\n- It can be easy to get confused with the number of different kinds of specialized ships in each class when they're bunched up since they have the same geometric designation. You don't want to send a laser frigate after a bunch of fighters for instance, or a missile corvette after a dreadnought. But you can assign groups, or types to numbers 1-0, which is invaluable for keeping your fleet organized.\n\n- It's nice that the noncombat ships such as carriers and harvesters won't follow your orders if you accidentally order them into the fray. They're like... ...um...NO. On the other hand, combat ready ships will pounce on an enemy as soon as they're in range.\n\n- There are unlockable fleets that have special traits. The Lost Fleet feels like a real upgrade to the Nomad Fleet. The Hybrid Fleet has a ton of character, and plays significantly different than the other two.\n\n- Even after full release, the dev is still checking in and responding to feedback and questions, as well as providing patches.\n\nOverall - Nomad Fleet is a veritable gem of a game, and an absolute steal at this price. I'm so glad I found it.","March 15","true","43.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

What limits it at the moment is simply content, it needs more factions/more types of ship to choose from (maybe more civilian/unarmed ships that provide a use but need protection) and a few more possible scenarios for each system such as finding/rescuing human colonists (although I was impressed with how many there were already).

Commanding units that are spread out over the entire map is a bit of a chore with the camera moving at its current speed. You can hold shift down to make the camera move a bit faster but the difference is only marginal.\n\nSecond there is the AI, all carriers will just spew out lighter units that go straight on a suicide run to the mothership. I'm not saying the AI has to be particularily intelligent, however it should have different behaviors that vary based on which faction is controlling the ship. Such as retreating and regrouping when the advantage is lost or just grouping fighters into one force before charging in. In its current state the AI is very predicatable and it makes the game very easy once you know how to prey on its weaknessess. Some variation on behaviors and deployment patterns by faction and location would help immensly in improving replayability of this game.\n\nOverall this game has a lot of potential with just a few things holding it back at the moment.

Having limited RTS mechanics as you build and rebuild your fleet works well, and the limitations placed upon you add to the flavor of gameplay as you jump from system to system and search for more resources.\n\nThe emphasis on objectives and ability to jump out of a map as soon as your FTL drives are recharged adds some interesting choices as well: do you stay and slug it out to salvage the enemy's capital ships, or will the damage be too great to merit the rewards?\n\nThe short length of the campaign makes it a good casual play-through, and the randomized maps mean you can easily enjoy doing it over and over.

Highly recommend you use [keyboard + mouse] combo instead of the usual [xbox controller] deal.\nAt its current 'Early Access' state you can experience the game glitching out on you from time to time (Maybe that only happens with W10 users? Have no idea honestly), but it my opinion it doesn't affect the gameplay as much as I thought it would. Hopefully the next update it gets it'll fix these litte issues because a sci-fi strategy game I've had my eye on for the longest time and decided wth I should just buy it and see how it evolves.\nThe only other game like this one I've played before was Sunrider Academy: Mask of Arcadius. That's the reason why I went out of my way to find something similar to that one and ended up stumbling upon Nomad Fleet. It's incredible to me that a single individual has been working on this game over a year.","March 16","true","3.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Looking forward to future titles, worth the money.\n\nI really like this game. It does have some downsides, but I knew what I was buying. When I purchased the game, it was early access and it showed. While not all the planned features made it, most of them I know are challenging features because even Relic (Original Makers of Homeworld) had issues with making them work, they said as much in interviews they gave.\n\nPros:\n\nRoguelike/RTS hybrid somewhere between Homeworld and Faster Than Light (FTL).\n\nSome decent multi-session replayablility, which for the price is golden in my book.\n\nDifficulty, without having some challenge, your just wasting your brain power.\n\nConsistant Art - (It was not made by the developer, but I don't really care who made the art as long as it is consistant across the board, and it is.)\n\nCons:\n\nYour overall ability to command ships - It is not huge issues that really knocks this into a con list, it is all the little ones.  The view at times hampers your ability to command, other times it is the ship AI itself, and yet at other times it is the fact its a roguelike and sometimes you just get into impossible to win situations, but makes you feel as if you've done something tactically wrong.\n\nRoguelike issues - One of the problems with "random" is that it is ultimately going to punish you at some point or another, for simply what amounts to a "bad roll". It happened in FTL and it happens here too. Sometimes it can ruin an entire game and it happened to me here too. The difference between FTL and this, is that this takes up considerable more time than FTL, in one play. I could run 10 FTL plays to just 1 Nomad Fleet play - this could be taken as a plus or a minus depending on your personal outcome. For me, having a 4 hour campaign be impossible to win, was flustrating.\n\nUnmet lofty goals - this was made by a single person using Unity.  I realize more than most just what this means to have managed to finish and release a game.  It takes a lot of passion, and a lot of time. That said, the reason why this is listed as a con is that some of those goals just didn't get met. I'm completely understanding - the why of it, in fact I'm absolutely thrilled that he admitted it. He did not quit and walk off like so many other unmentioned developers. That takes a lot of courage, and more importantly instills confidence that in future projects he will TALK to his fans and the gaming community about the why of it.\n\nIn closing, I would certainly recommend this game as long as you like games of this genre, for those who are on the fence and don't love this genre, I'd say wait for a sale, I doubt any rational person would pile on the hate over a few dollars.","May 1","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Most of what I see is likely meant to be improved and built upon, in any case.\n\nThings I would like to see improved:\n\n-- More options to alter the control aspects of the game, specifically the camera controls. They're awkwardly slow.\n-- Moving things into similar vertical positions is somewhat annoying, as the perspective and lack of feedback make it     difficult to do on the first or even second tries on a command. I would point to Homeworld's way of communicating positions to the player for vertical movement as an example of how this might be done.\n-- The game's tutorials seem insufficient; specifically it does not inform you that harvesters can repair capital ships.(That I saw.)\n-- The AI is a bit stupid. As they are now I'd plug them at an easy level. Difficulty settings would be nice.\n\nThings that I would like to see added:\n\n-- Voices. The game's flavor could be greatly enhanced with some quality voice work.\n-- More/generated galaxy maps.\n-- More scenarios. Many more.\n-- Additional races to interact with.\n-- Formation flying.\n-- Notifications when ships are damaged or destroyed.\n-- More contextual functions like ordering harvesters to harvest a group of resources from the tactical map, or ordering fighters to stay docked. A quick docking feature would be appreciated too, as 4X is a bit slow to just be waiting.\n-- Autosaves.\n-- Civilian or unique ships to add to your fleet.\n\nOutdated from 27 July.","July 20, 2015","true","10.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Rotating the camera can help with that somewhat, and I super appreciate that they have improved those controls. However, the game REALLY needs a way to tell how high everything is compared with the selecteds' plane, or something similar.\n\nThe units need to better respond to your orders, so I need to see lines leading from my units to their targets.\n\nI need to be able to see Resource Units. At the moment, I have to find the near-black objects floating in space to know where they are. How can I be expected to watch my collector if I have no idea where they're going to go?\n\nI would also highly appreciate some modification to unity icons based on specific class (so bomber and inteceptor should have slightly varying icons, maybe a well-placed dot or line).\n\nWhile I could now play more than one level of the game, I couldn't play too far before that feeling of being blind impacted my enjoyment too much to continue playing.","September 3, 2015","false","0.5"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","22","42","2","1"

Its buggy, glitch, has some problems. But other than that it is actually a pretty interesting game. Then again, I have been playing about a few hours in. Yet despite the bugs I've encountered, the game is pretty interesting and fun to play.\n\nIt is too simple though. Much of the game mechanics and gameplay are rather simple. That wouldn't be so bad if you consider the game takes inspiration of Homeworld and FTL (FTL I see less inspiration from.) There isn't a lot of tactics, formation or simplistic combat styles.\n\nDespite that, I still think the game is rather engaging with an interesting storyline. (If the developers can polish the grammar and details and decide to voice act the intro and certain dialogue, it I think this can become a more deeper  and engaging immersive story.)\n\nThe real finer points to this is how close it actually plays to Homeworld. Mainly it feels more like Battlestar Galactica but that's beside the point. It is a rarity how space RTS games these days do not make use of three dimensional space that Homeworld does. It is a nice change to the genre.\n\n6.5 out of 10. Would reccommend.\n\nDefinitely needs to be more polished and fixed.

Something that looks and feels like Homeworld!  I like the way the gameplay and engine is really similar to Homeworld since I can't get enough of it.\n\nGranted it's an indie game, so I wouldn't expect the large funds to develop heavy content that big name games get access to, namely the budget for story writing, cinematography and music, but the game engine is definitely is a good base to start from.\n\nI like the ability to select the next level by choosing unexplored squares, however what I liked less was the fact that these squares are basically a bag of pre-selected random missions which may repeat, which by half-time you would already have the maximum fleet.  If the goal was to make this replayable, the game can be made to be harder by having more level variations and rewards, and the path to the goal shorter, so a player will need to replay mutiple times to be able to encounter all reward/level combinations.  (look at FTL for the great use of replayability mechanics) Missions could be varied and limited to utilize only a few ships, for example.\nAnd to make it really playable, it'd be nice to have mini-RPG elements like Star Control I (one) where the amount of territory you control can increase your supply lines, for example, so the player can bring forward more ships.  So my suggestion for immersion would be less RTS (ie. disable the infinite ability of building fleets just from mining resources, ships in real life takes years to build), make it more RPG where you can fix your ships from resources but not build entire new ones unless you get it in a mission, but that's just me :)\n\nI know this now sounds more like a suggestion thread instead of a review, so it'd be nice to have a forum in your website to solicit feedback and for players to post their stories, since this engine is really ripe to be used to tell great stories, so don't settle for a Homeworld clone, get some great stories out there for your game to tell.\n\n\n","November 8, 2015","true","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It's not as in-depth as games like 'Sins of a Solar Empire' or 'Homeworld' but it makes up for that with its random missions and roguelike concept. Nomad Fleet is a Real Time Strategy game where you must lead the last remnants of Mankind to safety after a mysterious alien race has hunted them near extinction. Lead a fully armed fleet of battleships, carriers and fighters through a series of randomized scenarios and encounters where they must fight for their survival while scavenging for resources, trading and researching new technologies. - Recommended!","July 24, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","2","5","3","0"

I am glad that this is a good game because it is unique in its own way for having random scenarios every time you start a new game. This game is like a lot of others but has a sort of chalenge to it with increasingly difficult enemies the farther you get. it is also different becuase you have to gather the resources in the scenarios while fighting an enemy. This has Lots of potential!","July 23, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It genuinely tries to be homeworld. It also tries to be FTL. SO much so that it has almost an identical branching path system FTL has. The controls are clunky and the camera is shoddy. Good effor though a genuinely good try on the developers part. It doesn't look crappy and doesn't feel pushed out by any means.

I just kept pressing fast forward as much as possible in order to get through it. After about an hour I only kept playing in order to see the epilouge which was, suffice it to say underwhelming. Now if this game was made by only a few people my respect goes out to you, I've played much worse. But this game was not worth the $$$ at all. Id rather spend a couple hours playing online arcade games.\n\nTo the designers, Good effort.","May 7","false","4.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Should have known when I read that the developer had a whopping two Linux testers that it would be laborious to get it working, but wow. None of the control options do anything; increase zoom rate, decrease zoom rate, invert y axis, doesn't matter... you get the same controls no matter what. Shame, because it looked like a pretty good Homeworld ripoff.","May 7","false","0.1"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"
