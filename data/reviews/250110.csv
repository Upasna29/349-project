"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/recommended/250110/","Sysg3n","Sysgen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sysg3n/","4617 products in account","Geometry Wars has company.  Assault Android Cactus is quite the score based twin stick arena shooter.  The game also supports mouse and keyboard.  I've tried both controller and keyboard and each method of control is more than precise enough for this genre.\n\nMultiple characters are available, four initially and five unlock-able, each with different load outs and each requiring their own strategy for you to perfect, and I do mean perfect.  Every little detail in Assault Android Cactus has been methodically thought out and implemented by the veteran developers and it is up to the player to not only play but observe and learn the characters and arenas in order to maximize scores.  The Austrailian developer team's lineage has roots in Midway, Electronic Arts, Sega and Professional Gaming Leagues.\n\nThe ranking system is of the D to S / S+ variety.  In AAC, to maximize scores, it is not only about dispatching enemies as quickly as possible but how you dispatch them.  Maintaining chains is paramount.  Strategy is important and seeing players with 100+ hours in the game speaks volumes of depth and replay-ability.\n\nAAC features a battery mechanic, essentially an energy charging pickup that prevents death.  In simple terms, your battery runs out and it's the scrap heap for you.  Hits alone will not explicitly kill you but will make your demise imminent if you accrue too many.  The player character has a limited number of recharging hit points of which a count of zero will render the player incapacitated requiring resuscitation by mashing the fire button.   When rendered incapacitated you will lose some of the energy pellets you've been accumulating to power level your weapons resulting in a powered down weapon and ruining any chance for leader board supremacy.\n\nThe game spawns not only batteries but a power-up, one of three types.  Speed, companion orbs to accelerate weapon discharge and stasis.   Not all types are optimal for every situation or every character in every arena.  The three types will rotate in place until the type you desire is picked up.\n\nAAC features a twenty five stage campaign encompassing five themed levels made of five arenas with difficulty increasing with progression.  AAC is high intensity, very challenging and will require a degree of dedication in order to maximize efficiency.  Arenas may contain environmental obstacles and will on occasion morph.   Each of the themed levels is capped with a very challenging boss battle.  Boss battles are typically multi layered and require advanced pattern recognition.  In addition to the campaign, there are additional modes such as survival, daily and local coop with up to four players.  Coop games are also recorded on the leader-boards.    Locally, game pads and mouse / keyboard combinations may be mixed on the same computer.\n\nI mentioned Geometry Wars.   The spawns in the AAC, both battery and power-ups are designed to encourage aggressive game-play.  Having played my share of Geometry Wars, obsessively battling for score dominance with a lovely friend of mine, I'm reminded of a similar design.  Baiting the player to take risks to maximize scores but yet encourage mastery by rewarding success with ascension up the leader boards.   From experience in both games you might think that you've achieved your score goal only to stare in disbelief at the final total.  One more time .........  and so it goes.","September 28, 2015","true","19.6"," 78 of 79 people (99%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","99","78","79","2","6"

At first, it felt brutal and maybe too hard for a 7 year old but it felt rewarding with every attempt as we both got better at the game with every try. About 15 minutes in, we knew how to play and started dying less and making more progress. We faced our first boss together and it took a few tries but we beat him and it was satisfyingly hard.\n\nI'm rating this up because not only is the game style cute and over the top action packed for my taste but my 7 year old enjoys it and it got us some pretty good time together. We're taking a break because we have company coming over but we both look forward to playing more Assault Android Cactus either with them or alone after they leave. It's hard to find a game both parents and children can enjoy together and this might be one of them.\n\nThanks!","November 29, 2015","true","3.7"," 85 of 90 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","85","90","9","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angryjedi/recommended/250110/","angryjedi","Amarysse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angryjedi/","481 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNearly two years ago, my then-managing editor Jaz Rignall pointed me in the direction of an intriguing-looking Early Access game on Steam called Assault Android Cactus. After taking a peek at the pre-alpha build, I began corresponding with Mr Sanatana Mishra from developer Witch Beam Games, and it transpired that the game would be on show at the then-new Eurogamer Expo (now known as EGX). Since I was heading to EGX anyway, I made an appointment to meet with Mishra and have a chat about the game, and in the meantime I familiarised myself a little more with the early build.\n\nWhen I first heard about Assault Android Cactus, I wasn’t sure what to think. On paper, it sounds like any number of games that bloat Steam’s marketplace daily — it’s an arcade-style twin-stick shooter inspired by retro classics — but it quickly became apparent from playing through the limited number of levels in the early build that there was actually something quite special taking shape here. This feeling was further compounded when I eventually made it to the Eurogamer Expo and had a thoroughly enjoyable chat with Mishra about the game and the team’s plans for it in the long-term — to cut a long story short, it was apparent that Witch Beam was a small team who were absolutely dedicated to making Cactus the best experience it could possibly be, and to creating a truly authentic Dreamcast-style experience heavily inspired by the masters of Japanese shoot ’em ups like Treasure, Cave and their ilk.\n\nSince I first gave Cactus its glowing write-up on USgamer, I’ve checked in on the Early Access build numerous times as it’s developed, and regularly talked about how much I like it. I’ve also kept in touch with Mishra and the rest of the team at Witch Beam via Twitter, and it’s been a genuine pleasure to witness the passion they’ve been pouring into their project. It’s been a long and slow road to release for the game, but it's finally here.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I received an email from Mishra containing a beta code for the full review build of Assault Android Cactus’ full version as a “thank you” for the support I’ve shown them over the last couple of years. Touched by this thoroughly nice gesture of appreciation, I made a point of immediately downloading the new build and playing it for a good few hours. And it seems my early impressions were very much correct: Assault Android Cactus is something very special indeed, and if it doesn’t end up taking its rightful place of honour alongside modern arcade classics like Ikaruga, DoDonPachi, Geometry Wars and their ilk, something is very, very wrong.\n\nFor the unfamiliar, Assault Android Cactus is, as previously mentioned, a twin-stick shooter. There’s a few twists on the usual formula, though: the right stick just aims rather than shoots, for one, so you have to actually pull the trigger to fire, while the left trigger swaps between your chosen character’s main and secondary weapon. Main weapons have unlimited ammunition; secondary weapons have a cooldown before they can be used again, but tend to be considerably more powerful.\n\nAnother major twist on the formula is the fact that there’s no lives system, with the challenge factor instead coming from a time limit represented by the characters’ declining battery charge. Blowing up a wave of enemies allows you to collect a recharge item, while getting knocked down wastes time and battery charge as well as costing you some points, so avoiding getting hit is a very important part of going for high scores. The battery system proved to be a controversial addition to the game when it was first put in place, but it’s now such an integral part of the game structure that it’s difficult to imagine Assault Android Cactus without it. It ensures the game strikes a good balance between accessibility for casual players and rewarding skilful play from the people who know what “1CC” stands for.\n\nOne of the most noteworthy aspects of Cactus’ gameplay is its selectable characters, who are gradually unlocked as you progress through the main series of levels. Far from just being different skins, each of the playable android characters handles uniquely, with very different main and secondary weapons allowing you to play in different ways. Title character Cactus is the most straightforward, boasting a simple machine gun and short-range flamethrower combination, while Aubergine is one of the more peculiar offerings due to her main weapon being an independently controlled helicopter drone and her secondary weapon being the ability to summon a quantum singularity and suck everything into it. The way the different characters play is one area where Witch Beam has clearly taken inspiration from classic Japanese shoot ’em ups, since many of these have selectable ships with different weapon setups. There’s a huge amount of creativity in the way the characters play, though, and it’s a real pleasure to get a handle on how some of the more outlandish characters work. (I still have no idea how to use Aubergine effectively, mind.)\n\nAnother interesting aspect is in the level design. Cactus could have easily been a straightforward arena shooter, but instead the levels show a great deal of variety in their structure. While they all have the same goal — destroy all the enemies — some of them take place in a confined space; some of them unfold in an arena that changes shape over time; some of them are in levels that force you to move from one place to another. One particularly memorable one scrolls infinitely in every direction, with checkerboard floor tiles flipping up and down according to which direction you’re going; the backdrops are always interesting and exciting to look at as much as the main action is.\n\nCactus’ long-term appeal comes from the same place as other arcade-style shooters: score attack. Completing a level immediately shows you a leaderboard as well as a letter grade, with the elusive “S+” rank being reserved for those who chained all of the enemies in a level into a single combo, didn’t die and were generally a bit of a superstar. After attaining an S+ rank, you unlock “Pro Mode”, which puts an on-screen indicator on your HUD showing whether or not it’s still possible to attain an S+ on the level you’re playing; you can also quickly restart a level if you make a mistake along the way somewhere.\n\nThe ranking system has been well thought out. Levels are designed so that you can “learn” them, much like a bullet hell shooter, and attaining the best ranks is dependent on you figuring out these enemy patterns, how to avoid their attacks and how to ensure that you’re always on the offensive to keep your combo active. Bosses are similar, unfolding across several learnable phases, with the boss’ health bar clearly showing where there’s a phase transition so you can ensure you’re in an advantageous position ahead of time.\n\nIf you’re not in the mood for score attack, though, some Sega-inspired “EX options” allow you to play the game in various different ways. You can try the game in first-person, for example, or from a fixed isometric perspective rather than the dynamic camera angles of the regular game — though both of these options disable the leaderboards. There are also several graphical filter options — including an entertaining “JJ Mode”, which spooges lens flare and bloom all over the screen for an incredibly colourful experience — as well as options for having AI players alongside you or taking on co-op enemy waves with just a single player.\n\nIn short, if you’re a fan of arcade-style shooters and you’re looking for something entertaining to feed your virtual quarters into, Assault Android Cactus is pretty much an essential purchase.","September 23, 2015","true","17.1"," 52 of 69 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","52","69","0","0"

The controls are sharp, with both gamepad and mouse / keyboard working just fine (although I personally find using a gamepad much more fun).  There's no ammo or need to reload, meaning you can put out a never-ending barrage of firepower against the constant stream of enemies.  Visual design is superb, with all the robots having distinct looks, making it easy to remember and react to their attack patterns in the middle of the chaos.  Despite the ridiculous number of exploding robots on screen, I never find it overwhelming - everything reads well and the times when you die to something you didn't have a clear warning about are very rare.  The battery system (which is effectively a timer + checkpoint system, with a bit of a twist) keeps the pace up and forces you to be aggressive.\n\nSound design is great too.  Audio cues are easy to pick up on (such as the "woop woop" when you reach low health, or the little "tink" when your secondary weapon recharges), even while having your face melted off by the soundtrack.\n\nAll the little details feel right - the speed at which the power ups cycle, the range at which you can collect the weapon orb things, the time it takes for the secondary weapons to reacharge - and it all comes together to make a game that is just plain fun.\n\nOn top of all that, the difficulty curve is handled well.  There's a smooth progression from playing just to clear levels, onto playing for S+ ranks (along with a robot voice saying "S plus!" that makes you feel special inside), onto playing for pure score on the leaderboards.  There are no real difficulty spikes - by the time you've cleared most of the levels, getting the top rank on the first stage is easy, and from there you can just keep going.\n\nHaving said that, I do have a couple if issues with the game, the only one worth mentioning here is that I don't think it works very well in co-op mode if you have a bit of a skill mismatch.  Due to the battery mechanic, every member of the team needs to contribute to killing robots as fast as possible in order to reach the next battery drop.  If you have a less experienced player who falls behind, it's not like you can wait for them to catch up - the other players need to immediately pick up the slack by killing robots even faster.  While this is possible, it's no fun for the player at the bottom, as they will be constantly dying, having their weapon level lowered, being unable to keep up with the damage, and then dying again.\n\nIn single-player, however, this is a game that I can recommend unequivocally if you have any interest in fast arcade games.","September 24, 2015","true","89.4"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","25","27","2","1"

As you progress through the game you unlock more and more playable Androids, taking it to total of nine. All nine of them are incredibly diverse in how they work and play.\n\nEach character comes with a primary and secondary attack, both unique across all characters. Primary attack will trully be your main source of engaging combat, as it has no cooldown or any limit of using in rapid succession. Using secondary attacks cannot be abused, as there is a cooldown after usage. The dodge is extremely important to the game’s mechanic if you want to stay alive and keep them high scores comming.\n\nLevels are constructed to keep a constant flow of action and intensity. Good for us that the controls are very responsive, as dodging becomes almost an art in evading constant danger, while using swift reactions to stay away from danger. Lives are non-existent here, meaning death is only a handicap that drops the android to the ground for a few seconds, while removing any power up or primary weapon buff gained from energy orbs dropped from the defeated. Tapping the fire trigger brings the android back on their feet ready to battle on.\n\nInstead, life is represented by a battery bar that drains over the course of play. If it empties, the level is a failure, and the only way to stop this is by collecting batteries caches that drop somewhat randomly after you blast decent amound of those evil robots. Don’t think this makes the game easy, as dying constantly will prevent you from killing enough machines to generate the next battery. The whole battery system is very well thought-out and intuitive idea by any standard.\n\nAssault Android Cactus requires the player to be alert most of the time. That said, I still think that that the game as a whole is a stress-free and fairly easy experience (campaing wise that is, as there are some extra and bonus modes that will really test your skills and reactions). Getting a S+ rank in any stage is another story. Requirements are quite brutal, as you must not let your combo streak end, you must not get hit more than a few times and your battery must not deplete. Good luck with that.\n\nOverall, Assault Android Cactus is a slick game that feels so good to play with its satisfying controls, fluid game mechanics, some really terrific levels and diverse combat styles.\n\nDisclaimer: Key was provided by developer for testing the game and for review purposes only\n\nFULL REVIEW[pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com]","February 7","true","10.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Boss fights are top notch and unique all around and NEVER boring. Bullet patterns feel fantastic to move around and really give you and empowering feeling when you make it through a wave of them without getting touched. Getting strategies down to complete stages or beat bosses just feel so good and really gets you pumped up to tackle on the next obstacle. I had to pull myself away from the games after wanting to push forward to complete more areas.\n\nThe biggest part about this game that makes it so amazing for me are the stages and how they are laid out and even dynamically change during gameplay. It stage transformations happen so smoothly and look so beautifully that sometimes you loose yourself to it and forget that you have bullets flying in all directions. Who ever the stage designers were for this game deserve some sort of award. They are that amazing to watch.\n\nOne thing that I found to be relieving is how fast the load times are for restarting stages when you know you are trying to make it through without getting hit or getting knocked out. It's so quick. Even boss fights with dialogue at the beginning are skipped when restarting the boss fight. I just wish more games like this would implement this system. It really helps with getting practice in certain areas without wasting time.\n\nIt has a very genuine arcade feel to it. You can really feel the passion that this team put into creating this game.  The game seems like it will run buttery smooth on most modern systems out there for those that are hesitant on picking this up on lower end hardware. The game really seems like it was focused with 1 player in mind due to how the difficulty and bullet patterns are. So the game not having online multiplayer really isn't that big of a deal. I would welcome it for other modes in the game where a extra set hands would definitely help. But personally, I feel like play the campaign of the game with 2 people would really take away from the feeling you would by taking each stage on yourself.\n\nAll in all this is one game that should be in every STG and Twin Stick Shooter fan's library of games. It is, in my opinion, THE best twin stick shooter on STEAM right now. Don't hesitate.","September 24, 2015","true","23.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The controls are tight, the graphics pop and dazzle, the soundtrack is enjoyable and never gets dull or lost in the background of explosions. The gameplay itself is fast, fun, and addictive, having that "Must play one more time" mentality. As you begin to unlock more characters and defeat bosses, you essentially unlock new play styles for you to try out. Each of the nine characters has their own distinctive weaponry that changes the way you approach enemies and situations. One character can generate black holes while another drops deadly land mines. It's this dynamic shift in combat and abilities that makes picking new characters refreshing and enjoyable. While AAC story isn't necessarily the focus, the game does have plenty of charm and style. Each of the nine androids is adorable and comes with their own dialogue and bios. I shouldn't forget to mention the game also features Co-op for up to 4 players, so bring your buddies along and blow some ♥♥♥♥ up! On TOP of all that is unlockable content and different game modes to keep your appetite wet. Anyone who enjoys twin-stick shooters, bullet hell games, or just wants to not think and blow stuff up is going to love this game.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/LOlPP4pF9fs\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 9, 2015","true","2.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","2"

Vague planes of what will be in the game and what will not? Developers who have very little communication with their community? All the stuff that happens one Early Access? Well then, take a look at Assault Android Cactus! There's a clear goal of what they want to be in the game at launch and how much is in it at the time you're buying it, right there on the store page! A lesson to the majority of developers that put their game out there on Early Access\n\nBut what about the game itself? Is it any good? The short answer is: Yes.\nThe long answer is the amount of time you'll find that you sink into the game. With four characters to boot and another one unlocked with every boss leaves us at 8 in total. All of them unique in their own way. They all have a primary and a secondary weapon which drastically changes the way they are played.\n\nThere's a whole heap of different enemies for you to blast to bits and rack up the points in a total of 25 planned levels! 23 of them available as of the time of writing this. And in addition to that you have Boss Rush and Infinity Drive game modes. The latter of which might need a bit of explaining, It's basically a wave survival mode.\n\nSo you're having a good time blasting enemies and all that, and then you suddenly get your first S+ rating. Meaning that you got through a level with an unbroken chain of kills. Nailing the level perfectly. And this is where your dark descent begins. This high is something you'll keep chasing, again and again on each of the levels, with your ranking going higher and higher on the global leaderboards.\n\nThe music and sound design is fantastic and fits the game like a glove. Not much more to say about that really.\n\nSo, why should you buy this game? Well, all the reasons above really. You'll be supporting a hard working team that, as a previous review stated, "short of the developers being visited by aliens and having their brains replaced with cottage cheese and pineapple chunks - this should be an easy recommendation, and a big thumbs up from me."\n\n..At least do try the Demo. The first one is always free, remember?","December 26, 2014","true","78.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"

Everything you've ever wanted.\n\nYou can call this game “twin-stick hell” (…well it’s the best joke I could make here. What a shame): little android in a small arena dodging hundreds of bullets and killing hostile robots, wave after wave, trying not to die and finish the level before battery runs out.\n\nArenas are small, but change dynamically (sometimes dramatically): in the middle of a battle new obstacles appear, while the old ones disappear, suddenly there are  holes in the floor, moving sidewalks, lasers… all sorts of different things wich could save or destroy your playthrough.\n\nVariety of pickups is not that great: “pretty wings” (speed up), “tiny robots” (extra firepower), “blue circles” (freeze enemies) and battery (recharge battery). Gameplay variety is mostly provided by playable characters (you unlock them progressing through story): nine different cute androids. Each android has two weapons: everyday gun and something special and powerful, but with a cooldown. Weapons and specials are very different (seekers, laser, railgun, shotgun, etc.) and you must change your playstyle depending on it.\n\nGameplay: fast, furious and aggressive. Don’t think, don’t plan — see, react, destroy. Your battery's running low. You’re surrounded. Break through. Don’t get hit. Get wings pickup. Speed up, survive and exterminate everything.\n\nStory: oh… well… it's funny but not remarkable. However, you didn't came here for the drama, cinematic look, unexpected twists and epic cutscenes.\n\nCharacters: “Everything's dead…”. Which is lovely.\n\n\nP.S.

Here's an excerpt:\n\n"Responding to a distress call from the crippled Genki Star, Junior Constable Cactus soon discovers she is overwhelmed by malfunctioning worker robots. Desperate to save the ship, Cactus battles her way through deck after deck of rampaging robots and bosses whilst befriending and recruiting androids along the way to heart of the ship, where presumably they will find the cause the Genki Star's malfunctions.\n\nAssault Android Cactus features four main playable android characters: the titular Cactus, a plucky, but perhaps out of her depth police android; Holly, a nervous inventory manager; Lemon, a trainee medic with a happy outlook; and Coral, a fitness instructor with an outgoing personality. In addition to these four, a range of additional unlockable characters are planned. The current Steam Early Access and Humble Store DRM free versions of the game include Starch (who is my personal favourite), an insane android with a mysterious past. Starch's silly presentation shows that this game doesn't take itself too seriously and values fun above all else.\n\nWhere Assault Android Cactus shines (even in its current unfinished state) is in the execution of mechanics, where the same attention to detail and stylistic choices already covered have been brought to bear on creating a robust and satisfying experience that is as enjoyable the fiftieth time as it was the first."\n\nThe full review along with some screenshots can be viewed here: http://cheesetalks.twolofbees.com/aac.php","October 6, 2013","true","149.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

If the first 5 levels don't get you excited enough to buy the game at a totally reasonable price of $15, then I'm worried you are the kind of person who doesn't smile or know what immeasurable bliss and joy feels like.\n\nThe True Story\n\nApril 5\n1:30 AM: "Assault Android Cactus.....that is probably the weirdest name for a game I've ever heard....Oh, it's like 1941, but with androids instead of WWII airplanes. Okay, I'll get the demo and check it out. I like these kinds of games."\n\n2:00 AM, upon finishing the demo: "Oh my gosh, that was so fun. I want to play it all again with a different character. Holly looks cool."\n\n2:30 AM, after finishing another play through of the demo: "This game is amazing. I'm buying this." So I bought the game + DLC because the soundtrack is amazing.\n\n10:30 PM: I start playing from the beginning again with one of my good friends in my house. He loves it.\n\n11:30 PM: Another friend hops in as he gets home, and I can't tell if he's tired or just mildly interested, but he wasn't exactly rushing to the computer.\n\n11:40 PM; The second friend is totally in the zone, and a third friend we invite says "Okay, but I only have time for one round." Yeah, right. Sure. Okay. Go for it.\n\n11:55 PM: The third friend decides to help us with the boss fight, and as he plays as Cactus, he goes right up to the boss and is using the flamethrower relentlessly. I say, "Dude! You're so hardcore! You're right up in there!" He laughs and says, "Yeah man! I'm gonna get this guy!" I am reminded of when he said he'd only do "one level." Yeah, right. Uh-huh. Sure. That's like saying "Okay, but I'll just have one Pringle." Never happens.\n\nApril 6\n12:00 AM: We beat the second boss three or four levels later and the third friend is like "Dude. This game is so sick." Sadly, he did finally drop out after going through the last half of the second section to go to bed.\n\n12:30 AM: Me and the other two friends finish the third section of the game and finally decide that this is the best time to call it quits since we all have class or work in the morning.\n\nIt's charming. I don't give that kind of description to many games nowadays. It is charming and reminds me of the innocent fun we all used to have in the 90's before everything turned into a dark, harsh, nickle-and-dime, profanity-laced online mulitplayer FPS universe. It reminds of a time when games were games and it was just good fun. The characters are witty, there are lots of little things that make the game fun (like the characters being disappointed when you change your mind on who to select), and even an entire section that gives you the backstory on each character, NPC, and enemy. It even gives you info on stuff you won't encounter that is only mentioned in dialogue. It's like you get all the fun preface stuff from your old video game manuals built into the game! Surely any 90's gamer will remember such game manuals.\n\nAt this point you're still here because you're looking for an excuse not to buy it, but deep down you know you want it. Buy it. It's fun, and that's all it is. Just cut loose, don't be stingy or nitpicky, and have fun. There's a reason this game has a 97% approval rating. Play it and go back to a day when games were simple, silly, and charming.","April 6","true","17.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","7","7","3","0"

In campaign you can control 9 different androids across 25 levels, fighting hordes of enemies and giant bosses. Each character has its own types of weapons that alter the gameplay, you also collect a lot of power ups on the battlefield which help you to survive (such as additional guns, incredible speed or a tool that stops enemy movement).\n\nFirst levels of the campaign are quite easy, but it gets very difficult in later stages, making you sweat a lot in order to survive and gain high place in the leaderboards. There are A LOT of extra levels and bopnus content that you unlock on your way as well, you can even play with friends in local co-op. It's really fun!\n\nThe graphics are a bit dated, but thanks to that you can play on a laptop or an old rig in 60 frames per second. Music is unbelieveably fast and loud - it perfectly fits the chaos around you.\n\nIf you like fast, arcade shooters and are not afraid of challenges - this game has every means to make you happy.","September 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Once inside the ship, she finds out that all the robot workers have rebelled because some malfunctioning. Attempting to save the ship, Cactus fights hordes of robots and bosses that control different decks of The Genki Star, together with 7 other androids that she recruits along the way to reach the brain of the ship while trying to find out the cause of the malfunction.\n\nThis game is a Twin Stick action arena shooter with an isometric top-down view that up to 4 players can play in co-op mode. It was firstly made for PC, but it will be available for PS4, Vita and Wii U, and although the game is still in Early Access, it is extremely refined and polished, it has great 3D graphics and great performance, it runs very smoothly even when the arena is packed with enemies.\n\nThe art style reminds me of Jet Force Gemini and Megaman with influence of anime, and every android is remarkably different, not only in appearance but also in gameplay, each one of the androids has a unique primary and secondary weapon. The primary weapons go from an assault machine gun with high precision to a shotgun with more spread shooting that can help with crowds. The secondary weapons are very powerful and have short cooldowns, they help a lot when taking down the big robots, and as if it wasn't enough you can power up the primary weapon by collecting energy, and there are also 3 pickups that can assist you in your fire rate and speed.\n\nEach level consist of two objectives, the first one is to destroy all the enemies, and the second one is to collect the batteries that the robots drop when they are destroyed, so you can keep fighting. This battery system works as a timer and in fact, the only way you can lose is by running out of battery which will shut down your android. Apart from that, getting hit a few times will eventually stunt your android, making you press the shooting button repeatedly in order to get up and keep fighting, this doesn’t count as dying but it does drain your battery.\n\nNow, what makes ACC one of the best games of its genre that I have played is the mechanics of the game and the amazing dynamic levels, the arena changes while you are fighting, moving and rearranging itself, this can play in your favour or against you by making you take decisions really fast and being spontaneous. There are 20 levels and 5 bosses, which are very different and challenging.\n\nI would like to say that I'm really impressed with the work these developers have made, the game is getting close to its final stage but they keep adding more awesome stuff, like the bonus features on the EX options where you spend credits for more features like more visual filters, A.I. partners and a First Person Shooter Camera MIND BLOWN!.","March 18, 2015","true","8.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Probably even more. If I live that long.\n\nPros: (I apologize for my formatting)\n\n- Soundtrack>  OH man do I love a good soundtrack. This game nails it with the music. Perfect combo with the nut-busting action (but 10 bucks? jeepers)\n\n- Characters>  Every android is different, and it was easy to find my new robotic waifu (I'm looking at you, Lemon). Some androids fit certain levels/bosses better than others, and you can easily switch characters between levels. Bosses also have completely different dialogue depending on who you're playing, and you can learn about each characters backstory and standing in the ship this way (not that anyone actually gives a toot about the story, get out there and blow stuff up!)\n\n- Action>  Shooting feels great, and every level offers something new to keep you on your feet. You can earn power-ups with various effects, and managing your battery can be very stressful in a fun, sort of sweaty way (like when mum chases you with a kitchen knife). Each boss is unique, and offers some new elements to the playing field.\n\n- Visuals>  Look at the screenshots you ape\n\n- Replayability: - Leaderboards\n- Co-op\n- Tons of unlockables (that can change how the game plays / art)\n- Infinity Drive (endless mode)\n- Daily Drive (Daily challenge thingys)\n- Boss Rush\n- And probably more!\n\nCons:\n\n- Multiplayer(?)> I guess there is no online multiplayer?

And of course I want to complete the game with each character. I think there are 9 characters so (2x9=18) 18 hours of gameplay minimum.\nThe level in wich you fight against the other android requires you to concentrate like you didnt till that point and try hard to beat it, that was the hardest part of the game.\nThe game makes you proceed fast because your life depends on a timer that is always draining, and to fill that timer you have to finish waves of enemies. Same with the bosses, bosses hp is split in a few parts and to fill your timer you have to take out that parts.\nIntro is nice and fun. I literally laughed with some silly jokes in the boss dialogues.\nGraphics are exacly what this game needs.\n\nThis game is at least a solid 8/10 if you love killing waves of enemies in an asometric view and dodging a lot of projectiles and attacks.","September 23, 2015","true","9.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aznplucky/recommended/250110/","aznplucky","Taiyaki >{{{º>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aznplucky/","40 products in account","I've never played a twin stick shooter before. The closest thing I've played are Touhou games, and I was never that good at them (I think I've only ever beaten a couple in Easy mode). So, as a casual noob to this genre, I have to say Assault Android Cactus was loads of fun, providing challenging but fun gameplay that was smooth as silk and high on adrenaline. The action never stops, thanks to a forgiving health mechanic where you can take a few number of hits before you die, and if your health is low, all you have to do is not get hit for a few (felt like five?) seconds and your heath regens to full. Also, when you switch weapons you get a few frames of invulnerability. This allows you to dive for those power ups and, more importantly, batteries.\n\nThe battery mechanic encourages aggressive gameplay, since your power constantly drains and the only way to get more power is by killing enemies for battery drops. If your power drains to zero, it's game over. This gives you the perfect excuse to go ham on those mobs. Besides batteries, there are three types of power ups that drop. If left on the ground, the power ups change between each of the three types. So if you want a specific power up that isn't currently on the ground, you can run around killing mobs until the power up changes to what you want (it feels like five seconds or so between each change). This becomes an interesting tactic as you balance killing high priority mobs with power up timings, taking into account how many seconds it takes to run to that mob, kill it, and run back in time so the power up has changed to the one you want.\n\nThere are nine playable androids (four to start, the others unlocked as you go), each with their own unique primary and secondary weapons. All of them are a joy to play, though I found myself gravitating towards three or so favorites. The story is light and fun spirited. It's easy to get behind the androids even with the dearth of character development, simply due to how cute and enthusiastic they are. The campaign took me about 5 to 6 hours to complete, including all the fails and retries for some of the harder levels (the final boss was the hardest, taking me about 15 attempts to beat). But, as I said earlier, I'm a complete noob to this genre, so it will probably take you less time. I personally found the difficulty level to be that sweet spot of challenging but still enjoyable. Some of the bosses have bullet patterns that resemble Touhou games, but with maybe half the bullet density.\n\nThere is a decent amount of replayability to be found in the Infinity Drive game mode, as well as trying to beat your high score on the campaign levels. The gameplay is slick, the soundtrack is amazing, and the level design is beautiful-- all this, along with the ability to choose between nine different androids, makes replaying levels a blast. That feeling when you S+ a level is quite satisfying as well.\n\nAs someone who is not really into these types of games, I really enjoyed AAC. The gameplay is smooth and addicting, the sound and level design are top notch, the characters are lovable, and the difficulty level is just perfect in my experience. Highly recommended.","October 25, 2015","true","60.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

If you like high difficulty and an occasionally uncooperative camera, BUY IT. If not, probably best to avoid.\n\n\nAssault Android Cactus is a very fast paced, intense game. It has great humor and a varied cast of characters, each of which have their own strengths, weaknesses and charm.\n\nThe gameplay is unforgiving, but also very satisfying when you achieve victory. If you love games that stack the deck against you and force you to fight for every inch of progress, you can skip the rest of the review, as this game is for you.\n\n\nAs for why I don't give the game a shining recommendation? A few flaws (some a little more subjective than others, I'll admit) hold it back:\n* The camera. It's set up to keep your character centered on the screen or, if in a group (I tested it with AI teammates) to keep all players on the screen. This means that the edges of the arena are sometimes hidden. This is especially prevalent in co-op, where I often found myself attacked by enemies I could not see.\n\n* The battery. This one may be a strength, depending on how difficult you want the experience. In addition to having to master a character's play style and learn boss patterns to beat the game, you're also on a very tight timer in the way of your battery. Killing enough enemies or clearing a phase of a boss fight drops a powerup to refill the battery somewhat, but it's still a very tight time limit. If you miss a single powerup (which is plausible, considering how fragile the characters can be), you will lose, guaranteed.\n\n* Lack of difficulty options. As I hope I've made clear, this game is hard. Very hard. I will admit that I'm not all that good at action games, so I prefer playing on a lower difficulty so I can enjoy the game without putting too much strain on my heart. AAC has a campaign mode, an Infinite mode (apparently a survival mode, judging by the description) and a 'daily' mode that I also didn't look into. The point is, the campaign mode has a single difficulty. Personally, I'd have rather it had a standard easy/normal/hard set, with easy being detrimental (or disabling) your score.\n\n* The Ex Options. This isn't a flaw, just a related observation to the last point. You earn credits by playing the game that can be used to unlock options. These include adjusting the characters to human proportions, unlocking AI teammates or two options I'd like to mention in detail:\n\nFirst, the ability to play a co-op game solo, meaning more enemies with more health. Effectively a hard mode, I suppose, which may appear to conflict with my previous statement about difficulties. The idea of unlocking a harder challenge sound like a good inclusion to me, since it means a player unlocking the option is confident in their ability. It seems more emotionally rewarding, at least to me. But it adds context to my next point:\n\nSecond, the ability to toggle on stronger weapons. This sounds a bit like an easy mode (and in fact, a friend suggested it to me specifically when I mentioned being stuck), except the option costs 5000 credits, versus the 1000 most other options (including AI co-op) cost. It also disables your score. To me, that feels like paying twice. First I have to grind for credits (since I'm only getting double digit rewards from each stage) just to afford it, and then I'm barred from the leader board. The AI co-op option also locks you out of scoring, but only costs 1000 credits.\n\nThough considering I care very little about high scores, personally, this doesn't bother me. I'm just a little confused about why it's implemented that way.\n\nSo to sum up my thoughts: I love the game. Genuinely adore it. But I'm a filthy casual and would love it more if it had an easy mode.\n\n\nOn a side note, I had difficulty playing with a controller due to it being very hard to aim with the right stick. A slight movement would have my character firing in a completely different direction.

One of the best twin-stick shooters I've played. The control is tight, the graphics are solid, the framerate is consistent, the music is great.\n\nThe stage design is excellent. I generally would have been fine with each room being a box, but the developers went much further here. Stages introduce new concepts such as traps, usable turrets, transforming floors. The enemies are surprisingly varied and there's even some legitimately cool boss fights that add more of a shmup flavor at times. I have no greivences with the camera system -- even Geometry Wars doesn't always show the full stage at once, I don't find that to be a weakness here, particularly when there are icons on the edge of the screen helping with enemy placement.\n\nThe best part, though, is that the androids all feel legitimately different. Each one has two weapons and I honestly expected them to all blur into eachother. This couldn't be farther from the truth. Some of the weapon combos almost make this feel like a different game, you're approach has to be adjusted.\n\nThe basic mechanic of staying alive is even fairly novel. You can "recharge" yourself back to life as long as you have battery power, which can be replenished with pickups after killing waves of enemies, but is otherwise constantly depleting.I've been surprised by how much I enjoy this setup and it helps give it that elusive "one more try" quality. Some people seem to feel this mechanic is unfair or cheap -- to me it's not much different than an extendable timer. If you kill enough stuff, you'll get more batteries.\n\nThe game just feels right; everything it does it does well. The main campaign is solid, but there's additional modes and some neat unlocks to boot.\n\nVery highly recommended.","October 28, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And let me tell you, as long as we get games like Assault Android Cactus, the bloody system can stay.\n\nAt its core, Cactus is a twin-stick shooter and ranks among the best of them, if you ask me. Large enemy variety, level variety, even completely shifting, dynamically-evolving stages, this game has it all. The game is relatively easy if you just want to win it (although the bosses will require you to git good), but getting high scores or at least decent ranks? Oh, boy, now there's a challenge.\n\nNot least impressive is the variety of adorable combat androids you can take into the fight. The best thing is, they're not just skins, but each has her own combat style. From the starring Cactus, who wields an assault rifle and flamethrower combo, to the likes of Aubergine, whose main armament is a little pet robot she sends in to slice enemies (one of the more challenging androids you can play as). Each Android even has different dialogues when they meet bosses and such.\n\nThe thing even has co-op, though it is one of the local variety.\n\nOverall, Assault Android Cactus is a great game, well worth its asking price.

I jumped in and this was a blast from start to finish.  A lot of fun, VERY challenging, but I kept making a little more progress each time, so i never wanted to stop playing.  And the way each character is a completely different experience with different strategies is genius, as is the fact that bosses patterns are somewhat based on player actions, so quasi random and quasi predictable.\n\nSolo player was fantastic, and i generally dont like "bullet hell" games, but this isn't REALLY a bullet hell game so i guess that makes sense.\n\nLocal co-op will be fun as heck if you get someone likeminded who's willing to try things multiple times until you get it (see the penny arcade guys do a letsplay where they get complete noobs to be able to finish bosses).  Of course, we all wish for an online Co-Op, but it's still a good game without it.  (and since the play isn't super breakneck and is somewhat predictive, perhaps with server side AI decisions and client side hit detection it may be possible eventually?  Perhaps if the single player sells well, they can bring on an online dev team?)\n\nAlso, when i first played this (aug 7 2015) I thought it was a just-about-to-be-released product from a major developer.  I was blown away to realize it just entered BETA and is made by three guys.  It's super polished and i had no issues and just had fun from start to finish.  I call witchcraft, theres no way 3 guys make a game like this!\n\nGet the demo or just buy it now.

Their goals: to crush the robot rebellion, defeat the Sector Lords, and to prevent greater loss of life aboard the Gemini Star.\nBut mostly to crush the robot rebellion.\n\nYou're given three weapons with which to fight the coming menace: Speed, firepower, and a brilliant dodging mechanic that will doubtlessly save your life on many occasions, provided you have the presence of mind to use it amidst the chaos induced by a thousand rotating bullets.\nAs to your armaments, each android is equipped with one main weapon and one rechargeable secondary weapon, whose cooldown ensures that you can't spam black holes and macross missiles across every inch of the stage. Switching between them doubles as the dodging mechanic, so wise use of your secondary weapon is necessary to ensure you'll be able to dodge a bullet when you need to most.\nAnd trust me, you will need to. A lot.\n\nThe game starts off slow and easy to let the players accommodate to new controls, and difficulty builds in a fairly linear curve with short spikes representing the boss battles at the end of every layer of the ship.\nThe score system is based on how quickly you completed the mission, how many robots you destroyed and powerups you collected, and how many times you ran out of life (more on that later.) It is accompanied by a combo system in which each enemy you destroy adds to the combo counter and increases a score multiplier, and if you go more than two seconds without destroying another bot, the counter resets.\nDuring your first mission you'll be lucky to get a chain of more than 50, but by the end of layer two, you'll easily be pulling out combo chains of 200 or more. This is in part because the game teaches you how to play it intuitively, and in part because enemies will become greatly more numerous – being surrounded is a common circumstance in this game, and the sooner you learn how to weave through the besieging bedlam, the more likely you will be to survive each successive battle.\n\nIn this game, your battery is what keeps you alive. You have a health meter, sure, but it's no big deal if it runs out. A second or two to catch her breath and your android is up and kicking again, albeit without her upgrades and powerups. But once the battery runs out, it's game over. The only way to prevent your battery from running low is to find another amidst the flaming wreckages of your erstwhile opponents. And as a result of this design choice, the battery will almost always be in the middle of a swarm of other angry, smashy robots ready and waiting to annihilate you. What's an android to do?\nDestroy them all and take the battery, of course!\n\nSo when the screen begins to flash and you hear the droning THUM, THUM of the low-battery alarm, your first instinct isn't to hide behind a barricade and hope it all goes away while your health regenerates. No, your first instinct is to scream "LET THERE BE NO HOPE FOR THE MORROW," and to blitz head-first into the enemy lines with the goal of taking as many with you as possible in a final blaze of glory - and, you hope, with the chance of finding that next elusive battery, and using it to replenish your ever-depleting life.\n(In developer terms, this is called "Badassery as a Game Mechanic," and it works just as beautifully as it sounds.)\n\nIt is simultaneously necessary to avoid taking damage while doing so, because recovering from a 'death' takes more battery than merely staying alive, and once the alarm begins to sound, you no longer have the luxury to afford that time.\n\nWith so many bots encircling you, it might seem like your chances are dim. They're not. You'll quickly learn to spin, dodge, and blast your way through every wave of enemies you encounter, and each time you do, you'll quickly find yourself surrounded again. It's a chaotic frenzy of robot destruction in which you are the sole star, and it's easy to find yourself getting lost in the blaze.\nThen you look over to the combo counter and see that it's climbed well past 1,000.\nNot 1000 hits. 1000 robots. And in the zen-like state of robot eradication this game induces, your only response will be,\n"Cool. Now let's go higher."\n\nThe FPS count on games this frantic usually dips into the twenties, or even mid-teens when they look as good as Cactus does. Strangely, however, I experienced no performance difficulties on this game whatsoever. The options menu has an FPS lock automatically set to 60, and though I am not as attuned to these things as some, I never noticed a dip in frame rate during the entire time I played.\nThis is stunning, not only because the game is chaotic, but because it's downright beautiful. I very seldom judge games based on their graphical quality, but Assault Android Cactus might be one of the prettiest games in my library, and not for lack of competition.\n\nTo replayability, each of the nine androids uses weapons unique to her and has a playstyle distinct from (though often similar to) any of the others, and each has her own dialogue when taking on the Sector Lords. There is also an entire category of EX Options to unlock that can further alter gameplay by providing AI companions, changing the camera to a first-person or iso-dimensional viewpoint, applying various visual effects and even providing the androids with a new, even more powerful secondary weapon in the same vein as their primary.\nMy favorite among these options is the ability to up the number of enemies to levels that would normally only spawn with 2 or more players, as this can increase the action dramatically and I'm always in wont of a challenge.\nIt's almost as if this game was made for me - but in fact, it was not.

Gameplay mechanics are finely balanced to keep things frenetic and happening at close- to mid-range; this game wants you to stick close to crowds of enemies, and be constantly seeking them out, and it juggles the tension like it's been doing it all its life. If you prefer a more cautious and laid-back pace, this might not be your cup of tea. Definitely grab the demo and give it a go--it's free!\n\nInfinite mode is now ready, and this is the quintessential twin-stick shooter experience: dancing between waves of unrelenting enemies. You have to try this. You know a game is serious about what it is doing when there's an auto-restart-if-combo-is-broken option (and you have to achieve a perfect stage first to unlock it).\n\nThis is one of the few games that make me wonder why there isn't a button around for me to give more money to the devs just because I like a game so much and feel like I underpaid for it.\n\n[November update] The game is still going strong, the character lineup is complete and bosses are almost all done. This is a stellar example of how Early Access can succeed.\n\n[February update] There's a new game mode--Daily Drive--with semi-randomised waves of enemies every day. You get one chance to not screw it up. Great way to add lots of replayability to an already-replayable game. Content is getting more and more complete every day. Devs are responsive on the forums. I don't have much to add here, except that I am still enjoying the game very much, and I wish more Early Access games could be like this.","December 6, 2013","true","119.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you know what SHMUP is?  "Yes" to either = get this game.   AAC is pure arcade shooter fun.\n\nDon't be discouraged by the Alpha state.  This game is more polished and stable than most full releases.  It runs flawlessly on reasonable hardware.  Control (gamepad or keyboard/mouse) is smooth and really tight which are important for games like this.    Basically:  the core of the game is complete and future updates will cosmetic updates to a few levels, minor balance changes, additional game modes, and lore/story/info bits.  The devs are very responsive and open about future content.\n\nAAC has a few mechanics (such as the battery mechanic) which simultaneously lower the skill floor and raise the skill ceiling.  This makes the game accessible for novices but also very competitive if you like chasing high scores.  Otherwise, it has pretty much every feature you'd want in a game like this.  Level select for the levels that you've cleared.  An infinite arena mode.  A daily 10-wave mode that is different every day which adds a ton of replay-ability.  Quick access to different menus for character/level/mode select.\n\nCo-op is a riot but it's local only.  You can have up to 4 players and you can mix and match control schemes (you can play 3 person co-op with 2 controllers and one keyboard/mouse) but it has to be done old-school-console style.  This makes AAC a really great co-op game if you have an HTPC or living room PC.\n\nPlayer base is small-ish but they are pretty dedicated to dominating the leaderboards so expect some stiff competition that's your thing.\n\nI love this game.","February 19, 2015","true","120.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The character designs are briliant and the shooting is fun and fast paced. It is never an overwhelming shooter, that is until you start high score chasing and playing the 'drive' modes. This game wants you to play through to the end on campaign mode. Each character has their strengths and weaknesses and finding out each for each character will be very fun. The only thing I could hope for in this game is for a better or more detailed bio for the character Starch. All the bosses seem terrified of her and I really want to know what this incident is that mandated her shut down and lock up. It just has to be a great story. Plus her dialogue is hilarious. Is it obvious that she is my favorite character? If this game runs so well on my gaming PC i can just imagine how well it will run on my PS4 when released. I cannot wait, this will be one of a very few games I will purchase twice. Before I forget let me mention the soundtrack. It is pretty good as well. It lends perfectly to the very fst nature of the game. Some levels will have better tracks than others but nowhere in the soundtrack would you say it is underwhelming. If you don't like shooters I think this one will change your mind. If you think you have played the best shooter try this one to let it try to change your mind. This is one game on Steam (and soon on consoles) that has earned it's brilliant reputation.","October 25, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Video review below with text thoughts after: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVbxXAYnDWQ\nAssault Android Cactus is a game that I feel sets the bar higher for what indie studios can produce.  Not only is it mechanically sound and a blast to play, but the presentation is simply out of this world.\n\nYou take the role of Cactus (or 1 of 8 other androids) in a fast paced, arcade style, twin stick shooter environment for 1-4 players in local co-op, blasting robots and attempting to restore peace to the inhabitants of the Genki Star.  The Campaign mode in Assault Android Cactus spans across 5 areas each with a handful of levels apiece, each topped with a challenging and visually impressive boss fight.  Each stage is unique and beautifully crafted.  In fact, the only 'downside' I see in AAC is simply that I wish there were more campaign stages, purely for how well they're made.\n\nEverything about Assault Android Cactus shines.  The graphics are charming and clearly display information in the intense environment, the soundtrack is spectacular, the voice acting is solid, cutscenes are engaging, the controls are tight and response, everything simply flows together for a fantastic experience.\n\nWhile the Campaign may only take you a few hours if you're skilled, Assault Android Cactus is all about replayability.  You're ranked on your performance and in-game leaderboards keep the competition hot.  Additionally, the game provides an unlockable 'Pro Mode' that you can setup to facilitate better rank monitoring or quick resets if you're going for that perfect run.\n\nIn addition to the Campaign leaderboards, there's also the 'Daily Drive' which is a ranked Daily Challenge for 1-4 players, with each category separated.  You only get one shot at this and everybody plays the same level.  The Daily Challenge spans 10 'layers' of a shifting arena with a variety of enemies and bosses.  Beyond that, there's also the Infinity Drive, an endless mode that works much like the Daily Challenge but can be replayed as often as you'd like, seeing how far you can get.  Also included is an unlockable Boss Rush mode if you want to practice against the bosses or simply challenge yourself to back to back boss fights.\n\nOh you want more unlockables?  Done.  Playing the game earns credits, much like many older games or early entries in the Uncharted series, which you can use to unlock a variety of different things.  Lore entries, artwork, or even gameplay adjustments in the form of visual changes, AI companions, or powered up weapons (the latter of which turn off leaderboards for that run of course).\n\nAssault Android Cactus is chock full of options and replayability to a level that's typically reserved for AAA games, many of which have even been lacking in the past few years.  Highly recommended.","September 23, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall the difficulty is not too tough if you just want to beat it, while still being quite challenging if you want to push yourself to do well. The way your health works gives a bit of leeway but not so much that the game feels too easy.\nThe enemy variety is quite nice. A good number of different types without going overboard and becoming overly contrived. The bosses are interesting and their patterns are complicated enough that you spend a bit of time learning them.\nThe character variety is great. Each character is well thought out and has two weapons which complement each other or interact in interesting ways that are fun to figure out. This gives them each a unique feel and approach to mowing down the hordes of enemies.\nThe levels are interesting and varied, especially the later ones, and there aren't so many that they become samey. Replayability comes more from getting the levels done well and going for a high score, or from re-playing with a different character.\nThe heat gauge and two weapon system works well and has a good amount of hidden depth, especially since it is tied to the dodge. The game gives you lots of options to kill enemies fast including power-ups (which feel noticably powerful), your secondary weapon and charging up your primary weapon.\nEven though the game punishes you for messing up, it also gives you the tools to get things back on track again. And on the other hand when you don't mess up and get a good chain going it feels awesome.\nThe characters and lore are interesting but not too in-your-face. There's just enough to get you invested in the game world, but you can also skip right past it if you're not interested. I admittedly don't really like the big heads of the characters and am glad there is an unlockable option to make their heads normal-sized.\nProbably most importantly, the game feels really smooth to play and there is a satisfyingly large number of enemies to kill. Playing a level well is also really satisfying.\nThe music is absolutely amazing.\ntl;dr If you like this sort of game give the demo a go. You'll probably get so hooked by the menu music when you start it up that you'll buy it right away.","October 9, 2015","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Coral is an ideal crowdsweeper but is a risky play as you have to get close.... and so on.\n\ni know i've said "i dont usually" alot here but its true, this game got me notcing things that take alot to get me to notice. thusly i transition onto music. its rare i notice ingame music but when i do i love it. this one, well, the main menu theme is catchy enough as it is. never seen a death screen with lyrics and at first i was kinda put off by it but honestly after it grew on me i kinda get tempted to stay dead and listen now.\nI will DEFINATLEY by the OST for this when i get the money and that makes a first for me. i've got a few one off tracks i listen to sometimes from games i like such as fleets arrive from mass effect and a fair few choice tracks from Legend of dragoon but this? well i like it enough to buy it without hesetation.\n\nThe extras are pretty fun too. being able to set A.I coop players on is a fun idea and i like the additional options you can unlock to make things even harder for yourself. still yet to try them all. First person mode in a bullet-hell is something im looking forward to..... in a kinda Masohcistic way...\n\nit runs pretty well on my computer and even on my crappy really old worn down useless laptop for that matter before it hit the point it cant run ANYTHING and thats saying something. back when this ran on my laptop you'd have better chances getting a flash game to work on a calculator in most cases.\n\nthe graphics and artstyle are nice and while not superhyperrealiticultraperfect levels most people dream for they dont need to be as the graphics look good as they feel styled. i feel it will likley age well because of that. i've played plenty of old games that still look good today because they took a style to their graphics and went with it instead of trying to look realistic. this is a game i feel will be able to pull that off.\n\nas many people have said before the one thing that would make this game one of the best things ever is easily an online multiplayer. co-op modes for this game would do it a world of good and the level where the boss has android health even implies you could have some rather fun competative modes too. however even without those this game holds up on its own but that would of been the icing on the cake for me and im sure plenty of other people would agree.\nIm not sure what the Devs of this game have planned but i'd like to maby see more of this game and maybe some DLC or expansions. the story and ending works well to say you could easily have more stories and levels and so on and i'd love to see more and learn more about this world and the characters in the game.\n\nOverall i HIGHLY reccomend this game. it is well worth a look even if you aren't so much a fan of the type of game it is. i usually dont go for twinsticks or bullet-hells and i love this gamenevertheless.\nIt was good back in its early stages and it has easily improved alot since then to even greater levels.\n\nNow thats enough typing.... i have some S+ ranks to go get...","October 10, 2015","true","29.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The character designs are briliant and the shooting is fun and fast paced. It is never an overwhelming shooter, that is until you start high score chasing and playing the 'drive' modes. This game wants you to play through to the end on campaign mode. Each character has their strengths and weaknesses and finding out each for each character will be very fun. The only thing I could hope for in this game is for a better or more detailed bio for the character Starch. All the bosses seem terrified of her and I really want to know what this incident is that mandated her shut down and lock up. It just has to be a great story. Plus her dialogue is hilarious. Is it obvious that she is my favorite character? If this game runs so well on my gaming PC i can just imagine how well it will run on my PS4 when released. I cannot wait, this will be one of a very few games I will purchase twice. Before I forget let me mention the soundtrack. It is pretty good as well. It lends perfectly to the very fst nature of the game. Some levels will have better tracks than others but nowhere in the soundtrack would you say it is underwhelming. If you don't like shooters I think this one will change your mind. If you think you have played the best shooter try this one to let it try to change your mind. This is one game on Steam (and soon on consoles) that has earned it's brilliant reputation.","October 25, 2015","true","19.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall the difficulty is not too tough if you just want to beat it, while still being quite challenging if you want to push yourself to do well. The way your health works gives a bit of leeway but not so much that the game feels too easy.\nThe enemy variety is quite nice. A good number of different types without going overboard and becoming overly contrived. The bosses are interesting and their patterns are complicated enough that you spend a bit of time learning them.\nThe character variety is great. Each character is well thought out and has two weapons which complement each other or interact in interesting ways that are fun to figure out. This gives them each a unique feel and approach to mowing down the hordes of enemies.\nThe levels are interesting and varied, especially the later ones, and there aren't so many that they become samey. Replayability comes more from getting the levels done well and going for a high score, or from re-playing with a different character.\nThe heat gauge and two weapon system works well and has a good amount of hidden depth, especially since it is tied to the dodge. The game gives you lots of options to kill enemies fast including power-ups (which feel noticably powerful), your secondary weapon and charging up your primary weapon.\nEven though the game punishes you for messing up, it also gives you the tools to get things back on track again. And on the other hand when you don't mess up and get a good chain going it feels awesome.\nThe characters and lore are interesting but not too in-your-face. There's just enough to get you invested in the game world, but you can also skip right past it if you're not interested. I admittedly don't really like the big heads of the characters and am glad there is an unlockable option to make their heads normal-sized.\nProbably most importantly, the game feels really smooth to play and there is a satisfyingly large number of enemies to kill. Playing a level well is also really satisfying.\nThe music is absolutely amazing.\ntl;dr If you like this sort of game give the demo a go. You'll probably get so hooked by the menu music when you start it up that you'll buy it right away.","October 9, 2015","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The devs are called "Witch Beam", which should be kind of telling.\n\nDon't be fooled by the twin stick control setup, this game is definitely a bullet hell title. AAC is very arcadey in style, putting heavy emphasis on scoring via chaining enemy kills consecutively while not getting hit too much, much like a proper bullet hell game. However, it also features roguelike-style dailies and an endless score run mode.\n\nThe game's art style and dialogue are very tongue-in-cheek. Kind of like if Sonic Adventure grew up and realized how cheesy it was, then ran with it. The playable characters are all likeable in their own way, spouting one-liners while mowing down hordes of rogue AI. Each of the 9 heroes has a unique playstyle, posessing a unique primary and special weapon. Also, if it matters to you, despite the all-female playable cast, none of the characters are even remotely sexualized.\n\nReally charming and fun game, but if you're into games for the story, don't look here. If you want to do score attacks and ace every stage, buy it! You won't regret it, trust me.","February 10","true","38.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The health-death mechanic is bit different because health loss costs you score/weapon level and you only really 'die' by running out of time limit.\n\nThe levels work mostly by changing the terrain on the fly rather than having you move towards something.  So instead of more traditional 'scroll left' type of map, think of an arena where walls and grounds are changing every now and then.\n\nThe enemy variations are pretty good IMO.  You got your standard slow dumb cannon fodders to bigger mooks with varying tactics (some shoots seekers at you, some ground pound for shockwave, etc.), swarmers to turrets  to verticle missile launching robot dogs, it's got healthy variety in both design and function.\n\nSo all of this probably reads rather conservative in terms of mechanics and yes, you probably have seen all of these bits and pieces before but you probably haven't seen them to this degree of polish.  Dare I say it, this game plays like indie take on twinstick shooter with the famous "Blizzard polish".  Fans of the genre would be amiss to not have this in their library, and for new comers this game is really good introduction to the genre.","December 15, 2014","true","19.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's very fast-paced, constant action, and it only looks like it'll get better as time goes on. It certainly isn't finished, but that doesn't mean it isn't very fun to play. The boss fights add a bit of story, with different dialog for each character. There could be improvements, for example some feedback when you get hit so you know to move if you're looking on the other side of the screen... which is often in this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Subedii/recommended/250110/","Subedii","Subetai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Subedii/","266 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSupremely polished and well executed twin-stick shooter. Simple concept, easy to learn and hard to master. Levels are short and punchy, each usually with a gimmick, a good sense of escalation, and never outstay their welcome.\n\nFrequently described as a "Bullet Hell" shooter, that's somewhat of a disingenuous title. Bullet Hell shooters typically depend a lot on memorisation and can feel frustrating when a single mistake costs you everything.\n\nBy comparison, AAC feels far more forgiving than most any of the bullet hell shooters I've ever played (this is NOT the same as requiring less skill to perfect, more on that later). Whilst there are often floods of enemies and bullets onscreen, you have a (relative to the genre) generous shield which allows you to take some hits before being knocked down. Even this is a unique design decision, as it doesn't automatically end the level level, it merely sucks up time. In order to survive, you merely have to defeat the level before your battery runs out (recharges drop intermittently as you destroy robots).\n\nAs such, completing the levels is doable once you get used to the systems at work. But the real draw of the game is when you stop "surviving" and start aiming for "the perfect run" (No knock-downs, one continuous combo chain). All the levels are built around this, to the point that they've included a handy "auto-restart" option should you miss the combo.\n\nFar too many modern games depend on lengthy grinds and unlockables to try to get you to keep playing. In AAC, the what keeps you playing is getting better at the game, getting that S+ (and then, purple S+). Unlockable characters are present, but don't depend on a grind, just beating the levels.\n\nIt's why over the past couple of years of Early Access I'ved dumped about 100 hours worth of 10 minute intervals into this game where other ostensibly more "in-depth" grindy titles left me cold.\n\nIt's a solid and easy recommendation. Try the demo. Learn to survive. Then learn to S+. The game opens up from there.","September 21, 2015","true","157.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It brings me back to another game that I loved in my younger years... Smash TV for the Supernintendo. The running and gunning plays alot alike except you are a cute Android and this game won't kill you off as fast and as often as Smash TV did. Like Smash TV you are stuck basicly to one screen, unlike Smash TV the levels morph as you are fighting in them. In a way you have unlimited lives but the limit is defined by a battery you can't let run dry over time. This game has great running and gunning fun and boss levels that attack in patterns that you can figure out. Is this a massive game? No but what it does it does well. It maybe not a long game but it is definitely a fun one. By the way, get yourself a controller. Keyboard and mouse work well but not as good as a controller. As far as recommending this game, there isn't much to dislike except how short it is. But even so it's definitely fun and that's the important factor to me.","July 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Perhaps "Windowed Fullscreen" mode, or let CMD-TAB / ALT-TAB work.\n\n2. Auto fire. It's tiring to press the trackpad button continuously. You can work around this using OSX accessibility options but in-game would be better.\n\n3. Fall down mechanic. Not much fun because it breaks the flow.

My only complaint would be that it's a little short. Although there is a lot of replayability with new character unlocks and trying to get an S ranking on each stage. Overall i would say its a pretty good deal.","September 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especially those bosses. The horror. I quickly got sucked in and obsessed with keeping that combo chain going. The feeling of godlike power when you have a maxed-out weapon with both the pretty wings and tiny robots (Starch-4-lyf) power-ups is awesome. The characters are great too, something I normally would not really care about in an arcade shooter like this.\n\nBe warned: this is not a relaxing game. It has one difficulty setting and it will cause you stress, especially if you're a completionist. It's a game of deceptively deep mechanics that caters for hardcore score-chasers.","October 10, 2015","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I usually am not a huge fan of the twin stick shooter genre because frankly I am usually not very good at them. The main reason I am terrible at these games is that I have a hard time avoiding enemies when there is a bunch of things happening on the screen at one time.\n\nTherefore I really liked the idea behind the battery power. In Assault Android Cactus you don't die when your lose all of your health. Instead you are stunned. You need to make sure that your android doesn't run out of battery power though. In order to recharge your batteries you need to kill enough enemies in order to have one drop a battery powerup. I liked that Assault Android Cactus allowed you to focus on killing enemies instead of spending all your time trying to avoid enemy projectiles.\n\nThe only major issues I had with the game was the length and difficulty. The main storyline only takes four to five hours to complete. Outside of the bosses the game is quite easy and you will rarely die.\n\nIf you hate twin stick shooters you won't like Assault Android Cactus. If you have even a passing interest in the genre I would recommend picking up the game at some point either at full retail or during a sale.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","September 25, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't know if a twin-stick shooter could get any better than this, or if anything this entertaining. The game escalate towards insanity, but it's all put together so well that as things get crazier on screen, the experience only gets better.\n\nIt can sound pretty simple when you describe it: you choose one of nine playable androids (five of them need to be unlocked), each android has a unique primary attack and special, and you shoot the baddies. You have a battery meter that will slowly decrease, but can be recharged with battery drops from the said baddies. This isn't anything to worry about unless you're taking a lot of hits - this is a bullet hell game at its core - when you take too many hits you can become stunned, and this is when the battery meter can become an issue. It's all about time management, and getting stunned saps at it. But even after bouts of badluck and poor play, things have rarely felt completely hopeless. Come backs feel like a real thing if you up your game. There are also powerups that drop and you primary weapon progressively gets more powerful until being reset when knocked down.\n\nThat's all pretty straight forward. Things get interesting because of the levels you're fighting in. To call them dynamic might be a bit of an understatement. From circular rooms with spinning wheels to square grids that reconstitute at will, things wont get boring anytime soon.\n\nThe boss fights are a blast. Each android feels unique. And I could play so many of these levels again and again. There are even a couple added modes I've yet to dive into, and I haven't even finished the core campaign. So much fun.","September 24, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fast paced twin-stick shooter that has a lot of personality and charm. Even though it's early access, I still loved it. There can be bugs, such as currently the game would crash for me after the opening scene before the tutorial. Luckily a forum member can a save file, or you could use the -skiptutorial parameter. If that was fixed I would definitely recommend 100%\n\nPros: style, fast paced, varying androids with their own abilities, great soundtrack, polish, nice overworld setup\n\nCons:Bugs (at time of review), last boss is wayyy to hard, the difficulty ramps up very suddenly at the end.\n\nAbout the end bossThe end boss is a hard point of this review and game. I feel it is just too hard, given the difficulty of all previous levels and bosses. The difficulty seems to just ramp up from 60% to 100% out of nowhere. You must be exactly on point during this boss fight, or you WILL NOT make it. Even checking out a short video for tips, showed that him and myself included, beat this end boss with mere seconds left (about 5)! My hands hurt after trying the boss about 25 times. Felt like a challenge mode instead. The one thing I can recommend here is to use someone like Starch, and use here rocket secondary to "twirl" through hard to avoid enemy fire and objects.","August 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For one, every aspect of the game looks and feels incredible.  The game looks gorgeous and full of character.  It somehow pulls off being chaotic and cluttered without making it so you can't see the important things like pickups, and making enemies easily differntiatable.\n\nThis game is seriously challenging.  If you want a casual, easy game, AAC isn't the game for you.  But if you want a rewarding, incredibly addicting edge-of-your seat game, buy this one *now.*\n\nOne thing I really appreciate is that the game is consistantly difficult whether you're just starting out or you (like me) are on the quest to S+ rank every level - the difficulty curve is steep, but constant.  And the difficulty is never artificial, like something like 'I Wanna Be the Guy.'  Every time you die, it was your fault and you could have avoided it if you were better.  That's the best kind of difficulty, the kind that makes you want to keep trying over and over for that perfect score, the kind that makes a game into electronic cocaine - but in the best way.\n\nI do have one minor complaint, however - please, *please* make the drop-from-the-ceiling-instakill-bombs not spawn in the place you're about to walk.  I understand that you have to react to them fast, but until you get really good at dodging those on a dime you'll die to them a *Iot.*  That's the only moment in the difficulty curve I found too steep and a little artificial - it can get frustrating to die over and over to the same damn bombs, but you get used to the twitch nature eventually.\n\nAll in all, a 9.5/10 game for me.","March 23","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I try to remain unbiased, but take note that this is a positive review; I like this game, so don't expect me to be thinking too clearly. :P I'm not being payed or trying to persuade you to buy the game, I'm just relating my experience.\n\nTL;DR\nAndroid Assault Cactus turns this type of game in its head with backwards and chaotic gameplay. While its story and graphics may not be spectacular, it makes up for it with unique and intense gameplay.\nOverall score: 8/10\n\nGAMEPLAYYou know those guys who charge around without strategy constantly firing at everything and repeatedly getting themselves killed? You know how everyone hates them for being a stupid liability? Have you ever stopped to consider how they feel or WHY exactly they have no strategy? The reason is revealed in this game; cry no more, that guy! The game pushes you to use this chaotic strategy, whether you like it or not. Guerrilla tactics, sniping, and farming have no effect as the only way to stay alive is to kill everyone as fast as possible. People who play this game will quickly learn that most power ups are worth more than your life and recklessly charge into a hoard of enemies, firing constantly. Trust me, this doesn't subtract from the strategy. To understand it better, look up gameplay. All of this makes up for how very generic the game looks at first.\nYou thought that was all? The game gets twice as crazy when you try to get a good score. This game is no longer casual when trying to get an S+! Suddenly, local multiplayer becomes an added difficulty and life is precious. Strategy and planning are essential and must be carried out to the millisecond in order to work. Nothing less than a perfect marriage of brilliance and skill will work. (So I'm obviously at a loss. :P)\nScore: 8.5/10 (Only because it's not completely original.)\n\nREPLAYABILITYAlthough the game is notably long, it still has a fair amount of replayability. In fact, some can argue it has too much. With two different multiple different game modes that both focus highly on score, you could literally play this game for months without being satisfied with your completion... The definition of hell for some. However, to a less hardcore gamer, it'll still be fun for a while. After you tire of the many central elements, there's the EX options to change up the game. Among the more notable ones are FPS mode, AI partners, super weapons, duplicate characters, and [ALT CAMERA WHT DOWS IT DO]. Though for some... The immensely fun gameplay, character variety, and local multiplayer could be enough In itself. Perhaps the only problem with playing it over and over is the lack of randomness. I think the only thing that's random is the things dropped by enemies... But you could still argue that it has a great amount of replayability.\nScore: 8/10\n\nGRAPHICS AND CUSTOMIZATION Anyone with FPS mode can say that the graphics are unnecessarily good. It has a sufficient amount of settings to suit your computer and playstyle... I'm unconcerned with graphics unless you can't see crap or if they lag my admittedly bad computer. This game does neither, so I see no problem with it. For someone who likes playing with graphics, there are plenty of options for that... Which brings me to customization. As mentioned above, you can change the graphics. Other necessary options at included, but they have extras that go above and beyond. I mentioned a few of the EX options earlier, but there are many more. Some make the game more challenging, others make it easier. Some relate to graphics and music, and others fundamentally change the game. Most are serious, some are silly. While the game isn't spectacular in either of these aspects, everyone can agree that it does well.\nScore: 7.5/10\n\nSTORY I would not buy the game for the story alone. Not that it's terrible; I've seen much worse. The problem is that it's not the BEST. The integration of story with graphics and gameplay is poor... Death robots pop up out of nowhere and brainlessly attack you, and three untrained androids manage to grab extremely powerful weapons and use them for a presumably long time with SIXTY-SECOND BATTERIES by ripping out and draining the batteries or enemies... Just ignore that. Dialogue is infrequent, but characters still have a shocking amount of personality from voice lines in and out of battle. This raises new questions about how they got to be like that, but I'll count it as a plus since personality counts for story in my book. I could go on, but I don't like saying bad things about this game. Let's just say that there are good and bad things that mostly balance each other out.\nScore: 4/10","April 10","true","73.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is minimal, but its all it needs to be as it sets the stage perfectly for where you are and why you are fighting hordes of robots. You start out with one of many playable female robot character each with their own drastically different playstyle. This arena shmups takes the genre to a new level as nearly each level transforms to change the landscape at certain stages. Few games get their formula and enjoyment right in terms of getting me to play level more than once, but this game is one of them. Getting an S+ rank is hard and rewarding and thanks to each characters different playstyle each level and their horde spawns require a little re-learning.\n\nThank you Witchbeam dev.","April 2","true","34.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first it seems like it might be simple or easy, and the story doesn't set itself as being too extensive. However once you get past the tutorial you quickly realise how frantic and fast paced it is.\n\nThis is SMASH TV meets Gunstar Heroes. It's an isometric twin stick shooter filled with frantic hordes of enemies that push you harder and harder to keep them back. The weapon variety between the different androids you chose definitley makes every one of them feel unique and fun to play as, and the switching from primary to secondary and the pickups you get ads to the game. The weapon's attack style is what reminds me a bit of Gunstar Heroes, although you don't necessarily pick and stack your weapons like the legendary game.\n\n*Additional edit* I've since beaten the whole game but just can't put it down. Each level is really well designed and vary from one another that they don't feel the same and add a uniqueness to run through, and the daily challenge and infinite drive makes this a great game for SHMUP fans. I try to be as honest as I can and not let the key being given by request affect my critical interpretation, but this game is great and fun.\n\nYou can do up to four player coop, and in addition to the story mode there's two varieties of infinite mode to add more variety to the plate.\n\nThe only negative I can really give is the coop is local only. I love local coop and appreciate having this option, but for $15 I really feel like it should have online coop too. Still,  with everything you get in the game itself I feel that the $15 is justifiable despite that.\n\nOtherwise this is a really fun and fast paced twin stick shmup!","November 19, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I killed him on maybe my 30th try or abouts, but I had zero battery power left, quite literally less than half a second left. The graphics, gameplay, sounds, and music are outstanding. Some of the best production value I have ever seen in a indie game or twin stick shooter for that matter. The game's biggest problem though is that it is very short with almost zero replay value and extreme repetitiveness. Once you beat the game (I did in about 4 hours, closer to 3 probably considering how many tries it took me to beat the horrible last boss), there is no reason to play the exact same levels over again with the exact same strategies (moving and shooting) just to do the extremely frustrating boss fights over again.

It's quick, it's fun and you're going to replay levels to try to beat your best score. It's in early access, yes, but if the final product is anything like this, it's totally worth the price. I would like to see the graphics improved slightly (there doesn't seem to be any anti aliasing) and support for more widescreen and HD resolutions (like 1366x768) but it is an awesome game.\n\nThe price is a steal and the developers are onto something here. They understand gaming doesn't always have to be serious and we are in this to have fun. This game is fun, colourful and you unlock more characters as you go along. Each character comes with a standard and alternative weapon, but they're all different, which makes for interesting combinations in multiplayer. If you're unsure, there is a demo available, though I do believe you're getting more value than what they're asking for it.\n\nAs for the technical stuff, it is a top down shooter, which supports keyboard and mouse, or a gamepad. It has local co-op too so that's a plus if you have friends over. As I mentioned before, the graphics could do with a few tweaks, but it is by no means unattractive. The gameplay is fluid and you will be moving around the arena a lot while gunning down hordes of machines. There are powerups available, which also encourage you to keep moving. The music is upbeat and adds to the fast-paced atmosphere.\n\nI'd give it a solid 8/10, with the hope that the final product will be as fun, or even more so.","September 12, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

They understand gaming doesn't always have to be serious and we are in this to have fun. This game is fun, colourful and you unlock more characters as you go along. Each character comes with a standard and alternative weapon, but they're all different, which makes for interesting combinations in multiplayer. If you're unsure, there is a demo available, though I do believe you're getting more value than what they're asking for it.\n\nAs for the technical stuff, it is a top down shooter, which supports keyboard and mouse, or a gamepad. It has local co-op too so that's a plus if you have friends over. As I mentioned before, the graphics could do with a few tweaks, but it is by no means unattractive. The gameplay is fluid and you will be moving around the arena a lot while gunning down hordes of machines. There are powerups available, which also encourage you to keep moving. The music is upbeat and adds to the fast-paced atmosphere.\n\nI'd give it a solid 8/10, with the hope that the final product will be as fun, or even more so.","September 12, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

The gameplay is a little more forgiving than it looks and while projectiles spray in every direction and will take away energy, these events are very well balanced with the use of the knock-down/power-down incident that occurs when you take too many hits back to back. This will allow the player flexibility and the ability to momentarily cross over into gun fire and enemy packs to pick up energy and powerups, in the process taking out a few more trigger happy enemies!\n\nReplayability is awesome. The game's quality is beyond Early Access level. If I'd have bought this game as a retail title I wouldn't have found it to be "beta-ish", there's really very little of this game that looks like a "work in progress" - rather is is fully playable and fun right off the bat.

So. The title. It makes about as much sense as the game does. But hell, whatever. There's been more crazy names thrown around in the Steam universe. Let's roll with it. What are we looking at?\n\nAssault Android Cactus, and from this point on I shall merely refer to it as Cactus, is an arena score shooter. Where you pick from a stable of androids, each with their own weapon loadouts and personalities and looks, and then select a level from an ever expanding list and have at it, dealing with wave upon wave of horribleness in the time honoured tradition of Arena Shooters everywhere. With obscene firepower.\n\nOn my rig, it runs beautifully, after the first run on a level which for some strange reason it needs a bit of time to shake out the cobwebs it will invariably run at 1920x1080 with all the shiny set to max, and with nary a judder. The movement is slick and the animation is crisp. The effects are bright and the game moves along at a rapid clip, controls are ridiculously simple, you have four keys for movement, you use your mouse to aim, one button to fire, the other to switch between primary and "power" weapons.\n\nAnd that's it. Kill everything that isn't you.\n\nThank god, because this is all about instinct, you pretty much are on the move from start to finish, dodging bullets and badguys in a near incessant firestorm of incomming pain and rage in the form of various mechanical and I -think- biomechanical baddies, I didn't get time to admire the scenery too much. Kinda hard when everything is trying to kill you.\n\nThe graphics are excellent and the story, what there is at this point is witty and well presented, in the style of some sort of adult teen anime, there seems to have been some kind of robot mutiny, and the androids you control are tasked with restoring order. Each of the androids has a very specific personality, which shows through quite nicely in the boss fights, their expressions and their playstyles. Music and sound effects are also uniformly excellent, with each "area" having a thumping soundtrack that keeps a high tempo and keeps you pretty much immersed in what's going on.\n\nAnd this is an early alpha.\n\nThis review will evolve but bluntly - short of the developers being visited by aliens and having their brains replaced with cottage cheese and pineapple chunks - this should be an easy recommendation, and a big thumbs up from me.","February 12, 2014","true","15.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

Great mechanics, not buggy at all, good tutorial, excellent learning curve capitulating in a super difficult boss. Sounds great, right?\n\nBut here's the thing. The last boss broke from the rest of the game's solid gameplay in a big way. The final boss of AAC is an amalgamation of all the previous bosses, with some significant power-ups. This by itself is great; it gives the player one big challenge to overcome which is also representative of all the smaller challenges that led up to it. The amalgamation takes about 10-15 minutes (don't quote me on that, but the point is it's not an insignificant time investment). This is a common mechanic in video games, and I had a ton of fun with this very challenging level.\n\nThe problem for me came with the fact that following this multi-stage bossfight is yet another, even more challenging level. This, also, by itself, would be fine - but despite giving the player full battery (health) at the beginning of the level, the player gets no checkpoint. With the amalgamated boss fight being a gatekeeper to the hardest level in the game, I became frustrated and gave up trying to beat this game - twice. It's a genuinely unhealthy mechanic, made all the worse by the fact that the game got everything so very right all the way up to that point.\n\nSo my actual ratings:\nIf you don't care to complete games or you're a total masochist who loves to waste time: 10/10\n\nIf you like good games that _don't_ deviate into unnecessarily frustrating game mechanics in order to prevent you from wanting to beat the game: 2/10\n\nI really wanted to see what happened; guess I'll look it up on youtube. =(\n\nPre-edit:\n2/10\n\nthis game would and should have been a 9+/10. but unfortunately the devs decided that the final boss would be 8 super difficult stages (which is fine) with no checkpoints (which is not fine). after about 20 attempts i put the game down for what i thought would be forever. a friend came over and wanted to try about 3-4 months after that, and i had forgotten about the boss and recommended the game highly.\n\nbig surprise, after about another 20 unbelievably frustrating attempts, i'm done with this game forever and writing them a bad review. the devs clearly have a fundamental misunderstanding about what makes challenging games fun. it shouldn't cost me 10 minutes every time i want to _get_ to the hardest challenge in the game. you get full health beforehand anyway, so why no checkpoint?\n\nfrustratingly difficult != fun challenge","February 26","false","7.8"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","2"

I enjoy the game, but can't recommend it.\n\n-I game on a craptop. When it was in early access and I only had the demo to play, Cactus was one of those shining gems that ran beautifully, seemingly without sacrifice. When the demo was updated for the full release, the graphics went to ♥♥♥♥, probably as a final compression render to make sure they continue to run smoothly. This is a minor gripe compared to what comes next.\n\n-Acheiving +S rank in the demo was a satisfying challenge. Shootdodge, a great shootemup experience. This was not reflected in the full release at all, on multiple levels.\nThe difficulty spike is un-fun. You will reach a point where you are swarmed with robots, small, large and in between, that you were not prepared to even think about. This game will not appeal to the casual shmup player, as the spike is more severe than Nuclear Throne's. Im sure there are already extreme hardcore cactus players because Ive seen the leaderboards, and Im sure they'll try to disagree, but the fact is Cactus is the type of shmup where you will need to fail a level over, and over, and over, just to study the wave patterns in preparation.\nCombine that with many enemies that tend to blend in to the floor and you have a recepie for multiple downs every level until you've studied it like you're preparing to take the BAR exam.-Make sure you don't forget grabby corners. You will get stuck on them. It's infuriating. Helo, Aubergine's weapon, get's stuck on geometry as well.\n-Hitscan on some of the weapons can be very bad. Peanut.\n-Physics on most of the weapons will stop you from playing with a controller. E.G. Coral's shotgun, Lemons Scattershot. Corals shotgun no longer shoots in an even spread, making her essentially a non-damaging character. The recoil of Lemons Scattershot causes it to wobble, preventing you from focusing damage.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still mildly enjoy the game. I will definitely enjoy it more if some broken things are fixed though.-The bosses are pretty good, challenging but capable of being defeated reasonably, with the exception of Liqourice, who sends an army of robots at you before you fight her.\n-Each character has different diagloue to every boss. Again, Liquorice, that ♥♥♥♥♥, breaks the 4th wall in a way that can be taken good or bad\n-Apart from some enemies being the same color as the floor, causing them to blend, the art design is really nice.\n\nTL:TR I bought this game because it was fun in the early game/demo. It wasn't fun all the way through.If I wasn't me I might have refunded it.","January 8","false","9.1"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","1"

I like twin stick shooters with multiplayer - it is a guaranteed way to get my money. But this?\n\nRegretting. Purchase.\n\nGameplay is paced through code - good play is not rewarded, you can always expect a battery to drop when your alarm goes off. Powerups suck because they cycle VERY SLOWLY. One of them(and there are only *THREE*) is pretty much completely pointless.\n\nThe characters are really badly unbalanced, and chances are that you're going to find yourself defaulting to one or two most of the time because the others suck or have serious flaws or are only good for one kind of fight. Special attacks are seriously a very mixed bag, with some of them being completely and utterly pointless while others will obliterate every enemy on the screen without fail.\n\nSpawning is also done programatically I suppose, because the game stupidly spawns crap RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU that BLOWS UP AND MAKES YOU DROP ALL OF YOUR POWERUPS .\n\nWell done designers, you got me. I can't escape your ineptitude now. Standing in the wrong place under the invisible spawn point? Here, let's teleport this thing in right on top of you with zero warning and no chance to dodge.\n\nHAVE YOU A$$HOLES EVER PLAYED A SHOOTER?\n\nOnce this happens the game turns into a bull$hit $logfest that is poorly paced and unfun because you are rocking a pea shooter and the level is just ramping up.\n\nGetting up requires button pounding. Please. Why. Just. No.\n\nThere are dozens and dozens of other little things I hate about this game.\n\nUtterly pointless powerups(and plentiful) blot out enemy bullets so you smack right into them.\n\nThere is a stereotyped Asian android.\n\nController support is half-♥♥♥♥♥ so you can pretty much expect that only your *official* xbox brand controller will work right.\n\nThe camera jerks around like a jack russel terrier that's been snorting cocaine, and you can't really expect consistent camera distance while you're playing from board to board, sometimes not even within the same board.\n\nEarning credits takes forever. Spending them is pointless, and the one or two things that actually alter gameplay dump your score over it.\n\nYes. If you try to evolve this game ANY it DUMPS YOUR SCORES.\n\nAnd here is the absolutely number one thing that pisses me off about this game: It's some kind of indie darling because of the unusually(for indie) high quality presentation. The character visuals are polished, the voice acting is great, the graphics are wonderful and highly stylized, the animation is top notch and the facial expressions are great, the music is perfect and usually suits - but when it comes to the actual core mechanics there are some serious issues.\n\nTo be honest I wouldn't suggest buying it unless it was on sale. This is a ho-hum twin stick shooter that looks and sounds really nice, but is INCREDIBLY SHALLOW. If you're hoping for more than that then, like me, you will probably be disappointed.","April 19","false","2.8"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

It is also one of the finest examples of Twin Stick Arcade Action Shooters on the market. The bar this developer set for the genre is now set extremely high for any Twin Stick game to try to compete with.\n\nYou'll need to bring quick reactions for the fast paced non-stop action. With the hoards of enemies, morphing arena, power ups, explosions, more enemies, grueling boss battles, environmental hazards, walls of bullets, even more enemies, and the option of your friends playing simultaniously (local co-op, for your cheap friends) you need to be quick. The gameplay and levels are so well designed and balanced, that they'll have you coming back for more, time and time again. Even in its early access state this game is solid and almost feels complete.\n\nPersonally, I'm a sucker for anything twin stick shooter so even with a price tag of $15, for me it wasn't a question of being worth the cost but how long it would take to download but for everyone else I can honestly say at that for the price it is worth every cent, and even more so for those who have an arcade action addiction like mine.\n\nThe one small issue I have with the game is with the text based dialog. I'm hoping this is only an early access thing and haven't gotten around to doing the voice overs or, since this is a robot based game, use a text to voice program. I know this isn't a huge issue for some but me being a musician, I'm a stickler when it comes to audio.\n\nThe only other issue I have with the game is that I got it on early access. Yeah, I get to play it before it is completed but here in lies my problem. It's like hanging a brilliant painting on your wall that is not finished yet. You can see it, even though you don't really see the real final product. I'm aware this is petty gripe. ....but! On the other hand, its not that the $15 I spent is going to pay my rent or even my phone bill for that matter, but my contribution is going to a worthy developement team that is working diligently to make a decent product, all the while keeping public relations strong in the community hub.\n\nOverviewGame Play: Twin Stick Arena Shooter\nGraphics: Great - runs great on my i5 - intel HD3000 laptop even though according to the dev, "the HD3000 graphics are below minimum spec's."\nSound: The sound track is great but it is missing the voice overs! Still early access though and it's on my wish list!\nControls: Great! - Highly recommend with a controller, as twin stick shooters are meant to be played with 2 sticks.\nReplayability: Yes! - I find myself going back to levels I've already beaten in attempts for higher rankings on the leader board. Plus the wreckage and carnage is pretty fun!\nOverall: 9/10 - Solid gameplay!

Aubergine means "Eggplant".\n\nAssault Android Cactus is one of my favorite games on Steam. It's over the top, it's adorable, and it knows how to keep it's audience playing. The satisfaction that comes from pulling off a satisfying rank is always well emphasized- from the music letting you know you're on a roll, to your character's voice exclaiming how unstoppable she is, to your weapon kicking into high gear and unleashing a flurry of projectiles. This is a fun game, with a charming cast of characters and enough interesting dialogue to keep you curious. Although I personally haven't gotten past Justice* yet, it's still an excellent game and well worth the money invested into it. Typing such a compliment surprises me- AAC is still in Early Access, and it's already a game that I've enjoyed more than some which are fully released. The bosses to this game are always huge, overwhelming, and ridiculously in your face with the many weapons at their disposal. They're well thought out- if slightly overpowered (but then again, it makes it all the more satisfying when the boss is destroyed). Being new to Steam, it can be difficult to tell beforehand how much fun a game will turn out (especially since different people have different interests). This game has certainly maintained it's level of enjoyment for me.... even though I have yet to topple Justice*.\n\n*(Justice is one of the game's near-impossible bosses)","December 30, 2014","true","44.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This "review" is based on my gameplay impressions using a 360 pad.\n\nQuick facts:\n-------------\nGame version at the time of this review: 10.6\nMy Playtime (for a single run through): about 4 hours\n\n\nBought the game because of the demo.\n\nI was on the fence about this one for a while for whatever reason.  If you're not sure if you want to buy it, try the demo.  If you enjoy the demo, buy the game.  It's great.  Certainly worth the price, discount or not.\n\nACC has a very "arcade-y" style feel going on.  If AAC was actually an arcade game, I can tell that it would be rather hard on my wallet.  It's a hard game to put down.\n\nIt's super fast with tons of enemies and tons of bullets on-screen.  Seriously glorious chaotic fun.  Difficulty and chaos increase exponentially the further you get into the game.  The bosses are well designed and borrow elements of Bullet-hell type shmups.  Transforming levels and the battery mechanic do a great job of keeping you on your toes.  It's rather satisfying once you find your best character and dance your way across a level racking up that massive 200+ Hit combo and never getting downed once.  Enemy mechanics do not feel cheap.  Any time I felt frustrated, it was over my own lack of skill.\n\nThe art-style is very colorful, and looks great.  It also never gets in the way or becomes overly busy.  I do not recall every losing track of my character because of all the chaos onscreen.\n\nI read somewhere that someone compared this game to Smash TV and they were right in making that comparison.  AAC does remind me of that game.\n\nGame did not crash once, no frame-drops or other bugs. Cranked the settings up to max and it still runs like a dream.\n\nOverall very impressive for an Early Access title.  Very much looking forward to more content and release day.\n\nI wish I had someone to play coop with if for no other reason than to see how crazy it gets with more players.","December 31, 2014","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is really a joy to play, to look at, and to listen to. Each selectable character is fun and different, both in play style and...you know....just, they're different, okay?! Even their pre-battle dialogue with each boss differs, which is a nice touch.\n\nIt does sometimes get claustrophobic. Enemies tend to be big, and often, they're just in the way while you scramble to grab more battery power, rather than pose much threat by their own strengths. Surprisingly, I even enjoy this. It's not something you run into too often, having to actually push through a crowd of super dumb killer robots just because they're in the way. I like to scream obsenities at them while I pound their faces with android bullets. It's awesome.\n\nUhh....Yea, so I've only really beaten two bosses, but with each, I was rewarded with the use of a really fun, new character. The ways they swtich things up is great, even though it means some characters makes the game incredibly difficult.\n\nI've noticed the very few negative reviews here manage to call the game "not fun." These people are ridiculous. This game is NOTHING BUT FUN. It oozes fun from every pore.","December 31, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game takes the simple premise of being a bullet hell-ish arena shooter, peppers it with unique and memorable morphing levels and eight playable androids with different kinds of playstyles, strengths and weaknesses (four of which are playable from the start), and tops it with a race against time to beat the levels before your batteries run out (yes, even boss levels work like this!).\n\nEven though levels tend to get downright overrun by enemies really often, I never felt like I lost sight of where I was (I did mix up my character on ocassion with that of other players) or that I didn't stand a chance agaisnt them, and the enemy variety is enough that you'll feel challenged by them, and will have to think fast when some particularily pesky ones decide to show up.\n\nUnlike with regular stages, bosses are fought one-on one, with you pelting them with all you've got while struggling to get them to drop the next battery in time. Again, I feel like they are challenging and can get to overwhelm you, but still do so in a fair way (gotta learn their attack patterns!).\n\nEven if you don't care about the score attack aspects of the game you can have plenty of fun with the crazy levels and huge number of enemies that get thrown your way. Still, the game really shines when playing local co-op, so I'd definitely recommend Assault Android Cactus to those of you who know other people you can play it with more than to people looking for a satisfying single-player experience (except for score attack enthusiasts, of course).\n\nHaving personally met the team behind it, I'd say that their concept of designing levels with easily identifiable features (ie: the popping lava level, the conveyor belt one, the one where the lights go out...) was a really good decission, making for a wide variety of fun and interesting arenas which also have the added bonus of letting different characters excel at each of them.","February 14, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a traditional play-safe-shooter though. You can actually take a couple of hits in this game, because it wants to encourage you to take risks. There's also a timer (in the form of battery pickups) that's pretty tight, to encourage even more rushy adrenaline filled play. It seems to be quite hard to get good scores on the later levels, so I'd say it's good for quite some challenge.\nThe different characters all have different playstyles aswell.

It's an early access game and has a few bugs and issues, the frame rate dips occasionally, but it is optimised well enough that it can run passably on most PCs and unlike games like Towns it is still getting updated, it's got a nice enough price too, so I can whole-heartedly reccoment this fun ride of a game.","August 31, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is so tight and feels so good that you may just forget that it's in Alpha. This game's levels are an adrenaline rush from start to finish, a high-energy high-pressure robot laser massacre that forces the player to be aggressive instead of allowing them to hang back and snipe. The Weapon Level system, Battery system and Power-ups encourage the player to get in close, and this creates a feeling of urgency and danger that is unique among twin-stick shooters.\n\nEvery level is an ambush. Hundreds of robots will attack you in the span of a couple minutes and attempt to overwhelm you with sheer numbers. Good thing your weapons are so powerful. And this is just in singleplayer -- if you have any buddies playing with you, the robot count may rise into the thousands... Good luck!\n\nThis game is excellent for a coffee break. The rounds are typically 2-3 minutes, so you can hop in and play a quick game whenever you want. And then you'll want to play just one more level.\n\nDid I mention the incredible production value? Assault Android Cactus's art style reminds me of Jimmy Neutron. Everything looks really cool, without eating too much of your processor. This game can run very well on even low-end computers. The exciting Drum n' Bass music, tight controls and high skill ceiling puts this game in the same tier as Super Meat Boy and the likes.\n\nBuy it.

The game takes the simple premise of being a bullet hell-ish arena shooter, peppers it with unique and memorable morphing levels and eight playable androids with different kinds of playstyles, strengths and weaknesses (four of which are playable from the start), and tops it with a race against time to beat the levels before your batteries run out (yes, even boss levels work like this!).\n\nEven though levels tend to get downright overrun by enemies really often, I never felt like I lost sight of where I was (I did mix up my character on ocassion with that of other players) or that I didn't stand a chance agaisnt them, and the enemy variety is enough that you'll feel challenged by them, and will have to think fast when some particularily pesky ones decide to show up.\n\nUnlike with regular stages, bosses are fought one-on one, with you pelting them with all you've got while struggling to get them to drop the next battery in time. Again, I feel like they are challenging and can get to overwhelm you, but still do so in a fair way (gotta learn their attack patterns!).\n\nEven if you don't care about the score attack aspects of the game you can have plenty of fun with the crazy levels and huge number of enemies that get thrown your way. Still, the game really shines when playing local co-op, so I'd definitely recommend Assault Android Cactus to those of you who know other people you can play it with more than to people looking for a satisfying single-player experience (except for score attack enthusiasts, of course).\n\nHaving personally met the team behind it, I'd say that their concept of designing levels with easily identifiable features (ie: the popping lava level, the conveyor belt one, the one where the lights go out...) was a really good decission, making for a wide variety of fun and interesting arenas which also have the added bonus of letting different characters excel at each of them.","February 14, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is really a joy to play, to look at, and to listen to. Each selectable character is fun and different, both in play style and...you know....just, they're different, okay?! Even their pre-battle dialogue with each boss differs, which is a nice touch.\n\nIt does sometimes get claustrophobic. Enemies tend to be big, and often, they're just in the way while you scramble to grab more battery power, rather than pose much threat by their own strengths. Surprisingly, I even enjoy this. It's not something you run into too often, having to actually push through a crowd of super dumb killer robots just because they're in the way. I like to scream obsenities at them while I pound their faces with android bullets. It's awesome.\n\nUhh....Yea, so I've only really beaten two bosses, but with each, I was rewarded with the use of a really fun, new character. The ways they swtich things up is great, even though it means some characters makes the game incredibly difficult.\n\nI've noticed the very few negative reviews here manage to call the game "not fun."

It has some mechanics that set it apart from other twin stick shooters, such as the depleting battery meter that must be kept charged at all times.\n\nThere are a slew of characters to choose out of, each one with their own unique primary and secondary weapons. I played the game mostly as an unlockable character by the name of Starch, and thoroughly enjoy lasering everything in my path. The game supports local co-op, which makes the game immediately twice as fun as it was before. I played the game from start to finish with my brother, and we had more fun playing through this game together than we have had in a long time.\n\nThat's not to say that the game is without it's flaws though. There are a few things in the game that feel a bit unbalanced or a bit unfair. Some of the weapons used by enemies will instantly deplete your health meter, and at times the screen can be so packed full of enemies that it can be easy to lose track of your character. Let alone dodge the walls of projectiles coming from all sides. That's not including all the explosions and enemies that grab you to keep you from moving. Unlimited deaths helps to ease this a bit, but it can still be frustrating to get up and immediately be knocked back down.\n\nThis game can get HARD. The last world is brutal. But we pushed through and beat it, and had fun doing so.\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone that is a bullet hell, or twin stick shooter fan.","May 16, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason I bring those games up is because the twin stick shooter genre is one of the oldest there is, and somehow a little indie developer named Witch Beam has made a title that is one of the best in it's class... now onto the game.\n\nAssault Android Cactus is a hybrid of sorts.\n\nIt's mostly a twin stick shooter, but there's a bit of bullet hell in it's DNA. The first few levels are fairly easy, as you progress the game gets harder, as more enemies appear on screen AAC becomes more of a bullet hell, and you have to make smart use of the invincibility you receive when you switch weapons.\n\nThere's 8 playable characters, each "Android" has a unique primary and secondary weapon, and a bit of personality. All 8 play pretty different, and i'm sure you'll find at least one or two that fit your playing style. Witch Beam actually put a story with voice acting and cutscenes, something you rarely see in this genre. It's not the best story ever told but it has a lot of charm and style, and is a nice bonus.\n\nOnly real complaint I have is the last boss. Maybe i'm just terrible, but the last boss seems far more difficult than the rest of the game, and to this day I can only seem to beat it with a particular character, and only that one. But maybe i'm just doing it wrong, i'm not sure. Other than that, the game is excellent, looks and plays beautifully and I can see me returning in the following months even though I've finished AAC and play some more of the endless mode.","January 17","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is well produced and the voice acting is good. Although it is hard and sometimes frustrating the game is fun to play\n\nThe game can get hard. Assault Android Cactus introduces a battery life system, the battery constantly deplets until it reaches zero, once it reaches zero, you're dead. To regain your battery's life, you have to get battery life and it increases your battery life. However, the game can get frustrating when there are a lot of enemies and the power up lands right in front of them and you die because you didn't manage to get it in time. The battery life system is clever but can get annoying immediately\n\nThe game's main story is short, clocking in at around 3-4 hours. It is extremely short however the game does offer infinite waves, daily waves and once you've completed the game's story, a boss rush where constant bosses spawn. Plus, you can modify the game with EX mode. EX mode offers you to play in first person and other such modifiers\n\nAssault Android Cactus is a fun game, hard but fun. The game's short length might turn some people away. Thankfully, there is a demo for you to try out before buying the game\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","February 19","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each android has 2 different weapons and all of then are quit different to play with, you can anytime change your android between the areans or at the end of it.  You able to play solo or in coop until 4 players.\n\nInside the areans you will be able to get power ups and you need to collect batteries to stay a life. This can become very thrilling specially during the boss fights. But lucky overall the game is very fair with the battery drops and you mostly able to escape near death during a normal area. ;) The boss fights itself are all very good and fun to play.\n\nDuring my first play season I lost myself in the game and get really  excited from it and I start replaying areanes  and boss fight over and over again just because I was so close to a better rating or the area was just crazy because of the amount of enemies in it or want to try the same boss fight with a different android.\n\nThe grafic and the style of the game is very colourful and depends on the zones with different themes, all with nice light effects. Depends on the themens and the situation the music is also all the the time changing to it. The soundtrack of the game is full of good electronic music and its easy to get catched in the music and fight like it.\n\nThere are many things to unlock in the game starting with galleries, sounds, music too new androids, mods or tweeks on the game like different views, mega weapons. xD\n\nIf you like arena or bullet hell shooters and highscore races then this game is a must buy for you.\n\nPersonally this is my favorite game of 2015 with the most fun and enjoyment, no other game what i played that year was so good as this one and could take me in its ban for so long.","November 3, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having put in a few hours and done all the modes I have to say I like this game. One of its shining aspects is how differently the characters play, it's almost like a different game with each of them. The overall simplicity and straightforwardness of the goals and ideas is refreshing in an era of stagnant game play focusing on illusions of free will and choices mattering. Here the choices come down to, character, stage, and method. And unlike other games, choices here make a direct difference :P Either way I have found myself really quite enjoying this game and have done really well on some daily challenges and some levels. There is some character inbalance, for example Startch is mindlessly easy to play and is very easy to rack up insane scores on while, Aubergine takes a great deal of focus to do half as good as swigning your second stick around randomly with Starch. The level designs are interesting if simplistic. There is one near the end of the game where the floor is constantly being made and unmade under your feet; this is an amazing level. The boss fights are a lot of fun, I found some of them frustrating, until I simply gave up and owned them with Startch. There is a silly story line that is kind of irrelevant in the enjoyment of this game.\n\nOverall the game looks good and plays nicely. I reccoemnd it to anyone looking for a solid dual-stick arcade game.\n\nOne minor complain: I cannot get the game to register any input after the menu screens on my Linux Box (Debian Jesse 8).

More or less at any rate. It's a twin stick shooter set in the future starring a bunch of androids trapped on a ship filled with homicidal robots. The titular Cactus is an Assault Android sent to investigate why the ship, the Genki Star, shut down contact with its other vessels, and is the type who prefers to let her trigger finger do the talking.\n\nAs a result, mayhem, explosions, and heavy weapons fire ensues. With a bunch of other surviving androids along for the ride (more unlocked as you progress through the campaign), there is a lot of action to be had, and a lot of beautiful bullet patterns to be avoided/destroy yourself on whilst you (possibly fail to) eliminate your enemies.\n\nAdding to the challenge of dodging and weaving around gorgeous blooming bullet flowers and huge beam lasers and kamikaze mines and rockets and such, you have to not get too close to enemies which usually have some kind of devastating melee attack which they will attempt to hit you with, keep your battery topped up with battery pickups, and evade/make use of the levels' various hazards and traps...\n\nAll of this to a fantastic soundtrack ,and with plenty of EX Options to unlock, which will up the difficulty further if you so wish. Can you S+ rank every level by making sure you never drop your combo and never get knocked down? Can you beat every boss flawlessly before your battery runs out? Can you discover why the robots on board have turned against the humans?\n\nWhilst primarily a single player experience, local co-op exists of up to four players and is purportedly lots of fun (as well it should be). There's also lots of fun things to unlock and even a first person perspective mode if you really want to ramp up the difficulty. Also at only £10.99 it's a real steal!\n\nGet it now, join the fun, blow up robots.","November 13, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having put in a few hours and done all the modes I have to say I like this game. One of its shining aspects is how differently the characters play, it's almost like a different game with each of them. The overall simplicity and straightforwardness of the goals and ideas is refreshing in an era of stagnant game play focusing on illusions of free will and choices mattering. Here the choices come down to, character, stage, and method. And unlike other games, choices here make a direct difference :P Either way I have found myself really quite enjoying this game and have done really well on some daily challenges and some levels. There is some character inbalance, for example Startch is mindlessly easy to play and is very easy to rack up insane scores on while, Aubergine takes a great deal of focus to do half as good as swigning your second stick around randomly with Starch. The level designs are interesting if simplistic. There is one near the end of the game where the floor is constantly being made and unmade under your feet; this is an amazing level. The boss fights are a lot of fun, I found some of them frustrating, until I simply gave up and owned them with Startch. There is a silly story line that is kind of irrelevant in the enjoyment of this game.\n\nOverall the game looks good and plays nicely. I reccoemnd it to anyone looking for a solid dual-stick arcade game.\n\nOne minor complain: I cannot get the game to register any input after the menu screens on my Linux Box (Debian Jesse 8).

If timed right you can use your weapon switch as a brief dodge, which can be pretty useful. Middle      Battery is an amazing mechanic, but in the final boss battle it is the real enemy as if you you die more then twice you guarantee you'll run out even at the end  (T _T)\nMega weapons are fun but realistically I did better with defaults (O  _0)?\nFinal boss battle is truly challenging and can be fun, but unless there is a battery adjustment, you literally haved to play S+ level otherwise you'll die and it can be very disappointing for gamers who just will settle for B and complete the story (v_v)\nWell assembled and fun stage, but I wish there was more (^_^)Con     No strong indivudal android story except for boss fight reactions, Like I want to know more about Starch and Aug, beside what the Collection has to say.\nThis one is just me but I hate unused content! The weapon attatched to Cactus arm is just for looks and serves no purpose as she has an Assault rile and flamethrower!\nBattery mechanic in Final boss is truly aggravating as the diffulcty level of the boss required you to die no more than twice and alot of luck plays in it over skills.\nAnother me part, likely its just I am not skilled enough but I beat every section lord without too much problem, but the Final Boss  is way powerful as getting hit once means it over (Q _ Q)\nBatteries tend to spawn in a death sentence zone in Final boss! Take a guaranteed stun for a charge!\n\nThe game is truly amazing and fun. Definitely worth playing, just the major flaw as my cons to it were mostly that the final boss its very difficult even with mega weapons. I've yet to beat it and most of my losses are primarily at t̶h̶e̶ ̶J̶u̶s̶t̶i̶c̶e̶ ̶i̶m̶m̶i̶t̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ ̶o̶r̶ or the Core and Cubes. The battery truly add most of the fun, but when it comes to conclusion it sucks for the final boss and you may find yourself deterred from even wanting to fight the Medula even after beating it once.\nSuggestions\nI would say heavy balancing would be needed on the final boss as its truly the only real issue I had with the game. Maybe adding battery time for strictly Medula boss fight would be pleasant, a slight nerf on it,o̶r̶ ̶a̶d̶d̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶d̶e̶f̶e̶n̶s̶e̶ ̶c̶a̶p̶a̶b̶i̶l̶i̶t̶i̶e̶s̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶r̶o̶i̶d̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶h̶e̶a̶v̶y̶ ̶s̶e̶t̶ ̶a̶t̶t̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶w̶o̶u̶l̶d̶ ̶m̶a̶k̶e̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶b̶e̶a̶r̶a̶b̶l̶e̶ and atleast add a more realistic difference in ranking skills. Also where are the humans!!! I did hope to meet atleast one! Give the shooter on Cactus arm an animated purpose when recovering, I just hate seeing unused content, alot of times it speak of incompletion.\n\nAll around I still recommend this game as it is fun and brings back what made gaming what it is today!!!","October 7, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game up to that point had been a very pleasant if somewhat easy ride.\n\nI think the developer should consider either lowering the difficulty of the final boss or ramping up the difficulty on later levels so when you reach the final boss you aren't woefully unprepared for it.

The music is well produced and the voice acting is good. Although it is hard and sometimes frustrating the game is fun to play\n\nThe game can get hard. Assault Android Cactus introduces a battery life system, the battery constantly deplets until it reaches zero, once it reaches zero, you're dead. To regain your battery's life, you have to get battery life and it increases your battery life. However, the game can get frustrating when there are a lot of enemies and the power up lands right in front of them and you die because you didn't manage to get it in time. The battery life system is clever but can get annoying immediately\n\nThe game's main story is short, clocking in at around 3-4 hours. It is extremely short however the game does offer infinite waves, daily waves and once you've completed the game's story, a boss rush where constant bosses spawn. Plus, you can modify the game with EX mode. EX mode offers you to play in first person and other such modifiers\n\nAssault Android Cactus is a fun game, hard but fun. The game's short length might turn some people away. Thankfully, there is a demo for you to try out before buying the game\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","February 19","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each android has 2 different weapons and all of then are quit different to play with, you can anytime change your android between the areans or at the end of it.  You able to play solo or in coop until 4 players.\n\nInside the areans you will be able to get power ups and you need to collect batteries to stay a life. This can become very thrilling specially during the boss fights. But lucky overall the game is very fair with the battery drops and you mostly able to escape near death during a normal area. ;) The boss fights itself are all very good and fun to play.\n\nDuring my first play season I lost myself in the game and get really  excited from it and I start replaying areanes  and boss fight over and over again just because I was so close to a better rating or the area was just crazy because of the amount of enemies in it or want to try the same boss fight with a different android.\n\nThe grafic and the style of the game is very colourful and depends on the zones with different themes, all with nice light effects. Depends on the themens and the situation the music is also all the the time changing to it. The soundtrack of the game is full of good electronic music and its easy to get catched in the music and fight like it.\n\nThere are many things to unlock in the game starting with galleries, sounds, music too new androids, mods or tweeks on the game like different views, mega weapons. xD\n\nIf you like arena or bullet hell shooters and highscore races then this game is a must buy for you.\n\nPersonally this is my favorite game of 2015 with the most fun and enjoyment, no other game what i played that year was so good as this one and could take me in its ban for so long.","November 3, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was really neat watching this title grow and it's mechanics evolve and get fine tuned.  This was my first early access title and holds a special place in my heart, logging in months later to see a whole new, vastly improved game is something else.  What started out as a pretty fun coin munching concept grew into an extremely well polished game and possibly one of my favorite twin stick shooters of all time.  It has that special something that games used to have and lack these days, it feels like, well being an older fella what my generation would have called an actual video game back in the day.\n\nMaybe it's the trippy lights, maybe it's the stellar sound effects, or maybe even the frenetic bullet hell insanity, but one thing's for sure, this game has a soul.  Give it a shot, it's more than worth the price of admission.  If you've got buddies, even better.","September 23, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very colorful and pleasant visuals and a decent challenge as well.  Pick this up if you've ever been a fan of the genre.  There's some fun score-attack features and a good variety of characters that change the weapon you use and therefore the style of play.\n\nThe only downside thus far was the opening cutscene, thought at time of writing it's the only one I've seen.  It's got that same cringe-worthy sensibility that so plagued the excellent Freedom Planet, though to a far, FAR less problematic degree.  The gameplay is so much fun that's easy to overlook, so not much of a slight at all, I'm just hoping there aren't many more.\n\nQuite a lot of fun and content for the price.","September 30, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's super top quality on almost all fronts.  And its challenging!\n\nIf I had to give it a slight negative, it would have to be on its missed potential of story told through animation.  You see the game starts off with a really cute interection with the captian and some other androids (voice acted and well animated) and the humor is really great.  However so far at over half way through the game, it's had no more of that type of cutesy voice acting or highly animated cutscenes (its mainly been a few text dialogues between you and the bosses with not much going on).\n\nStill worth it, although maybe a little short if you only plan on doing one play through or stop trying to beat your best score.  I will note there are 9 androids to try each level with if you like, along with a daily challenge and an infinite level, so there is no shortage of gameplay if this is your style.","September 25, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game up to that point had been a very pleasant if somewhat easy ride.\n\nI think the developer should consider either lowering the difficulty of the final boss or ramping up the difficulty on later levels so when you reach the final boss you aren't woefully unprepared for it.

I got it through Indiebox, so it came with some great little things, such as Cactus' badge, phone charms, a physical soundtrack, and an Assault Android Cactus-themed USB with the game itself on it. But lets forget about that and look at the game. This game had me hooked from as soon as I turned it on and heard that great music. It accompanies the visual style well and gives a very clear theme to it. When the gameplay came along, I found myself nostalgic for hardcore shooters like Smash TV and was, in honesty, disappointed.  But there are options to increase enemy count in the store  Aside from the somewhat easy gameplay, I enjoyed gunning down hordes of enemies as even the starting characters, who all appeared to have their own roles in battle. Cactus for your basic damage, Holly for ranged support, Lemon for spreading damage to large groups, and Coral for hitting small clusters hard. All in all, even from this 20 minute session I played, I know this game will be money well spent for anyone, whether it be a family looking for something simple and fun to bond over, or a hardcore single-player looking for a smooth-sailing break from Ikaruga.\n9/10","March 30","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The geometry keeps changing mid-level, light switches off, floors dissapear, etc.\nTo reward risk of going after power-up points from fallen enemies, your weapon gets stronger.\nA lot of fun, especially with a friend or two. I've been playing this on and off since the early alpha days and it's great to see it has evolved into such a smooth experience!","May 1","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rustic_Fall/recommended/250110/","Rustic_Fall","Rustic_Fall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rustic_Fall/","153 products in account","Assault Android Cactus is an arcade twin stick shooter. In the game, you can play as many characters that have their own dialogue when speaking and voice actors. This was a suprise indie game that I didn't like at first, but then got really into it. This game will keep you addicted with a campaign of levels and bosses. The cast is wonderful and fun. The O.S.T has some memorable tracks and the visuals are great. There are also daily challenges, infinite run mode, and a boss rush like most arcade like games. The battery system is intersting and keeps you at your toes. Also, the bullet hell in the boss fights are fun and a blast. If you like Pac-Man and Nuclear Throne, this game is for you. Also, all the enemies are varried and the level design is different each time so your never bored. One gripe I have with the game is that the battery has this magentic attraction to you when you go near it to get it. Yet if you move to fast, it will never reach you and result in a lot of stupid game overs. Overall, its a great game that I'm glad I was able to find and play. Thank you so much Witch Beam for this game and I'm excited for your next! I give it an 8/10.","May 1","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
