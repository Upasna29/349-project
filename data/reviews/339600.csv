But what you dont know till you're already inside, is that it is also massively Pay-to-Win.\n\nIn my time playing VEGA Conflict, (on browser before the steam release) there are 3 kinds of players; Coiners (spend real money, and LOTS of it), Scripters (cheaters/hackers), and those who actually play for free.\n\nThe PRO's of this game;\n\n1) Great visuals, especially since the steam release\n2) Gameplay is easy to learn but near impossible to master, meaning that there is always someone out there better than you.\n3) Each fvf (pvp fleet battles) is like a game of chess, make a wrong move, your ships go down quick.\n4) You are free to customise your ships/base however you want, with a plethora of weapons, armor, shields, and special equipment, and the battles that follow with these ships will be decided by your skill and your fleet's arms and armaments.\n\nCONS;\n1) Kixeye (the almighty developer) got greedy, or so allege the great majority of the players, and they keep proving us right with their schemes to get you to spend real money, which the coiners do, and they get WAY ahead of the free-to-play people, and abuse it. In other words, there is HEAVY imbalance of power in this game. In other words, the rich get ahead, and leave you in the dust.\n2) The monthly events that kixeye throws at us are getting increasingly hard for f2p players to keep up with, while the coiners simply dish out some money and intant-repair their fighting fleets and just rake up the event points, and get the event ship/weapons which are available for just those few days.\n3) The worst thing about this game is something that kixeye wont change, and that is the behaviour of the players. It can be the coiners gloating about the sheer advantage of power they possess over you, or it could be that they just derive pleasure from attacking you everyday, because maybe they feel they have something to prove. Who knows? I've seen too many people use just the most racist, offensive language at you, either because you are new, because you attacked them once, or whatever else. (They often start the fight in the first place).\n4) The politics. Kixeye introduced "Alliances" some months ago, and now if the player of one alliance steals resources of the other, a MAJOR dialogue is opened in the game chat between the leaders of both alliances over freaking 200k in resources.\n\nWhats that? Report them to Kixeye? lol you think that does anything? There were rumors floating around that kixeye un-banned cheaters because they started coining before they were banned, or something like that. Do I believe that? I dont know, its just a rumor. But who knows for sure...\n\nThis used to be a good game, and if you ask anyone who was playing before Carriers were introduced, most will agree. (not the coiners obviously. Well, maybe some of them...)\n\nPretty long review, I know, but seriously, unless you are super-rich, the playing field is ALMOST NEVER level or equal. There are dozens of games out there that deserve a download more than this game.","February 22","false","5.0"," 389 of 429 people (91%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","91","389","429","15","16"

How about\nPAY TO WIN\n\nI’ve been playing this game long before it came to steam, for over 2 years now, and from what it was, the game has gone from good to bad to downright horrible. The only reason I still play is due to playing for so long that to abandon my progress would be impossible\n\nThe developers are horrible - they only add things in that benefit them financially. They never listen to the community.\n\nThe events are near impossible for anyone who doesn’t have the absolute latest tech, unless you like grinding for days on end just to win.\n\nThe BUILD TIMES are what make this game pay to win. It's worse than Clash of clans. It takes roughly 1-2 weeks to build a single end-game ship, and you need at least 5 to make a decent fleet. Your options are:\n\n1.) Wait nearly 6 weeks MINIMUM for a single fleet of ships\nor\n2.) Pay over 100$ MINIMUM to instantly have that fleet\n\nWhen your fleet eventually dies, you still have to wait 12-36 hours just for them to repair, per fleet. You can't repair multiple fleets, so a person who doesn’t spend money in the game can get a few days of repair in the course of half an hour.\n\nThings is, its very easy to have someone destroy your fleet even with skill, because they recently added in ship crafting, which allows you to upgrade your ships. This makes it a “paper scissors rock” scenario, where fighting with the wrong fleet can lead to disaster, with 12 hours of repairs to you, and none to very little to your enemy.\n\nAnother small detail, THE GAME IS FULL OF CHEATERS.\nThere are many Chinese alliances (clans) that manage to use scripts to kill NPC fleets over and over again while they sleep, and Kixeye refuses to do anything about it because, as I said earlier, they only do things that benefit them financially.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nDO NOT GET THIS GAME unless you have hundreds of dollars to spend in a game where the highest bidder wins, or unless you are very very patient","December 14, 2015","false","183.0"," 610 of 725 people (84%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","84","610","725","50","53"

I used to play this in browser back when this was actually a good game before Kixeye's greed kicked into full swing.It took almost  3 years playing this game to slowly see it was slipping into the same state as Kixeye's other flagship game "Battle Pirates".\n\nLet me start with the Pros:\n-Graphics look a lot nicer after steam release\n-much more stable gameplay after steam release\n\nJust a small list of Cons that happen with Kixeye:\n-If you do not buy large amounts of thier overpriced coins thier coustomer service is nonexistant for you.\n-Raids/special events desgined for the advancement of everyone but built for the elite.\n-Ridiculously long building and ship build/repair/refit times.\n-Many glitches and exploits that will only be fixed if the big spenders complain enough about them or Kix looses money       from it.\n-Eliteists that buy their way to the top and create a toxic community.\n-Upcoming content that is backed by the player base is discarded for other content that is backed exclusively by the big spenders.\n\nBetween Vega Conflict and Battle Pirates I have roughly 9 years of expierance with Glitcheye and thier crap.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoduE/recommended/339600/","NoduE","Cyrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoduE/","63 products in account","Okay, first of all, I have been playing Vega Conflict for nearly 3 years now. 4 years, if you count the other games made by the same devs. I have never spent a dime on in-game assets; I learned, survived, and thrived. Even with that, it's still difficult to be competative in such a PVP orianted game without dumping some serious money into in-game assets. Here are my 2 cents on this review.\n\nI really love this game. Seriously. It's quite an exciting game. Simple at a glance, but underneath, it's actally very deep in terms of ships, tactics, and even politics. But can I recommend this game? No. Not anymore at least.\n\nWhy? Because of three major reasons that the developers never seem to learn from.\nPay to win      It does not matter if you're an absolute newbie that just got the game when it came out on steam, or an elite pilot who has been playing since the beta days 3-4 years ago, if you don't spend real life money on in-game assets (coins!), you're not going to have a great time, nor be very competative in PVP.  Period. And I am not talking about casuals who invest 20-50 dollars a month. I am talking about investing around 100-1000 dollars. Need a ship or base module build or refitted now? Pay up. Don't have the coins? Too bad. Wait 2-16 days. Your fleet is down? Pay up now, and get back in the fight (and/or spam that same fleet, rinse and repeat until the enemy is down.). Or wait until that fleet is done repairing.\nIncompetent Devs    This is the biggest red flag in my opinion.  Kixeye, the developers of Vega and other games, have quite a reputation (at least within their community) to make the same game killing actions on each and every one of their products. Especially over the course of the last 6 months, they have broken their promises again and again. Without shame. One such example is the black market. They explicitly stated that coins will not be involved in the black market. It will only involve a form of currency called Blood Amver, which is something that can only be earned by completeing daily missions. You actually got to play the game to earn Blood Amber, and buy cool tech. What happened? Well, around the start of November, Kixeye had the nerve to break their promise, and introduce coins into the black market. Want a good, effective item on the black market? Pay up 20 blood amber and you can only get one. OR you can buy 6-18 of that item for 200 coins each. On another note, good luck getting an actual response from support, because Kixeye support is pretty bad. The "responses" are moreorless copy/paste from the F&Q. So if you want to get that fleet that died thanks to a lag spike or a server outage on kixeye's end, chances are that you will not be riembursed.\nNew players are going to have a bad time at the current state of the game      I have seen many newbros get their fleets slaughtered thanks to the difference in technology between newbros, "semi-vets" and veterans. Each month, Kixieye launches events that often offers a unique ship hull that will probably never be offered until a year or two later. The ship hulls, weapons, and defenses that are researched are stepping stones at beast, and just plain garbage at worst. The problem? They had not been rebalanced since the game came out of beta (with the exception of a few). Back then, they dominated the game, in terms of PVE and PVP. Now? They are stupidly easy to destroy, if you have the most recent and state-of-the-art technology. So newbros are basically stuck with thise outdated technology. The only way to get better tech is to grind. Grind cargo fleets and hope to get some blueprint pieces that offer viable technology, or grind event fleets, which appeal to veterans rather than anything below. So unless you have a friend who is also a veteran at this game, you're going to have a real hard time aquiring the technology we veterans already have.\nI really do enjoy this game, but I can't recommend it to others, for the reasons stated above. Now I cannot stop you from spending money on this game, but please, consider it deeply before doing so.\n\nAs for newbros, feel free to contact me. I want to help newbros as much as I can, and adapt them to this rather.... hostile enviornment.\n\nThere. /endrant\nThere's my two cents right there. Hope that you now understand why people don't recommend this game.\n\nUPDATE: 3/15/2016\nAs the community might have known, Kixeye did yet another foolish descision and decided to add a patch dedicated to "rebalancing" every single ship class. But in reality, it's pretty much a few changes in numbers without actually thinking about the potential consequences. Sparing you a wall of text, instead, I will offer you the offical forum link.\nhttps://www.kixeye.com/forum/discussion/617760","December 15, 2015","false","407.8"," 237 of 285 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","237","285","10","4"

(got all but 2 achievements apon signing in)\n\nThis game is very much so pay to win. This game focuses on end-game content but Kixeye will make sure you pay somewhere along the way to get there.\n\nKixeye will not listen to your opinion and if they dont like what you say will just close your forum thread or ban you from the forums.\n\nKixeye holds events for new ships every month or so and let me tell you, they are always hard unless you already have end-game content. That means noobs, good luck with getting that slick new ship.\n\nThe community is so-so at best, a lot of people will have banged your mom. You will also have eaten a lot of... pen0rs. There are also players who will help you, but don't expect to much except for your allies and your own alliance.\n\nShip build times are really crap. You will find yourself spending a ton of days/weeks/months for one fleet of end-game ships.\n\nThe new crafting system is so crap you will spend months trying to upgrade entire fleets.\n\nSo if you like spending money and want to try to out coin your enemies and pound them into oblivion then this is your game.\n\nYou will need to invest a lot of time in this game to reach the end-game. Unless you pay to speed up your builds and upgrades.\n\nOh, and new players who see a really cool ship and want it, chances are you will never see it again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warstalker/recommended/339600/","warstalker","WarStalkeR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warstalker/","1221 products in account","This game is developed by Kixeye. A company known for milking players for money by implementing extreme pay-2-win measures in to gameplay, unreasonable banning of players (which spend thousands of dollars just for one of the games) and immense power creep in all of it's games. Some pay-2-win is even forced. Good example is post of the Kixeye CEO (Will Harbin): https://www.kixeye.com/forum/discussion/565500 (backup link, in case if original will be removed: http://i.imgur.com/1xgetsM.png) - even more expensive then any general MMO (most MMO cost $14.99/month).\n\nExtreme Pay-2-WinAt first their pay-2-win looks quite innocent. Kixeye say that the only thing they sell is time time acceleration, no premium ships or weapons - and it's truth, they only accelerate time for your $, but when it comes to prices... It's whole different story... Good example from another Kixeye's game Battle Pirates (Kixeye's pay-2-win is equally extreme in all). Time costs there 1 coin for half hour or 2 coins for 1 hour. For $100 pack you get 1,250 coins (1,000 + 25% bonus), seems a lot right? But when fully equipped ship takes 20 days to build and you need 5 of these ships in fleet, you need total of 100 days of time to wait. Or just pay 4,800 coins, which equal to almost $400. Also $400 still counts as "not that bad" - because there are fleets which cost $800 or even over $1000.\n\nImmense Power CreepIf such extreme pay-2-win was the only problem, it still would be manageable. But all Kixeye games are throughly infected by Power Creep. Yes, basically a fleet, which player bought for his $600 will be useless after 2 or 3 month... Because, Kixeye will release even more powerful ship/weapon, which will completely overshadow previous ones, by making them completely useless against new ones. And fully equipped of new ships will cost about $400~$1000. In addition, every in-game event Kixeye makes is focused mostly at players with high-end top equipment, which is only about 1% of all Kixeye playerbase. And such power creep repeats every month, sometimes even twice a month.\n\nUnreasonable BanningA lot of it. Even players that spent thousands of dollars for one of the games can be banned out of the blue, without any explanation whatever. And when contacting support they are sent to **** off via standard sentence "we have zero tolerance against cheaters/hackers" - while most victims (that contacted support) even haven't seen so called cheat/hack with their own eyes, while the actually reason can be whatever they want. Even somebody's negative review about their game. Good part that PayPal and Credit Card Companies are always ready to assist, when it comes to Kixeye. Just google for "Kixeye bans players" and you'll find a lot of interesting material.\n\nVery Sad ConclusionKixeye's games are interesting, ideas put in these games are great, graphics is good, but execution is horrible and greed corrupts all games they've made, which could be really amazing and enjoying, but instead are just tiresome and expensive (unless you don't buy in-game money from time to time). Dear reader, I'm suggesting you to pass by and play some other games, unless you don't mind throwing out a spare $1,000,000 in to the trash can.","December 14, 2015","false","344.8"," 78 of 100 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","78","100","5","0"

Your wallet has a big outcome on fleet fights, just prepared to spend hundreds and you WILL overpower any opponent!!!\n-It actually has an easy learning curve, but has advanced pvp / pve strategies as well, which most players don't even realize.\n-FANTASTIC game to troll in, and easy to make as many accounts as you need.\n-Very simple to grief other players and make them your ♥♥♥♥♥ and gang up on them with all your friends. Good game to bully people.\n-Now that crafting is introduced, hardcore grinding so you never get bored, if you like grinding!\n\nCons:\n\n- Big groups of obnoxious terrible (no skill) players frequently ruin the game for anyone they want just by coining (spending real money) on their fleets until they overpower their opponents. When you point out how terrible they are, they will usually say something like "it's a war game". Then when a real threat to them shows up, they will run away without putting up a fight at all.\n- If you don't spend money it will take you longer to complete events and get crafting items because you may need to wait for your ships to repair. Also as a new player you have about 3 months before you get a set of decent high level ships. However once you have a high tech fleet and pilot it well, you may not suffer so much repairs in PVE and will do better in events (just getting to that point takes at least 3 months though).\n- There is no good PVP ranking system. There is "medals" which is a worthless mechanic.\n- Because of the recently added crafting system, you must grind for months to bring your high-level fleet to it's full potential. The fully upgraded ships are insanely powerful and you have little chance vs. them. If not for this I would have recommended the game, but now it is too much of a grind.  However most players don't have these fully upgraded ships... yet, and mid level players and new players won't have them, so it is still fun.\n- Can be difficult for a solo player to do well but not impossible.\n- Absolutely horrible repetitive grinding, maybe the worst I have seen in any mmo\n- The alliance system is barebones... there are much better games to play with friends\n\n\nSummary:\n\n1. Fun troll/griefing game to embarass the people that spent their real money, but still suck.\n2. Good game if you love spending your money on imaginary spaceships, like trash talking, winning at any cost, bullying people that didnt spend as much $ as you, and endless grinding.\n3. Bad game for any casual player because of the people in category #1 and #2.\n\nI find reason #1 makes the game worthy of playing but cannot recommend the game to the average player.","December 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 49 of 69 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","49","69","5","0"

The idea of a free game did not draw me in, I am a coiner. I enjoy my time off and I will invest in my entertainment. Although, Like any Investment when I see signs of trouble I will no longer invest in it. I have watched Kixeye, the developer, take a fantastic game and over tweak it with updates. Not all of the updates have been bad, but most have. They present a free game to play and is you like farmville than this is the game for you. If you like FVF and the challenge of out manuevering your opponent, well I would recommend pulling out the O.G. Atari console and plug in Pong. Kixeye has dumbed this game so bad that it has ruined all skill. I would say that they did it for the players, allowing the new guys to have a fighting chance, reallistically though, it is about maximizing the amount of moeny that people spend to play. What I mean is that, when you get to become a high level player your ships will take a week to build, a fleet will take hours, not a couple, if you are lucky you can get away with 7 hours, if you know how to build them. Although, the recent updates will most likely change that, and that is for maybe 3 minute fight, that is all you will last with your fleet. I would say that if you practice, like I did, you could get 3 or 4 fights in with a single fleet, that takes flying skills though, If you are considering this game, move on, it is not worth it.

The early gameplay was unique and interesting, like the many new players who had a favourable impression of the game, i was drawn to the game by its explosive trailer and was immediately hooked for several months. However, as time passed, i got my first event reward and a maxed out base, i soon realised that this game was a complete disappointment.\n\nKixeye has monthly events which offers new equipments and these events are strongly pay to win. The enemies in the event are extremely difficult and not flexible, it require a specific fleet type and equipment to beat , if you lack such a fleet you probably have to miss the event trying to refit your ships or spent hundreds of dollars to instant refit so you can take part right alway.\n\nStrangely not playing the game is actually part of the gameplay, if you are using late-tier tech  which you probably have to use to win events and your fleet gets damaged or completely destroyed, it may require more than 6 hours or even a day just to repair it, you either wait for it to be repaired or you spent money to instant repair it so you can play the game.\n\nIn most games, mid lvl players get lower tier rewards and high level players get end tier rewards in events after a few hours of grinding, but not in vega conflict. In vega conflict you pretty much have to grind out more than 8 hours per day for 3 days just win some rewards below or of your current level.\n\nThere are also smaller events called "riots" which is supposed to be easier to help lower level players earn old event equipments to catch up with the high level players but it is a complete B*******. "riots" allow players to hit weaker targets to reach their goal unlike the monthly events BUT these weaker targets worth lesser points which meant you need spent almost the same amount of hours grinding as the normal events\n\nThis game has alot of bullies as well, the level restriction of potential invaders are removed  upon hitting level 35 and since it would cost many hours of repair time to hit a player of similar level, lvl 50 players would purposely and sadistically attack players many levels below them over and over all day every day just for fun. They will label you a "CAREBEAR" ,destroy your base and use a single fleet to kill all of your fleets that you send out to fight NPC fleets, rendering you unable to play at all.  In case you are new and do not know what "CAREBEAR" means, it meant a peaceful farmer (welcome to vega conflict! where playing a nice guy and not hitting other players is a crime. #F***LOGIC)\n\nKixeye does not interact with their playerbase as well, they do have a community manager on their forums who is pretty much powerless and is only used as a punching bag for players to whine and curse at. The recent event " warfront" had many players complaining about its difficulty on forums within 1 hours of its release and all kixeye did was to delete those topics on the forum. Kixye did tried to give a F*** however, they say that they have nerfed the event npc fleets, BUT they did not provide any other information like which fleets got nerfed or any numbers like how much damage or health was reduced, NONE....JUST AN EPIC ONE LINER\n"Due to player feedback, the warfront event fleets difficulty has been lowered."\nHowever that so called nerf was barely noticeable as many player still complained that their repairs times are still almost the same.\n\nsome players who are reading this review may call me a sore loser and a hater who likes to whine and B**** about at the forums but i do not really care anyway, i had an abusive relationship with this game, where i kept coming back no matter how many times it hurts me. now that i finally gave up on this pay to  win   play S*** , its my benefit.","December 15, 2015","false","0.8"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","29","44","2","1"

If you're a hard core PVP person, you definitely have lots to do.  If you're more of a loner who wants to farm ships, you can do that all day long as well.  There are millions of ways of configuring your ships and fleets so that no two fleets need to be the same.  The depths of ships, weapons, armor, etc is staggering.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about this game is that it takes forever to do things when you get to the upper levels.  Can only upgrade 1 building at a time, can only equip items on one building at a time, ships can take over a week to construct, etc.  It makes the game drag on at the upper levels.  But getting to those upper levels is a lot of fun.\n\nI've also seen a lot of Negative reviews saying you have to Pay To Win.  This is a bunch of BS.  I haven't paid real money for anything and have had no problems.  Sure, I can't complete with the people way above me but I'm not supposed to.  Farm resources, upgrade, buildings, repeat.  I've never had to sit and wait because I didn't have enough resources.  Rather I wait because I'm waiting for a building to get done upgrading.  Sure, you can pay lots of money to make things finish faster but that's true for any game of this stye (e.g. Clash of Clans, Game of War, etc).  Or, you can level up more slowing and learn as you go and not have to spend a dime.\n\nTry it out.

If you have patience, willpower, time to waste and Don't care about winning PVP, you don't have to spend real money to play.  It worked, looked good, sounds good, played good.  It is a PVP game with PVE resource gathering that you can grind, other players say it is Pay to Win.   Has Steam Achievements.  Try it, maybe you will like it.

Now it has become a space type of "Farm Ville" where they make you farm all day and night for items/techs that they will nerf them in a few months (as it has happened), so you just waste your time doing it. Not to mention the greatest scam made by kixeye, where they sold items for you to upgrade your ships and then just sort of reset the game (calling it "rebalancing" it), making you lose all you have invested in it. VEGA Conflict used to be  great game. NOT anymore.  I feel cheated and robbed by this company. I DO NOT recommend this game to my worst enemy.\nHere are some videos of what VEGA used to be and why I used to love it:\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrT0BkHbXFA\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppJWw2dNHLQ\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVX4Da-_vsc\nMy opinion... find another game.

But sometimes you love your wife even when she is getting fat or ugly lol because you still remember how hot she was... 50 years ago lol... read more below:\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nGame is very unbalanced at the moment, feels like work. A lot of events, where you can grind for days to get the tecnology (i am high end player and have to do that also :P), which is obsolete in most cases at the same very moment when you get it - or badly designed. If you really want to be free player, expect to invest thousands of hours to even get to some competitive level... If you are a coiner, dont expect 15.000 $$$ will make any noticable change lol... After they are spent, you will be no better than any of free players... Some of us are playing this game from the very start and have hundreds of ships and tech you will probably never have... xD Events changed in past 3 months. It was possible to complete the events before with minimum damage - or 0 damage. Kixeye changed that and made sure, our ships ALWAYS get damaged no matter what you do. Piloting skills mean very little now - examples: Their bombers have insane range.. before u even get close to the vega carriers, expect to get a lot of damage. Vega ships have LONGER range, are FASTER, are HARDER,... A lot of high end players are dropping out of game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the cheating stuff kixeye does. Because new players will lack the knowledge of us - long time players, you will have hard time to find blueprints, you will have hard time to do a daily mission, it will take months before you will be able to compete at the events, dont expect to win fvf or basing battles, expect to be killed over and over again where you will not be able to do anything to defend yourself.\n\nStill, overall it is a fun game, enjoyable to play... Only sad thing about this game is, I cannot leave it lol as i have put too much time and finances in it xD If only Kixeye would stop being so gredy and would listen to the community once for a change... Then the game would be superb in many ways... And if they stopped cheating us with SUPER POWERS lol...\n\nSHIPS/FLEETS/BASE:\n\nPRO - Customize your ships and base with lots of different shields, amors, specials, weapons.\nAGAINST - A lot of tech and ships get obsolete very fast as kixeye is changing and adding unbalanced stuff all the time.\nAGAINST - If you don't know how to make a proper setup you will end up with a fleet with over 30 hours repair time and you will have no use for it.\nAGAINST - It is only possible to repair one fleet at the time.\nAGAINST - it is only possible to EITHER build or refit a ship. Ships you will want to build will have over 10, up to 20 days build time...\nAGAINST - If you will play long enough you will have hundreds of ships with no real use. Kixeye has hard time to balance the game. At this point the only fleet that is worth having is Ragnarok Carrier with Zeal or Dread Battleships. Those kill most of the older ships without damage or minimum damage...\nAGAINST - game tends to be rock, paper, scissors game and COINS to win them all...\n\nPRO - Customize your base same way as you customize ships\nAGAINST - If you want to build a decent base, then it is only possible to build it with Technology you get from Events. You can never tell when you will be able to get that tech - if you will ever get it at all...","December 15, 2015","false","507.2"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","1"

But what you dont know till you're already inside, is that it is also massively Pay-to-Win.\n\nIn my time playing VEGA Conflict, (on browser before the steam release) there are 3 kinds of players; Coiners (spend real money, and LOTS of it), Scripters (cheaters/hackers), and those who actually play for free.\n\nThe PRO's of this game;\n\n1) Great visuals, especially since the steam release\n2) Gameplay is easy to learn but near impossible to master, meaning that there is always someone out there better than you.\n3) Each fvf (pvp fleet battles) is like a game of chess, make a wrong move, your ships go down quick.\n4) You are free to customise your ships/base however you want, with a plethora of weapons, armor, shields, and special equipment, and the battles that follow with these ships will be decided by your skill and your fleet's arms and armaments.\n\nCONS;\n1) Kixeye (the almighty developer) got greedy, or so allege the great majority of the players, and they keep proving us right with their schemes to get you to spend real money, which the coiners do, and they get WAY ahead of the free-to-play people, and abuse it. In other words, there is HEAVY imbalance of power in this game. In other words, the rich get ahead, and leave you in the dust.\n2) The monthly events that kixeye throws at us are getting increasingly hard for f2p players to keep up with, while the coiners simply dish out some money and intant-repair their fighting fleets and just rake up the event points, and get the event ship/weapons which are available for just those few days.\n3) The worst thing about this game is something that kixeye wont change, and that is the behaviour of the players. It can be the coiners gloating about the sheer advantage of power they possess over you, or it could be that they just derive pleasure from attacking you everyday, because maybe they feel they have something to prove. Who knows? I've seen too many people use just the most racist, offensive language at you, either because you are new, because you attacked them once, or whatever else. (They often start the fight in the first place).\n4) The politics. Kixeye introduced "Alliances" some months ago, and now if the player of one alliance steals resources of the other, a MAJOR dialogue is opened in the game chat between the leaders of both alliances over freaking 200k in resources.\n\nWhats that? Report them to Kixeye? lol you think that does anything? There were rumors floating around that kixeye un-banned cheaters because they started coining before they were banned, or something like that. Do I believe that? I dont know, its just a rumor. But who knows for sure...\n\nThis used to be a good game, and if you ask anyone who was playing before Carriers were introduced, most will agree. (not the coiners obviously. Well, maybe some of them...)\n\nPretty long review, I know, but seriously, unless you are super-rich, the playing field is ALMOST NEVER level or equal. There are dozens of games out there that deserve a download more than this game.","March 10","false","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Its not a 4X game so if that's what you're looking for you should look elsewhere.  In fact, the game need more time investment when you start rather than later.  The more you progress, the more time you require to build/repair/research things (this can go up to DAYS and probably WEEKS even further).  This exponential time needed to build/repair/research things reduce the progression to a crawl after a few weeks unless you pay real money.\n\nDoes it worth it to pay??  I'm not sure.  I haven't and still play it around 20 minutes day in order to keep my base, my ships, my economy and my researches growing (slowly).  If you wanna go F2P and you can live with that you will appreciate the game. However, if you wanna reach leader boards and be competitive, be prepared to invest a ton a cash.\n\nRecommended as a casual ''hobby'' to waste time.  If you really want to play a game in which things matter and you actually feels like achieving something, go for something else.","June 3","true","38.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But its very addictive! You get to blow ships and bases. Ths is not really a story line game where you have to do quests and reach an end to be triumphant. You gradually raise your base level, you aquire new tech and new ship (it may take a while though) and you can fight PVP and PVE.\n\nReviews say its a pay to win game, but win what? You win some fights you lose some and after that you repair. Repairs can sometimes take a long time, but you dont have to pay if you dont want to. When you are in an alliance, you just say "Sorry guys I am out of ships now, so cant fight anymore". Then you can log out or you can watch others fight (its a great way to learn how to pilot your fleets).\n\nThere is a great community in this game. You can ask questions to anyone about how to improve your fleets or base. There are some trolls, but its like that in any game. There are some alliances who enjoy trying to torment you, and again its like that in any game. You just have to decide your play style and enjoy the game.\n\nIn the end I love this game. Its very addictive and frustrating sometimes. As I said before you dont have to pay if you dont want to. As I see it its a long and enjoyable game and its free.","May 1","true","420.3"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","20","36","0","0"

How about\nPAY TO WIN\n\nI’ve been playing this game long before it came to steam, for over 2 years now, and from what it was, the game has gone from good to bad to downright horrible. The only reason I still play is due to playing for so long that to abandon my progress would be impossible\n\nThe developers are horrible - they only add things in that benefit them financially. They never listen to the community.\n\nThe events are near impossible for anyone who doesn’t have the absolute latest tech, unless you like grinding for days on end just to win.\n\nThe BUILD TIMES are what make this game pay to win. It's worse than Clash of clans. It takes roughly 1-2 weeks to build a single end-game ship, and you need at least 5 to make a decent fleet. Your options are:\n\n1.) Wait nearly 6 weeks MINIMUM for a single fleet of ships\nor\n2.) Pay over 100$ MINIMUM to instantly have that fleet\n\nWhen your fleet eventually dies, you still have to wait 12-36 hours just for them to repair, per fleet. You can't repair multiple fleets, so a person who doesn’t spend money in the game can get a few days of repair in the course of half an hour.\n\nThings is, its very easy to have someone destroy your fleet even with skill, because they recently added in ship crafting, which allows you to upgrade your ships. This makes it a “paper scissors rock” scenario, where fighting with the wrong fleet can lead to disaster, with 12 hours of repairs to you, and none to very little to your enemy.\n\nAnother small detail, THE GAME IS FULL OF CHEATERS.\nThere are many Chinese alliances (clans) that manage to use scripts to kill NPC fleets over and over again while they sleep, and Kixeye refuses to do anything about it because, as I said earlier, they only do things that benefit them financially.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nDO NOT GET THIS GAME unless you have hundreds of dollars to spend in a game where the highest bidder wins, or unless you are very very patient\n-------------------------\nAigan 猫Xion Gate猫\n53 products in account\n2 reviews\n\nNot Recommended\n226.5 hrs on record\nPosted: December 15, 2015\nOkay, first of all, I have been playing Vega Conflict for nearly 3 years now. 4 years, if you count the other games made by the same devs. I have never spent a dime on in-game assets; I learned, survived, and thrived. Even with that, it's still difficult to be competative in such a PVP orianted game without dumping some serious money into in-game assets. Here are my 2 cents on this review.\n\nI really love this game. Seriously. It's quite an exciting game. Simple at a glance, but underneath, it's actally very deep in terms of ships, tactics, and even politics. But can I recommend this game? No. Not anymore at least.\n\nWhy? Because of three major reasons that the developers never seem to learn from.\nPay to win\nIt does not matter if you're an absolute newbie that just got the game when it came out on steam, or an elite pilot who has been playing since the beta days 3-4 years ago, if you don't spend real life money on in-game assets (coins!), you're not going to have a great time, nor be very competative in PVP. Period. And I am not talking about casuals who invest 20-50 dollars a month. I am talking about investing around 100-1000 dollars. Need a ship or base module build or refitted now? Pay up. Don't have the coins? Too bad. Wait 2-16 days. Your fleet is down? Pay up now, and get back in the fight (and/or spam that same fleet, rinse and repeat until the enemy is down.). Or wait until that fleet is done repairing.\nIncompetent Devs\nThis is the biggest red flag in my opinion. Kixeye, the developers of Vega and other games, have quite a reputation (at least within their community) to make the same game killing actions on each and every one of their products. Especially over the course of the last 6 months, they have broken their promises again and again. Without shame. One such example is the black market. They explicitly stated that coins will not be involved in the black market. It will only involve a form of currency called Blood Amver, which is something that can only be earned by completeing daily missions. You actually got to play the game to earn Blood Amber, and buy cool tech. What happened? Well, around the start of November, Kixeye had the nerve to break their promise, and introduce coins into the black market. Want a good, effective item on the black market? Pay up 20 blood amber and you can only get one. OR you can buy 6-18 of that item for 200 coins each. On another note, good luck getting an actual response from support, because Kixeye support is pretty bad. The "responses" are moreorless copy/paste from the F&Q. So if you want to get that fleet that died thanks to a lag spike or a server outage on kixeye's end, chances are that you will not be riembursed.\nNew players are going to have a bad time at the current state of the game\nI have seen many newbros get their fleets slaughtered thanks to the difference in technology between newbros, "semi-vets" and veterans. Each month, Kixieye launches events that often offers a unique ship hull that will probably never be offered until a year or two later. The ship hulls, weapons, and defenses that are researched are stepping stones at beast, and just plain garbage at worst. The problem? They had not been rebalanced since the game came out of beta (with the exception of a few). Back then, they dominated the game, in terms of PVE and PVP. Now? They are stupidly easy to destroy, if you have the most recent and state-of-the-art technology. So newbros are basically stuck with thise outdated technology. The only way to get better tech is to grind. Grind cargo fleets and hope to get some blueprint pieces that offer viable technology, or grind event fleets, which appeal to veterans rather than anything below. So unless you have a friend who is also a veteran at this game, you're going to have a real hard time aquiring the technology we veterans already have.\n\nI really do enjoy this game, but I can't recommend it to others, for the reasons stated above. Now I cannot stop you from spending money on this game, but please, consider it deeply before doing so.\n\nAs for newbros, feel free to contact me. I want to help newbros as much as I can, and adapt them to this rather.... hostile enviornment.\n\nThere. /endrant\nThere's my two cents right there. Hope that you now understand why people don't recommend this game.\n\n","March 24","false","231.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Here are my 2 cents on this review.\n\nI really love this game. Seriously. It's quite an exciting game. Simple at a glance, but underneath, it's actally very deep in terms of ships, tactics, and even politics. But can I recommend this game? No. Not anymore at least.\n\nWhy? Because of three major reasons that the developers never seem to learn from.\nPay to win\nIt does not matter if you're an absolute newbie that just got the game when it came out on steam, or an elite pilot who has been playing since the beta days 3-4 years ago, if you don't spend real life money on in-game assets (coins!), you're not going to have a great time, nor be very competative in PVP. Period. And I am not talking about casuals who invest 20-50 dollars a month. I am talking about investing around 100-1000 dollars. Need a ship or base module build or refitted now? Pay up. Don't have the coins? Too bad. Wait 2-16 days. Your fleet is down? Pay up now, and get back in the fight (and/or spam that same fleet, rinse and repeat until the enemy is down.). Or wait until that fleet is done repairing.\nIncompetent Devs\nThis is the biggest red flag in my opinion. Kixeye, the developers of Vega and other games, have quite a reputation (at least within their community) to make the same game killing actions on each and every one of their products. Especially over the course of the last 6 months, they have broken their promises again and again. Without shame. One such example is the black market. They explicitly stated that coins will not be involved in the black market. It will only involve a form of currency called Blood Amver, which is something that can only be earned by completeing daily missions. You actually got to play the game to earn Blood Amber, and buy cool tech. What happened? Well, around the start of November, Kixeye had the nerve to break their promise, and introduce coins into the black market. Want a good, effective item on the black market? Pay up 20 blood amber and you can only get one. OR you can buy 6-18 of that item for 200 coins each. On another note, good luck getting an actual response from support, because Kixeye support is pretty bad. The "responses" are moreorless copy/paste from the F&Q. So if you want to get that fleet that died thanks to a lag spike or a server outage on kixeye's end, chances are that you will not be riembursed.\nNew players are going to have a bad time at the current state of the game\nI have seen many newbros get their fleets slaughtered thanks to the difference in technology between newbros, "semi-vets" and veterans. Each month, Kixieye launches events that often offers a unique ship hull that will probably never be offered until a year or two later. The ship hulls, weapons, and defenses that are researched are stepping stones at beast, and just plain garbage at worst. The problem? They had not been rebalanced since the game came out of beta (with the exception of a few). Back then, they dominated the game, in terms of PVE and PVP. Now? They are stupidly easy to destroy, if you have the most recent and state-of-the-art technology. So newbros are basically stuck with thise outdated technology. The only way to get better tech is to grind. Grind cargo fleets and hope to get some blueprint pieces that offer viable technology, or grind event fleets, which appeal to veterans rather than anything below. So unless you have a friend who is also a veteran at this game, you're going to have a real hard time aquiring the technology we veterans already have.\n\nI really do enjoy this game, but I can't recommend it to others, for the reasons stated above. Now I cannot stop you from spending money on this game, but please, consider it deeply before doing so.\n\nAs for newbros, feel free to contact me. I want to help newbros as much as I can, and adapt them to this rather.... hostile enviornment.\n\nThere. /endrant\nThere's my two cents right there. Hope that you now understand why people don't recommend this game.\n\n","March 24","false","231.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Its free to play and primarily not P2W as you cant buy items, you can only save time but  Oh boy oh boy, they really draw the times out and make you wait if you do not want to spend any real life cash on the game.\n\nin the higher lvls  (25+) its all a waiting game or spend money game literally. ( you get to level 25 in about 2 weaks)\nIf you get into a PVP battle and lose, prepare to wait hours before that fleet can fight again. or you can spend a couple $$ dollars worth of coin to repair that fleet and go again.  the stronger your fleet the longer you wait . .or the more you pay.\n\nAs you upgrade your base you open up new tech, you have to wait a week before being able to actually use it, or you can buy coin.\n\nIf you your fleet gets killed in PVP  then prepair to wait half a day to revive the it, or you can buy coin ( you only get 7 fleets -eventually)\n\nMost of the time your farming just to get new tech blue prints , just so you can "wait" 2-7 days while it researches , and after the research is complete you realize that you need something else for the blueprint to be usable so you research that too and wait another  2-hours to a week depending on level, or you can buy coin.\n\nI can go on and on, but my point is the game revolves around this mechanic.\n\nIf you have extreme patience and like base defense its a fun game though, although it leaves much to be desired in content as far as things to do while you wait.\n\n\nNow that you know all that I said above .. I still recommend this game even tho I give it a thumbs down, its fun as long as you know what you are getting into.","January 23","false","898.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It all changed in last update. How? well let me explain\n\nLets start with how it screws up new player. There is ability to repair for free 5 minute worth of repair, and new player could have spam it, thanks to which if he was active enaugh progression was kind of fast up to early mid levels. Now becouse of increased time of repair it takes much much longer, sometimes repair time increses from 6-7 minutes up to 30-40\n\nHow it screws up medium level players, becouse of improved repair speed i cannot repair my fleet in 20-30 minuts after hard battle, increasing time of repair to 1-2 houers! Makingi it simply not affordable to attack high level npc fleet that are main source of materials needed for base construction (there are base building that allow it but they do not give near enaugh of those. And since cost of new building increases dramaticly with few levels progression is much much slower\n\nand finaly, you could have thought, sure this game seams like pay to play and buy to play, if i spent a bit of cash then i can simply increase speed of game so those things will not bother me\n\nwell - no.\n\nTheere are coins that you can buy 1 coin = 3minutes of repair time or building time,  500 coins cost 5 euro. Seams to be resonable until relize that some buildings on lvl 6 (out of 10) take 4x24houers + few houers to improve. Making them cost about (if i am not misstakes) 2,2k of coins which would matter alot more if not for the fact that you will most likly spend those coins to repair fleet and be able to actually, you know play...","March 28","false","97.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Since then i spent over 500+ hours playing this game.\nThe game was pretty interesting and it was even possible to let AI take care of some battles if you had the right Fleet setup. When doing event you have to do 125,000 to 24 hits to aquire top event prize. This range is divided on 30+ different fleet difficulties you could hit. Imagine doing this manually in 4 days. Your life becomes this games if you play it. It was tidy work and only the oldest players could do an event with ease, having the best fleet setups. For new players like me it was precius to lessen the burden when you could do some of the battles in AI-mode with minimum repair time. After some decent tech upgrades you could even begin to aquire first prices but it was not easy work for low/mid players.\n\nJust recently Kixeye decided to change the game completely. This means that it got alot more difficult. All ships players now have and have investet thousands of hours into are worthless. And for new players and lo/mid players its not playable at the moment. KIXEYE didnt even get all the changes that are bound to happen in the last patch. So there is more negative changes for existing players coming. The baseline is KIXEYE has the nerve to render all players achivements worthless to change the game into something new. They hope they will be forgiven and hope they will earn more money in the longrund rather than the loss they expect to achieve after these changes.\n\nDo you want to play a game witch you cant trust the developers to not turn upside down in the future?\n\nThis reminds me of Diablo 3.

I have seen how this game evolved from an interesting and fun game into it current state.\n\nThe company, Kixeye, has recently "rebalanced" this game to make it more attractive to new players and hope to retain more players, which in fact has the opposite effect. Long time players are leaving in doves since the "rebalance", and the learning curve for new players are actually higher than before.\n\nThis "rebalance" basically killed one of the features of this game, which is the diversity of the ships that you can configure and fly. Kixeye, basically equalized all stats in according to class of ships and made massive changes to the other ships components. This has caused an uproar to the existing player base. Increasingly, Kixeye is expecting the current player base to purchase and utilize coins in order to advance or keep up with the changes. This is a blatant bait and switch tactics that has been utilized in alarming frequency in the recent months.\n\nI do not recommend new players to try this game at its current condition, although it is still free to play, but you will have to pay to win as the developers are desperate for your money. They do not listen to any of its customer based (which are those who purchased coins to be utilized within the game), and other games developed by this same developer are facing the same boycott from its player base as well.","March 16","false","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now for the review graphics are really nice good sounds and fast buiild times untilk you get to max level (7 days) for buildings at max rank and (14 days) for the biggest ship. now the biggest ship youll only build 5 in your entire time playing the game unles you like to hoard stuff but youll understand why later on when your in the game. now the bases are fun to build its not like clash of clans were people just rush you with barbarians or whatever and destroy you but you cant do that to there base for sokme reason. vega conflicts base building is very logic based. should i place a turret here no because its an easy target. should i bunch up my stuff, depends on what you wanjt your base to defend against. sniper fleets go buncgh up long range, rush fleets spread out and mid range. rim job fleet dont do anyhing and are for noobs. all arounf base have a mix spread out and bunchewd up with medium to long hard hitting weapons and multi type shields. id rate the game 9/10 fiew bugs and what not but you really are kept entertained with the weekly events that give you goodies to unlock. hope this review helped","January 13","true","5.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Over 3 years. When it first started wow what a breath of fresh air. That was back when it was in Flash and before you could even relocate. Everything was simple then. You researched ships and tech for your base and fought along side your friends against others. Blueprints were introduced and the first event came around. All good still. I still enjoyed playing and felt like the company really wanted the best for the players in balance with still making money off coins. I didn't coin and you could still enjoy the game very much without doing that. Met some great people online and things still were good. Around a year ago their best Community rep left and that's when things went down hill VERY fast. Kixeye started making promises and not following through with them. Things were ♥♥♥♥♥ing ninja nerfed and that started making people realize things were changing for the worse. Communication happened with less frequency from the company and then the switch to Unity said goodby to Flash for good.\n\nMore new blueprints and features came along (a lot of which the community never wanted) and tweaks to the stats of ships and combat modules started muddling what was once a simple game. Events and mini-events started happening more often and most of the time the prizes were less than spectacular. Mobile was introduced and then things really went down the drain. Kixeye started offering discounts on in-game money and giving crazy bonuses to coin bundles. Alliance features were added a bit before the mobile was but mobile was the start of the official end of this game as I had come to know it. Coin to win had officially taken over the game. I still stuck around because I had been in the game for a while and had most of the ships and tech and had good friends. Events started getting very difficult to do with the enemy dealing out huge damage to those grinding for prizes. Several of the events were so geared towards coining that I didn't even bother. Now "crafting" comes along. So begins the new grinding for parts that were tough to come across and would not drop when they were supposed to. People were getting upset. Answers to our questions were given a in a kind of blanket way and promises were thrown around some to never be fulfilled at all.\n\nFast forward to a handful of weeks ago and Kixeye informs us that there is going to be a "rebalancing." What that meant was that all the time we had been grinding for parts and making new upgraded ships, was soon to be rendered completely irrelevant. Every single ship was getting changed. Every. One. Shield energy was getting slashed and armor damage repair on heavy ships was about to go through the roof. Not only that, they said every ship class was getting their speed changed to match each ship in that class. So an easily researched ship was now the exact same speed as an event ship you had to grind for (in each class). Mass of items stayed the same but their energy/damage resistance went way down.  Many other similarly ridiculous changes are also to be introduced soon. The community erupted in mass disapproval of course. Overnight dozens of threads in the forums were posted and people were ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I've never seen so many thumbs down on the thread Kix released about the changes coming. It was easily 95% negative. So after that the founder of Kix did an online interview where he basically avoided all direct questions regarding how wrong this all was. The community managers haven't properly addressed this yet at all. Negative threads continue to show up dozens by the day and no proper response yet. Nearly everyone in the community hates this idea and doesn't want it. Free players and coiners alike. They don't care. They already released the first part of this "rebalance." Two more to come.\n\nDo not play this game. It looks great and had potential a few years ago but the company only cares about a flood of new money coming from mobile and has no desire to keep vetran players. They have ZERO long-term vision. They ignore the community as a whole and just do what they feel like. What started as a beautiful flower planted in fertile ground has since been dug up and replanted within a field of weeds where it's being suffocated to death. Avoid this company like the plague.","March 11","false","21.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've played this game for several years and it was a good game ONCE.  Now what the company does is they have events every week where you can get new technology and ships only to have them nerfed a few weeks down the road.  So if you spend any money on this game to help you get ships and technology it will be a waste of money because the abilities of the technology and ships will be nerfed shortly after.  Last week and this week the company has updated the game and took all the uniqueness away from ALL of the ships.  All ship types are the same speed and agility, the only difference is their mass.  So all the time and or money spent to receive elite ships was a total waste.  The company did these updates as a money grab plain and simple.  They nerfed the ships to guarantee that you will take some sort of damage some way or another, you might be able to avoid damage if you are an "End gamer" and have the tech and ships that can still squeeze out a win on an artificial intelegence gamer fleet, but will most likely take lost of damage against another player.  This way more people will spend money so they can play longer.  Money grabbing "pay to win" game.  Avoid this game, a lot of players have already quit, every sector in the game looks like a ghost town.","March 14","false","310.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The old model was basically that you could play completely free but could spend to make things go faster and/or if fighting a lot with enemies. After these changes, it is basically necessary to spend to do anything. The new kixeye philosophy is that any battle you engage in should result in damage to your ships, no matter if you are a great pilot or if your ship is much stronger than your opponent. Since getting the equipment to make good ships is done by hitting AI ships, this change in philosophy results in either a requirement to pay or extremely slow progress.\n\nThe company is also notorious for ignoring the complaints of its players. The changes have been almost unanimously denounced by players, however the company continues to ignore legitimate complaints.","March 14","false","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have a lvl 43 base and been playing for almost a year.\nThis game is Free to Play = Heavily Pay to Win = Pay to Play\n\nCons:\n\n-Huge Pay to Win mechanics.\n(People who spend real money on it, clearly have the advantage in this game. Instant repair opposed to 15 hours repair time of a single lvl 50+ fleet)\n\n-sub point microtransactions should NOT be game breaking\n(This is a MMO and its business model heavily supports players who spend real money into this game.)\n\n-Relies heavily on 3rd party messaging tools in order to supplement alliance infrastructure\n(my alliance uses LINE messenger, Discord and our own Homepage in order to coordinate things and we are one of the smaller alliances in the game)\n\n-sub point bare bones diplomacy options\n(as mentioned above the lack of an in game mailing system makes it hard or impossible to communicate with players from a different sector. Even personal messages are not allowed to a different sector. There is a workaround by using a second account but this is as i said a workaround implemtented by the gamers)\n\n-Outdated visuals\n-Buggy login function\n(if you have an existing Kixeye account, you have to start a new game through steam. Once you gain control over your base, you have to go to settings, account management and from there Link both accounts be careful to choose the right one since one will be overwritten)\n\n-No effort being made to counter balance the spending of money\n(meaning it is game breaking, even the introduction of the black market which was suppose to balance things out includes items which can be purchased with coins. At some point you were able to buy 6 resistor modules for coins but only 1 resistor module with blood amber)\n\n-Latest cheater controversy\n(players who have used scripts to very far into the game have been unbanned because they spend so much money on the game. a case had been posted in the forums where a player spend up to 9000 USD in a week on this game)\n\n-Events to win special prizes in form of blueprints\n(will be also a pro point so please don't get confused. The idea of events is great, but Vega Conflict events last for 3+ days. Which require you to grind for many hours at a time in order to get the main prize. The latest Warfront event introduced a 7th ship into a Vsec Remnants fleet. A regular fleet is limited by specific amount of mass and the amount of 6 ships you can have in it. The 7th ship was a carrier which with fighter squadrons, dealing guaranteed damage no matter what strategy you apply.)\n\n-Sub point event ships incoherent with available Vega Verse technology or mass restrictions\n(meaning that devs change values and give ships buffs to guarantee damage. They force players to spend money for repairs, instead of making events more challenging they are based on generating max profit)\n\n-Many sectors but not a connected universe\n(will be also a pro point. An alliance is locked to a certain sector for a week, but can jump to different sectors either on random jump, to an alli members location or a facebook & kix friend. This does not work for cross platform friends however so beware that all your alliance members sign up through one platform or create a profile which is then linked to a certain platform.)\n\n-Sub point relocation of members / whole alliance (our alliance had to jump loads of times since we ended up fighting big alliances using coins in order to repair their ships and send them out again. You can spend 1000 coins if you need to jump out before your 1 week timer cools down.)\n\n-The crafting option is broken\n(drop quality has improved but reports from many players state that they still receive drops they don't need)\n\n-Customer service from personal experience is good. But player posts of their experience is rather disturbing at times.\n\nPros:\n\n-Huge player community\n-You can create your own guild and form alliances with others (to some degree)\n-Real time fleet battle\n-Rotating events on a regular basis\n-Many sectors you can jump too\n-Crafting is available\n-Customer support responds fairly quick if problems occur\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt is fun as long as you manage to fight alliances on similar or slighty better tech level but the latest emergence of mega alliances like UA, IVC and others make it very hard to fight a single alliance.\n\nThis game could be a lot of fun but it is on a downward spiral of becoming unpleasant to play for players who do NOT want to spend real money into this game.\nI would instead recommend other upcoming titles like Massive Frontier, which is being developed by a long time player of Vega Conflict who got fed up with their business model or sign up for the Beyond Dark beta on BeyondDark.net","December 15, 2015","true","554.2"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

Various equipment, both researched and acquired through blueprints will help with that.\nAnd you have real fleet PvP, although only in 6vs6 max format. But it's very real and feeling cool. Seeing a couple of frigs destroy a full fleet of battleships for the first time would make you **** bricks.\nAlso base assaults are interesting. There is no impenetratable defence, but if you lack in skill, you'll have unpleasant moments assaulting clever enemies.\nAnd couple of words about the community. It's nice if you don't behave like a **** in your own sector. Don't attack, don't steal cargo unless it's marked "free" in chat.\n\nSo, to summarise.\nPros:\n1. Base construction and planning\n2. Ship customization\n3. Nice graphics and art\n4. Cool PvP\n5. Microtransactions are really not necessary to play\n6. If you are nice to community it'll be nice to you.\n\nCons\n1.

But kixeye doesn't for whatever reason chooses not to listen now the pass months their has been bugs popping up that make it tough to stay interested in the game, false promises have been made by the dev team, the new event coming out are stale either lots of old tech and ships or just re skin weapons with alittle tweek.\n\nAlot of people say its just a pay to win, i guess it can be i have killed alot of fleets from coiners so its hard to say but now its just to much to enjoy it.

Right after it switched to Unity, however I have a much longer lasting experience with the developer of the game. A bunch of money grabbing corporate posers who think that they can view the player base as walking wallets stuffed with cash and that they can keep stuffing us with new stuff that becomes obsolete by the time we get the "next big thing". For people who know the game Battle Pirates the name Kixeye will be well known and have a bad name. I must say I have not played this game for quite a bit now but I used to be one of the better players in the game when it came to driving.\n\nNow getting back to the very topic of the game, it used to be very fun, huge PvP battles between two different sectors were held on a daily basis. We got hit and hit back loads, for now the ships I have don't take a lot to build(trust me, 2 weeks per ship is NOT a lot of time when compared to 30+ days in Battle Pirates). Would I recommend this game? If some other company was doing it I'd recommend it without a doubt, right now I'm having my doubts but I might give it another chance(quit the game when I noticed it's becoming more and more of a money grab from Kixeye).

Run away from VEGA Conflict because it's a game which will empty your wallet, pockets, make you sell your clothes, your mobile devices, computers, jewelry and a house. You will eat the dust to save money just for a dream ship and then find out everybody uses it upgraded, which will cost you a lot more. And when you upgrade it you realize that the only ship that makes the difference between 'successful' player and 'low level noob, 0WN3D' is the Ragnarok Carrier which was available summer 2015 and has blown up the game balance to pieces.\n\nIf you are new, don't even try to play it. If you are old player, though, have no carrier, just leave the game. If you are old player with a carrier,  insert it up your ♥♥♥  pretend you are a honest, no-cheating player. That's all.

If you haven't got the money to invest in the games microtransactions to attempt to catch up to the higher levels then don't bother. Also don't bother talking or attempting at asking for advice...it will only for some reason enrage the vets further and make them camp your base and fleets. In a game designed to be MMO worthy...that will only discourage the majority of new players and also ruin the chance of building connections in game to keep those invested.\n\nMicrotransactions: This game has gone off the cliff when it comes to a money sink. The game in BETA had a decent amount of Pay to win but this has gotten ridiculous. It has gone into the Clash of Clans level of ♥♥♥♥ery.\n\nPVP is limited: only 6 v 6 combat and even then there are few choices when it comes to what weapons to use. Again unless you spend a godly amount of time you will be eventually forced to put money into the game to keep up with competition in your systems. Since they refuse to move and add more noob friendly systems putting you into the thick of it surrounded by higher levels only discourages play.\n\nLiterally saying durin the tutorial that no base can repel all attacks is a bit wrong. Especially on a game that relies so heavily on resources. Not giving the player the ability to more easily repel attacks of the same level player is a bit of a con if that was what it was reduced to. Player griefing is huge in this game, and would not recommend playing it. Let this game die like it should and play a MMO space game more worthy of your time like EVE or O game.\n\n\n","December 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I must say i did enjoy the game back then. They also had some very bad updates imo that i didn't agree with. I have played all of kixeye's games so its not that far off the others ones. Once you get to higher levels everyhing just becomes way too long to upgrade like a ridicules waiting simulater... Or you can pay all of your upgrades away, and get it over with.\n\n\nGreat concept. poorly executed with transactions to further reign on people who rather not spend money.\n\n","January 9","false","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

That is bullsh!t. This game is nowhere near P2W. There are things called "coins", they are basically a type of currency (that you have to pay $$$ for) that speeds up construction time, or use it to buy the remaining amount of resources you need to upgrade something. But you cannot buy anything past your current level, so yes you still need to do some work towards the thing you are trying to upgrade or build. Yes that does seem very P2W-ey, but if you play Clans of Clans and you dont think it is P2W... yet this is?

It was really fun when I 1st started, but Kixeye (developer) has ruined the game.  I now have a base and fleets at the Eltite levels, but to compete and enjoy the game at this level you have to coin a serious amout of money, and I am talking between $200 - $400 a month just to enjoy youorself.\n\nKixeye has only made updates saying they are for the player benfit, but in reality, and all players know this, it is for their coining revenues.\n\nI have witness some really good players that were really fun to play with leave due to the amout of money spent.\n\nAlso, Kixeye will deny this, but there are hacks that have allowed players to build fleets that would cost actual  US dollar - $2500 to build 1 fleet.  I hva seen this with my own eyes and watched a player coin 4 of the same fleets which is about $10,000.  Now, we all know no one in the right mind would spend that to make 4 duplicate fleets. And, on top of that the MK level of those fleets is impossible to have that make parts and pieces to build.\n\nKixeye is a bunch of arrogant money hungry developers that do not care about the player experience and have runined the playablity of this game.\n\nSo stay away from this game","April 17","false","274.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TalinPeacy/recommended/339600/","TalinPeacy","TalinPeacy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TalinPeacy/","97 products in account","Primarily a Mobile player, level 32 at time of review\n\nMMORTS, Far better than most MMORTS's, good base building mechanics, real time tactical ship battles, relatively high rate of customization to ships (stats and equipment only, appearance customizations are severly limited and are more a side effect of certain upgrades),decent variety of ships.  A great game to play on a variety of platforms.  Active development team.\n\nLevel 1 to 20: Relatively fast paced with a little effort, you won't, however, matter much in the grand scheme of things.  You're small and will likely only be accepted by recruiting factions and factions looking for people to click the "help" button and speed up wait times slightly.  It's a good learning period though, and you won't have much to worry about.\n\nLevel 20-30: The game starts slowing down about here as wait times start occuring more frequently and the ships you can possibly field start getting more expensive.  It's here that PvP becomes "a thing" and while you won't likely be much of a threat, people will try to pick fights with you occasionally.  This period of time is the "awkward puberty" stage of the game.  It's basically a very "tough love" learning period that lets you see if you really want to play this game.\n\nYou will need to play for long term goals that won't come to fruition for days, weeks, even possibly months depending on how active you are, the goals you have, and how much experimenting and "messing around" takes up your time.  It will be a bit grindy.  You will face hardship (as much as you can from a game that is) and it will take a bit of time to get through unless you pour literally hundreds if not thousands of dollars to speed through the waiting periods.\n\nLevel 30-34: Pre-high end PvP.  Anything level 35 and up is at the mercy of anything else above level 35.  There is no longer protection against anything higher then 5 levels attacking you at level 35.  As such, you will likely spend your time researching and upgrading your fleets and defenses until you believe you can handle being at level 35 and above.\n\nLevel 35-40: If you're smart, you won't call too much attention to yourself, either way, you're going to likely be a target more often as level 45-50 basing fleets try to steal the resources you have or even just try to scare you off so that you won't be competing for resources and parts.  by now you know the importance of farming vega fleets to upgrade your ships and you'll know that if everyone is farming, it becomes harder to farm at a solid rate, hence why people attack enemy farm fleets.  More resources and upgrades for them, less for the enemy.\n\nLevel 40-50: Typical PvP level.  I haven't reached this point so I don't know what to really tell you about how you're likely to be spending your time.  Most of what I see is farming in sector and warring for domination over other factions.  Events are much easier now and the real threat is rival players.  Supposedly wait times take weeks at this level unless you are willing to dump large amounts of money into instantly getting past them.  Time is now, by far, the measure of success in war.  It's constantly a struggle to ensure your enemy's fleets are out of commission for longer than your own.\n\nAt the time of this review, an update is officially announced that will change the entire way repair time and refit builds work.  This will rework several strategies and alter the way the game is played substantially.  In fact, the entire focus of the game will likely shift towards a much more agressive style of play due to repair times being completely based on the defensive values of the ship (outside of ship upgrades)\n\nAs of this moment, I recommend this game.  You can play it on your PC, then play it on your phone.  It's not perfect but it is worth spending the time to see if you like it.\n\n","February 23","true","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Yes AND No.\n-Extremely fun when you're a low level (first 10 hours)\n-Okay when you're a mid-level (next 20 hours)\n-When you're an end-gamer this game becomes more of a micro-transaction demanding game. (after 100+ hours)\n\nIts free to play~ but what they dont tell you is it's PAY TO WIN.\n\nHere's the breakdown;\n5 USD gets you 500 coins, 100 USD gets you 12,000 coins (2k bonus)\n1 coin cuts you down 3 minutes of repair time\n\nOne end-gamer fleet can go as much as 12-18 hours of repair PER fleet\nTherefore its literally paying 2.5 USD each time your fleet gets destroyed, or wait a staggering 15 hours average PER fleet, you have 7 fleets.\n\nTo build 1 of those end-game fleets, it will probably take you a month. (one ship builds from 5-12 days depending on what you're building)\n\n\nHowever if you're still making up your mind, then here's an actual live recorded footage by me caught in action between the top 20 alliances in this game just going at it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghwNRV_uTP0\n\nA lot do recognize me as CODE Aldnoah in game, because i'm one of the best pilots around that spends the least while getting the most results (9 fleet kills in a row)\n\n\n*Side note*\nClash of Clans is actually a clone of Backyard Monsters developed by Kixeye, which also happened to be the developer of this game. (Google it)\n\nSo I hope that clears things up, hope it helps :^)","January 29","true","568.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

And in my honest opinion It is one of the best free-to-play timer games out there. CoC may be more popular, but this game outshines that in every way, why? The piloting. Yes you can build a fleet and smash a person's base, but the fleet vs fleet combat is absolutely unparalleled.\nI've never before seen a more intuitive mix of strategy elements such as weapons range, weapons velocity, ship speed, firing arcs, move commands, ship health, and equipment customization.\nGames like Empire at War are wonderful, but this gives the satisfaction of giving you exceptional control of your ships unlike EaW, here you have to think about your weapons range compared to your enemy, instead of just clicking on your ship, clicking attack, and watching them fight. But the thing is with Vega, you can do that too if you want, or you can strategically outpilot your enemy. The choice is yours. Pick your battles wisely.\n\nNow on to the game's attributes as a ftp timer game.\n\n"Stuff takes too long!"YES you have to WAIT, is this bad? Only if you're impatient. Unlike other strategy games, things in Vega like your base and fleets take time to build, repair, refit, and upgrade, thus giving them value and forcing you to learn how to take care of them properly to avoid unnecesary waste of time. If you don't like this, then this game is not for you.\n\n"This is just a farming game!" LOL this one makes me laugh. First of all who doesn't want to blow spaceships up constantly? Secondly a grind is another part of the learning process. This isn't some cheap game, the fleet combat is very complex and difficut to master. Hitting fleets repeatedly helps reinforce valuable skills necessary to function in game and defend yourself against actual players.\n\n"This is just pay to win!" Well yes, you can pay for in-game currency that speeds up the in game timers. I believe 1 coin cost's about 1 cent and counts for 2 minutes of time past the 5 minute free threshold. My tip should you want to spend coins, first buy the coin module, then don't waste coins by instant building entire ships, research and base upgrades, use it for ship and base repair only. Second dealing with coining players is no different than others. They only get to complete things faster. No matter how much they spend they won't gain any real skill. I've seen Chinese players who started very recently and are my level due to coining, and they had absolutely terrible fleet builds and base setups because they had no idea how to play the game. Also this game would not exist if it didn't have funding so I can't exactly bash coiners too negatively.\n\nSome other final words. If you find the game atmosphere too caustic, because people won't leave you alone, remember this.\nThis is a war game, people don't have to have a reason to attack you so don't actually give them a good reason to. this means, don't complain in chat "Hey why are you hitting me, I was just getting cargo?!" "Go pick on someone else your own size!" These would be the things to avoid saying as they just invite more unwanted attention. If things are really too hot to handle you can always relocate to another sector and lay low. During my mid levels of about 20-30 I just stayed quiet and slowly built myself up more. If that's not your style join a clan that likes to fight and cause trouble. But most importantly......\n\nIf you relish in the strategic victory and want to destroy those that challenge you in a cold and calcualting way. Then you can do that. If you prefer brute force at any cost, you can do that. If you love causing other players trouble and making them fight you out of rage, you can (just don't harass anybody). Play the game your way and just HAVE FUN.","December 30, 2015","true","472.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Everything in the game is real life time based you have to take time to build your base/ships, repair your ships, equip your ships with stuff, equip your base modules, etc. You will also do a lot of farming for everything in the game.

If you put time into this, you will probably put more money into this than a season pass game. This game does not forgive mistakes, and it's sole goal is the long haul. It has a community of those who care far too much for the game, as demonstrated by the sudden increase of shitposts. But enough of that, here are the facts.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n--It's going to take about a year to get up to end gamer level at the most basic level.\n--Most tech is based on weekly to bi weekly events, you won't be touching those for a while.\n--You need to make allies, or learn how to play quickly if you want to catch up within a reasonable period of time.\n--Building fleets and bases are an art unto itself. It takes time, the further you progress this turns from days to weeks.\n--All progress moves forward unless the player itself deletes it.\n--There are protections for new players, but also disadvanages.\n--If you play this game, after a certain point, your weekends may be forfit until you invest in higher end equipment.\n--You will have a significant learning curve and disadvantage until you recieve event tech.\n--The game core dynamics have recently changed, you will have an edge if you can find a way to adapt.\n--The community can be toxic as all hell, but they love the game.\n--Like fight club there are 2 rules. The first is that there are no rules, and second is that you do not ask about the rules.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIn short it's a fun game I've sunk plenty of time into, but it is going to be difficult for a newcomer to put their time into. It's not to say that there is a significant learning curve, but it is stacked against you in comparision to much easier MMOs.\nRegardless, best of luck in the void rebels.","March 16","true","308.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It has been about 2 weeks now since I started. The ships are many, even if the graphics aren't amazing 3D. But what I enjoy about this is the strategy, building fleets and other elements.\n\nJust realized you can group ships in your fleet. So that helps in creating a strategy in taking down an enemy player's base. When it comes to ships, its important to learn what best ships can do what. I usually set up fleets for specific roles.\n\nLike space, there are multiple planets that revolve around their stars as well as systems and sectors, so you can really go out to battle across sector and planetary space! See a player traveling through space? Attack it :)\n\nThere are micro transactions but even those don't really help you much since upgrading things once you are about level 18 take a lot more "gold" to instantly upgrade. So my take on this is to upgrade and just go on to raid lower lvl AI fleets.\n\nEverything is in real-time so you may be battling a fleet here but another player is attacking your unguarded base.","January 23","true","34.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It might look like your standard base builder game where you upgrade you modules and build armies. But Vega Conflict lets you control and costumize every unit (ship) to counter the strategy of others. Instead of a cruiser vs cruiser ending in a draw, the cruiser with the better fit can still lose if the other cruiser is controlled better.\n\nThe game has a very interesting blueprint mechanic that lets you get rare modules and ships from the AI controlled ships you attack. And the pvp has some very cool depth that really relies on strategy and skill.\n\nUnfortunately the game still has pay to win in the form of coins that lets you instantly complete something, but the fun is that you can actually punish people for it by attack them :D","December 18, 2015","true","129.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Lots of people get frustrated and end up paying for those microstransactions, but I like to take my time and actually play the dang game. Now, let's get into pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Has a lot of potential starting from the app (which I owned prior to this) and so this would probably get a lot of popularity from the people who already have the game. This means more players which means more fun.\n-It is a long game, meaning it doesn't take you only about 5 hours to complete the game. This actually takes a long time to even start getting close to the end, and even when you do make it to the end, that doesn't mea the fun is over.\n-Super addicting! I haven't paid any microstransations for either version of the game yet (App and Pc) which makes it more interesting.\n-This is a new conscept. I don't know any other games that have similar ideas such as this one. Having being able to use several fleets at once is super awesome and I love that about this game. A lot of this game has originality, most of the designs are original and complex, which shows how much work the devs put into the game.\n-It really gets you in the moment. A lot of games like clash of clans these days (im gonna be using coc as a referrence point for the rest of this review seeing as just about everyone knows about it) never actually make you play the game. It's just 10 minutes of attacking, collecting resources, and yada yada yada. After 10 minutes is over, you either stop playing the game or repeat the same thing tomorrow. This game isn't like that. A lot of people actually play this game for some periods of time like me and we actually do stuff to progress, instead of waiting 12 hours for an elxir collecter to fill up (coc referrence). Instead of mostly depending on my miners to mine out the asteroids, this game actually lets me use my fleets for other things other than attacking bases, which is one of the main pros about this game. That gives me a lot of time to go attack some cargo and actually gain resources and keep progressing even when I'm not offline.\n\n\n\nCons:\n-Super long waiting times, kinda like Clash of clans. If you've played clash of clans, you know how long it would take you to upgrade, for example, a lvl 9 cannon to lvl 10. Just like clash of clans, you start getting multi-hour long wait times very early in the game, which I noticed very quickly as I played the game more and more.\n-It's extremely frustrating when searching for cargo. One day, you get your lvl 15 (or something near lvl 15) fleet and go find some cargo. But, what do you see? Oh, yeah, 10 ROWS OF LVL 17, LVL 25, AND HIGHER just slowly heading towards the VEGA outpost. There are soo many cargo ships for higher lvl players which makes it harder to progress in the beginning. Now, this is not a *big* problem, but for me it's really frustrating.\n\nNow, those are my pros and cons. Remember it's just my opinion. I would highly reccommend this game if you enjoy sci fi, fighting, and space base building. These are one of the few times I make reviews, but when I do, I make it for a game I really like, and so this is one of the games I chose. :D","January 8","true","22.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I would not recomend playing this game too much a day but it is definantly one of those games to play for about 15 minutes a day.  There are events all the time and the developers are always realeasing new content, much more so than other games of this type.  My main draw to this game is how easy it is to make and maintain friends.  Aswell as this you can also view the chat and if you decide, oh I dont know maybe you disagree with his opinion on penguins, you can easily click his name and send fleets over to his base (or even his fleets) and lay siege on it! Just because you can!  Overall its a fun game to play a little bit every day with new content coming all the time.  I would recomend this game to any who enjoy coordinating wars with friends and dealing with complicated in game politics and creating treaties.  If your on the fence weather or not to try it, just go for it.  It is free to play after all and you have nothing to lose.  I hope you like it.  -Molten","December 15, 2015","true","29.7"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

They need money somehow.\n\nThe standard for F2P games is to limit expansion by time, and then they let you buy out of that time by spending money. Vega is no different.  It's not pay to win, but it's definitely play more if you pay.\n\nDevelopment of buildings, tech, ships, etc all start out quick but eventally take days.  Your first few weeks you won't even notice the time restrictions.  Buildings and tech only takes a few minutes.  Cheaper, smaller, ships repair instantly for free.\n\nBut as you progress, you'll find that one tech can take a week to research, but before you start you need to spend 5 days upgrading a building, and then after you're done researching you'll spend five days building the ship you just researched.    Oh, and you need six of those ships to build a useful fleet.\n\nAll of which can be avoided if you spend money, of course.  But it's not pay to win, it's just a quicker experience if you pay.  Everybody, coiners and not, are playing the same game.\n\nIf you do play, search on youtube for strategies, read the in game chat, and if you value your ships don't steal resources.","December 18, 2015","true","906.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I was big fan of RTS games before becoming a predominantly console gamer.  I tried a few mobile games (Boom Beach, Clash of Clans, etc) but found there was nothing "Real-time" about it.  Enter Vega Conflict, a game which I originally found on my phone.  I took a liking to this game due to the fact that the combat was in actual real-time, not like other games where you can only choose where to attack (and possibly redirect them slightly).  There is a lot of depth to the combat in this game, with many different ship classes, weapons, shields, and upgrades to choose from to customize your fleet.  Fleet size is limited, which I feel helps with fleet diversity and forces players to fly their ships with some skill, rather than the smash my army against your army mechanics that many RTS devolve into.  The game features monthly events that provide new technology and ship types if you are able to kill a large number of computer enemy fleets.  This game is also a social experience, as I'm sure most MMO-esque are. With all of that said, no game is perfect, and this one has some flaws.\n\nThis is a free-to-play game that leans on timers; that is, you can either use your purchased "coins" to speed up processes (building ships, repairing ships, building your base, etc) or wait out those processess out for free.  This can create some instances where you are facing an opponent who will spend his real-world money to continually repair his ships to attack and defeat you, regardless of your respective skill levels.  The monthly events are geared toward high-end players who have been playing the game for a long time; as a newer to mid-level player, there isn't very much for you to do during these.\n\nOverall, my experience with this game has been more good than bad and I recommend RTS fans give it a try.","December 15, 2015","true","870.1"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

It takes a lot of time to build anything or get a higher level. Play it casually, in-between your other games. So far, it's kept most of my interest constantly for 4 months now, and i spend more time on it than anyother games, albeit afk at times. I haven't spent a dime on this game and you have to get used to getting beaten on and outclassed by anyone that pays money. But I have thought about it, because the deals have looked pretty good.\nThe ships are diverse and the weapons and additional modules are all quite different and quite interesting. For instance, the energy weapons are short range; they always hit, the missles are explosive with medium range, and the projectiles are long range but slow. All types of ships include: the  all-around cruisers, the weapon loaded battleships, the evasive harriers, the pursuiting cutters, and the sniping destroyers.\n\nOverall, not the best but a good game. You can quit anytime but I'm pretty sure it'll have a hold on you for awhiile.","March 10","true","142.0"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","2"

This brings me to the fact that you can play this game on mobile, as well as on PC, which is in my opinion a nice touch.\n\nVega Conflict is a free to play, MMO space sim with RTS elements and base management. It's gameplay consists of building a base that will withstand any assaults from enemy fleets, as well as building up your own fleets to attack other players bases. You gain resources by attacking other people’s bases, attacking NPC cargo or military fleets, or through stealing cargo from other players' recently defeated NPC fleets.\n\nBase upgrades, research for new weapons, and building new ships take real time. At first, as it is with all F2P games, the wait is quick, and is softened even further by the fact that you can skip the build/research time of any process that is under 5 minutes. Your base expands quickly, as all of the build times are under 5 minutes and you can complete many upgrades in the first few hours of play instantly, with no wait at all. However, over time, the average wait time starts to increase, and eventually reaches the point where at a base level of 25, you are waiting multiple days for a building to upgrade. Due to the fact that there are multiple buildings to upgrade, each of which have multiple levels, all of which take 2 days or more to upgrade, it can get very tedious very quickly as you can only upgrade one building at a time.\n\nMicro transactions are present, however you can get almost anything present in the game for free, over a very long amount of time. For example, if you want to speed up the researching of a new technology, the building of a ship, or the refitting of a building with new weapons and armor, you can either wait the allotted amount of time, or you can pay for premium currency and skip the wait.\n\nOverall, it's a fun experience. If you get involved with the "alliance" feature, it can build a sense of community within a game that would otherwise have none. However, I can see that as the wait times increase, I will become less and less tolerant, making it a game for which I can see the end of its relevance approaching very quickly.\n\nGive it a try, but know that it’s a free to play, and get ready to wait.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThey have updated the game and increased the afformentioned wait times by around 6 times the original ammounts.\n\nI am changing my review from positive to negative untill they fix the problems that they have created in their latest update.\n\nPlease do not spend any money on this game untill the update is either rolled back or fixed in some way.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nChanged back to positive, seeing that there are workarounds to the increased wait times.","February 18","true","240.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
