Except the controls are terrible (and never explained, you have to figure them out), there are no options to change settings/key bindings/etc, and there is no multiplayer. Not to say it isn't entertaining: the challenge of battling the game's poor controls to try and get a good time is kinda fun. If you think $2 is worth an hour or so in a cheap racing game doing time trials, go for it. Otherwise, forget about Nulldrifters.","December 16, 2015","false","6.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","1"

Gameplay is a bit lacking as there's not really too much depth to it, but for the price it's worth giving a go.","December 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

The game is awesome, no questions, hands down awesome. It looks awesome and the levels are well done, the music is great and it has a sweet feel over all. I definitely recomend it for the price.\n\nHowever, this game needs a darn MENU! I get that its only $2 but do we really have to play it in a little box on the screen? I want to be emersed in the game play, I want to adjust the resolution and graphics and volume and the CONTROLLER setup. Why on earth doesn't this support controllers? If they added a menue where we could adjust things, and if they added a freeplay mode (instead of a 3 lap time trial) it would be perfect. I would have paied $5 happily if they just made those changes. The thing is the levels are quite hard to master, you move very fast and if you want to win without crashing into every single wall you really need to practice (like everything in life) but its difficult when you can't freely drive the tracs. I want to sit and drive the same track over and over and over again, beating my own times without having to reset the level every three laps.\n\nIts seriously an excelent game but I'm finding it hard to play more than a handfull of races with so much missing","January 7","true","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The controls are great, the graphics are good looking and most of the tracks are pretty well designed. It's pretty fun too, it just feels a little bit unfinished. Oh, and it's pretty cheap.\n\nYes, there are much better games at Steam, but this doesn't mean this game isn't worth getting.","December 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
