The devs of the game haven’t made the point of this game clear enough, rounding up many negative reviews from the users who may not understand or appreciate the hidden humour within.\n\nThe theme of Fowl Space is peculiar, though it feel somewhat original and refreshing. A light background which contrasts with the dark foreground, is different and not common within the world of gaming. The story has you controlling a Rooster, a milk-gun wielding, coffee drinking, Rooster. The story is hard to follow which loses many players, sending them into a negative-review rage.\n\nThe gameplay has you mainly fighting little to large Vikings. It has some Platformer potential, proving somewhat fun for short bursts of play. A problem users had were it felt like you were walking on ice. The game is supposedly set out of space, where the gravity isn’t as apparent.\n\nAnother enjoyable feature, which I personally enjoyed, was the ability to collect hats and masks throughout the story. The ability to collect a power-up which grants you three killer whales, knocking all enemies and killing them.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of Fowl Space is it is full of sexual innuendos and a parody of popular culture, turning it into an interesting parody. Though the game is very simplistic, not having much going for it. Long play becomes very repetitive, and players who do not understand the referencing going on, find it utter rubbish.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPositives:☆Unique.\n☆Interesting artstyle.\n☆Full of sexual innuendos.\n\nNegatives:☆Story hard to follow.\n☆Very simplistic.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSummary:Overall, the game was enjoyable, simplistic and in my opinion, the negative reviews were unneeded. The whole point of the game is the bad puns, the horrible memes. If they took a bit more time to informatively conduct a proper review, the site states a “crazy experience you will never forget… to say the least”. This game was meant to be “bad” in a way. The game is simplistic, and I’m not saying it was wonderfully addicting, though every game needs a chance.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════Find this review helpful?

It is this comedy that makes Fowl Space an enjoyable game. However if you drop the jokes you're left with a very short and simplistic platform game. If you're not amused by the idea of a ♥♥♥♥ shooting a dubious white substance in the face of a viking, you better leave Fowl Space alone.","February 18, 2014","true","6.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devpo/recommended/109500/","devpo","Dev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devpo/","28 products in account","was looking for chicken-themed games but decided to stay away from this one due to the mixed reviews, until it went on 90% off sale.\n\nI don't think it's nearly as bad as most reviews make it out to be, though it's still not the best. I honestly find the platforming to be the most fun part of the game and don't have any issues with "slipping", but the added mouse-aim style shooting gets tedious and a little annoying. It's a game you'll probably only want to play in short bursts because it is repetitive and short, although the silhouette art style is striking at first it also becomes repetitive after the first level and I would have liked there to be more variance in lighting styles. As it is, Fowl Space seems more like a flash game on kongregate than something you'd ever pay 5 buck-bucks for.\n\nOverall: recommend when it's $0.50, NOT worth full price\nwe need more good chicken games :(","June 19, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Not sure why... but I think the Steam Gods like to tempt me into buying things because, well, you know, it's cheap. It's actually pretty odd as games go. You're a space chicken trying to do something or other, who drinks coffee, combats space Vikings and collects hats.\n\nDon't make the mistake of taking this game seriously. It's a parody of popular culture. With meme, film, music and game references this game is a nod to internet culture. The game did cause me one or two internal laughs. The whole point is to feel 'in on the joke' as it were.\n\nAlthough I don't think it's fitting of its' £3.99 price tag. The controls de-sync sometimes, the game is nonsense to those who don't know what it’s referencing and it's rather unpolished. Controller support, better controls and support of different resolutions would add to the over-all quality of the game.\n\nI did, however, enjoy the game despites its' flaws. There is some minor re-playability if you want to collect all of the hats and do all of the challenges.\n\n4/10. Amusing but flawed. If you like internet culture, and fancy a giggle, pick it up in a sale. Don’t expect serious, or well-polished, game play. Enjoyable none the less.","January 10, 2014","true","1.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You know you're doing something wrong when every level feels like the ICE LEVEL!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/109500/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","Boring, and I could find something similiar for free on a flash games website.\n\nFrom the short 11 minutes I spent playing this game, I didn't enjoy it. Obviously.\n\nThe mechanics were clunky, everything felt like it was in slow-mo. This weird goo-spitting gun on your back you use to attack enemies with a chance for blind them and have them run around confused and blind. You can also charge up the gun to do a shotgun blast. The amount of pellets depends on how long you hold the attack button.\n\nThe goo-gun isn't fun, it doesn't have any kind of impact. You just click, some goo spits out, possibly hits enemy, apparently they take damage and after consecutive goo-shots they die. Great.\n\nThe game's level design is boring and there's a shape-shifting background that will probably give players a feeling of motion sickness because it's always shifting and fluctuating 2 different colors that change based on events happening in the game.\n\nI got this game intially because it seemed crude, quirky, and fun. Also because the banner "FOWL SPACE" with that cool-looking colored chicken next to it looked pretty rad. Though I felt a little silly after noticing everythings black and white on the foreground, then grey in the middle-background. Then the actual background is two random colors. So visually the game isn't appeasing to look at, at least. They didn't do anything artistically interesting with the colors. The idle animations on the vikings look pretty nice, but everything is blown up and blurry and fuzzy. Clearly wasn't made for full screen. the second you window the game it shrinks down significantly and then you can see how the actual and only resolution for the game is.\n\nThere's random collectables in the game, like you can collect mens and womens underwear and bra's? For some reason..\nAnd you can collect hats, which. I guess the hat collecting isn't that awful, at least it's something you can look for and switch up your appearance a little.\n\nI think it's kind of funny how there's a speedrun timer in the game, cause yes. Someone's going to run your buggy, slow-mo game with enemies that do too much damage (roughly 4-5 hits and you're dead, the vikings do some pretty spammy moves that can come cross as cheap as the game moves too slowly and they move significantly faster than everything when doing their spin attacks. Which since your running speed is ♥♥♥, jumping's the only option and since the attack is pretty anti-air. ...you get the idea.)\n\nI don't know, I guess I expected a fun, quirky, fast-paced and short game. Turns out the game was in-fact short. Because I stopped playing it pretty quickly, ending the game immediately.\n\nAlso the music is boring and bland and runs on a pretty glaringly obvious loop that just adds to the overall dullness of the game.\n\n\nRegardless, this game isn't fun, I bought it on a really cheap price and it wasn't worth it. There's much better games out there for you to play, like you know all of those free to play games on steam? Play those! Wicked fun! and FREE!\n\nHell, flash games are fun too. Here's one of my favorite flash games to-date.[www.kongregate.com]\n\nBada boom, you have a flash game, fowl space is a failure of a game. And it costs money. And that game I hyperlinked is a successful flash game and is a fun platformer, it's a touch buggy and a touch slow. Still a good time and still will kill a few hours and you'll feel kind of cozy and nice once you beat it. So now that you played a nice flash game, DON'T BUY this BAD flash game! Yay!\n\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my review, hope this helped in your decision in whether or not you want to buy this game. Have a good one.","January 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In Fowl Space you play as a chicken who goes to a Sun station to destroy it. But is it good ? The game has to be one of the worst platformers on Earth. The game has a terrible platforming segments that barely work and one of the shortest games on the planet clocking in around an 1 hour of entertainment if you can call it that. The game is played like a 2D side scroller with some shooting mechanics attached to it. The game is so easy you can finish it in around an hour. The game is riddled with bugs that make some segments hard to beat. If you liked the game in the first place theres some challenges rooms to play but theyre so boring it will make you want to shoot yourself in the head.  The game has a painfully dull soundtrack that will make youre ears bleed. Graphiclly the game looks like nothing special all of it is black presented on a coulour background the platforms and where you can go mix with the enviroments and it becomes difficult to navigate. Overall this game is amazingly bad and how did they mess it up is beyond me. Bad music, mediocre graphics, and bad gameplay overall this game is a game that you should pick up if you like bad games but to everyone else STAY AWAY i give Fowl Space a 2.5/10","February 9, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It is really fun even just to spam it all over the place (God that must sound awful).\n\nAny I really enjoyed it, it’s very funny. The boss fight was good. It has nuclear bomb riding vikings (Dr. Strangelove style).\n\nOn steam the full price is $5 and is probably worth it (I can’t say for sure because I didn’t play that much). At the moment it is 90% percent off and only $0.50. Was definitely worth getting at that price.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","June 27, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
