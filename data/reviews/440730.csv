You can see more in pretty much any demo of any game ever made. Thumbs down until there is some form of actual gameplay. I don't recommend tech demos.\n\nThe videos are a pretty accurate depiction of what you get with this game. In fact thats ALL you get with this game. They have shown EVERYTHING in the game,  the only difference is you don't start with an axe or a flamethrower. According to the developer these can be found in crates (I didn't find any).\n\nMultiplayer consists of one server with a building and some boxes. No players or zombies and no terrain at all.\n\nSingle player is a small underground bunker with a few "zombies" that kill you IN ONE HIT. You don't have a weapon so no gameplay there unless you consider running from zombies until you get cornered in a 3 bedroom bunker gameplay (or you manage to find a weapon). Well hey, it worked for Pac-Man.\n\nYou can exit the bunker but you end up in an unpopulated terrain with a couple of buildings and nothing else (although I hear there might be animals around).\n\nThe interface and ui is more complete than most early access games. Keymapping works and you can turn off the music.\n\nThere is some potential but when developers release things like this so early I have nagging doubts, although to be fair the developer did respond to this review and posted a patch to the game so those are good signs.","April 22","false","0.3"," 50 of 55 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","50","55","0","5"

First of all, the framerate is horrible! I can't even turn with my state of the art graphics card without seeing the mountains phase into existence! Second of all, the mouse sensitivity is OUTRAGEOUS!!! How am I to shoot a man if a mere flick of the mous esends it spinning like cattle sucked into the funnelof a tornado???!!! Third of all, there are holes in this map! This really grinded my gears the most!!! I HATE holes!!! When I pruchase a game with my weekly Subway $5 footlong money, I expect it to be patched!!! That is to say, I expect ALL holes to be patched!!! Fourth of all, the mutants aren't even that scary!!! I've played horror games on Newgrounds and I have to say, some of those developers are underrated!!! Especially when compared to this developer!!! One shot and mutant dead??? RIDICULOUS!!! How does the human race not stand a chance against such a weak species??? Riddle me that, wise guy!!!\n\nIn conclusion, I will be refunding Down to One, since the multiplayer doesn't even work!!! Nor does the soccer mini game!!! Down to One is a disappointment, and I suggest all partons who wish to experience a true survival horror experience that will be the ultimate experience that you have ever experienced in your days, please do not purchase Down to One. It is a fluke and a scam!!!\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nHubert J. Gameston Jr.\n\nP.S. I am OUTRAGED that you put mutants in a SURVIVAL game!!! It ruins the immersion! Put in wolves and bears to fight first!!! it is unrealistic that mutants would be able to survive in the desert without nourishment for so long!!! If you're going to leave them in, please at least put some food in the map so that they won't go hungry. It makes more sense that way!!! You can have that one for free, but please credit me for it. If you're interested in utilizing this suggestion, please email me at gamestonkid@hotmail.com\n\nThank you.","May 29","false","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its early access so i think it will get better. Yeah it has some bugs now but i hope that it will be no problem by the time the game is fully released. The graphics are very good for a 5 dollar game...even for an much expensiver game. I played the 1st chapter so far and had much fun..... however the 1st boss isnt that hard :)","May 17","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

But now again, I am writing a review again, because since then, this game had made great progress. The game has much more features now, such as new weapons, and new maps. The weapons, are flamethrowers, sniper Kalashnikovs, and many more. This is a very fun game, but still in Early Access, so do not expect a finished game yet. But just yet, because as I said earlier, this game is getting good progress, and the developers are very active. I think they deserve a positive rating, because not many developers are so active, and they are working really hard on their games, which is a very nice thing.\n(Extra info for the haters: I did not get payed to write a positive review, like people thought I did last time. I am not the developer of this game. I am a friend of the developer, but that doesn't change my review. My review is 100% hones all the time. Thank you for reading.)","May 17","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
