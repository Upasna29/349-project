You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story, which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something what makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which makes from every single battle - an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childish or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to being able to put an end to his misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although, nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (which he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content. Many of the things I struggled with had been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them.\n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).","June 6, 2015","true","286.9"," 1,967 of 2,045 people (96%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","96","967","2","83","88"

I'm a Witcher, I'd have heard it. Just like I can hear your heart. Which is pounding... like a liar's.'Geralt of Rivia\n__________________________________________\n\nIntroduction\n'The Witcher III: Wild Hunt‘ has won so many awards and has been praised by so many people that it’s kind of impossible to miss or ignore this game. It’s the third part in the videogame series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and represents the end of the famous videogame trilogy of Geralt of Rivia, a.k.a the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken. To cut a long story short: The game lived up to every expectation I had and exceeded them with ease. Even the games‘ minigames are better than many full-price titles – yeah exactly, I’m talking about you Gwent, you awful little drug that I can’t get enough of…\n\nThe main story connects to the events of the second Witcher game 'Assassins of Kings‘ and brings the overall story started in the first part to an end. Witchers are infamous monster hunters, magically improved mutants that are simultanesously feared and needed in a world threatened by dark creatures, evil spirits and living nightmares. Geralt of Rivia is a famous specimen of this kind and thought for a long time that his former friend and love, the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, was already dead. However during the recent events in Loc Muinne he learned that this was not the entire truth and so he decides to start a new journey to finally find answers to his questions.\n\nA huge world with fascinating lore and characters awaits the White Wolf - the sheer quantity of places you can visit, persons you can talk to and monsters that have to be slain would be enough to  fit in several other games.\nThis world is not only packed with interesting stories, dialogues, quests, fearsome monsters and an insane amount of details behind every corner, moreover it is convincing and far away from all the happy fantasy clichés you've already seen a hundred times. There is neither black nor white, just many shades of grey. Elves are neither the glorious archers nor the kind tree people, humans not the friendly guys that accept every race the same and dwarfes are no gentle stone-loving miners. In this world you have to make choices that you won’t like and to live with the consequences. Morally ambiguous is the description you’re looking for.\n__________________________________________\n\nGraphics and Audio\nRegarding the technical aspects this game conquers Mount Olympus easily (despite the much complained 'technical downgrade‘) as it is one of the most beautiful RPGs I’ve ever seen, with amazing sunsets/sunrises, spooky nights and gorgeous views over detailled landscapes full of nature and terror - this game is definitely gorgeous.\n\nYou want to see some examples? Let me show you some screenshots taken from the game using only the additional E3FX and the free camera from the console:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639380403\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=657195325\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626638385\n\nIn addition to the stunning visuals there is also brilliant music and fantastic voice acting that will catch you during dialogues or pumps you up during the fights. Together with the exquisite characters, the superb dialogues and all the deep little stories the game suceeds even more in creating a credible fantasy world.\n__________________________________________\n\nCons\nSo now there's the question: Are there negative points at all?\nYeah some minor flaws: Talking to every person and looting every stash is kind of unsatisfying as there is no wide variety of things that you may accomplish or find this way, so after some time you will visit mostly the important places and persons while ignoring the rest. Furthermore if everything else may be a 10/10 for me, the fighting mechanic is not as fantastic as the rest. It has definitely improved since the second part but it’s still somewhat 'special' as it lacks unique aspects, a good feedback for the hits and suffers every now and then from targeting problems, camera angles, weird controls or some questionable hitboxes.\nThat now may sound worse than it actually is - from my point of view it's 'still' an 8 out of 10. In addition I encountered some small visual glitches and sound errors during cutscenes but they were so small and disappeared after reloading, so I don’t even care about this at all. Compared to the games‘ size and content there are nearly no problems at all and everything runs more than just smoothly for me.\n\nTo be honest there is only only real downside that I have with the game: My journey with Geralt will end some day and it set new standards regarding characters, lore and dialogues that future RPGs have to be compared with - and this will be a tough struggle for many of them.\n__________________________________________\n\nConclusion\nSo in the end, would I recommend the game? Yes – and no.\nIt’s a fantastic RPG with an amazing amount of content, exquisite characters, dialogues and interesting stories, so I’d recommend it for everyone who has even the slightest positive attitude towards RPGs or the fantasy genre in general.\nHowever at the same time I wouldn’t recommend the game for anyone who has only little time to spare, doesn’t want to be immersed in a massive world full of lore or just wants to rush the story - this game needs time. A lot of time. However it pays off by providing a brilliant experience that will take you on a journey that you’ll never regret or forget...\n\n…or to be more precise let's call it 'a journey you’d like to forget'. Just to experience this masterpiece again from the start and to get these great feelings again (damn I even ignored the fast-travel option and turned off the minimap and the quest hints willingly for many hours (I’ve been lost so many times) to enjoy the world and the quests even longer).\n\nI rate it gladly 9.5 out of 10 points.\n__________________________________________\n\nLet's end this review with another badass quote of the White Wolf:\n'I'm a Witcher. Heard you wondering about my swords. Well, one's for monsters, the other - for humans.'","December 20, 2015","true","197.8"," 1,062 of 1,123 people (95%) found this review helpful 99 people found this review funny","95","062","1","99","15"

In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. We can do it quietly or killing everyone. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. The story is for 30h game without sidequests. We also have mini games like cards (Gwent).\n\nGameplay - 9/10\nBeautiful world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore caves, forests, mountains, helping peoples and doing much more things. The map is 30 times bigger than in the previous part. Crafting and Alchemy are more important, we also can upgrade swords, armors and signs. These sandbox gives many, many opportunities. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.\n\nCharacters - 10/10\nEach character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can decide who will be our enemy and who is our friend. We also can choose the path of the main character. Character (mainly Geralt's) and monsters doing really great feeling, details are amazing.\n\nGraphics - 10/10\nGraphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water clouds are very well refined, falling leaves, changing weather make a huge impression.\n\nSounds - 10/10\nMusic and ambient sounds in this game is great fits. We can listen medieval music which is selected for each moment of the game. Animals noises are natural. The monsters sounds are really threatening. Character voices are well selected and fit into personalities.\n\nOverall - 10/10\nIf you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game. These game is masterpiece.","May 24, 2015","true","96.4"," 1,558 of 1,692 people (92%) found this review helpful 76 people found this review funny","92","558","1","76","38"

Yes, web ware developer as well...but not in gaming (tele-health).\nThe politics, the physics, storyline, emotions, visuals, and music score hit every mark that can be made in a game.\nSure, one could argue, you can't create or modify your own character like in Skyrim or other RPGs, Fair enough, and I suppose if you are a female, that could put you off--but in TW3, you get to play a female character as well. Brilliant solution to the gender bias paradox.\nOn the other side of the coin as well as the edges of the coin--I don't know what other game can compare with the reality of the choices you make in a game. It is the closest thing to real life I've ever experienced in a game. Enough has been written about the graphics, story line, etc... What make this game unique is that choices matter, little is linear, and one can replay the game, as I did, increasing the level of difficulty each time. I wish I could make more different choices....but I'm such an ethical and loyal smuck that every time I play I reject Yen, hook up again with Triss, kill Rad, don't kill the "paint" Troll, I look after Ciri's interest, etc. Every time! I always get a "good" although arguably not sure any endings are the 'best'. Just the fact that the game has more than 3 or 4 endings (thinking Mass Effect) or just one ending (Skyrim) makes this as close to real life as any game I've ever played.\nI'd recommending buying the game, but with a caveat--it may take up to much of your time and compromise your real life. But depending on your life, it may not be a bad alternative...I play it to take my mind off of other projects and it is significantly effacatious in that regard.\n;P\nEnjoy!\n","April 25","true","648.1"," 1,441 of 1,580 people (91%) found this review helpful 158 people found this review funny","91","441","1","158","32"

Anything I say now would just be retreading over what everyone else has said, but regardless; this was one of the finest gaming experiences of my life. The world was meticulously crafted, the story was engaging, the characters were believable, the struggles and victories powerful, combat was enjoyable and varied.. this was magnificent. Not a perfect game, but very close to it, performance left a lot to be desired and the bug list was shocking to be perfectly honest.. exceeded - if not matched - only by the likes of Obsidian and Bethesda, and that simply should not happen in this day and age. The UI was merely passable in some instances and downright terrible in others and, sadly, the levelled-loot was made utterly worthless due to the expansive crafting system in the game. You craft, and use for the majority of the game, far better gear than you can find or buy -- and that, too, is a shame.\n\nStill, I won't soon forget this game and indeed I fear now that the bar has been raised to such a level that it will negatively impact my enjoyment of other so-called "open world RPGs" to come. A bitter sweet realisation, I guess, though there's nothing to do about it now except wait and hope for games to match the quality set forth by The Witcher 3.

This is the greatest RPG I've ever played. I've used Steam for many years now, and never written a review for a game before...this game was good enough to make me feel like I should.\n\nLooking back on it, I feel like I actually played several games. The overall storyline contained so many sub-plots that each "chapter" felt like its own complete game. I've heard some people mention this as a negative, but I can't possibly see how. It's value...you don't have to play the game if you don't want to. If you only want 40 hours of content from a AAA title, then quit playing it after 40 hours.\n\nAs for the quests themselves, I found even the random mini-quests generated from "undiscovered locations" to be well-executed and thoughtful, some of which would only take a few minutes to complete, but added genuine character to the gaming world, making it feel like a real place. After over 170 hours of play, I found myself saving the final quest and just roaming around Skellige checking out undiscovered locations, even though I knew the vast majority of them were smugglers caches, and I already had all the gear and crowns I could ever use...I didn't want it to end. I anxiously await the next DLC expansion.\n\nI hear a lot of people complain about the combat system as well, and for the life of me I can't understand why. In close quarters the camera gets a bit wonky, and it's hard to maneuver properly because of your view being obstructed, but that's only in a few specific places. The combat system is elegant in that it is as complex as you make it. You can finish the game quite easily doing nothing but blocking/countering if your opponent is human, dodge/attack if your opponent is a monster. Now add to this basic and extremely effective routine the use of the various bombs, potions, decoctions, and signs, especially in conjunction with area effects and each other...there are a thousand ways to defeat your opponents. Throwing a gas bomb and lighting up a bunch of bandits with Igni is always entertaining, as is using Axii to make a guy kill his buddy. Some special attacks you can unlock, like Whirl, are just amazing to watch when you pull it off correctly to take out a whole group of enemies in one fantastic display of swordsmanship.\n\nGwent is another feature that gets a lot of attention, and I really didn't know what to make of it at first. After analyzing it for a little while, and picking up some different cards with different abilities, I began to realize the genius of it, and eventually got to the point where I can honestly say I haven't had as much fun with an RPG mini-game since Triple Triad in FF8. It's just another part of this game that is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity yet astoundingly deep.\n\nWell, there you go. My first Steam review. I enjoyed this game immensely, and unless you're a cave troll, you probably will too.","May 4","true","177.8"," 565 of 604 people (94%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","94","565","604","34","8"

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has got to be one of the greatest single player games I've ever played, and that is from somebody that is not accustomed to the previous two titles.\n\nWith so many areas to talk about, I'll first mention about game dialogue. Considering an average novel is between 80,000 and 100,000 words, the script to Witcher 3 accumulates to a 450,000 word goliath. Unbelievable! It requires over 950 speaking roles, which reportedly took more than two and a half years to successfully accomplish. Whats slightly more incredible then those statistics, is that Witcher 3 makes you feel like you don't want to skip any of it whatsoever, through an amalgamation of whit, thrill, mystery, passion and more. I've never known a game to deliver dialogue so well, but on top of that its you that gets the choice of how the story goes. Your in control! You can continue to show Geralt as the renowned warrior he is, or you can often show his softer side in certain situations. There is no right or wrong. Even towards the latter stages, Co-developer Marcin Iwinski announced that there are 36 possible endings for the game, mind = blown.\n\nThe environment to Witcher 3 is also a great achievement in itself. To put it into perspective, the map is 20% larger than Skyrim. Its also 35 times larger than the map found in Witcher 2. A large map is a good feat on its own, but these facts give CD Projekt Red massive bragging rights! At first it felt like the environment was very much going to be the same throughout, and I was really wondering whether or not there would be massive differences later on. As it turns out there is so much more in the lands of Witcher 3 to explore, in which I was extremely keen to find for myself.\n\nYou get to see a lot of the world through the storyline, but stepping away from that and doing side quests & contracts are where you can find yourself in extraordinary circumstances. I can't honestly tell you another game thats genuinely made me want to do everything. Each side quest feels like a mini-storyline, you don't seem to get any that follow a tedious or repetitive nature. On one side of the spectrum you could be fighting the biggest and deadliest creatures that Velen and Skellige have to offer, then on the other side you'll be hunting treasure, balls deep in Nekker swamps.\n\nYou'll more then likely reach a few points in the game where you are overburdened with side quests, treasure hunts and contracts. It can sometimes lead to confusion, but the easiest way to clear your Journal is to go through them one by one. Obviously due to level restrictions, some of them cannot be completed until Geralt is stronger - which doesn't mean you can't try to do them, it just means that it will be incredibly difficult to do so. One moment that I will always remember is when I went to fight a Royal Griffin that was 12 levels higher then me. I would spend a long time evading damage and trying to deliver some form of pain, but its almost like the Griffin was laughing at me, all I seemed to do was shave feathers off its back, nothing more. Then in one foul swoop, I'd be dead. Repeat. Dead. Repeat. Dead. ♥♥♥♥. I'm one that embraces difficulty, playing on the hardest setting in this game is fantastic, yet this was a battle that I had to swallow my pride and leave. Go away. Get stronger. Come back, and rip that ♥♥♥♥ing bird to pieces. This was great, not many times have I been in a situation where a game would allow me to fight a much higher level, you tend to get games match the enemies strength based on your current level. With this said, I actually much preferred Witcher 3's approach, it created some great and memorable fight scenes where I wouldn't necessarily assume victory. Certain areas are swamped with much higher creatures early on, so returning to them 50+ hours later provides a nice feeling of self accomplishment and power.\n\nNow I remember all those years ago, playing cards in a big Saloon in Red Dead Redemption. Poker, Blackjack, maybe a little bit of Five Finger Fillet or Liar's Dice. These were wonderful times. Now I have a new love, playing Gwent. Gwent is a collectable card game that simulates two armies meeting on the battlefield. "Invented by dwarves and perfected over centuries of tavern table play, Gwent is a game of initial simplicity and ultimate depth, something beloved by both road-weary travellers during long nights around the campfire and elegant nobles looking to liven up dragging dinner parties." I have no idea how much time I've spent playing Gwent in this game, all I can say is that 25 hours into this game I was Level 3. 3! Gwent immediately took my focus as I attempted to gain recognition throughout Velen. Its a continous side quest in the game, challenging notable opponents and entering tournaments, not only that but also every merchant is up for a game. Just when you think your building a great deck and come out of a tournament as the winner, a local fishmonger will always be ready to embarass you (early on anyway, it becomes a breeze later on in game). There is also a quest to collect them all, so enjoy your time hunting for all 150 cards spread through the factions of Nilfgaard, Northen Realms, Monsters & Scoia'tael.\n\nI've always enjoyed games that heavily involve fighting, particularly when the mechanisms are right. I have heard mixed  reviews about the mechanisms to Witcher 3 combat, some arguing that Geralt feels particularly stiff and robotic when under attack... absolute garbage. I think combat can be pretty tricky in Witcher 3 for those unfamiliar with the series, considering the many different mechanics in play at any one time. Blocking, parrying, signs, pivots, rolls, variant of sword, etc. Practice makes perfect, and it is different to other games so get used to it! Thats all I can say. Dismemberment is always a joy to behold, and Geralt doesn't hold back on his capability to carve through people, creatures and monsters like butter.\n\nCould this game have anything to make it better? Yes & it does - Free DLC. Not just a few, but 16! 16 Free DLC packages to add even more into a well-packed game. CD Projekt Red have had the best launch I've seen of a game, in terms of its update structure and responsiveness to people's comments. From launch there was new DLC every week, patches to address issues and bugs retaining in-game. Free DLC includes new armor sets, the ability to visit a barber, new quests, contracts, animations, alternative looks, and not to forget the NEW GAME + mode.\n\nI put this review on hold numerous of times as it deserved to be reviewed once completed, it truly is a remarkable and well made game that will forever have the highest of impacts on me. Its groundbreaking in every sense of the word, and literally pisses all over certain companies that think its right to strip a new game of content then release it as paid DLC. Congratulations to CD Projekt Red for providing one of the most immersive & detailed games that I have ever seen, I look forward to the expansions "Hearts of Stone" & "Blood and Wine" to continue my witcher journey!","September 6, 2015","true","164.1"," 361 of 382 people (95%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","95","361","382","26","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/koreanjuice/recommended/292030/","koreanjuice","Dellicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/koreanjuice/","246 products in account","Honestly this game is brilliant. I'm 30 hours in and feel like I have not even started yet. The maps are huge, and quite intimidating. There are lots of things to see and places to explore. Sometimes randomly exploring places you will find a hidden letter or item that leads you on a new quest. Speaking of quests, the secondary ones tie in beautifully with the main story and feel like they have meaning and purpose behind them. The visuals are stunning, especially if you have a rig capable of using HairWorks and HBAO+ to their full potential. The day/night cycle on top of the changing weather conditions really engross you in the world. The sound, both ambient and effects, are all awe inspiring. Just listening to the wind blow the trees, the village sounds of hammer on steel and axe on wood, even the gentle noises your horse makes as you travel is just very immersing.\n\nThe story telling is one of the major positives for me personally. All the NPC’s really come alive with the texture and detail on their faces, CD Projekt RED did a great job with that. The voice acting is great, much better than Witcher 2 and feels far more professional. All of the conversation options are well thought out, and there are plenty of decisions with some severe consequences depending on the way you play it. If you import a Witcher 2 save, you will have a few surprises and reappearances as well.\n\nCombat is solid, it takes a little practice to get to grips with the dodging, parrying, and when to use the signs effectively, but once you work it out you will love fighting some mobs. The skill tress are varied and in-depth, and you can really tailor your play style by equipping/unequipping specific skills for different scenarios. Using mutagens to further develop and buff your abilities.\n\nThere is so much more I could talk about like Gwent, the card game, bartering/intimidation mechanics, boat sailing, all the crafting and potions, but you need to play it yourself to really appreciate it. Hopefully with further updates and user mods the game will continue to improve and evolve.\n\nThere are not many negatives, mostly performance related which, as of writing, a lot of have been fixed already with v1.03.\n","May 22, 2015","true","188.9"," 417 of 452 people (92%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","92","417","452","20","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kbron_milagroso/recommended/292030/","kbron_milagroso","Don Alencio of Rivia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kbron_milagroso/","303 products in account","This game is a masterpiece. It is possible that it is the greatest rpg game ever. Side quests are not boring, the game world is huge, weapons are great and combat although has some minor problems, is glorious. No game is perfect, this game has some problems, but the combination of great atmosphere, depth story, attention to details, quest diversity, sound, voice acting, music, monsters, weapons, armors, storms, Roach (the Horse) and of course the best mini game I have ever encounter in a video game : Gwent. All of this plus dozens of other great things add up and to give 10/10 masterpiece.\n\n***Keep reading for a few more details if you are interested:\n\n•  Side Quests: I will not specifically mention any side quest because I don’t want to spoil anything. But I have to praise the quality of the side quests. I have played a lot of rpg’s in my life, and I have never encountered one whose secondary quests are so well written. Even the smallest one of them have something interesting, for example a dead guy can have a note on his body which narrates something related to his final demise. Also, I’m not exaggerating when I said that the stories of this quests are amazing, going even head to head with main stories of other games. (Some of these quests endure 2 or 3 or more hours). Also, the main quests are amazing.\n\n•  Monsters: Yes, there are monsters in this game, and you will hunt them down and probably kill them (occasionally you may let them live if you choose so). But the best part is that you can track this monsters down with something similar to “detective mode”, which will give you hints of what kind of monster you are tracking, also villagers may help to determine of what kind it is. And there is strategy in this: monsters have weakness to something, it varies from monster to monster. To learn about this weaknesses you can read the “bestiary”, which is a log of entries that have descriptions, histories and details of monsters. There are necrophages, specters, giants, insectoids, draconoids and many others. You mostly track them down by accepting or taking Witcher Contracts.\n\n•  Potions, Crafting, Alchemy: Yes this game has all of this. I as a player usually don’t waste time with alchemy, but I really enjoy it in this game. There are dozens of potion recipes and diagrams for armor, and swords that you will encounter in the game world. And they are meaningful, not like in Skyrim, were you have like a million useless potion in your pockets. In here I actually use them, especially while fighting monsters. For example, there a different kind of oils that can be applied to your swords, each one add damage bonus to a specific kind of enemy.\n\n•  Graphics, sounds and music: Yes, I was a little bit disappointed when I saw all of the graphic downgrade posts and news, and yes there is some downgrade if you compare the game with the e3 trailers. Now that said, even with the downgrade, the graphics have remained impressive. Armors, lighting, reflections all of them looks well. The game atmosphere is amazing, there are storms, strong winds, rain, thunders and even the occasional fog is some areas. So don’t let the “graphic downgrade”  thing affect your judgement of this game. It’s pretty.  The sound is top quality too. And the music is also top quality.\n\nCombat: The combat control is not perfect, specially the first few hours. But as you become more familiar with controls you will really enjoy and master its mechanics.\n\n•Geralt of Rivia: And remember you are a Witcher, a guy who is basically an expert swordsman and alchemist, but at the same time have some basic knowledge of magic spells (like kinetic blasts and fire bursts). This is not an rpg were you create a character, in here you play with a forced role, you play as Geralt of Rivia and you have no choice in that matter. But this is not a bad thing. You will feel like Geralt and live as him…and decides like him. Geralt will have to deal with hundreds of choices in his adventure, those choices have different outcomes. If you had never played any Witcher games, let’s said that this is something similar to mass effect choices (but better). Also, you can import your save files from Witcher 2, so decision in there has some interesting outcomes in Witcher 3. If you have never played any witcher game, don’t worry, you will still understand the game.\n\n• Progress: Yes there is ability tree and all that stuff, so you as you gain xp you can invest points in different abilities like magic, combat and alchemy (and a general attribute section).\n\n• Gwent: This is an in game card mini game. I’m one of those guys who usually ignores all mini games in games. But you should try Gwent. It has a lot of depth and strategy. At the beginning it may be difficult, but as you progress you will earn new cards that will help you in your Gwent career…try the mini game, is amazing.","May 23, 2015","true","134.4"," 548 of 611 people (90%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","90","548","611","20","3"

I am running postprocessing and the majority of the graphics options on HIGH. I have the hair-effect turned off as it does degrade my FPS.\n\n- The world feels alive. From the wind blowing through the trees, to the dynamic weather system, to the wild life running through the forest, nothing stands out as generic or as an asset that was placed into the world without thought. The first two areas are more organic than any other game I have personally played.\n\n- The side-quests are varied and offer up much more than fetch this or kill that. Many are investigation based and require multiple steps to complete.\n\n- The UI has taken a MASSIVE step forward from The Witcher 2. What was once a clunky mess is now fairly intuitive and streamlined. There is room for improvement, but clearly the developers have learned from their past mistakes.\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, but please don't expect a fully modded Skyrim or iCEnhancer GTA4 level of detail. Again, the developers seemed to be more concerned with making a world that feels organic and vivid than throwing 24k textures on everything. It's the art, color, and texture cohesion that really makes the graphics standout from other titles.\n\n- The dialogue and voice acting are on par or better than most action RPGs I have recently played. I have yet to encounter two NPCs that I felt were using the same voice actor. The only generic voice in the game is probably the protagonist, but that is by design.\n\n- I have not encountered any bugs worth mentioning. Zero crashes and no broken quests is impressive for any game when compared to other recent major releases.\n\nActual Cons:\n\n- While the soundtrack and game ambiance are very well done, the game suffers from sound balancing issues. For example, at certain times the sound level of voices will be much lower than everything else in the world, forcing you to read the subtitles.\n\n- There is an overuse of "stage setting" mini-cinematics, especially if you play in short bursts and load often. There should be an option to skip these and instead be able to read the suggestion text during a loading screen.\n\n- Level progression has been quite slow which has forced me to back-pedal a bit from the main quest to play catch-up. This may be by design, but placing you into an area that is for level 7+ while you are only level 3 isn't the best choice IMHO.\n\nBottom Line: I will continue to play The Witcher 3 for the foreseeable future. It offers a blend of DA:I and Skyrim-esque gameplay with it's own unique lore, dynamism, and atmosphere that is truly enjoyable. Please feel free to ask any specific questions in the comments and I will do my best to answer them.","May 18, 2015","true","29.2"," 2,513 of 2,963 people (85%) found this review helpful 2,053 people found this review funny","85","513","2","053","99"

That being said, you can take my review with however large a grain of salt you may wish.\n\nTo say the game is vast belies the true scope. The designers wisely guide you from quest to quest in a flowing, natural way, almost always part of the story. Note that I said "guide". There is rarely any pressure or situations that lockstep you into a given path. You are free to make choices that let you go as deep down the rabbit-hole as you wish to go....\n\n...and that hole is very deep indeed.\n\n"Story rich" is a term that has a nice, general sort of meaning to it, but again, does not do the efforts of CDPR proper justice. The game is so tightly wound into the books, that unless you have read them, you constantly miss the references that are so beautifully woven into the tale. If you have not read the books, you don't lose anything, but you definitely gain so much more for the knowledge.\n\nThe story, while deep and inviting, is marred a bit by the development of some of the characters. There are some that have a constant impact in the game, but the characters themselves feel somewhat shallow and undeveloped. Yennefer, for example: The character of the books is haughty, proud, complex, and passionate. The game character feels just b*t**y and moody.  Some of them, however, are just delightful and give you real reason to "buy in" to them (Zoltan and Dandelion come immediately to mind).\n\nThe environment - I am somewhat of two minds about the environment. Aspects of it are epic...the vistas from on high can be breathtaking. The play of light through trees and the colors at sunrise and sunset are a visual feast. There is a great deal to lend itself to the suspension of disbelief that is critical for immersion into the game world. But there are some things that blow that disbelief up quicker than a grapeshot bomb.  The trees, bushes and grasses look very obviously two-dimensional. It was a disappointment that was lessoned somwhat by the variety in the landscapes, and the impact of weather on it, but it still was a bit of a jarring surprise when taken in context with the overall quality of the environment. Then there are the many inconsistencies in the way Geralt interacts with his environment (swimming on land, the inability to use terrain to your advantage in combat, getting stuck in trees, etc.).\n\nCombat is by far the best iteration of all the games in the trilogy. It still remains a bit clunky (having to go into inventory, then go to your potions/food/bombs tab, then select the bombs you want to use, then exit out of all that, to have to go into the wheel and select the bomb before you throw it.....is a real pain in the @$$..... would have made far more sense to allow the user to simply click on the bomb slot in the power wheel and get a pop up inventory of just bombs. Same for potions slots and special slots.)  But beyond those inconveniences, the blend of signs and attacks, coupled with dodging, parries, and combat rolls makes for an engaging, flowing combat experience. Some fights are simply acrobatic melees, while others require careful patience, waiting for the right time to strike, while maintaining a stout defense to avoid getting one-shotted.\n\nNow, all this having been said, I have to admit that I was more than a bit disappointed that CDPR fell into the same trap of American publishers: putting the game out before all the bugs were ironed out. There have already been 8 patches and still there remains a plethora of irritating bugs (inability to talk to certain npc's that you should be able to talk to without meditating for an hour first or the flank speed on boats not working are the two most immediate that leap to mind)\n\nYes, there are pros.\nYes there are cons.\n\nBut even with the cons, I would easily match this to The Mass Effect Trilogy, or the Dragon Age trilogy, as one of the most enjoyable RPG experiences I've ever had in gaming. I've already played the game 3 times, back to back, and working on a 4th with the new Game + (which really is the exact same game with everything made higher level....I've not yet seen a benefit to this yet).\n\nWatching Geralt's beard grow as time goes by was just a huge giggle for me. It was a neat touch. Watching whales in the ocean broach by my boat as I sailed by gave me no end of delight. I parked Geralt on a mountain top in Skellige and watched an entire sunset.  I checked myself into Gwent Addicts Anonymous.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Without a breath of hesitation. Then I would immediately advise to take the bugs with a grain of salt, and get lost in this rather amazing world, and thoroughly enjoyable story.\n\nGo, and see just how deep that rabbit hole is.","September 10, 2015","true","680.9"," 223 of 237 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","223","237","12","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/recommended/292030/","kosmozuikis","Kosmozuikis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/","1177 products in account","A masterpiece\nI have waited for this game since i finished the Witcher when it came out. Yes there was The Witcher 2, but i have waited for open world Witcher game since then. And finally my wait is over.\n\nThis game is amazing. Finally we see Ciri and Yennefer, two major characters which did not appear in previous games and i so wanted to see them in a game. Second game was too linear and short for me. It had very little content, no real cities etc. I wanted to feel that Witcher soul, like in the books, all the traveling on horses, coming to the village which is filthy and devastated by poverty. You see all the blood, racism and cruelty.\n\nThis is the first open world Witcher game. And the world is huge. It is pleasure to explore that huge world. Sometimes you find awesome treasures and sometimes you meet a quick death and sometimes you feel like a hero when you encounter some bandits and slaughter them chopping off their heads. The world is so alive and full of various creatures and monsters. Sometimes you don‘t even want to fast travel and you just ride the Roach (a horse name haha) and admire the beautiful world. The one of the best experience for me was when i have arrived into the small village at 4am. Everyone was sleeping, it was so peaceful and silent. Even the wind has calmed down. There was only one sound - a mosquito buzzing. That feel was amazing.\n\nThe one thing everyone talks the most is the graphics. Some people are very unhappy that graphics was downgraded. Yes of course this was not a very nice move from CDPR that they promised better graphics and the final game came with worse graphics. But the graphics are still amazing. It‘s not revolutionary, but it looks really really good. You want to take screenshots one after another. If only there would be an option to turn off the hud with one button. Or even better – a photo mode like in Shadows of mordor. In short the game is gorgeous. Character models are good, but they could use some work. Same goes for trees. But this is only a very small flaw which is not very important.\nThe performance is pretty good also. It could be better, but you can comfortably play while having a good graphics. Hairworks takes ~15fps away, but it looks really cool, i keep it on and have lowered some other less noticeable graphics options like shadows.\n\nSound is another great aspect of this game. It makes the wonderful (a dreadful and horrible really) world even more alive. You hear the wind, the birds chirping, the monsters aaaaand the people spitting. The voice acting is good and it makes the awesome dialogues even more interesting.\n\nStory is amazing. Especially the side quests. This game has the best side quests ever. They‘re funny, cruel, sad and sometimes ridiculous (in a good way). The world of Witcher is very dark, full of torture, ♥♥♥♥, violence and death. I love that CDPR made the world how it‘s supposed to be. The world changes after your decisions. You come back and you see that some things changed because of you.\n\nThe Witcher 3 also is good for time travel. You sit to play for half an hour and suddenly you see you played for 3 hours.\n\nI love the combat in this game. Yes it could use some work, but i like it. It‘s fun to fight some stronger monsters. Maybe it‘s a bit hard against a group of weaker enemies, like Nekkers, but if you think before the fight you will manage. I love that they designed this game to be played using a controller.\n\nThe Witcher 3 also has a game inside a game. It is called gwent. It‘s a card game and it can be really addicting.\n\nSo far for me this is the best RPG ever made. I just can‘t think of better RPG game. It has everything – good story, graphics, gameplay, combat, world, characters.\n\n9,5/10 Amazing. Thank you CDPR for this game. Definitely will buy the DLC.","May 26, 2015","true","131.5"," 266 of 291 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","266","291","13","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoenigma/recommended/292030/","neoenigma","Jim2point0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neoenigma/","275 products in account","I don't know if I can adequately explain why this game is as amazing as I think it is.... but I'll try.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe writing\nHands down, this game has some of the best writing I've ever experience in an RPG. The main quest feels very personal, and you actually want to progress in order to find out what happens next. The characters are all interesting and also incredibly well-written.\n\nThe quests\nAgain, this game has the best side quests out of all the RPGs I've played. And that's saying a lot. Every quest seems to have at least some back story. There's typically at least a few forms of interaction other than just killing something and then returning to the quest giver. The decisions you make are never black and white, and usually involve some form of consequences. And FINALLY, you actually get to feel like a real witcher\monster hunter by taking on some really fun witcher contracts.\n\nThe world\nVelen and Skellige can both rival some of the largest open worlds out there in terms of size, and yet the level of detail and polish remains consistent throughout. Exploration is very rewarding. There's loot to be found everywhere, and little quests can be unlocked along the way to help you find even more treasure.\n\nNovigrad is a HUGE city, and you just walk inside without a hint of a loading screen. It actually feels like a living, breathing world. NPCs have daytime\nighttime routines, and will seek shelter if it starts to rain. Little things like that go along way to bring you into a world.\n\nGraphics and art design\nHow can I put this? All things considered, The Witcher 3 is probably the most beautiful game I've ever played. You must experience this game in motion, but feel free to look through my screenshots if you need convincing.[www.flickr.com] One thing that can't be seen in screenshots is the way everything moves and feels alive. And while the wind effect might seem overdone, it really helps to sell the atmosphere.\n\nThe Witcher 3 can be rough around the edges and other games are definitely doing some more impressive things technically, but the overall Witcher 3 experience is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe combat\nThis grew on me. At first I didn't like it. I didn't think signs were strong enough, and I was constantly getting my butt kicked. But then I learned how to dodge and counter properly. I learned how to use signs to my advantage, I learned how to stick and move, and start treating each encounter like a puzzle. Eventually I was punching WAY above my weight, taking on level 20 witcher contracts with a level 14 character. Now I love the combat and I'm always looking forward to doing the next Witcher contract.\n\nThe Bad\n\nControls\nQuite possibly my biggest gripe with the game. Controls just feel clunky at best. I play with a mouse and keyboard, so maybe that is part of the reason... but movement in this game feels sluggish and unresponsive. Sometimes I'll try to move Geralt a little bit and he won't budge, and at other times he'll move too far and run off a cliff. Just turning around can feel like a chore as Geralt has a rather large turning radius. Even worse are the horse controls, which kinda feels like driving around a very large SUV. Constantly getting stuck on geometry and trying to maneuver around it is an ongoing, frustrating chore.\n\nBalance\nEven on the largest difficulty, it doesn't take long for this game to become a cake walk. IF you enjoy the sidequests like I do, you'll likely spend a lot of time completing them instead of doing the main quest. The main quest is GOOD, but some of the game's best content can be found in the sidequests. And after 20 hours of questing, you'll probably find that the next step in the campaign is 5 levels below you and therefore not challenging in the slightest. There were several instances where I'd go up against an enemy that is supposed to be tough and intimidating... but I kill it in less than 12 seconds.\n\nLoot progression is also a joke if you do any kind of crafting. The witcher gear is probably better than anything the game will give you from monsters or chests. During your travels, you'll come across countless relic quality swords. And they may even have more damage than your current green sword. But witcher gear is highly specialized and usually compliment specific builds. Using a higher damage sword might actually gimp you if you lose a massive bonus to sign intensity, or adrenaline point gain.\n\nOther stuff...\nThere's still so much I could go into. Replay value is probably lower since you only have 1 character to play as, but the game makes up for that with a much more personal and involved story. Gwent is probably a very fun card game, but I still haven't played a single game due to not wanting to dump a ton of time into it. Some day I will. Witcher sense is fun at first, but after a while it will feel like a chore. Having to hold down the button combined with the ridiculous screen effects really hampers my enjoyment of this commonly used mechanic. And you never feel like you're solving an investigation using witcher sense. Just looking for red stuff on the ground and following on screen prompts while Geralt figures everything out for you.\n\nConclusion\nI can not possibly cover everything there is to cover about this massive game. But I can say that the good FAR outweighs the bad, and that this is is my favorite open world RPG of all time. I know that The Witcher series isn't for everyone, but I think you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.\n\nAnd again, if you need convincing that this game is drop-dead gorgeous, have a look through my screenshots :)\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/jim2point0/sets/72157653074223832","June 11, 2015","true","419.4"," 224 of 241 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","224","241","7","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekator/recommended/292030/","nekator","☠✠☩ Nekator ☩✠☠","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekator/","3326 products in account","Finally the epic finale for the story of Geralt of Rivia arrived.\nCombining the best of Open World RPG and story driven RPG CDProject tried to offer the best of both worlds, so to speak.\n\nWhile many say it is the next skyrim, i always had to think more of Red Dead Redemption in fantasy. Both games had a fixed main character, which is only so far customizeable, which is a big difference from Skyrims system. Also the dark and gritty settings, with their bit of melodramatic storyline, exploring all the mostly bad sides of humanity are quite similiar.\n\nNaturally the witcher has the plus of a more "interesting" background world, filled with magic, war and monsters, as well as being the finale to a story spanning three games and many books.\nAlso CDPR did the trick to create an open world, which not only looks beautiful and offers an nearly unbelievable amount of possibilities to do, but also kept the content of the great amount of quests so unique that none feels the same.. and surely not like the boring MMO grinding stuff, for example some bioware products of late do.\n\nThe characters are also very well made, and i surely couldn´t believe the stupidity of some "gaming journalists" whining about how Witcher 3 favors anti female and racist content. Anyways, naturally even this new RPG masterwork isn´t without it´s flaws. Sadly some bugs still can annoy players, one which even seems to be introduced with the last patch, disturbing some character models. Though i trust CD Project to solve this in due time.\nOne of the other controversies about this game seem to concern the problems for a game, which is made both for consoles as well as pc to be optimised for both. While on the one hand some graphic options had to be tuned down, due to the limited possibilities of the consoles, the menus and texts, which were quite fine on pc, we´re often complained about by console players.\n\nThis section confesses nearly all of the bad points for Witcher 3 though, there are very few things i can say about the actual game, which are really negative. Maybe that your witcher has to be a cleptomanic as*, who steals everything, which isn´t nailed down, to use it in the very innovative crafting system. Or that one of the new mini games, a card game named Gwent, steals way too much time of actual playing, since it´s addictional content.\nBut all this fades against the atmosphere of a war-ridden Novigrad, where beggars and ♥♥♥♥♥s, meddle with fanatics and witch hunters.\n\nConclusio: This really set´s new standards for open world as well as roleplay games imo. Definitive recommendation, not only for fans of Geralt.","May 31, 2015","true","123.4"," 305 of 342 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","305","342","11","6"

By all rights I should have been madly in love with CDPR’s first interpretation of Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski’s leading man but unfortunately the original game and its subsequent sequel left me stone cold. There is just something about the first two adventures that I can’t quite get my head around (granted I have not yet tried to play the second game again now that it has full controller support) but after having completed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt  I feel I might have been a bit unfair on the series since I can’t remember the last time I have had this much fun in one single game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=456262077\nWhile The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s opening moments start out incredibly slow which sees Geralt of Rivia accept  a commission by the Nilfgaardian Emperor to find his daughter Cirila and bring her back home safely soon evolves into a dangerous cat and mouse game with a legion know as the Wild Hunt who have more than a passing interest in locating and finding the young girl for themselves. The first few hours where you get to explore The Witcher 3's opening location, White Orchard, can be trying since not much happens in those first few hours but the game does open up once the player reaches Velen/Novagrad. The transition between the map of White Orchard and Velen/Novagrad is a daunting one and can often be overwhelming when you look at the square meterage that needs to be uncovered, meterage that is filled with hundreds upon hundreds of little "?" marks denoting areas of interest. It's during this section that the game hits its stride as each main quest line you tackle opens up its own set of branching quest lines, each of them ending with a cliff-hanger or two until they reach their explosive finals. CDPR manages to deftly weave a tale of intrigue and danger into each of its main quests that never seems to lose sight of the main plot line even as an entire genealogy of characters are thrown your way and you begin to struggle remembering who is who in the zoo as the intricate plot line advances.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=446842953\nThe same can be said for many of the side-quests and monster contracts Geralt picks up through out his travels. Each one of them is their own self contained adventure yet somehow CDPR have done the impossible and given them enough weight and meaning so that they are not just frivolous fluff to busy your time with in order to level your character. Often these side quests will interject with the main quest lines sometimes even directly influencing certain main quest lines denouncements. I also particularly loved how CDPR took the common old treasure quest trope so often seen in these kinds of open world games and spun them on their head. Thankfully you won't go treasure hunting for 100 flags spread across the map in various locations but instead these treasure quests will have you seeking out new and more powerful gear which are presented to you in the form of patterns which can then be taken to certain blacksmiths and tailor's in the game to be made for you, provided you have the correct crafting ingredients to make them. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, despite the controversy surrounding the games supposed visual downgrade, is still an incredible and breathtakingly beautiful world to explore. It's so pretty in most places that the drive to uncover more areas never becomes a chore and one can easily get lost in exploring the land and forgetting why you came in the first place.\n\nBut not everything is perfect. The game does suffer from some terrible balancing issues with the first few hours being particularly difficult (the games first boss battle with a griffon is a long and arduous fight - one taking upwards of 10 minutes to best) where as the further you progress it starts to become a bit of a cakewalk. Pathfinding is a complete joke and often the game will have you running around in circles. This becomes more of a problem in Skellige where the map is covered with high rise mountains that make it near impossible to climb yet the pathfinder will insist that you continue upwards when it becomes apparent it's not possible. The game is also never entirely clear how your potions and elixirs are replenished and manoeuvring Roach, Geralts steed, often feels like you are trying to drive a tank through a doughnut hole. Some quest lines broke irreparably during my playthrough and there are a host of visual glitches that put the game on par with AC: Unity after launch.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=449890411\nGranted CDPR have been particularly good at patching the game so it will just be a matter of time before most of the glitches are ironed out but this may hamper your enjoyment so be advised. Combat also comes across as far too simplistic the further you venture into the game world. It's never more than just engaging enough, “simply” just getting the job done and often can devolve into a button mashing exercise with the odd occasional parry and magical aura spam here and there. That being said The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt does hit more highs than it does lows and many, if not most, can be overlooked but they should be mentioned because they may invariably define how you will ultimately feel about the game.\n\nCDPR have excelled with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt delivering one of the most engrossing games I have had the pleasure of playing. While it may be rough around the edges in certain regards, the ambition on display here is admirable and I can't wait to see what comes next. I expect BIG, BIG things. Well done CDPR - you took a gamer who couldn't have cared either way about your franchise and made him a fan.

The voice acting was superb and the music was memorable, yet there are some problems with some of the combat and some parts that downright broke immersion. A Fantastic and great game that is almost perfect except for a few issues and immersion breaking elements. The review I did was so extensive I can't even fit it on this steam review. I'll throw down a TLDR for you guys out there but you can check the review video at the bottom if you want more in depth. review. Thank you for taking your time to read this.\n\n\nPros  + The graphics which doesn't of course look like the pr trailer of 2013 but was still beautiful in this game. The world feels alive with the animals that roams it, the day and night cycle, the windy and rainy days. Very immersive. Hell you can even see shooting stars at night if you look in the sky, the skybox is so good.\n+ Detailed textures enough to see pores, scars and such on chracter faces\n+ Voice acting is top notch while the music are very memorable. Must own OST'\n+ The story and lore of the game was memorable and very engaging, Everything had a story behind it, Game is rich in lore everywhere you go.\n+ The choices that has positive and negative impacts throughout the game depending on your choices.\n+ There are technically 3 giant maps in this game, the rest are side maps. Each of the maps is very finely designed. Plenty of sidequests to do throughout.\n+ The decapitation gore and animations when fighting humans and monsters.\n+ The game is separated into 3 questing categories. Main storyline, secondary and witcher contracts each of which has its own story and memorable moments. The lore will keep players engaged.\n+ Nvidia Hairworks looks good if you have the card for it, Mainly for Monsters and people with fur armor, Geralt hair wasn't as impressive.\n+ You can import your save file from previous witcher games or answer questions during your beard shave which will shape the game\n+ Traveling by walking, running, horseback, swimming, boat = immersion and fast travel requires signposts instead of just a game about instant traveling all over. Exploration can also bring out more quests you've never seen before\n+ The towns in the game is so vibrant and npcs going on with thier lives. They react to certain events accordingly.\n+ Geralt grows beard in real time, must meet barber to cut. I felt like I was Geralt\n+ There is an extensive amount of loot in the game and craftable weapons and armor for your character. 3 main type of sets to choose from and any gear to wear the way you want to play.\n+ Alternative spells and sword style ability techniques that was really fun to use though is few, Igni spraying from hand and the sword twirl.\n+ Fist fighting, Horse racing and even a card game called gwent. Each with their own quest line\n+ The Beastiary is very detailed on how to defeat enemies and the amount of them.\n+ No on disc dlc charged but instead they are free and the devs stances and actions. They do not adhere to major company standards and that's already a huge plus in my books. One of the only few companies out there that does this.\n+ the amount of  support by dev through patching, each patches brings delight as the game gets better, runs better, looks better and so on.\n+ The romance/sex scenes are way better than anything Bioware has put out.\n+ Goty contendor\n\nCons - Ai in the game is leashed, sometimes if you break the boundary they run in circles, sometimes if you are out of their boundary they go back, even if you shoot at them away from the boundary they do not react.\n- The combat can be a bit wonky with the focus targeting and needs patching especially with a mouse and keyboard, you need to slide the mouse too far to target another and thus resulting in your death because of the amount of mobs that gang up on you. It works better with on a joypad at the moment and hopefully this will get patched.\n- Roach horse riding is a bit clunky but a great idea, the auto travel ability is fine until he veers off the path and hits anything in his way. It doesn't feel like a real horse when he just stops coming close to everything even a small rock.\n- The ragdoll physics of enemies, sometimes I have enemies fly 20 feet in the air, most of the time they wriggle the ground and bounce and the way hair wriggles when there isn't wind lol, breaks immersion. (hopefully patched)\n- People are wet inside their houses on rainy days along with everything in the house, It was hilarious easy for me to tell what weather it was during any cinematic.\n- The tree skills is more based on buffs rather than technique, it wasn't as interesting (personal opinion). I didn't have much to look forward to when leveling. The skills slots all unlock at level 30 so it takes a long time\n- The enemy does not scale with player so even on deathmarch difficulty eventually by level 30 the game becomes easy. Very easy. So the difficulty only applies to the start of the game\n- Physics wasn't the best or lack of, tables don't move around, items on it doesn't drop, giant enemies chasing Geralt doesn't take down trees due to engine limitations hopefully in the future we'll see an amazing upgrade from the engine itself.\n- The interface can be very sloppy sometimes especially when dealing with vendors on selling items since there isn't a loot stash\n- When you have every potion/oil in your arsenal, it can take quite a bit of time to look for your potions or oils you want to use in combat because most of them look the same\n- End game or post end game content feels empty and there is also lack of only thing you can do is go over what you haven't done. You'd have to start the game over to relive the experience.\n- There is no loot stash in the game yet, every item is on you and uses weight limits and just clutters your inventory  (Hopefully will get patched in)\n- Theres plenty of bugs but they are being patched\n\nOthers +- Optimization seems to be a problem at first then quickly got patched and feels much better, though I am running a Titan x so I I can't rate this category but for me it ran amazingly well and loads super fast.\n\nVideo review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTSpLmK_lpQ&feature=youtu.be","June 2, 2015","true","197.7"," 251 of 282 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","251","282","11","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/recommended/292030/","MTizzler","Dark MT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/","483 products in account","A Cautious Recommendation (For Now)Probably the most impressive title I've played in many many years of gaming. Unbelievably engaging story, atmosphere that has been beautifully transferred from the books into great graphical fidelity (despite controversies) and volumes of content, all the while remaining interesting - side quests in TW3 are great.\n\nThe hype for this game was real, with damaging expectations. But after The Witcher 2 and CDPR's reputation, it was inevitable. After all, the Witchers were never  'perfect' games, not 2 nor 1 (that godawful combat). Like Demon Souls before Dark souls, Witcher catered to a cult niche on its own charms despite its flaws, and later rose to acclaim where bad hype began.\n\nThe world from the source material has been transferred beautifully into game format, and despite technical issues, TW3 is an RPG that has sucked me in like no other game has before.\n\nWhat to expect from this overviewAn honest overview of the game, start to finish. Due to the word limit I must restrain analysis that is too detailed. For an idea of how big TW3 is, I wanted to write 3x as much as this just for the first 20 hours alone. Read with discretion.\n\nAs usual, a TL;DR for the lazy (In no particular order):+ Good character development with flexibility\n+ Atmosphere like no other RPG\n+ Great combat despite clunky controls\n+ Insane volume of content\n+ Superb soundtrack, though a bit repetitive in its thematic style\n+ Phenomenal Writing for all quests, main or side\n+ Beautiful Graphics\n+ Runs OK on my 770GTX/3570k\n+ Mod Support\n+ THE WHITE WOLF CAN JUMP\n+ 16 Free DLC\n+ Great story\n- Some padding in main storyline\n- The game has been "downgraded" in its graphical detail compared to its 2013 trailer (I don't think this is significant but many do)\n- Bizarre performance issues yet to be resolved\n- Terrible Movement Controls (slowly improving)\n- Some texture popping, probably hardware related\n- A disappointing set of PC options for a CDPR game (update incoming)\n- A few bugs\n- Crashes for some\n- Terrible Performance on Keplar GPUs (600-700GTX)\n\nI shall spare you the long origins and synopsis for the game - there is an abundance of information on the internet if you wish to learn more of the Witcher franchise.\n\nGame MechanicsAs I am a vehement believer in the significance of gameplay above all, I will address this criterion of judgement first. For those who have enjoyed previous Witcher games, there's little that will be unexpected- combat with unique enemies that requires forethought, but now with a crossbow, more gear and better lock control. The real improvements are in atmosphere and exploration.\n\nThe utility wheel for this game, however, blows. For those on a keyboard and mouse, one may find the wheel barely-usable due to the console nature of the controls. The developers have thankfully provisioned a means to select signs through the number row, thank the Gods.\n\nBut the worst offense - movement. The Witcher has since become somewhat sluggish, with more instances than I can count whereby I have moved too far forwards or back to loot a corpse or gather herbs. It is to the degree of frustration that I feel like I am fighting the controls more than anything else in the game and this is sincerely my biggest complaint of the title.\n\nThe Witcher "Sense", is an overlooked mechanic. Now a full hold-down keybind, it permits players to investigate surroundings for clues to quests and loot. I prefer games to treat me as competent. But, as I played I realised the hilarious reason for this was simply due to the sheer volume of detail in the game; clues were often so hidden in the forestry/furniture that I would never have been able to discern their existence. That said, even with the Witcher sense it is reasonable to believe that some players may still experience difficulties, struggling for five minutes finding clues. No complaints nor praise- just caution.\n\nFinally, character progression. The Witcher 2 was lacking here, forcing the player to invest with little knowledge in skills with much regret after investing. TW3 has taken a leap here - now, skill points are obtained more frequently and through more means than levelling up. Skills can be allocated to your "equipped" slots at will, this is particularly useful for those who wish to experiment and I see great potential especially with mod support.\n\nStoryThe real reason to play. Superb writing, great cast & phenomenal setting. Quests and contracts are engaging and exploration is fulfilling. The Witcher isn't about saving the world. Simply, a skilled man and his lover/friends trying to get by (and trying to get laid) in a harsh world with mass suffering and distrust. Monsters have their own unique archetypes, all intertwined with gameplay mechanics.\n\nCharacters both main cast and supporting are unbelievably interesting and you will want to talk to everyone you meet. Scenery has blown me away with oozing atmosphere and the books' world is very well transferred into game setting with a fantastic story start to finish with satisfying consequences to your choices during the game. Everything Mass Effect 3's ending should have had is in here.\n\nThe writing is amazing and has caught me off-guard more than once. I have found situations where I didn't know how to act because choice and consequence is significant in this game, and when I do sometimes I regret my actions - you can even fail quests. TW3 is literary realism at its best.\n\nGraphicsControversy time. There has been talk of 'downgrading' of the graphics since its 2013 trailers. I can say that some of this is true - but I don't mind. I am somewhat partial to this- I believe there must be a discussion of dangerous complacency against fanatic gamer entitlement.\n\nHowever, despite this, the game is still beautiful. Riding through the desecrated world, I could see far into the horizon, lush atmosphere and the most beautiful bodies of water I have enjoyed in my years of gaming.\n\nBut, for a CDPR game the settings definitely suck, especially compared to TW2. Only one AA option, no supersampling, no antistrophic menu, ambiguous "levels" to each setting. The good news is that it requires no restart.\n\nThere are optimisation issues for some players. Anecdotally, my 770 GTX cannot run the game at 60 with max-ultra (no surprise). With a selection of features in ultra and rendering distance lowered to medium, I can obtain a solid 60 FPS with very few framedrops. Those who wish to inquire further may contact me here on steam.\n\nOne thing I must mention is that STEAM OVERLAY IS INVASIVE. With overlay enabled, I suffer from stuttering issues and a significant drop in framerate (15-20FPS). Disabled, I could enjoy the game with no stutters.\n\nTextures aren't GTAV quality, but The Witcher 3 has incredibly life-like faces that express emotion  extremely well. The cast is varied, with many hideous characters to contrast the rare beauties that you will encounter in your journey (Yen is very hot and this is a Witcher game after all). There is however, a large volume of vegetation that your character will simply pass through- not cool and immersion breaking.\n\nSoundThere isn't much to say. I personally love it but the OST will be subjective. Instrumentals are great but some will find the singing quite irritating. Did you like the trailer music? That's what you can expect. I for one will be buying the soundtrack. Oh and the OST for Skellige is beautiful when out of combat.\n\nConclusionI'd love to write more but there is a word limit on these things. I shall simply end with this: Despite some flaws, the game is beautiful, plays amazing and I have been thrown into a world like no game, book or film has before. The closest to 10/10 I have ever reached especially if they fix it even better.","May 18, 2015","true","66.0"," 893 of 1,105 people (81%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","81","893","1","35","91"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Legomenon/recommended/292030/","Legomenon","Hapax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Legomenon/","547 products in account","There are on occasion certain convergences and synergies that give rise to human creations destined to transcend and expand the role and scope of art and storytelling. That's when these creations border on myth. What distinguishes them is that they are not exclusively the work of a single mastermind; instead they become collaborations that span across years, decades, and encompass the minds of several artists, writers, visionaries. Such is the Nietzschean mythology of DC/Marvel superheroes; such is the Darwinist mythology of Planet of the Apes; and such is the Slavic-Tolkienian saga of The Witcher.\n\nMy personal maxim when it comes to games is: Gameplay is king; Story is queen. I have little to no interest in games with no story or even lore; and also no interest in games with only story (I'd rather read a book in that case). The seamless combination of both is what interests me the most, and very few games achieve this blend as Wild Hunt has achieved. This game is the embodiment of the perfect balance between gameplay and story.\n\nCDPR, the developer, has achieved the highest effect a game can have on its players: making them wish that it never ends. For the last five months I have delayed and put off the ending as long as I possibly could, wishing that this game could last forever; that I could play it for the rest of my life, always finding new side quests, new contracts, new treasure hunts. But alas, all great things must end; it's what makes them great. And in this case, The Witcher series ended on an incredibly high note. The fact that the developer has decided to conclude the story of Geralt with this game, instead of finding a way to milk the franchise also speaks volumes of their integrity as artists.\n\nThis is a game that is exuberantly alive: it bustles and teems with life. Walking through the woods, walking through a city, into a cave... you feel life around you, especially if you play with a good headset. The feeling of riding across the lands as the sun sets is something I'll never forget. I'd never played a game that felt so alive, so rich, so handcrafted in its minutest details. Some games came close, but probably due to limitations of technology and development cycle, they didn't achieve this level of liveliness and exuberance.\n\nI usually don't like cutscenes in most games, to be very honest, but in this game I couldn't get enough of it. The voice acting, the character animation, especially facial animation, is beyond anything we've come to expect from games in terms of quality, and most games now pale in comparison, seeming lifeless and dull. No wonder some critics said that it "defines next-gen": this game is technically and artistically unparalleled, and it should set a gold standard to be aspired to by all AAA devs in the coming years. Not that most of them will ever achieve something this great, but they should at least aspire to greatness.\n\nIt has moments where its writing is at its best the fewer words are used: Geralt and Ciri trashing a certain place was particularly brilliant. But the writing here is among the best a game has ever seen. From my own personal preference, only the writing in Fallout: New Vegas could equal the writing in Wild Hunt. The variety of soundbites in cities and villages, the different personalities ascribed to vendors (a blacksmith mourning his son, an armourer who is not what he seems, a grumpy merchant, etc etc etc)... From the very first quests, the inner life shown by these characters is simply staggering: a lone hunter in the woods, a very minor character, who considers himself a freak, has more inner life than most protagonists in most games out there.\n\nThis brings us to the question of empathy. Here we feel such empathy for these characters, even as we know that they are nothing but a complex arrangement of ones and zeroes (technically speaking) and we feel for even the most despicable among them, such as the Bloody Baron. Only in TV series such as The Sopranos and Breaking Bad have I felt such empathy for men whom I would personally loathe if I ever came across them. This is top-notch writing in action. We care for the characters in such a way that it’s hard to hold back the tears at certain points in the story. The only complaint I have, as some others have as well, is that the main villains are not as developed as they could be: Imlerith and Eredin in particular could have been much more interesting, as even minor characters came out more interesting than them. Especially compared to Letho, the villain in Assassins of Kings, the villains here are very flat. It is a minor complaint, though, in the grand scheme of the game.\n\nOn to the gameplay. The investigation component, though not exactly innovative, is employed so deftly that it makes for one of the most satisfying elements in the game: finding clues and picking up scents is just fun and it makes you feel like a supernatural detective. I know some players had objections to the combat, but I have no complaints whatsoever. Especially on higher difficulties, it is clever, tactical, challenging and just plain fun. You don't have to mash your buttons or click your mouse to death here, instead you have to pace yourself, prepare for each fight, try to get the right oils and signs and bombs ready. It can be awkward sometimes, but that's a matter of skill. The better you become at combat, the more surgical and graceful you can become, which makes it extremely fun and satisfying.\n\nAs an RPG, well, purists may argue that The Witcher series in general is not a true RPG because you will always be Geralt of Rivia: you will always be bound and limited by his personality, skills and fighting style. Yes, true enough. But within these bounds there is a freedom to build a character that is unique, not only in the dialogue choices that ultimately impact the story, but in the way you approach the world and what you do with it.\n\nIn terms of mechanics, I have had no problems whatsoever. Not a single crash, only some very minor and mildly amusing glitches. As I said before, this game is technically unparalleled. CDPR's engine is the perfect expression of Clarke's third law: advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Apart from some shoddy textures here and there, the game is truly magical in its beauty and scope. It is an open world without invisible walls, where the sky and the oceans are the limits.\n\nThe soundtrack is a work of art in itself. For the past two months I've started reading the books while listening to the soundtrack, and it makes for a very satisfying combination. It fills you with longing and transports you to the world of the Witcher while your body sits there in the bus, going to work or wherever. It is that good, seriously.\n\nFlawed as only the greatest masterpieces can be, Wild Hunt is a tour de force to be reckoned with. It is a world built by some of the most creative and innovative minds in the games industry; it is a game carved and handcrafted as a labour of love with only the varnish of commercial value. Wild Hunt redeems the videogame medium; it elevates art and storytelling to a whole new level that we can only hope will come to be imitated, however imperfectly.\n\n(This is an abridged version; the full version is here[medium.com])","May 8","true","241.6"," 195 of 217 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","195","217","9","7"

I loved every second of playing it,\nI have to say though, when you play it, play on the Death March! difficulty (hardest), why? because you need to play it like they intended, to get ready before the fight, taking potions, load specific bombs and apply oils, be more tactical when fighting the monsters.\n\nThe variety of the monsters is great, and every battle feels different, making you adjusting to each monster differently,\nuse different tactics on Wraiths for example, like placing a trap while fighting them because if you won't, you barely scratch them when attacking,\nor calming an Alghoul before smacking him up because when he isn't calm, he got spike shield and every time you hit him, you get hit back and you will die very quickly,\nand these are just 2 examples out of many more monsters,\nand another thing i found very sweet is that the same monster looks differently when they're at a higher level or at a different place in the world, like a Fouglet for example, in the swamps he looks pretty plain, but if you go to the Skellige Islands, they look really different, wearing horns, this is just a small example of the love and small detail crafting that went into this game.\n\nThe quests and story, I don't think that there is any other game with the amount of depth that's in this game,\neven the side-quests are so complex and deep that they feel like their a main quest,\nthe amazing animations, cutscenes and dialogs are made to prefection, allowing you to live it and feel so in the game as if it was a movie.\nThere are 3 major ending and around 32 minor ending to specific characters and how the world changes, this just gives you an example on how rich and complex the story is.\n\nI can go on and on and keep on praising the game, but I think you get my point.\n\nTL:DR, Buy this game, even at full price it's worth it, this game is master-piece.","June 23, 2015","true","220.1"," 159 of 172 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","159","172","11","2"

Now I just bask in the beautiful sun rising and setting over the Northern Realm.\n100/10\n\nSeriously, this game is ridiculously good. It definitely sets apart from other games in RPG. Actually in my honest opinion, this game should be a genre of its own. The story telling is ineffably amazing! Even the decisions you made in Witcher 2 can alter the universe in Witcher 3. That's just mind blowing. I am definitely going to finish Witcher 2 after completing Witcher 3, then replay Witcher 3 with the saved files and see how different Witcher 3 will be.\n\nThe quests in this game are always changing and exciting. I am a big fan of RPGs and have played several RPGs including Skyrim, Fallout, etc. but have always felt the stories were not captivating enough. I fell in love with this game after putting in 10-15 hours doing main and supplementary quests, slaying monsters on easy mode as I picked up the game mechanics. I have put in now 50 hours into the game over the past 5 days and have never felt bored or repetitive, and I don't even think I am halfway through the game yet. Each quest has a storyline that really hooks and connects you to the universe of the Witcher series whether it's a main quest or a side quest. Heck, I've done some quests that literally feature everything you can think of - slaying vampire, drunken sex with a transgendered elf (accidental of course), staging a play, watching somebody performing an autopsy, and many many more.\n\nLastly, I am no English major but I find the writing in this game sensational! Reading glossary on different characters and monsters and listening attentively to the dialogue are extremely satisfying and enjoyable. Even the love letter you looted from a corpse or note collected from a throng of bandits are worthwhile to read thoroughly. And who freaking knew there could be so many kinds of monsters - specters, ogroids, insectoids, draconids, etc. After this game if there ever was an apocalypse, I definitely will be the monster slayer guru.\n\nIf you are still for some reason wondering whether to pick up this game, I hope you'll find this review helpful. I seriously think this game is worth a lot more than $60 and I was happy to pre-order this game for $54. I am definitely picking up the DLCs.\n\nTLDR: Game is amazingly well-written through both main and side quests. Game developers were very thorough. Pick up this game.\n\nEDIT: Finished the game at 85 hours. Definitely was an emotional roller coaster, to say the least. Spent the following hour wandering around to finish random side quests but couldn't do it, felt so empty. Decided to buy Witcher 1 on Steam at full price to play the game despite its clunky mechanism, as well as the books and the comics. Also found out 16 free DLCs will be released before Heart of Stone. Definitely worth the purchase, down to every penny.\n\nNow back to applying for jobs.","May 23, 2015","true","109.4"," 183 of 207 people (88%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","88","183","207","29","0"

I spent a good time checking the visuals everywhere I went. The world really feel like real, like you could address locations by pointing trees along the way. Everything looks handmade and original.\n\nThe story is another thing this game does wonderfully. I nearly cried sometimes (no shame in it!) and Got really excited in some sequences. The storytelling and the cinematic are god-tier. This is by far the best aspect of the game.\n\nControls and combat system are different from TW2. The combat got easier (for the newcomers, I guess) and requires less strategy. Although the combat was made simpler, it is not boring at all, and the difficulty is adjustable so the strategy becomes neccessary sometimes. The controls, as opposite as some people say, I did not find bad. I played tons of games and I am always ready to get used to different movement mechanics.\n\nIn short, the game was fun and kept me motivated from start to finish. I would recommend this masterpiece to every gamer I know. I wish every game was like that. I would give it a 10/10, because I have ABSOLUTELY nothing to complain about the game itself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerspinach/recommended/292030/","killerspinach","OfficialCleveland","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerspinach/","333 products in account","First off, yes I recommend this game. I recommend this game one thousand times. When I die I want "Here lies Killerspinach, he recommends the Witcher 3" engraved on my tombstone.\n\nI am 35 years old, have been playing video games at a fairly obsessive rate nearly my whole life, and I can honestly say Witcher 3 is one of the best games I've ever played. I'm not going to go into a big technical breakdown of this masterpiece as it has been in the sun for awhile now and there are a thousand other, and many more qualified, reviewers who have done this. Instead I'd like to describe my thoughts and reactions to what is so far over 175 hours of playtime in WItcher 3.\n\nThe one thing that really struck me with this game is just how ambitous it is. CDProjekt must have been all kinds of hungry and ready to make a statement which they have certainly achieved. Witcher 2 was a great game and a commercial and critical success but the series, especially with the original being a PC-only game, was previously more of a cult classic than one of the top dogs like say Elder Scrolls or the Bioware titles. This title however changes that status big time and I don't doubt that this was the developers intention.\n\nIn an age where many big box games nickel and dime you to death, leaving what feels like empty voids of content that can be filled for a price, the Witcher 3 goes the complete opposite direction instead giving probably around 3 times as much POLISHED content as the average 60$ release. Yes some of it can be redundant as far as questing (mainly side quests can get tiresome at times) but the story and world they have created is, I say again, a masterpiece and it is immense. It is overwhelmingly large and alive at first but is stitched together quite well with a fast travel by post system that feels a little less cheap than the average teleport from anywhere approach to fast travel\n\nThe tone of the series is dark fantasy themed with a fair amount of politics and other sordid affairs. As far as being aimed at an adult or mature audience it is top notch. Most games with an M label just have it because they said F$%* too much in the script or they showed too much blood. Either way they are still aimed at the 13-25 year old crowd and with most of the industry money there traditionally why wouldn't they be? Well thank you to CDProjekt for having some brass and throwing down what must have been a huge budget to fund a game that not many 12 or 13 year olds would care much about at all. Seriously you can say GTA or something is "mature"because of it's rating but it's all juvenille jokes and run and gun action, I love that series too but I'm just saying; offensive doesn't = mature. No offense intended to younger people but Witcher 3 is just not the action packed or level-up driven experience that most younger gamers go for and I admire these devs for taking the risk necessary to create something this large that doesn't pander to those desires which are already well served by countless other titles.\n\nAll of this wasn't enough, giving us a true mature game and having it be the size and quality it is wasn't where this dev was stopping. Instead they came back with several free additions to the game ranging from new character outfits to an entire New Game+ mode. After 30 years of gaming it's rare I am swept off my feet, this one swept me off my feet. It won GOTY from nearly every game-review heavyweight and sold like a zillion copies. Enjoy the standing ovation, CDProjektRed, it's going to go on for awhile and you deserve it.","January 10","true","188.4"," 117 of 125 people (94%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","94","117","125","22","1"

I've read all the books, and I've now played all the games. Honestly I think CD PR Red has done a better job with the franchise than Sapokowski himself.\n\nAnyways, here are some pros/cons from my perspective.\n\nCons:\n- Quite a bit of glitches, but still nothing compared to what games like Skyrim/Fallout has\n- Lack of scaling. After the first 10 levels the game is very easy even on the hardest difficulty. Using time on potions, oils etc seems pointless as you progress into the game. NG+ doesn't really deal with this well.\n- Controls can be a bit clunky\n- drunk steed\n- some points of interest seems forced, rushed, and ultimately a not so much interesting point.\n\nPros:\n+ Extremely good voice acting\n+ One of the best open worlds in a game. The level-design is splendid.\n+ IMO the best characters in any game, it is simply stunning how well the characters are made. The greatest strength of the game. You quickly tie an emotional bond to the characters, and all the main characters are very interesting, and complex.\n+ How about a round of cards? Gwent, specifically?\n+ Brilliant soundtrack.\n+ Combat is versatile, interesting and challenging. First levels are very hard though. Variety of different signs and weapons to use. Expect something along the lines of Dark Souls in terms of moveset.\n+ Excellent graphics, and mostly very good optimization. I have a 980 and can do about 30 FPS in 4k(mostly 60 fps in 1080, but when it rains in the swamp it goes down to like 30 for some reason). This is one of the few games where NVIDIA's 4k setting really shines, as the textures in 1080p seem like garbage in comparison(check the trees, they're insane in 4k).\n+ Very good storytelling. The main story will keep most people hooked through the entirety of the game. I do wholeheartedly recommend to play TW2 before starting this however.The sidequests are the real surprise though, as I don't think anyone has put so much effort into sidequests in a game this big before. They are awesome.\n+ The sheer scale of the game. It is simply ridicolous. I have spent about 130 hours in the game on a playthrough. If you only care about the story and play on easy the game will take around 35-45 hours.\n+ Free DLCs, actual expansion packs; what's not to like?\n+ Mod support, with sort-of ok mod tools\n+ BEARD\n+ Choices in the game have a very great impact on the outcome of the ending(s).\n+ For those who read the books, the devs have done a good job putting in references here and there. Also, a lot of references to books, movies, games etc in general. You will chuckle.\n\nMy verdict:\nI have had so much fun with this game. One of the very few games that have managed to get to me emotionally. It has without a doubt become one of my favourite games, of all time. It's hard to put my finger on too many negative things here. There is a lot that could have been done better, sure, but compared to other games.. I don't think a game has to be perfect to achieve a perfect score, and  based on the immensely enjoyable time I've had with this game, I give it a solid 10/10. I have played about 500 games, and this is the 2nd game I can give a 10/10 rating.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend to play Witcher 2 first, as you will get considerably more out of the game. Witcher 1 has horrible combat, and is very VERY hard to get through. I honestly wouldn't even try it until after TW3.","October 8, 2015","true","179.3"," 128 of 140 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","128","140","6","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/292030/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action open world role playing game, developed by CD Projekt RED, releasing on PC, PS4 and Xbox One in May 2015. This is the third game in the Witcher series. The game is owned by about 1.5 million users on Steam alone, with people still constantly playing this game, the all-time peak concurrent players for Witcher almost broke the 100k mark at 92k. This goes to show how much of an epic game this is.\n\nWitcher appears to be a series which changes its gameplay elements quite a bit; the game play in the first game is almost completely different to how it is in this game. The combat system feels very fluid and easy to control; the game’s tutorial at the start of the game explains all of the elements in an easy to understand manner. To begin with I thought the fighting system felt a lot like the Arkham style, but as you get further into the game and develop your skills and abilities, it takes its own route and becomes a very unique experience with lots of dodges, parries to take into consideration as you are whaling on the bad guys. One feature that is a reoccurring theme in the series, is the potion making; this game more than ever encourages you to make potions and use them, sometimes it is almost essential that you have a good stock of potions on you in order to defeat some enemies and bosses.  Geralt can now jump and move around the open world environment in a much more free manner, with the game now also including a sort of parkour style running action. I really enjoyed that you also spent a lot of time on horseback, meaning you can also take part in combat scenes swiping your swords around at confused enemies as you rush by.\n\nGraphically, Witcher 3 is one of the superior games to come out of 2015. It looks stunning when you are playing with all of the settings on max. I was not able to play it on 4k resolution with the graphics ramped up, but was able to fully appreciate the game on 1440p with everything turned on, including the nVidia specialist stuff. I was especially impressed at the character modelling, the facial graphics are almost photo realistic, and along with some of the best animations I have ever seen in a video game. I would say the game will need a pretty heft rig in order to play it in its full glory, but maybe dropping down the resolution scale means you may still get to play it even if you aren’t on the most powerful computer. The sound effects and dialog are again up there with the best I have heard in a game. Every line of dialogue is fully voice acted. All of the sound effects are spot on to, even the very little ones such as the noise your horse makes as it runs through mud, everyone is perfect.  Whilst the soundtrack is one of the most epic you will hear as well; truly amazing.\n\nThe story within Witcher 3 is absolutely thrilling. Having not fully played the Witcher 2, the game gives a good overview of what has happened since then, so you can catch up with the plot in the series till now. There is so much plot to explore throughout the game, with almost half of it revolving around side quests.  As with all huge open world games, a lot of story and lore can be discovered through books, notes and dialogue with other characters find throughout the game. At the start of the game you get the option to import your Witcher 2 save file, but I have heard people say that it doesn’t add anything to the game as it seems that your options become void as you play this version of the game. As I haven’t finished Witcher 2, I did not have the option though. The actual main plot of the game is stunning though. I have often thought that Witcher would make a great movie to sit and watch, that would feel very familiar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I was completely enthralled in the plot and was on the edge of my seat a lot of the time with excitement.\n\nWitcher 3 is a quite difficult game. Most of the zones have a kind of set level of monster and quest in them, kind of like how it was in WoW where you have to work your way up to a specific level before going into it and not get absolutely destroyed as soon as you step foot there. I really liked this in an open world type game; whilst games like Skyrim and Fallout have everything scale to whatever level you are, I liked that Witcher put in some sort of barriers meaning you had a real reason to want to level up your character in order to take on the really epic encounters. Even in the lower level zones, there will be monsters and quests that are far too difficult for you to take on at that zone’s level, meaning you will have to move onto the next zone or two and then come back to finish the area off once you are at the appropriate level; again, I really liked this element of the game, it means you aren’t always clearing out your quest log and then moving on, it gives you a good reason to travel back and see previous zones.\n\nThe open worldness of Witcher 3 is one of the reasons why it is such a successful title, there is so much to do and see in the world, some of which you will need to travel to by boat, which is a new feature added in this game, and the rest will require you to travel by horse, again I really liked the horse feature, it allows you to travel around the world, see the stunning environments and even discover new objectives, quests and other side elements to the game, whereas if you had just used the fast travel system, you might not of otherwise located them.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, I have put about 60 hours into Witcher 3, this is with completing the main story and a good portion of the side quests. Now, I like to play these games in a very methodical way; I like to follow a set path and finish everything I come across; but towards the end of the game I really stepped up my interest in wanting to complete the main story, and then I could come back to finish the rest of the game at my own pace. The developers have said that there is about 50 hours’ worth of side quests to do; whilst I tried to keep my use of the wiki at a minimum, I would think if anyone were to rely on internet resources, this could be dramatically reduced to say 15 hours.  I have also seen people who have completed more than one play through of this game as well, as there is a lot of different choices you make throughout the game, that have a severe impact on the outcome of the main story; meaning the replay ability factor is there as well as the endless hours of content.\n\nI only ran into one technical issue whilst playing; this is when my map just went completely black. I couldn’t find any fixes online and the only way I could fix it was sadly through reinstalling the game; this was a massive pain in the back side to me given that the install size is fairly big; but as it isn’t an issue which has been reported before I can kind of let it slide a bit, my file may of got corrupted or some other hardware glitch, I don’t know. There has been a few updates that patched up the majority of the day one issues so you can rest assure that this game is technically sound as of now.\n\nMy conclusion of Witcher 3, is that it is an absolute masterpiece of a game, I am not surprised at all that it has been so many people’s Game of the Year for 2015, as it may even be considered game of the decade in my book. For me, Witcher 3 is now my all-time favourite game, something that I didn’t think would surpass my previous favourite, GTA V.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brevi/recommended/292030/","brevi","Brevi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brevi/","134 products in account","I just finished Witcher 3 after more then a hundred hours, and I can finally talk about an overall opinion of the game! There are zero spoilers in this review.\n\nI think that the game is an incredible achievement for CD PROJEKT RED and the European gaming industry. From a $67 million budget they made an RPG with content and quality that is up there (in my opinion) with the best titles of this genre.\n\nFor comparison Skyrim was done from an estimated $80 million budget and Dragon Age Inquisition shipped from est. $150-200 million. They are all different games so I don't want to ♥♥♥♥ around and say which one is better, but I think it's very fair to say Witcher 3 holds up and actually improves upon many aspects of these games while being developed from much less money and by a significantly smaller team.\n\nStrengths:\n\nStory & SettingSimply incredible how detailed and lengthy the story goes. They must have put a ton of effort into the story boards and scripts because it really showed. It has content enough to fill a several seasons long TV series! Both main quests, secondary quests, witcher contracts are done very well, the dialogue is clever, the options and different approaches yield interesting results. The game is not afraid to explore mature content, and some of the quests feature pretty heavy, grim and dark elements. I'm very satisfied with the conclusion I've got which is exactly how I wanted it to end.\n\nCharacters & Voice ActingDoug Cockle returns from previous Witcher games to portray Geralt. He must have had hundreds of hours worth of dialogue and I think he has done an excellent job. Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) totally 'ruled' as emperor Emhyr var Emries. The ladies Jo Wyatt (Ciri), Jaimi Barbakoff (Triss) and Denise Gough (Yennefer) did very well to bring these complex female characters to life. Steven Hartley (Eredin) was menacing as ♥♥♥♥. All the supporting actors were likable and delivered. The emotional scenes were buyable for the most part which is not easy in a video game. The characters had depth, realistic motivations, and in general great design. I think there was nothing missing in this area.\n\nGraphics, Environments, Overall Visual AspectSimply stunning. It's the best looking RPG I have played and the places I got to visit especially later in the game made my jaw drop left and right. Skellige was my favorite, but you also get to go to a few surprising and totally epic environments during the main quest that you cannot visit otherwise. The armors and weapons in the game sell this medieval fantasy world very well, they are realistic and practical unlike what we see in most fantasy games. The creatures are varied, there are flying, floating, swimming enemies (some even do a combination like fly and swim) and their designs are excellent.\n\nWeaknesses / Should be Improved:\n\nMovement and ControlsIf I would have to pick the worst of this package it's definitely the movement and interaction for me. Geralt handles like a freaking spaceship or a racing car. Not only that he gets stuck around everything, you have to manually jump over small boxes instead of the Witcher using common sense to lift his feet 10 cm higher. The horse is even worse... the double tap mechanism to sprint is complete aids, and likewise the horse gets stuck everywhere. Jumping in general is weird and you connect to surfaces in awkward ways. Falling from 2-3 meters high causes INSTANT death which will frustrate you greatly. Looting a simple box can be annoying as hell as Geralt is unable to target directly under his feet. Like many console aids games that came before Witcher 3, you can only loot things directly in front of you from a certain minimum and maximum range. They felt to include a mechanism to lit candles and other light sources with the same button that you would use to loot items... imagine what happens when you have a candle near a small box that can be looted. This is the area where you can really feel the missing polish, and that they focused on other areas of the game. It's a shame because movement animations are otherwise beautiful and done by expert motion capture artists.\n\nCombat System & Combat DesignIt's sad that this needs to be mentioned under the weaknesses. I would like to point out that Witcher 3 is still an improvement when compared to Witcher 1 & 2, but the combat is average at best. The fighting style of Geralt is very cinematic and the motion capture animation are beautiful, but there is just no substance to it on a gameplay level. It's not very responsive and it's too random for player skill to consistently triumph in challenging situations. Most monsters have a limited move set and often shared between similar species. Boss battles are largely forgettable from a game design perspective. CD PROJEKT RED clearly needs to improve in this area, but they are better every time from what I've seen.\n\nLeveling System & Skill Trees & LootI can't help but feel that this game would have been much better if it had some sort of a scaling game world at least when it comes to quest objectives. Quests are often red (10 levels higher) to you in the beginning, and then later you have a large pool of gray quests which are not worth doing. In the story and game world perspective it does not make sense either to have a High Vampire or Royal Wyvern that is a complete pushover because it is 5-10 levels weaker then you. I was literally killing some of the Draconids in one hit on later levels. It's also strange when you are handed a legendary viking sword that was forged from the finest steel and in dragon fire only to notice your mediocre crafted weapon outperforms it by a mile. Some enemies and some items should have scaled with Geralt and quests should never become gray in a single player game of this type.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI really loved some parts of Witcher 3 and I really hated others. Overall I can describe it as a masterpiece that is very rough around the edges. I've added it to my favorites because the story took me on a memorable journey with breath taking environments and epic battles. The saga of White Wolf Geralt was done justice! I can easily recommend buying this game for RPG fans if it's on a decent sale or if some kind of 'Game of the Year' polished version sees the light of day.","July 3, 2015","true","118.0"," 99 of 111 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","99","111","4","4"

You cannot just run in a slice people, you have to think, take cautious, make herbs, *be prepared*.\n\n- Story and sidequests are all rich, albeit, sometimes -rarely- repetitive.

But there's one thing that needs to be said about high profile RPGs like this one, something that many others ultimately falls short on that The Witcher 3 picks up, even holding it high above its head as if in triumph.\n\nThat is, side quests are actually worth the time , not only in the experience and/or money you gain from participating in, but that the smaller stories are actually engaging. Dragon Age: Inquisition was the most profound example of 2014 in terms of terrible and boring chores, so mundane, so devoid of life or purpose they shouldn't even be regarded as side quests. There's no gathering quests and cookie cutter "Kill X of Y, and return to Z" style missions; every small deviation from the main road feel like smaller roads, with attention to detail. The lore of the game is just that robust.","May 21, 2015","true","72.6"," 115 of 134 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","115","134","4","2"

Just max the textures for details\n- Characters faces are very detailed, looks almost like cinematic\n- Good optimization in big cities - you have 30-50 NPC just in front of you and no fps drop at all! I've expected huge drops in Vizima, but it's just like everywhere else\n- Controls, i think they are very easy and simple. Though some players don't like them\n- Potatoes, very cheap but effective\n- Boats, you can break them in pieces and sink\n- Your own horse\n- Horse races\n- Fast travel signs, located in towns and villages. You can also fast travel between ports, when on boat\n- Beard grows!\n- No game breaking bugs. Almost no bugs, you just don't notice them usually, game has so much good stuff to do\nAnd much more...\n\nCons:\n- Some players have multiple crashes. I may had few crashes, but once per few hours, and it may be related to hardware.\n- Won't run on a weak PC. That's obvious, you want some good graphics and huge open world - you need a decent PC\nCan't find any significant cons really...\n\nMy specs:\ni5 2400 3.1 GhZ (lol doesn't even match minimal req), 1tb HDD\nRadeon HD 7950 3GB (overclocked to 1100 and 1550 core/mem, adds around 10-15 fps)\n8GB RAM 1600\n1920x1080\n\nFPS - i'm playing on medium settings with Ultra textures and details, AA and VSync, no Hairworks.\nI got 45-60 fps, usually around 55 in villages, but game feels smooth even on 40.\nOn 50 it feels like 60. I mean, in fps game i can feel every frame, but here its just smooth and playable (guess that's because it's 3d person RPG)\nI lose some fps with rain and some other heavy effects (5-10), so that's why i lower some of the settings.\nOther presets:\nUltra - 30-40 fps\nHigh - 50-55\nMed - 55-60\n+5 fps without AA and SSAO\n\nMy specs aren't the best, i still have 30-45 in BF4 and new games on Ultra. I just set it between medium-max to have best quality/fps ratio. Also, AMD sometimes have worse drivers and optimization than Nvidia.  Haven't noticed that 3 years ago, but now i can see\n\n1.03 patch added like 5-10 fps, which is really nice for me\nSo, i would say this game have quite a decent optimization.\n\nAnd ♥♥♥♥♥ all that downgrade sh*t.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drahon45/recommended/292030/","drahon45","Crusader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drahon45/","243 products in account","God damn it. This game, people. This game. It is perhaps one of the best video games to have ever been created, definitely in the top ten. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has everything a gamer wants from a game. It has an amazing combat system, an interactive story where your choices truly do matter in the end, an awesome, charming, and tough protagonist - in both Geralt and Ciri, awesome side characters, an amazingly detailed environment and world filled with things to do and see, eye-popping graphics with plenty of room for optimization or further eye-poppiness by the player based on their needs, and an interesting take on character building elements.\n\nI've always flirted with The Witcher games. I've played both of the predecessor to The Witcher 3, but never really got into them. They just didn't immerse me as well as The Witcher 3 did. So even if you've never played any of the previous games - don't be too worried. You'll find that everything can still be well understood by a total newcomer to the series, thanks to an in-game encyclopedia all about the characters you meet. However, I do still recommend reading a bit about the plot from the previous games so you can have a better feel for what's going on, and what some characters are referring to when they refer to past events. I, for one, will probably eventually find myself completing the other two games just because I loved this one so much.\n\nThe thing that this game has best going for it, out of all of its awesome traits, is its amazing, well thought-out story and world lore, and its awesome main protagonist, Geralt of Rivia. Geralt is perhaps one of the most well-developed characters of all time when it comes to video games. He is a total badass, and whether he uses that badassness for good or for evil is up to the player in most situations. Geralt is the truest neutral one will ever find in an RPG. In this story, all he cares about is looking for his adopted daughter, Ciri - and he will do whatever it takes to find her, and to protect her from the otherworldly and immensely powerful Wild Hunt. The story follows Geralt as he goes to great lengths to find Ciri, and then to protect her as the Wild Hunt closes in. Sacrifices will be made, and hard battles will be fought. Yet Geralt doesn't hesitate when it comes to making sure Ciri knows that she is loved, and knows that he will do anything to keep her from being captured by the Wild Hunt, who plan to use her unique powers to invade this world - killing her in the process, most likely. God damn it people, if you play this game for no other reason - play it for the story. It is a story that needs to be told to all with eyes to see and ears to hear.\n\nBut the main story alone isn't all the game has going for it. In the world, Witcher Geralt has plenty of things to do beyond search for Ciri. Each town you find has a notice board that you can use to pick up contracts for Geralt, all of which involve hunting down legendary beasts and sometimes solving old mysteries surrounding these beasts. Some of my favorites involve hauntings and ghosts - but there are plenty revolving around all sorts of other mythical creatures.\n\nIn conclusion, The Witcher 3 is a game that deserves your money, and deserves your time. CD Projekt Red have put so much thought and care into this franchise, and have definitely made the last game in the series their magnum opus, and a need to own game. And, CD Projekt Red are perhaps the most communal based developer/publisher out there - releasing tons of free DLC to enhance user experience, and releasing two planned paid DLCs - the first of which is only $10 and has received nothing but positive reviews - and is an entirely new story revolving around Geralt of Rivia. If you have yet to purchase this game, I highly recommend it - and think that this game should be at the top of your "to buy" list. It is a perfect 10/10 video game, and one of the few we have had in years on the AAA scale.","January 1","true","51.0"," 103 of 118 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","103","118","3","4"

The Witcher 3 really does put other games to shame and sets an example of which I wish other games would follow.\n\nThe Main Story-The main story of this game is the best I have played to date, not only is it gripping but it also manages to give some back story from the other two games, something I was worried about been that I have never played the other two. But a sufficient amount of back story was given for me to make sense of Geralts relationship with some of the characters. It took me approximately 44 hours to complete the main quests although I know it has taken other people longer. The main story has three different endings what will be decided by the choices you make throughout the game.\n\nSide Quests-Even in the side quests you are able to see the amount of effort and detail that has been put into them. Each side quest has it's own story to tell and many of them take a considerable amount of time to complete. In addition to this these are not your typical go fetch or go kill quests each of them are unique to one another and tell there own story. If you prefer the more typical kill this and kill that type of thing to get your XP up then another option is availible in the form of "Witcher Contracts".\n\nDLCThe Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt offers a lot of add-ons at no extra cost. This was a major positive to me since most games today charge fees for such content. The free DLC includes, quests, alternative looks for characters and armor. There are two paid DLC's avalible one of which is yet to be released but if they are anything as good as the game then i'm sure they will be well worth the price.\n\nSummary-Despite finishing the game i'm going to complete every side quest and witcher contract I can because this game is something which should be enjoyed in every possible aspect because of the amount of detail that has been put into every nook and cranny. - I don't see myself completing everything any time soon as I spent over an hour doing a singular secondary quest.\n-If you are someone looking for a game to really sink your teeth into then this is it.\n\n-Great visuals\n-Gripping story\n-Everything in the game has had an amazing amount of detail put into it\n-Free DLC\n-Plenty of things to do once you have completed the game\n-Almost an endless amount of hours worth of gameplay\n-More DLC on the way","April 7","true","71.4"," 88 of 98 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","88","98","2","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dooleh/recommended/292030/","Dooleh","Dooleh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dooleh/","1488 products in account","Do I recommend this game?! - Does a leshen hate dimeritium bombs, relict oil, silver swords and igni? Hell yes!\n\nI rarely get "hyped" for games, or anything else really, but I had a feeling that the guys at CD PROJEKT RED would not let me down with this one, so around 9.5 months ago, I pre-ordered this game and patiently waited for my steam account to give birth to a rugged, emotionless, gravel voiced, monster hunting baby, and boy is it a beautiful baby!\n\nThis game lived up to all my expectations and then some. This isn't your dad's open world rpg game with nothing to do but run for miles and miles in snow and then occasionally whack a monster or two with your monotonous one button combat, no... this game is something completely different, the combat, the quest structure, the dialogue choices that actually impact the outcome of the game, the graphics, the music, the optimization, everything is just perfect and makes this game incredibly fun to play.\n\nSo, like in the past two games, you play a witcher/an adventurer... a monster slayer enthusiast, if you will, named Geralt, who is looking for his protege Cirilla (he refers to her as his daughter, so you know they're tight!) who is being pursued by the wild hunt. But even though he has to find her as quickly as possible, along his journey Geralt will find time to stray off the main course, as you do in open world games, and pick up an occasional secondary quest, a witcher contract, a gear set scavenger hunt map, play some magi...err hearthsto... I mean gwent! he'll play gwent... (a card game that took me some time to appreciate, but once I won a few cards from random merchants, I really got into it).\n\nThe game world consists of 3 major separate maps (you can freely travel between them) White Orchard, Velen/Novigrad and Skellige, and while White Orchard and Velen are somewhat similar, and are mostly woodland maps, well, Velen has some swamp areas and a giant city in it (it's so big and full of quests that it might as well be a separate area), Skellige is a snow covered, viking inspired map which consist of one big island and a few smaller ones.\nIf you're wondering if there is much to do in such a large game world, hell yeah there is! You'll be done with White Orchard in about 5-7 hours if you 100% it, but the other two maps are just chock-full of quests, and it'll take you days to play through them. I have 110 hours game time as I'm writing this, and I'm not done with either of them yet.\n\nOnto the "goods" and the "bads". It's a pretty game, so there are no uglies, well...\n\n+ The graphics are just amazing for an open world game, sharp textures on most objects and most main characters (Geralt and his friends especially), light effects, shadows, grass density, facial expressions, view distance... everything is just jaw dropping gorgeous.\n\n+ Sound design is pretty good, nothing you wouldn't expect from an AAA title, good medieval tunes while running around outside of combat, dynamic and intense music when you're in combat, no complaints there.\nVoice acting is a step up from Witcher 2, which itself was a huge step up from the first game, and while not perfect it's still good, and the important thing is, story related characters are voiced really, really well.\n\n+ Gameplay! While the combat is somewhat hindered by the controls, it's still pretty fun. The sign system gives it variety and a tactical approach to each fight (especially at the two hardest game difficulties). The witcher contract quests are especially a blast to play (they are my favorite part of the game), where you have to detective your way to the monster you have to kill, or not kill, you never know...\n\n+ Optimization is pretty good, I locked my game to 30fps on my i7 920 @3Ghz, gtx 660ti OC and 8gb of ram, and I can play it on ultra at 1200p, with shadows and foliage draw distance at medium, ambient occlusion turned off and without the nvidia hair thing...\n\n- Not everything is flower petals and fancy chocolates and cute baby unicorns, sadly... the controls and combat are somewhat clunky, and are the only bad thing about this game... controls especially. Sometimes Geralt acts like he can't turn around in place, and instead he makes a wide circle which makes movement in tight indoor areas, and under water a controller dropping/face palming/deep sighing pain.\nRoach, Geralt's trustry horsey, suffers from the same leg disease as Geralt, the horse has a mind of her own, sometimes a twig can stop Roach at full gallop, sometimes she'll go left if you tell her to go right, well you get the idea, no point in beating a dead horse (ha!).\nThe combat, while it can be very fun and tactical, also suffers from bad controls from time to time, but not as much as the above examples.\nSometimes Geralt starts combat with his sword sheathed and starts fistfighting a boss, in most of those cases it'll take you more than a few button presses till the game figures out you're trying to take out your sword.\nAlso, the control scheme changes when you enter combat and wipes the jump button from existence, so if you're stuck in a small space surrounded by a knee high fence, prepare to die!\n\n- some characters have bad textures which really stands out when you talk to them.\n\nAll in all, this game definitely lived up to my expectations, it's my new favorite open world rpg (sorry Oblivion), and while not entirely perfect, with the controls and whatnot... in my opinion, it's as perfect as any game can get in this day and age. I really can't give it less than a perfect score - 10/10.","June 1, 2015","true","114.4"," 85 of 98 people (87%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","87","85","98","22","0"

You can race, fistfight, play gwent, which that's a very easy card game, you can explore, and if you have hard time exploring you can buy maps or look at notice boards and they will pretty much just tell you where to go.  I think if you want to maximise you're fun, you should play the side quests first, then do the main quests.  One of the most funnest part of the game, is doing monster contracts. You negotiate your pay, gather evidence, track the monster, have an epic fight. Don't bad sad if you have hard time defeating some monsters.

He whispers into my ear, "I am the White Wolf". He grabs me with his powerful Witcher hands and puts me on my back. I'm ready. I prepare my body for Geralt. He begins the Trial of Grasses. It hurts so much, but I do it for Geralt. I can feel my insides tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against this force. I want to become a Witcher. I roar in a mighty roar as  I conquer the Trial. My dad walks in. Geralt looks him straight in the eyes and says, "Law of Surprise." Geralt leaves through my window.

I just finished the game, right before writing this review, on the Blood and Broken Bones difficulty, and only now can I say that writing a review would do it any form of justice. I started playing on May 18th, around 6 PM (it had only been out for a few minutes then)\n\nAfter sinking a significant amount of time into this game, I have only this to say: Its the most satisfying gaming experience I've had in a very long time. Probably since before 2010 (when gaming practices were far better IMO). In a day and age like this, this game gives me hope about the industry. Yes, it has managed to move me that much :P\n\nAn important note before going into this game:\nBefore you decide to pick this game up I STRONGLY recommend at least going over the entries of some of the characters on the Witcher wiki,\nThis will help you develop a better connection with them as the story progresses. Furthermore, make sure you finish the first 2 games for the best possible experience. All the better if you've read the books too (but the wiki sufficed for me :P )\n\nNow to the meat of the matter: the game itself.\nIn my opinion, this game is well worth its full price. Every aspect of it literally reflects the amount of time and dedication the devs spent into it to make it what it is. For one, combat has been balanced greatly; its far from annoying, and as you progress further in the storyline, you can't help but feel like a badass when you've mastered it all and see Geralt pulling off all those maneuvers that you could only imagine in the last 2 games.\n\nMake no mistake, this is probably the only game of the trilogy where you'll TRULY feel like a Witcher. Every aspect of the game feels truly organic. Everything gels in well to form a beautiful picture: the music, the general ambience, Geralt, the supporting characters and the side activities - all of them contribute to making this a wonderful experience.\n\nThe key point being that in this game, whenever you do something- you actually feel like you've made a small difference in some way: destroy a monster nest by an abandoned village and it will get repopulated, finish side quests and people will respond to you differently.\n\nCharacters from all the previous games make an entrance in one way or another, some as a happy surprise, others not so much.\n\nNow to gameplay mechanics:\nYou need only collect ingridients once to brew anything: after this, they replenish with the usage of strong alcohol. I like this, especially since its a pain in the ♥♥♥ to find specific ingridients in this large open world. Potions act as both preparatory measures, and reactionary ones. You can drink Black Blood to poison Vampires that feed on you, drink Cat to see in the dark, consume Killer Whale to dive to great depths and the list goes on and on.\n\nHorse riding is fairly simple, did face a few hindrances about ~10 times in my 68 hour experience, but far from game-breaking.\nYou can equip your horse with various equipment: saddles for stamina, blinders for making it calmer in the face of adversity (monsters) and even saddlebags to increase the load you can carry. Any trophies you collect may also be featured on the horse for some paltry bonuses.\n\nCombat is extremely satisfying. You still have light and strong attacks, but nothing as clunky as 2, or as boring as 1. Signs, bombs and potions still pay a significant role, but flesh out the combat tree and Geralt can whoop ♥♥♥ with just his sword (if you get that good, the difficulty I played on, I used everything). Chop something up well enough, and you can dismember it. Nothing more satisfying than watching a third of a drowner's body chopped off, or seeing Geralt behead a bandit in a brutal finisher.\n\nKey being that you actually feel like a sword-wielding killer mutant, but you're still human in the end. Make no mistake, this game will punish you for stupidity, but not in an unfair manner.\n\nThe story itself is awesome: the locations range from your Northern Realm's Velen (no man's land), the free and beautiful city of Novigrad and my personal favourite: The Skellige Isles (very norse-like in several aspects, feels like you're in the land of the Vikings to an extent).\n\nSide quests have just the right amount of weight associated with them. The choices you make matter right at the end, and you might have several outcomes depending on what you did on your playthrough.\n\nThe optimization's great. I played this beast on my Laptop, with only a GTX 850M, an 8GB RAM and a 2.3 GHz processor overclocked to about 3.4 GHz. The amazing thing is, that at 1920x1080, I could clock in 35+ fps with medium specs. Needless to say, I was very happy.\n\nSadly, there is no end-game content, but that would just be me acting spoiled :P\nThis game, is bloody amazing, and influenced me, a thinking adult, to start saying ploughin' instead of "f*ckin'" simply because it will remind of the number of times I've heard it in this game :P :P\n\nAll in all, if you've been a fan of the Witcher franchise, do not hesitate: pick this game up. Its well worth the price, and if you liked the first 2 games for only their story, well then, you'll be in for multiple pleasant surprises in this one. You'll clearly be able to tell that they put a substantial amount of effort into EVERYTHING.\n\nIf you are strictly new to the franchise, I'd recommend you get yourself familiar with the lore before investing yourself in this game. Read the wiki, play the games or read the books. Do at least two of the previous things, and you should be good to go.\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly recommend this game, because even after spending almost 3 days' worth of time on it, I can confidently say it was worth it. That's something I haven't been able to do  in a very, very long time.\n\nAnd finally, remember: steel for humans & silver for monsters, though you'll have a hard time distinguishing the two figuratively.","May 24, 2015","true","249.7"," 80 of 91 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","80","91","5","0"

It's incredible. Anyone who tells you that a modded Skyrim is better than this... please laugh right in their god damned faces for me. Thank you. Look at my library. Now look at me. I've played Skyrim for close to 200 hours, heavily modded, and it was gorgeous for its time, but it's NOTHING compared to THIS. W3 spanks skyrim all over the place. And thank GOD I can FINALLY say that. I've been waiting for this for so long. I didn't know it was this particular game I was waiting for, but now I know it is.\n\nThe tutorial? That thing that you try to rush through in most games? You don't even want to rush it. It's like ending up in bed with the hottest woman you've ever seen; you just take your time and ease into her, feeling the jealousy of the entire world around you, because you are in the midst of the glorious feast of life in that miraculous moment; that's what logging into W3 for the first time is like: You just languish, taking in the staggeringly amazing graphics. You say "oh my goodness... look... if I press "E"... it opens this door..." like it's the first time you've ever seen that mechanic in a game or something. And then you step out onto the porch, and you see a massive swath of land before you; mountains, crags, forest, valleys-- it's a magnificent view, and you think "well, surely this is just the instanced view from the porch during a tutorial, it's not like that when you get down there."  WRONG, it IS the actual world that you get to go play in; and it's only a slice of it. The goosebumps and giddiness I felt when I realized that I was actually looking at the massive open wilderness that I get to go play in? Yeah, I've never felt that before, in any game, not even Skyrim. Not even CLOSE. This unmodded, brand new release is ten times what the most heavily modded Skyrim could hope to afford the average gamer; the world is so alive and visceral, and the way the land is laid out is so diverse and organic and intense.

This is a pure open world adventure at best and well worth the entry fee. A very long romp through for those who are ready to delve into the Witcher world. Though the game has many janks to it, its easily forgiven because its a open world. While playing i couldn't help but note every game The Witcher 3 instantly either copied or got inspired by, but i assume it was for a good reason because of the experience it will offer those who play the game.\n\nTheres some poor developer choices in this game, that i wish was addressed but i guess when you cram so much into the game, youll forget the smallest details. The developers did a might job and i got my rocks off while playing. I enjoyed it a lot and the stories it had.\n\nmy con so far is i dont care for gwent what so ever. even though i did all side quest except gwent, cause i don't care for card games. Also im not a fan of multiple endings, most will like it, most will hate it, so make sure you make the right decisions. blah! none the less its a good game and worth owning.\n\nMy soul is finally free!!!","June 7, 2015","true","276.6"," 96 of 119 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","96","119","3","0"

Dodging is quite fun, especially when you parry!\n-Interesting quest details as if narrated by Dandelion himself. The work they put into each quests really makes it amazing.\n-Finding recipes to do your alchemy goodness is quite fun. Makes it more worthwhile to use them on enemies.\n-I say the same for finding diagrams to have blacksmiths craft you armors and weapons. Even more fun when you find decent diagrams from hidden treasures.\n-Bestiary is fun to read, and you learn what are the best options against the monsters!\n-Free DLCs, patches, the lather. It's very nice to have a game generously supported that way.\n-Upcoming mods to make your experience even better if you like!\n\nThere's plenty of pros for sure, but it's hard to really write it all down. Now for the...\n\nCons:\n\nMoving around can be a little wonky. It might be frustrating when you're trying to loot a box, not light up candles. You'll get a hang of it, but it will be inevitable when it comes across to that. You can say the same to your buddy horse, Roach. Gosh Roach, stop halting on hills! There's other cons I could list, but nothing really comes up in mind other than the common frustrations.\n\n\nAlso there's other little things I really liked. It's hard to pinpoint the exact reasons, but I can try and list down a few things:\n\n• You can pick up the quests you didn't pick up at all in the first place, then get to the bottom of it with the quest you are about to do. I liked that.\n• You can check on people again for what you did for them or what you've done. It feels immersive.\n• Geralt makes notes of certain things that is prompting you to check something out.\n• The expressions used on the faces really helps feel so natural!\n• There are geese you can hang out with. Honk!\n• Geralt's still witty as heck.\n\nAnd many more!\n\nIf you're a big fan of RPG, and don't mind the Grimm-tastic world where monsters and humans clash and wars churning all around. I'd say, go for this game! Support CD Projekt Red!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/292030/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Witcher 3 is pretty cool I guess.\n\nOkay, I'm not going to lie. I eat Witcher games the same way fat kids eat cake. I picked up the first game on a whim back in 2008 when George W Bush was still president and there was hope for my career in bio engineering. Since then I was hooked on the series because I'm easily impressed and bright lights excite me. So you should probably take everything I say with a grain of salt because I'm about to sploosh all up in your insides with praise.\n\nThe Witcher 3 takes place a few months after the end of Witcher 2 when everything went to hell and Geralt finally figured out how to grow hair on his face. You play as Geralt, a mutant monster slayer and recipient for the “player of the year award” 50 years running. It helps if you're immune to the clap I guess. This time Geralt is off on an adventure looking for his lost loved ones while at the same time trying to outrun the Wild Hunt, a group of phantasmal riders that would probably play electric guitars atop their ghost steeds if they could. They're like a moving heavy metal album cover, it's really cool.\n\nWith all this in mind, our Witcher friend embarks on a grand journey across the north to make things right and put things in order. And what a journey it is, the amount of ♥♥♥♥ you have to do is almost over whelming at times. It's like finding a dumpster behind Gamestop after dump day, just a plethora of Assassin's Creed standees.\n\nAlthough the combat isn't that revolutionary, it does it's best to separate itself from RPG's with more static and clunky fighting. Geralt has a number of ways to do damage and avoid damage with such valuable tools as: Hit with sword, hit with other sword, hit with fists, throw things at them, throw magic things at them, jump out of the way, jump out of the way further, and, my personal favorite, run away.\n\nWhat this does is add a little bit of pisazzle to your encounters, keep you on your toes. It's a system that works to the point that if you get good enough at it you can go mano a mano with some pretty beefy foes. Like that one dwarf that just so happens to have worked out enough to be physically stronger than a mutant monster slayer...Or the very large security guard that keeps me from going into Victoria Secret.\n\nBut this leads to one of my very few complaints about the Witcher 3. While you're out trotting around on your trusty horse, you'll sometimes accidentally wander into an encounter you may not be ready for. It's nice that the game doesn't hold your hand and trusts you to be able to make your own decisions and strategies, but sometimes I would like to not get too close to a ghoul that looks like any other ghoul but this ghoul has been doing cross fit so he punched my skull out the back of my head and stole my girlfriend.\n\nBut you can't really get mad at the game, even while you're picking your teeth and dignity up from the ground. Witcher 3 has some really neat looking scenery, pretty enough to make more than a few machines wheeze under the pressure. For me, framerate is a constant hassle, but that may only be because my machine is made out of several toasters and a hamster on a spinning wheel. I don't know how magical graphic technobabble works, I'm not a wizard.\n\nBut should you play 'The Witcher III: Moderate search'?\n\nLike I said, I'm not the best person to ask about this on accounts that I would let Geralt ravish me if I were a beautiful homeless woman and not just a hairy homeless man. The graphics are spiffy, the combat is fun, the story is engaging and the voice acting is top notch. It feels like what an RPG should, an adventure, a journey to discover new lands, people, and danger. I found myself lost in the Northern Kingdoms, gulping down strange liquids and stabbing dirty people in the face. So just like my every day life but with fancier names and titles.\n\nWitcher III: The frustrating survey gets a Dirk Dickbutt golden seal of approval. Well, I don't actually HAVE gold, so I'm just going to use this old Burger King wrapper instead. Hurray!\n\nCamel milk doesn't curdle.\n\n\n\nThe talky-dome: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","May 31, 2015","true","104.7"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","88","57","65","46","1"

Nigh is the time of madness and disdain.”\n\nMy favourite nymphomaniac mutant with kleptomaniac tendencies and an alcohol problem is finally back. Just like the previous games in the series it has plenty of adult content. Starting with strong language, over racism up to obscene moments. Sometimes it results in something rather hilarious.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the game is a sinister one, depicting the flaws of people, when they are confronted with crises and war. The already very detailed world of Witcher 2 has been further developed into an open world experience with a remarkable love for detail. The campaign offers several gigantic areas with an impressive amount of missions and monster contracts. Each of these quests have their unique stories and situations.\n\nThe huge variety of interesting and memorable characters create a vivid world packed with mysteries and intrigues, and provide the path for an epic and compelling storyline. Depending on your choices you make during your adventure, you influence other characters and their development. Some of your decisions have major ramifications for the future of the franchise. Furthermore, certain characters from the previous instalments are reintroduced.\n\nWhile the general combat has been simplified, the variety of potions and buffs has been increased. It makes the pre-battle preparation more interesting, especially on the highest difficulty level when facing several enemies. The specific attack patterns and weaknesses of each enemy type can be seen as another advantage of the multi-layered combat.\n\nDespite more than 70 different skills, you can only active 12 of them at the same time. This limitation leads to a rather restricted skill selection and character development, forcing you to concentrate on one of the four skill tree branches. Witcher 2 introduced a better thought out skill system, where you can evolve in all three skill tree branches, and profit from a balanced build.\n\nOverall, the world of Witcher 3 represents the current reference for immersive gameplay based on an open world concept. Your journey in this vivid and mature world, as the legendary Geralt of Rivia, offers countless hours of exploration and character development. Nevertheless, it remains questionable why certain features, like the combat system and skill tree from Witcher 2, have not been implemented and further honed in the successor.\n\nAmusing quotes:\n\n“The world seems to be black and white to you witchers, but it is shades of grey for us common folk.”\n\n“To the thief who’s nipping goods outha my pantry as soon as put them there! That sausage you took last week – I prepared it especially for you – from the bloated carcass of a mare I found in the mud, rotten eggs and a hand full of larvae. I added some highly personal ingredients. I hope you ate your fill.”\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe character Geralt of Rivia is based on several books by the polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.\n\nAchievements:\n\nEstimated time for 100 % completion: +200 hours\n\nSingleplayer achievements: 78\nMultiplayer achievements: none\n\nChronology:\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (PC)\nThird-person action role-playing game\n(Dark Fantasy) – 2015\n\nThe Witcher 2: Assassin of Kings (PC)\nThird-person action role-playing game\n(Dark Fantasy) – 2011\n\nThe Witcher (PC)\nThird-person action role-playing game\n(Dark Fantasy) – 2007","June 9, 2015","true","216.7"," 74 of 92 people (80%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","80","74","92","14","6"

I never played TW1 yet, but I played The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings few years ago and so I was waiting for this last part excitingly with my brother for months last year.\n\nBut I finally managed to finish TW3... after about 10-11 months haha :D, first buying it for PS4 in last May I think and later for Steam. It took me a while because of couple reasons, like too little time, burnout by open world games and MGSV hype. Some might think TW3 is too long as a game and I did too at first. Actually I have often liked more linear and shorter games. But anyway, it's one hell of a amazing game, that you should spend time with and enjoy the story and world, not trying to rush it.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is indeed a damn long game, perhaps the longest I've played from start to finish, and I still haven't played the DLC. Especially if try complete most of the side quests like I did, takes hella lot of time. I admit that I didn't explore every place and skipped some sidequests like gwents, some horse races and some treasure hunts.\nIt sure is worth your time investment to reach the end, will give the feels. Once you spend hours and hours going through the story and you finally reach those certain big moments you've waited for... they will feel emotional. I've heard it has a lot of different endings and the one I got made me shed tears of joy :).\n\nCD Projekt RED managed to elevate open-world and RPG into a whole another level in my opinion. I don't think I've seen so much detail added to side quests either, which alone is one great achievement. They're all done so well and they actually feel interesting. Hunting monsters is great. The way the forests move in wind is incredible, the weather changes too...just beautiful.\n\nThe story, world, characters, combat, voice acting, graphics are all fantastic. And music...that beautiful music is mindblowing. The voice acting is also some of the best I have ever heard, there is such a huge amount of it and makes the characters feel very real. The choice making is great and the outcome of what you chose, might not be always what you wanted in the end.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is definitely one of the best games and RPGs I've ever played. A must have for anyone who desires to experience an epic dark fantasy story.\n10/10","April 13","true","149.4"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","47","53","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnyTroll/recommended/292030/","JohnyTroll","JohnY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnyTroll/","338 products in account","The epic finale to the incredible journey that started 8 years ago is here. After 4 years in development by one of the very few remaining developers who actually care about their customers and fans, this game is a masterpiece and probably the best game ever made.\n\nI'm going to start by saying I'm a huge fan of this franchise, I've read most of the books and played the two previous games so this opinion is coming from a huge fan of the series. If you didn't read the books nor played the previous games the game still makes sense, but in order to truly understand the characters and their motivations, the world around you and how it works you must have played at least Witcher 2, since the story is an immediate follow-up to the events in it. If you did play Witcher 2, you'll be glad to know you can import all your savegames and decisions, some of them having a bigger impact than others.\n\nGRAPHICS:Powered by REDengine 3, Witcher 3 is hands down the best looking RPG ever created on PC, from the perfect lightning to the ambiance and cracking trees during rain, to the snow storms or calm nights, this game is beautiful no matter the settings you play it on, has probably the best lip-sync I have ever seen in a videogame and the best looking character animations and faces you'll see in an RPG. There's no question about it, the war-torn world of the Witcher 3 is beautiful, so much that walking through the battlefields of some of the recent battles makes you feel the sadness and loss that comes with war, loss of loved ones, the graphics are used to send a powerful message to the user, that this is an unforgiving world, full of loss and war, and you're in the middle of it.\n\nAUDIO/SOUNDTRACK:Composed by Marcin Przybylowicz, Mikolai Stroinski and Percival (cool polish band), the soundtrack is the best you'll ever hear in an RPG, it sends strong vibes of eastern european/norse mythology and history and fits the world perfectly. It makes you feel relaxed when you play the in-game card game, Gwent, it makes you cry when something sad happens, it makes you feel like a badass when you're fighting a monster, let's just say you'll be listening to it long after finishing the game, here's a taste of the soundtrack:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQS4o_bYA_M\nGAMEPLAY:Huge improvement over Witcher 2's mechanics and combat, Witcher 3's both combat and UI are refined, polished and simple to use. The combat is simple to understand but hard to master, it's basically a combination of sword combat, dodging or backing off at the right time to avoid attacks, casting magic (Witcher Signs) at the right moment to interrupt or damage specific enemy types, using bombs, potions and oils to improve your damage and crossbow to shoot monsters out of the sky. While the game is fairly easy on the lower difficulties, it becomes brutal on the hardest difficulty, Death March, exploration and side quests becoming the only way to survive during the early stages of the game, the difficulty becoming way more bearable once you go higher up in level (you also need to use potions/oils alot early on in order to survive the contracts).\n\nThis game is NOT easy. You can't rush through the main story, not even on the easiest difficulties, you must explore for better gear, learn how to counter and overcome various enemy types, it rewards exploration and preparation, it's not made to hold you hand, at some point in the story it even tells you to "Investigate all remaining leads" without telling you what to do, alot of things you'll have to figure out on your own, but once you do it will be the most rewarding game you've ever played.\n\nThe UI is a huge improvement over Witcher 2, inventory system is great but it could use some sorting, overall preety good. I've tried both Keyboard and Mouse and an X360 controller but found it way more enjoyable using a controller, it all comes down to personal preference, overall the game is optimized for controller use. Quest tracking is a HUGE improvement over Witcher 2's system, you basically have Main Quests, Side Quests and Contracts, each in its own category with every individual objective trackable on your map. The game now finnaly has fast travel, a much requested feature in Witcher 2, as well as the ability to jump and climb on every possible surface or rock you can find, you can climb preety much every mountain you see, go anywhere if it's physically possible.\n\nSTORY:This is hands down the best part about The Witcher 3 as well as the other games in this franchise, this game's story and universe is HUGE. Spanning 8 books and 3 games, it tells the story of a monster hunter for hire (witchers), Geralt of Rivia, trying to protect the ones around him and in the end save the world from total destruction. It is a mature story, very close to the things you'd see in Game of Thrones and is not afraid to pick on hard subjects such as prostitution, sex, drugs, racism and hate caused by religion. It feels real and the characters in the world are believable.\n\nThe story starts with Geralt on the path to Vizima, looking for his long lost love Yennefer amidst a huge war between the Nilfgaardian Empire and the Northern Kingdoms. After finding her, she tells him his long lost adopted daughter Ciri has returned and together with the help from Emhyr var Emreis, Geralt and Yennefer set out to look for her across multiple continents ravaged by war and famine in an epic journey that will change the face of the world forever. The story spans several continents, from northern islands of Skellige to the war-torn Velen, to the sprawling alleys of Novigrad, the biggest city in the world of the Witcher to the countryside of White Orchard, this game has a huge world, full of interesting side quests and characters, it's full of life and full of interesting stuff to do.\n\nThere's dozens of unique characters, each with its own personality and morals and by the end you'll feel like some of them are part of your family and some your worst enemies. No other game has made me feel empty inside after finishing it because I couldn't talk to the characters anymore. This game made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me love some characters like they were part of my real family. Ciri is hands down the best character in the game, stubborn like Geralt but very loveable, very strong willed and driven by the will to protect her family and friends.\n\nThe war is shown in a brutal and very sad way, an Emperor and a King stuck in a bloody never-ending war that's destroying the land and the economy. On one side, we got the Nilfgaardian Empire, wanting to conquer all the north to extend their borders, ruled by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, voiced by the brilliant Charles Dance (Tywin in Game of Thrones), on the other, we got the brilliant military mastermind King Radovid, once a great king now filled with hate against non-humans (elves, dwarves, witches), trying to unite the north and kill all the non-humans in the process.\n\nThe decisions you make change the world around you, for the better or worse. There is no such thing as good or evil in the world of the Witcher, there is just right or wrong decisions.\n\nPERFORMANCE:I played the game on High Settings at 1080p on an FX 8350 and GTX 760 with 8GB RAM and the lowest it ever dropped was 40 fps with the average being around 50, going as high as 70 in certain areas. The game is really well optimized, it has no stuttering or sudden frame drops, it utilizes 99% of your GPU power and as long as you got a Quad Core CPU or even an i3 you're fine to play, I've even seen GTX 480s from 5 years ago running it on low at over 40fps. Multiple patches have fixed 95% of all known issues, there's no crashes and the XP bug as well as the small fonts have been fixed. This is the most stable PC release in years and the devs have responded to all user messages.\n\nOVERALL: This game is a masterpiece - 10/10","July 19, 2015","true","348.0"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","47","53","3","2"

Easily one of the most ambitious games of any kind ever created, Witcher 3 does not disappoint in its enormous scope and the level of care and detail put into everything. The sheer amount of content in the game is mind blowing, with easily over 100 hours of gameplay in a single playthrough. Amazingly, even with this huge amount of content, almost none of it feels tedious or repetitive. In many open world games sidequests are a burden for completionists, but not in this game. Even the smallest sidequests are substantial and usually turn out to have an interesting story or something unique and worthwhile to see - there are almost no instances where you'll feel as if a quest or mission you did was pointless or a waste of time. The combat and inventory management systems have been vastly improved from Witcher 2, which suffered from some sluggish combat elements and a tedious subpar menu/inventory system. In Witcher 3, combat feels more fluid than ever, your combat abilities and signs can be customized to how you want to play, and the quest and inventory management is some of the best I have ever seen. The alchemy system has seen improvement through potions, oils, and bombs being a one-time craft, and they are then able to be replenished by means of more common ingredients.\n\nThe Witcher universe has always been known for its fantastic storytelling, tough decisions, moral ambiguity, and branching storylines; this game is no exception to that. It masterfully presents some very mature narratives in a dark fantasy setting. Nothing is considered off limits and it doesn't ever shy away from controversial or mature subject matter, and often presents these situations for the player to judge them at their own discretion. You will seldom find the game holding your hand in any way and you'll almost never see it encourage any particular decision you need to make. This has always been one of the best staples in The Witcher, and it inherently makes this very much a thinking man's game. Whether it's taking care of your inventory and gear, managing resources, preparing for tough fight, planning out a trek to the next objective, or working out a puzzle, your wits will most certainly be tested several times over the course of the game.\n\nOverall the story of this game, amount of lore, detailed backstory, and wide cast of characters each with fantastic development, when combined with that of Witcher 2, make this series on par with the likes of Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad in terms of storytelling. This game has set a new paradigm for RPGs to come, and CDPR is most certainly one developer who has not forgotten how to make an amazing game - this is true 10/10 material.","May 31, 2015","true","156.8"," 52 of 62 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","52","62","3","1"

Wielkie dzięki!\nThis game is my favourite game, the game of my entire life!\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍‍Hell, this game is optimized perfectly, especially considering optimization in The Witcher 2. I got Intel Core 2 Duo E6750, GeForce GTS450, 4GB RAM.. according to system requirements my pc can't handle this game whatsoever. However, it works at 20-25 FPS! Frankly speaking, I run this game on minimal settings, but anyway this game looks great even on such settings! When you have a dialog with somebody or just some cut scene, the game looks like you set high settings! Besides, developers do care about players, releasing patches.\n\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍Many players didn't like combat system in The Witcher 2, so devs improved it. Here, in The Witcher 3, fights became more intense and interesting: same signs, two swords, potions and oils and a large amount of movements. At last, there is no stamina while blocking anymore.\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍They finally added horse! Now you can explore the world riding on horse and slicing heads off. That was a good decision, since there is a really huge open world in the game. Of course, if you are tired of riding, you can just use fast travel option.\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍‍Developers paid much attention to details: a lot of various monsters and animals were created. Here the world lives its own life, there is no place where you could not find a creature: wolves hunting deers and lama, homeless dogs, bears, herds of wild horses and, needless to say, monsters, incredible number of kinds of monsters. It is all you can see wherever you are. Some of them you can find even underwater. I did not misspell, Geralt is able to swim now and, moreover, fight underwater creatures using his crossbow.\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍More than likely, you will visit barbers pretty often, because in this game Geralt's beard can grow. Especially if you are a fan of Sapkowski books: according to them, Geralt likes to keep his face shaven.\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍Characters are well made, I would say splendidly. Great appearance of main characters and not only them. Nice voice acting.\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍‍The only thing I do not like so far is an animation for drinking potions and oils usage. In my opinion, they could improve and make it similar to The Witcher 2 (at least taking potions animation).\n\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍Music is one of the main parts of the game. If you played TW1 and TW2, you might know how the music is great there. And composers made a great job again, compositions are as lovely as always!\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍‍All I described above makes atmosphere in the game unique and inimitable. Not really much to convince you to pay for this game. Nevertheless, I highly recommend you give it a try.\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍I would advise to read all the books of the saga written by A. Sapkowski before you play The Witcher games, especially the third one. These books tell the story of Geralt and the Lion Cub of Cintra, Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, his destiny; of politic wars between North (Temeria, Redania, Kaedwen, Aedirn, Rivia, Lyria, etc) and South (The Nilfgaardian empire); of politics and sorcerers, their role in it. You will realize what is going on in this game if you read those books.\n‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍ ‍Локализация вроде и хороша, актеры подобраны отличные, но из-за рассинхронности звуковых дорожек персонажи говорят иногда очень быстро или же очень медленно, что порой раздражает.","May 29, 2015","true","210.6"," 54 of 68 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","54","68","6","3"

CDProjekt Red has legitimately set the bar as developers for what our money is actually worth for content. 16 DLC's for free, right off the back. Patches, and constant stream of information concerning all aspects for your desired knowledge. They have information about releasing video content, and even host a plethora of events for their community. I fell in love with Geralt with Witcher 2, and now I'm back, and want everyone to fall in love like I did.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is unbelievably good. Like, for real. Words alone can't describe the masterpiece they laid before us. It has combat, story, sound, sex, mini-games, an insanely large, and fully explorable map, a believable economy that took me quite some time to understand. And to top it all off, they even created this AMAZING CARD GAME called Gwent. I'm hooked, I've played priests, pirates, Skelligans, even children (Who made me furious with their insults after my pathetic losses.).  This game makes me feel like they took their time, and poured themselves over every meticulous detail. Except for fall damage. I mean, seriously. Please fix that, holy sh!t.\n\nWhen it comes to the complaints about this game, they are few. The fall damage is painful. The main mode of transportation in the game is slightly buggy. Aside from that, the game did crash for me quite a bit- at first. With some help from some online forums, and trial and error, it is a rarity that I drop from 60 FPS on ultra quality.\n\nAll in all, this game deserves more spotlight, more credit, more people playing it and supporting CDProjekt Red. This game has majority of every facet functioning, and polished. It has brought back some hope for the gaming world for me.\n\nSo please, BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.","May 26, 2015","true","87.5"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","38","44","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Barelybeard/recommended/292030/","Barelybeard","BarelyBeard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Barelybeard/","72 products in account","With the main story line taking around 55 hours to complete (without ANY side story) this game takes my breath away as a modern marvel of gaming history. To spare the extended review i would usually give, to get to the point, this game shows imaculent optimization, beautiful story, and extremely deep characters that you end up almost crying over. Ill admit, this game took me a few hours to get in to, as in the beginnning i felt like i was running all over the place, however, despite that,  I became attached to Geralt and Ciri.\n\nVisually the game is stunning, the animations, the character models, they all look so amazing. Along with the beautiful models, the voice acting... the voice acting! it is so good, at times i laughed so hard, and at other times i felt the need to cry. Johnny for example, a little godling you find in novigrad; you first talk to him to find ciri, and he tells you how he took a huge dump right as the sun was rising. Diverse is the word i would say to describe the characters in Witcher 3.\n\nThe game has a lot of content NOT for children and i would advise ONLY 17+ TO PLAY. There are countless sex scenes and intense profanity that may not be suitable for all ages. Although the profanity seems almost more  immersive, as it gives characters their personality at times, there are even times when you would meet a 10 year old and they would be talking about how they saw a woman with huge tata's (they dont neccesarily say it that way). If you are a parent of a child who loves story and adventure, this game is TONS of excitment, however, as a parent, you might want to play over the game yourself to see the content that you would allow your child to see.\n\nThe RPG elements are found greatly in that there is crafting, alchemy, fist fights with random npc's, contant quests (side story as well as main story), hunting contracts, and more. In many games, i find myself skipping all the dialogue and backround, but in Witcher 3, as i collected diarys, informationaly books, and logs, i found myself often reading them  to get more immersed into the world of Witcher 3.\n\nAs a final note, i would recommend this game to anyone over 17 or 18 because of the mature elements involved *some are skippable, like dialogue, but if you reach a sex scene, it is a bit harder* but i recommend it as one of the best story-rich RPG's out there. As a PC player, i rarely find myself spending more than 25 dollars on a game, but this game is 100% worth the price. The story is amazing, the characters are so richly invested in, and the overall experience is mesmerizing. Everyone needs to try this beautiful game, and i hope you take my review with a grain of salt because after all, my taste is different than other people in the community. Have a great day, and HAVE FUN!","May 18","true","71.5"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","33","36","2","0"

But, I can't even add this as a negative because I stopped caring about loot once I got really into the crafting system as that's where your best items are! So, really, dispel with the notion of this being a loot-a-thon almost immediately or else you're only going to disappoint yourself.\n\nCharacter progression is a mixed bag for me, I don't pay too much attention to it as the skills are all pretty much fine out of the gate and they'll get buffed from items and runes anyways. The most you want to do is invest in the alchemy tree, really and pop a few points into your preferred signs.\n\nOtherwise, again, dispel any notions you have about levelling up quickly and getting SICK SKILLS every 20 minutes. You get the brunt of your XP from doing quests and contracts, usually helps if said quests or contracts are a level higher than you or the same level as you because otherwise you get jack for XP, especially if it's for doing things that are under your level. The highest amount of XP I think I've ever gotten for killing a random beastie in the wild was about 33 or so, so yeah... don't waste your time killing monsters without a contract that's your level or better.\n\nThose aren't exactly negatives on my end, I'm just laying them out there as a warning to people thinking of getting into the game with the wrong idea about its systems.\n\nAnyways, just about every quest and contract has an interesting little story to tell so absolutely do them eventually when you've stopped caring about just doing them for money or XP. This is the rare completely handcrafted RPG with no randomly generated quests, so you know every one you take will give you a little adventure!\n\nCombat is visceral and satisfying, possibly gets a bit simplistic after a certain period of getting acclimated with it but that never bothered me because, again, it's just so FUN and SATISFYING... especially when you cleave a beastie in half!\n\nThe world design is phenomenal with so much detail and love put into every nook and cranny, exploration is greatly rewarded...(just not with very good loot usually[there is the very rare exception however that you might find diagrams you need], to hammer that point home), you get rewarded with well written lore and absolutely beautiful sights.\nI love the creature design as well, these are beasts that are animated so well that I'd half expect to see the developers mo-capping actual monsters in any making ofs.\n\nThis is easily the best video game I have ever played and will likely KEEP playing for the forseeable future, it's just so easy to get lost in its world and fall in love with its characters. This game made me a fan of the franchise and developer for life.\n\nHighly HIGHLY recommend it, especially for fans of story telling.\n\nWelp, onto the expansions. See you in another 100 hours probably.","May 10","true","192.4"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","42","51","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/292030/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","This review was too lenghty for Steam! I had to cut some of the points out. to view the full thing, Click Here.\nOverviewThe Witche 3: Wild Hunt is without a doubt one of the most ambitious RPG games ever released, and certainly the best of the series. CD Projekt Red really hit the nail on the head this time. It improves upon almost all aspects that were criticised in the earlier Witcher releases, added tons of content, hundreds of detailed, well made quests, exiting side activities, not to mention much more popular than intended gwent card game. Overall, this game has received over 200 awards in so many areas! Recommending it is a no brainer, but I will tell you in a very exited fan's voice why I think this game is a must have!\n\nThe Pros:Gorgeous - Let's get this out of the way first, the game look amazing. Period. It did suffer a minor downgrade from the E3 presentation, but it still looks amazing (plus there is a mod to enable E3 settings wink wink) I won't spend too many words on this, as isn't that important, but I have to give them credit for such a gorgeous looking game, that is really well optimised too!\n\nHuge Hours of Gameplay - If you take your time to enjoy the story, you will easily require about 100 hours to finish the game. If you want to also explore the map, collect all the diagrams, craft every potion, finish all world events and side quests... well, spare about 200 hours. Oh, you want to play again and make different choices? Okay. 400 hours it is!\n\nBe Your Own Geralt - A.K.A Story choices! The witcher games were very known for their branching storylines and how the world and the characters in it are affected by your choices throughout your adventure, but the scale at which this happenes in Witcher 3 is to me, just mind boggling. Every choice you make, the game is watching you, and remembering. It will alter the story later in the game. You might find yourself thirty hours after you complete a quest in a certain way by some other quest that you did that, and here are the concequences! So choose wisely, and think before you act!\n\nAttention to Details - You know what else matters besides how you complete quests? When you complete them. The order in which you do quests might add dialogue choices or change a bit the way the quest goes. What I will say is this - if some quest seems important, it probably is, and you shouldn't ignore it, or it might turn out bad. But not only the quests are detailed, the world is as well. Characters' homes are actually related to them, and even peasants that chat on the street and give slight details about their lives or whatever, those details are not just dialogue fillers... most of them are actually phisically represented in their surroundings. Everything else is very detailed too! The world is huge and every nook and cranny looks so detailed! Forests are full of foliage, towns are lively, loads of NPCs with homes furnished to every detail.\n\nCharacters and Voices - Oh man, the characters are so.. alive! They all have their personality very contoured, and all of them have different voice actors! Even run of the mill peasants! It took 900 voice actors and two and a half years to record the dialogue of this game! And the effort was very worth it! Also, the 3D models look amazing, and have so much expression it's amazing. Even details like wrinkles that appear around the mouth when talking, blinking, eye movement, the whole lot!\n\nCrafting and Inventory - The systems have been overhauled! Miscellaneous items like alchemy ingredients, crafting components and food are now weigthless! You now have a horse, and you can equip him too! With blinders, saddles, saddlebags (to boost your max carry capacity) and.. Trophies!. When you complete a monster contract, you will take a trophy from him and can hang it from your saddle. They even provide passive bonuses, but not so great, more on that in the cons section. Crafting still works on diagrams, and once you know a diagram, it will never show up again in the world, so if you see one, be sure you don't know it and collect it. Potion wise, they have upgrades, and once crafted, they last forever! (well, they have charges that must be replenished using alcohol while meditating) Blade oils now have much better bonuses and last longer the stronger the oil is. A new feature - decoctions, work like potions but are crafted using monster mutagens and are very toxic but last very long. You can also craft bombs with different effects!\n\nLeveling System - Vast improvement over the Witcher 2 skill tree, you now obtain plenty of skill points, skills are iterative and will perform better with each point spent in them (to a limit) and you can also make combos using skills from a certain category (Melee, Magic, Alchemy) with mutagens found on monsters to boost some nice passive effects. This gives you many options in choosing how you wish to play the game, but the freedom only comes in the late game, when you have points to spend.\n\nMODDABLE!! - Yup, the game features mod support, and you can head over to the Witcher 3 Nexus and modify away. The game is amazing as it is, but if you don't like something, you can change it! With mods! Oh, PC Modding, dear friend!\nThe Cons:Bugs - Not that many, but most are important and may keep you from doing something because you can't complete a bugged quest, or you're afraid it will ruin something, so you will rather wait for a patch. This only applies for VERY few cases, so 99% of the game is fine. Also, rest assured the devs hear us out and are working hard to correct any errors.\n\nTrophy Bonuses - As I've mentioned earlier, moster trophies give a passive bonus when strapped to your horse... buuut they are mostly the same. You have like 25 trophies to choose from, but only 5 effects. Could have been more.\n\nSkills and Builds - Yep, there are a lot of skills, buuuut... you must equip them to have effect... and you are limited to 12 slots that unlock as you level up and that really limits your potential. The system is needed, as being able to have all you have points for would make you too overpowered, but 12 are just too little and you need to sacrifice abilities for mutagen combos and really think your build through.\n\nCrafting Sorting - The thing I hate about crafting diagrams of items is that there is no filtering out the inferior ones. You will soon find yourself being level 26 and have to scroll through all your level 4-17 diagrams to get to your gear. A more powerful filtering system would really be great.\nUseful links!Witcher 3 Map[witcher3map.com] - Powerful, interactive map, excellent to keep track over what you have done. Check it out!\nThe Witcher 3 Nexus[www.nexusmods.com] - For those who want to mod their game!\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone Expansion Review - I have also made a review on the expansion, available here.\nConclusionThank you for reading so far, I hope I was useful and convinced you that this game is worth it. One of the purchases I made with the most confidence. This is now my favorite game of all time, and has my support for Game of The Year!\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

Every quest either main or secondary has a unique story, you will never find yourself doing repetitive missions and losing interest in the game.\n\nThe Good\n-Perfectly crafted storyline.\n-Interesting secondary quests.\n-Amazing graphics and visuals, and also well optimized.\n-Huge open world with lots of content throughout the three diversed enivronments.\n-Simple yet advanced combat system, e.g, potions, oils, bombs, decoctions, etc.\n-Challenging monsters and foes provide a sense of achievement after every victory.\n-Wide range of dialogue options, which lead to many varying endings, your actions have consequences.\n-In depth character development, you will find yourself actually caring for the other characters in-game.\n-Great voice acting, emotions are clearly represented through character expressions.\n-Nice romantic options, plenty of kinky scenes.\n-The core witcher contract mechanic is executed perfectly.\n-Many different character builds to serve your own unique interests.\n-A lot of different armour and weapon sets/combinations.\n-Good alchemy and crafting system.\n-Simple yet addicting side-game, Gwent.\n\nThe Bad\n-Ending may feel incomplete, would of been better if more dialogue options with the other characters were avaliable after the completion of the main quest.\n-At times horse movement can be awkward and you can come to an unexpected halt, especially in horse races.\n-Minor bugs such as getting trapped in some areas whilst sliding downwards, although they are definitely not game-breaking.\n\nIn conclusion, CD Projekt Red deserves all the praise it has gotten for this masterpiece of a game. It is definitely worth paying the full amount for this game. I am currently in my second play-through, a thing I don't normally do for single player games, and am still thoroughly enjoying it, expect many more hours of play-time. I highly recommend this game to any gamer, you will not be disappointed in White Wolf's adventure.\n\n10/10\n-MikaiL","July 4, 2015","true","145.7"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","40","48","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwings9697/recommended/292030/","redwings9697","redwings9697","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwings9697/","188 products in account","This game was one that was hyped big time by many different outlets, as well as being highly anticipated by the gaming community. Did CDPR deliver on all their promises? Well ya, as well as to be expected today in a cut throat, and very difficult gaming industry. See back in 2013 the gaming community was in awe of what they saw with regards to CDPR and their trailers and viewings of Witcher 3. It looked insanely cool, and very realistic. But immediately people started wondering if we were about to see another Watch Dogs enter the market with a graphical failure on release when compared to what they were promising.\nEnter CDPR and Witcher 3 and I for one find they ended up delivering very close and at a realistic level of graphical fidelity when compared to their promises. Sure one has to admit its not perfectly as promised, but one can't ignore the fact that even a modern high end system built out of the best hardware on the market can run this game at the level of graphical fidelity we saw back in 2013. Marketing and PR are part of the gaming industry and we as gamers have the ability to vote for who we like and who we don't with our wallets.\nSo why than did I per-order a game when this old timer never per-orders games? Because I did my research and didn't listen to all the media, marketing, and PR BS. I sought out my own answers, and in turn grew very found of the Gerald I knew and loved in my own special way.\nI sought the truth, and I found a gaming company that was a bit different from the rest of the stagnant industry. Here was a company willing to promise us the world, but not afraid to show the world exactly where they were in development, and how well they were meeting their promises, or in truth missing them. Here was a company that openly talked about development, and even announced delays in order to get things right, or as close to right as possible. Game development is not for the faint of heart, and for CDPR they ran the risk as developer and publisher of their game.\nSo the moral of my story? Do your own digging and reward those that you find meet your expectations, and cut out those publishers and developers that don't plane and simple.\n\nWitcher 3 is rated my myself as a 9.5 out of 10. There are some day one issues, but far less game bugs than most AAA releases I have seen over the last 5 years. Sure the game has graphical randomness with different graphics cards on PC, and we all know darn well it would, every game does, so why are we acting all surprised?\nSure there is information hitting forums concerning GTX 700 series kepler cards having weird behavioral issues with the game.\nSure the game freezes after a while in menus, inventory, or just randomly while playing, and it seems to be due to a driver crash, not the game itself.\nBut how is the game as a whole you ask? Pretty damn good.\n\nI run an MSI Z77-G45 MOBO coupled to an I5 4670K CPU OCed at 4.2Ghz on a Corsair H105 Closed Loop Water Cooler. My Ram is 32GB of Kingson 1600Mhz Hyper X chips, with the game installed and running off a Samsung 840 Pro SSD. I have a MSI GTX 660ti OC Power Edition GPU thats 2GB of VRAM, stock clocked, and air cooled only. All In a Corsair Air 540 case with over 6 case fans all from Noctua running at low RPM speeds for silent operations. This should help for hardware comparisons.\n\nThe game looks amazing even with low settings. I tested at Low, Medium, High, and Ultra and found the sweet spot for me was not really about the settings, but more about which post processing features you turn off or on. For me to get a sweet 30-35FPS at High Graphical settings, I turned off Hair effects, and dropped my shadows to Low, but used HBAO+ Ambient Occlusion instead. It just looks much better this way, but I realize this is mostly my own opinion.\nI run in Boarder-less Windowed Mode as I notice far less freezing this way, and even when it does I can recover to the desktop easier than in Full screen mode.\n\nI fully expect both NVIDIA and CDPR to be working to address both freezing game problems and the crashing graphical driver issues as we speak. Day one releases have rarely ever been smooth, but to be honest, this has been the smoothest one to date for me in the last 5 years with AAA titles. I honestly do not feel like I paid to Beta test Witcher 3 and I like that very much.\n\nGraphically its all mostly subtle differences from medium to high to ultra. If you have 2GB of VRAM on your GPU just stay at high or medium, Ultra makes it much harder to keep FPS stable for really only a subtle difference graphically.\n\nGraphics are very well done for the system requirements by CDPR\nGain a few FPS with the grass and foliage settings by dropping them to medium, it will help and not murder your environmental experience in game. Medium is best to keep grass and tree popping to a level you wont notice, and I have tried to notice it, and can't myself.\n\nSound seems a little weird though. Sound files fire off properly in game, but I have noticed slight sound cutoff as others suddenly rush in to fire off as you move and play. Its small enough to not ruin anything, but the first time I heard a chicken crowing and suddenly stop half way through was a bit weird. Also sound seems quieter than it should be, yet positional sound is perfectly right.\n\nYou will find yourself just sitting at the tavern listening to conversations in the background, and they had purpose and meaning, and change with time spent in game. Makes the entire environment feel alive and real.\n\nCombat feels very Witcher like, and for those not used to how Gerald moves and fights, it can be a bit frustrating. You really have to pay attention even at the easiest setting with regards to who you are fighting, and how many. Button mashing will work at the easiest setting, but you will soon enough find yourself getting cut down. Stop, focus, and use your skills, parry, counter, and roll will make combat more fluid and with practice, it will feel much better, and far superior to anything else.\n\nThe Hunts are the best, hunting down monsters, the big and the small is fun. Skyrim feelings come rushing back but with a whole new flavor and improved mechanics. Exploration is vastly rewarding, and even needed as coin comes hard, and choices in conversations and play styles will find those on the more ruthless end vastly richer, while the more peaceful and helpful will be far more poor.\n\nCrafting takes time to get adjusted to, yet offers robust features, and options. I love being able to chose to sell items, or break them down to materials and even break those materials down into smaller materials is a nice touch.\n\nBut where Witcher wins me over and will do so with most everyone, is how it tells its story through multiple methods, not just the main story. Visually you can see emotions on NPCs and monsters. The first time I saw a werewolf begging for its life was shocking, as I could see the pain, the fear, and the struggle of the human and beast together. People openly show hatred for the Witcher, while ♥♥♥♥♥s know how to entice the men. You visually can see it on their faces, in how they move, and how they act. CDPR did a wonderful job here and it deserves credit big time. Story telling in video games has been mostly dialogue driven with cold or mechanical movements and facial limitations. Witcher 3 breaks beyond this and tells a story outside of the main story, as each and every NPC feels alive and believable.\n\nWitcher 3 is a solid 9.5 out of 10, and a must buy. This hype is real, and well deserved. The release issues are limited, and should be given enough room to correct. Nothing launches perfectly, and after AAA titles recently being nothing but glorified BETA tests, Witcher 3 breaks free and delivers on their promises.","May 19, 2015","true","178.4"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","50","66","2","4"

Also among my Top 5 list of best games I have ever played. One of the best series ever made.\n\nGameplay is better than ever: fluid, responsive, challenging even on Normal (currently playing on "Blood And Broken Bones" which is even more challenging and rewarding), gory as hell (there's a new dismemberment system in the game) and, of course, tons of fun to play. There are times that I really don't mind repeating certain quests (due to failure, etc) because the combat is so much fun. And yes, Geralt can finally jump!\n\nGraphics look fantastic, I don't even need to talk about them, just look at the screenshots I took in-game.\n\nThe Witcher games have always been known by their amazing and epic soundtracks (be it in-game during combat/exploring or even just during cutscenes) and what they've composed and created for this game is nothing short of beautiful and immersive. Some of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in my life.\n\nAnd now, for the Story. Wow. I don't even know where to start because it's just so well made and implemented throughout the game. Even choices that you make during side-quests have impact on the main storyline quests. Everything just ties together. Alot of old friends/characters from the previous game appear here in The Witcher 3, which some of them really took me by surprise. Simply one of the best stories ever made (also thanks to the books prior to the games). I really recommend playing, at least, The Witcher 2 before starting playing The Witcher 3 but there's no need to worry if you've never played any of them. The game introduces you to everything in a really good and functional way.\n\nHonestly, one of the few games that's really perfect to me. I would honestly rate it a 10/10. There's even 16 FREE DLCs.\n\nCongratulations to CD Projekt RED for achieving such a masterpiece of a game. Buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wagems/recommended/292030/","wagems","wade the brain mcclain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wagems/","385 products in account","A massive RPG in scope and lore, Witcher 3 delivers on every level. With scenarios that range from fending off racists who want to burn an elf in her own home, to deciding if the murderous succubus deserves to live and run or fight and die, Witcher 3 brings a variety of quests unlike any other game.\n\nThe game runs wonderously on my mid-range rig (FX-8350, R9 270x) at 50-60fps with medium-high settings (and ♥♥♥♥ing hairworks off). While the graphics have been downgraded from the E3 and VGX trailers, the final product still delivers with beautiful and varied environments and characters.\n\nCombat has also been improved from pervious installments. Changing your tactics as you go from slaying lowly bandits to shooting Wyrens and Forktails out of the sky is incredibly fun. It does take a little getting used to, but nowhere on the levels of Witcher 2.\n\nStorywise is where the game really shines. CDPR has made a world that really feels human, even though many of it's inhabitants aren't. The voice acting is great and though there are a few reused voice actors, it's nowhere on the scale of one of Bethesda's games.\n\nSadly, the game isn't perfect. Just like others in it's genre, it has it's share of gamebreaking bugs and glitches. Many times I had to reload a save because an NPC I was supposed to follow didn't move, or Geralt decided to never swing his sword or cast any signs. My biggest gripe with the game however, is it's conclusion. I won't spoil anything but it's a big "what? who?"\n\nFinishing off, Witcher 3 is an excellent game. My first playthrough took me 103 hours and I didn't even finish all the side quests, witcher contracts, and treasure hunts. Hell, my gwent collection is embarrassing, I don't even have a full monster deck. Though it is ripe with glitches, the good really outshines the bad. Witcher 3 is one of the best open world RPGs ever released.","June 3, 2015","true","142.4"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","31","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/292030/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt continues the novel-to-video-game adaptation of Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher Saga. This latest entry in the series concludes the tale of witcher Geralt of Rivia by following his quest to track down his adopted daughter Ciri. She is being chased by the mysterious and evil "Wild Hunt". While previous Witcher games featured a more linear level structure, The Witcher 3 is the first to introduce a completely open world that is described by the developers as 20 percent larger than The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\n\nGeralt is a Witcher, a spellsword trained and mutated from childhood to become a near-superhuman monster slayer. The game’s prologue finds him in search of the two most important people in his life: his lover, Yennefer, and his adopted daughter, Ciri. For different reasons, both are being pursued by a terrifying supernatural force known as the Wild Hunt. Like a lot of things in life, this game is much more about the journey than the destination. Geralt’s journey sees him make his way through three huge, distinct, and open areas of the Northern Kingdoms and their surrounds. Roman Empire analogue Nilfgaard is on the brink of completing a crushing invasion of them, but begins the game in a temporary stalemate against the last two of these kingdoms, united under the banner of the stern king Radovid V.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt expects and rewards preparation above all else. Anybody who plays it like an Assassin’s Creed title or other action game will find themselves reloading frequently — I should know, because that’s how I initially approached it. Mashing attack might kill a few stray dogs, but that’s about it, as I found out. Side quests are all but mandatory, as enemies do not scale to the player’s level. It’s one among many ways that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt makes you feel like one man in a very large world. That’s one of the things I really appreciated about the game. The tutorial, if enabled, will nudge you once or twice, but afterwards will leave you with plenty of rope with which you are free to hang yourself with. Multiple save files are a must for this reason.\n\nThe game’s soundtrack was generally fairly restrained, but battle seemed to bring out the silly side of it. Each time the chorus of wailing warrior women got started, I felt like Geralt and I had stepped into an episode of Xena: Warrior Princess. In a way, that’s an apt comparison. As Geralt slashes, pirouettes and leaps through skirmishes, I can’t help but think of Xena, beloved in part for its occasionally slapstick choreography.\n\nCombat is both challenging and rewarding. Experimentation is again, encouraged: I found that one of Geralt’s signs, minor spells that Witchers cast, was able to knock men from horses. From there, Geralt was able to execute the grounded fighters without a struggle. I realised that a similar technique could be applied to flying enemies, and cursed myself for having not thought of it earlier. It wasn’t too long ago that I had been fighting a griffin, after all.\n\nSigns, swordplay, bombs, potions and oils are Geralt’s main tools in combat, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s crafting ensures that you’ll be making the majority of them yourselves. Weapons and armor both degrade over time, and require repair in order to function properly. For a small fee, craftsmen can also take materials provided and upgrade Geralt’s current gear or craft entirely new items for him. You’ll find yourself spending a lot of time in the company of blacksmiths, so why not challenge a few to some cards?\n\nThat’s where Gwent, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt’s amazing minigame, comes in. Gwent has its roots in games like Goofspiel, being a simple game to learn but a complex one to master. Supposedly an analogue for how a battle unfolds, Gwent sees players placing numbered cards across three different zones. The first player to have the highest numbers on their side of the board for two rounds wins. It’s not as crucial a part of the game as Triple Triad was for Final Fantasy VIII, but it was compelling enough that I had to force myself away from it, lest this turn into Gwent: A Review.\n\nLoad times are disguised by short recaps of relevant main quests, matched to panning images like the one above. Unless you’re re-loading a save or just opening the game, you won’t actually see them often at all. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt really is an open world. Gone are the days of plotting where to base your Skyrim life to minimize loading transitions: if you see something in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you can usually walk up to or inside of it.\n\nOn the presentation and visual side, The Witcher 3 delivers one of the more engrossing and atmospheric game worlds seen in awhile. From trees waving in the wind to waist-deep swamps, everything about the game's visuals create a world that effortlessly combines real-world beauty with fantasy and medieval themes. The game world is presented in such a way that each territory, and the people that reside in its cities, are unique in their views on the current war, not to mention differences in their clothing and armor. Larger cities feature shady characters walking about streets and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on corners promoting brothels, while a smaller, more controlled city only contains nobles and streets that are well maintained. While there is a fast travel system, it's far more enjoyable and atmospheric to use Geralt's horse Roach, or to sail across rivers and oceans in a boat.\n\nThere’s a whole bunch of blacksmithing and alchemy plans to uncover and put to use as well. The world is chockful of components, particularly on the alchemy side, where the general wilderness seems to hold plants to collect every few 10 yards or so. It can get a bit overwhelming early on, but you’ll quickly learn that it’s not necessary to use or craft every potion or oil in the game, as you slowly mold your alchemy use to something that benefits your particularly playstyle. Crafting armor and weapons is fairly easy to do, but I found plans and competent crafters were a bit hard to come by.\n\nThe side contracts are where the game really shines. Where other open world fantasy games would treat bulletin board quests as a chance to make players gather ten bear butts through text only prompts, these can be just as nuanced as the main story chapters, with interesting twists on straightforward setups forcing the player to make the call as to who the real monster is. Even incidental missions and collectables filling up the map, while appearing too much like Ubisoft at first blush, manage to have something of a narrative seed embedded within. Treasure hunts often have examples of environmental storytelling and letters, and roadside encounters can lead to more complicated missions later on.\n\nStory-wise, The Witcher 3 does an admirable job of giving new players enough information for them to understand the world in which they live, while also providing plenty of bonuses for long-time fans of the series. While some elements of the narrative are left vague for quite a while - what's the deal with the Wild Hunt, exactly? - you'll usually be too busy dealing with the dark, gritty, interesting world around you to worry about the bigger questions.\n\nIt’s hard to not spend all day singing The Witcher 3’s praises, but it really is a special kind of game. One that reminds you of how games can be engrossing experiences, ones you want to share with your friends, filled with moments that make you laugh, cry and sing along to a sweet ballad about the white wolf and the sorceress.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ends Geralt’s tale in spectacular fashion, finding ways to fill a giant world with thrilling combat, beautiful sights, and a bevy of compelling content. A strong conclusion to The Witcher trilogy, and a masterpiece that will keep you enthralled for weeks and months to come.","June 4","true","143.5"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

I work from 4 in the morning to, most times, almost 11 at night. (0400-2300) I get weekends, which is mostly devoted to getting off post or practicing for TF2 competitive.\n\nAnd this game has officaily become my timesink. As I said, I play competitive TF2, and that requires a lot of practice. I haven't touched TF2 since this game came out, however, and if this game doesn't slow down significantly, I doubt I will not touch it for a good month or so.\n\nThis game is fantastic and fun and good looking and...

Then when you confronted the Priest about it took a bribe to never speak of it again?\n\nIt's worth the money, but seriously. Expect a challenge. DO NOT expect the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dark Souls version of a challenge, where you get stunlocked after a single swipe and then get instant killed the next.\n\nExpect the challenge where you sit there and find a werewolf in the middle of the woods, 5-10 levels higher then you, or a level 13 Alghoul when you were wandering around at level 2 and all you can say is "I'm going to kill that thing even if it kills me!"\n\n2 hours later you stand there victorious after finding the perfect time to roll away, the right sign to use when, and when to use heavy attacks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raccoonrinallday/recommended/292030/","raccoonrinallday","Raccoon Rin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raccoonrinallday/","500 products in account","Without a doubt the best RPG I've ever played. The open-world atmosphere is unparalleled, all of the characters are interesting and have their own stories to tell, missable side-quests could very well be part of the main campaign, the addictive "Gwent" card game should be its own standalone game, and the systems it implores are plenty and very deep.\n\nI rarely ever go off the beaten path in open-world games, but I found myself completely ignoring the main quest because the side activities felt so meaningful. The world CDPR created is downright gorgeous, and you can tell they hand-crafted a vast majority it, as it truly feels like an interconnected world. Despite talks of a downgrade, the game is a stunner. I often find myself stopping to just admire the surroundings. The world itself doesn't revolve around you, and will continue to move on without your direct intervention. There's a lot more going on than what you see and experience. You'll see trees swaying, the weather constantly changing, animals and monsters milling around, and caves and hidden areas filled with treasure, and all of them combine to create a very convincing world. Also, the facial animations are top-notch, and make the characters feel alive. Never have I seen such a wide variety of expressed emotions in a video game characters before. It's astounding.\n\nLike the Witcher 1 and 2, what makes this game stand out is its lack of black and white decisions. No matter what you choose, your decisions will have consequence whether that be a positive or negative, and this is what makes the world feel so compelling. The completion of side-quests linger after you play, and some are even connected to the main plot. The side-quests don't feel like throwaway quests, and the characters you encounter are all intriguing.\n\nCombat is actually very enjoyable despite what others have said, and truly shines when you master the mechanics. You have a variety of tools at your disposal: parrying, dodging, signs, bombs, potions, crossbows, and of course Geralt's Silver and Steel swords. Like in Dark Souls, enemies have predictable movesets, so dodging out of their way comes down to proper timing. However, I found myself fighting with the camera especially in larger groups, and Geralt's animation can be a bit unpredictable, but it's fun being able to look in your bestiary to find out what the monster is weak to and to prepare accordingly.\n\nGwent is also the best mini-game ever. It's a card-collecting game where you'll challenge NPCs. Its mechanics are simple to understand, but here's a lot there to master as well.\n\nPerformance is also a hit-or-miss. I found several areas where the FPS dropped significantly and parts where stuttering grew to be a minor issue. However, none of them proved to tarnish the overall experience, and I'm sure will be fixed with future drivers and game patches. You won't be encountering load screens as often, and even when you do, they're short.\n\nAll in all, one of the best games I've ever played and the best RPG I've had a chance to try. At first, it may feel overwhelming to be introduced to so many different systems at once, but when you get the hang of it, it all gels together. It's a very long game, and you'll without a doubt need to set aside time to finish this quest.","May 22, 2015","true","146.6"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","0"

CDPR really shows you make a fantastic\ngame with their continuation of the book series by the Polish Andrzej Sapkowski, featuring Geralt of Rivia, a witcher on the jorney to find his adopted daughter Ciri, who is part of a old prophecy of the worlds end.\n\nNo game is absolutely perfect, but The Wild Hunt comes close! You will find hours upon hours of content in this Story rich, Open world, roleplaying game as you come across all kinds of unique towns, cities, people and monsters on your jorney. The scenery is amazing and the graphics are great. An absolutely 10/10 game, if not 9/10 due to minor gameplay irks.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Very well crafted story and choises.\n+ Well written and performed characters, especially in the Family Matters questline.\n+ Immersive, big world full of things to do.\n+ Best sidequests ive seen in a game. Each has its own story and own cutscenes.\n+ Great sound design! Forests and towns feel so alive with the trees and leaves making sounds in the wind and towns full of chatter and people during the day.\n+ OST is fantastic.\n+ Gameplay feels overall smooth\n+ I have a hard time thinking of bad things to say in this review\n\nCONS:\n\n- Gameplay can get quite unbalanced late into the game. Your character can get overleveled and enemies become quite easy tasks to handle, even on the highest difficulty. (New expansion seemed to change this a little)\n- Has various bugs, but not too many. Expected from a game big as this.\n- Some story aspects releate to the older games and even the books so they might be hard to get for newcomers.\n- Packs of wolves are the most dangerous enemy. No joke. (Atleast on the highest difficulty)\n- No cutscene pausing\n- Bosses weren't that unique but still fine\n\nI loved almost every second i played, so far i've finished the game 2 times, and finishing up everything including treasure hunts, side quests and other activities such as horse races and fist fights, gave me a good 100-140 hours in one playthrough of the game. W3 has plenty of free DLC content, which include armor packs, new Witcher Contracts and quests among other things. The game also contains a season pass for the 2 expansions that are coming out for it, Hearts of Stone (Out now!) and Blood and Wine, which both will most likely contain 30-40 hours of new content combined.\n\nEXPANSIONS (Will extend here once they're out]\n\nHEARTS OF STONE\n\nHearts of Stone, the first expansion for W3 is now out and i've ploughed through the monster with 10-20 hours of playtime. The first expansion already set expectations for the next one high as it almost or did top the main story with it's eerie and mysterious tale of Gaunter O' Dimm, the Man of Glass and Olgierd Von Everrich, the immortal nobelman who signed a pact with Master Mirror.\n\nGeralt gets tangled up in these twos mess of a contract as he gets captured by foreign soldiers and gets saved by O' Dimm, but having to return the favour later, by helping O' Dimm finalize his and Olgierds pact. Many advetures ensue from raising the dead to party to robbing banks and haunted mansions. A very mysterious and eerie expansion, with its funny and great moments. New gear, gwent cards, ares and story with a soundtrack to make chills run down your spine.\n\nPROS\n\n+ Brand new story, which in my opinion topped the original. Very dark and eerie\n+ New areas and new loot\n+ Fantastic characters\n+ Music made the expansion for me.\n+ Bossfights were way more unique than in the base game.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Barely any useful new skills\n- New echantment service costs way too much\n- Wish it was longer, i enjoyed it a lot.\n\nBlood and Wine yet to come in early 2016!","October 15, 2015","true","260.8"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","2"

There is a vast world to discover and thats what fascinates me. Many games just leave you if you go off the track and you end up in a borderland until you are pushed back by map boundaries (or fall into a black hole LOL) but not Witcher 3! even if you sail to a remote island in like 10 min. you will find i.e. pirates on a beach with loot or a hidden smuggler cargo on the ocean.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/recommended/292030/","yamalight","yamalight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yamalight/","1769 products in account","Witcher 3 is a brilliant continuation of a Witcher gaming series.\nIt's an action RPG at its best - with huge open(-ish) world, beautiful graphics, solid combat and incredible quests and characters.\nAnd you need to know that I'm extremely biased here - I loved both previous games. And books, all of them.\n\nAt the moment of writing this review, I'd played around 40 hours of the game. And it feels like I'd barely scratched the surface.\nIt's really easy to get distracted in the world of Witcher. There's plenty of small things like hidden treasures here and there, but that typical open world stuff while very well crafted is not what makes the game so entrancing.\nIt's the fact that all the quests (including monster contracts) are so well crafted that you want to finish all of them.\nMost of the quests will require you to investigate things surrounding your target. You might decide to stop at some point, but it's usually a good idea to go 'till the end.\nYou might learn some useful details about the monster you'll fight, or about the character who you're gonna be interacting with in the end.\nBoth of those are equally important. In case of the monster - it'll allow you to properly prepare, because it's quite hard to win without proper preparations in Witcher (well, unless you are playing on normal difficulty which is quite.. well, normal).\nIn case of the character - that's probably my favourite part - you'll have to complete the quest. And all of your actions will have consequences. And I'm not exaggerating here - one wrong move and you'll wipe the whole village, but save kids. But would you prefer it otherwise?\nThat's what is awesome about Witcher 3.\n\nAnd then there's a pretty solid game engine - not without issues, but solid enough - with some pretty awesome graphics on top. Probably most impressive stuff I'd seen to date (not everywhere, but in lots of places).\nAnd then there's combat - it's much more arcadey than in Witcher 1 or 2, but still has weight to it. And still requires preparations and planning. And you can still die pretty quickly if you are not careful enough.\nWhat's even cooler is the way you develop your character - you can invest skillpoints into several talent trees (melee, signs, alchemy, generic stuff), but then you need to activate those talents. You can do that by inserting them into talent slots - there's 12 of them and they unlock as you level up. There are no lock-ins, so you can change your build pretty much on-the-fly, which makes it pretty easy to experiment with different things. I love this system a lot.\nAs some icing on the cake, the game this time around has tons of awesome loot along with a nice and simple crafting system, which has a lot of stuff to craft.\n\nIt's not without problems, of course. Since it's an open(-ish) world game with lots of places and things going on, you'll notice some glitches here and there.\nMost of them are not a problem at all and usually just amusing.\nThere are a couple of small issues with UI (lighting candles instead of looting chests, argh!) which can be fixed with manual editing of config files.\nAnd there are some issues with AI - be it enemies who cannot properly find a path to you over a boulder, or your horse that stops before every frigging bridge or small bump.\nBut once again, those are not critical and most likely will be ironed out pretty quick.\n\nWitcher 3 is a fantastic game if you are into RPGs.\nThat the best game in the series, if you ask me.\nAnd the game of the year in my book.\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttps://youtu.be/bQ458St1vpc\n","May 27, 2015","true","76.3"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","24","28","6","0"

You get to plan ahead and think like a Witcher, you get to use your Witcher senses and complete Witcher contracts where you're hired to slay a monster, allowing you to be on your path as well as continue the story quests.\n\nThis game is the RPG this industry deserves.

I still have around 20 quests in my journal. Granted mostly involving Gwent(the collectable trading card game). However there are still a number of contracts left unfulfilled. As well as points of interest unexplored scattered about the map.\n\nAt some point in the story I came to the conclusion that most of the game was almost entirely scripted into one general narrative. I was wrong. The choices you make are so subtle and dynamic that the story completely and entirely changes the world. This was eluded to by speaking with people at similar points in the narrative who had COMPLETELY different outcomes for specific events. Additionally, its not like Witcher 2 where there were say around 4 or 5 decisions that would turn the tide.  Witcher 3 has more like 50 that are interwoven to a degree that upon completing the game and reading a guide I still do not know all the outcomes nor how to achieve them.\n\nNow, this game had a little rough patch at launch. People complaining about character movement speed. A sort of dead zone of zero reaction to immediate sprinting. Character interaction where Geralt would find putting out candles more interesting than opening a chest full of hot loot. I didn't find those issues that much of an annoyance. However, riding Roach (the horse) became at least for me, a sort of nightmare. Roach had trouble starting into a sprint and even more trouble going near things that were not flat ground. Dead stop running next to rocks. Yeah, next to rocks. I soon gave up on trying to get what I'd call medium distances on horseback. I'd use the cantor as the the slower speed allowed for more control. Especially because even though Roach does not lose stamina on roads, he'd also run almost every time when approaching a fork the wrong way and then dead stop next to a rock. But I digress. Those issues are not that big of a deal.\n\nThe only other glitches I've saw were that of which you'd expect to see in any other open world game.\n\nReading this back to myself, it seems mildly negative. It is not my intention. I just felt those issues needed to be addressed.\n\nAs far as barrier of entry, this is by far the easiest to get into of the Witcher series. Potions can be crafted at any time and drank during battle. Which is a huge departure from previous iterations. Which, in my opinion is nice but it also takes away from the difficulty. Looking back I wish I had played on a higher difficulty. I went with Normal(Story and Sword) as my previous experience with the series suggested to my feeble mind. Additionally, using alcohest or a strong alcohol to remake every single potion and bomb seemed so trivial. Previously each potion required all ingredients and when it was gone, it was gone. But again, Making it easier usually brings more people in and from a business aspect I completely understand. So it goes.\n\nOverall, the way the narrative progression feels so organic that it seems scripted as if you had no choice begin with even though you actually have all the choice. Combined with the dozens of hours of side quests that feel like almost entirely separate plot threads. Rather enjoyable combat that doesn't get tired until well past your interest in the story has subsided. With at times needing to actually read the Bestiary in order to gain the upper hand on a contract. With great voice acting that makes you actually want to listen to the NPC's rather than skip all the dialogue and just ask where the next waypoint is; Makes for such a complete package that it makes me feel emotionally attached. Easily one of the best games I've ever played.","June 18, 2015","true","230.9"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/galf506/recommended/292030/","galf506","Ｇａｌｆ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/galf506/","175 products in account","I did a Witcher marathon, played the first two games again, now I'm 155 hours into The Witcher 3 at death march difficulty, finished the main quest, Some side stuff left to do but decided to not do it for now (I feel dirty playing now that the ending has closed the ties of the story), will probably replay after reading the books.\nSo, I'll try to keep it short, because there is way too much stuff that I could say about this game.\n\nFirst off, this game redefines the genre. Like really. Last time I had such a blast it was with TES : Morrowind, which at the time was too a "redefining" game, we've been stuck at "Morrowind" stage for a bit more than a decade, hopefully the other developers follow suit and TW3 will be the new standard. (I'm especially deluded with Bethesda, so I hope THEY see their errors, finally)\nThe amount of detail put into everything is groundbreaking, I refused to use fast travel for the first 120 hours of game because literally every time I walked somewhere I discovered new content. Quests aren't "go fetch 5 pelts", even the stupidest side encounter leaves you with some good content to explore.\n\nTechnically, it's not as good as they were advertising last year, but still there's nothing close to this. You'll travel without loading screens everywhere (except region changes), you do not realize how game changing it is to get into dungeons and buildings without loading screens until you experience it. I've been playing this maxed with hairworks @1920x1200 with some tweaks on my rig (i7 4790, GTX 970 G1, 16gb ram) and it's really scalable if you want it to run on lower end machines.\n\nGameplay is great but falls a bit short on expectations by the later stages. It's nothing bad though, just a rebalancing of the signs and skilltrees - the igni sign is just totally bonkers OP and the swords skillset is lackluster, with too many useless skills. The fighting itself is very fun *at high difficulties* - I hope they add another difficulty after Death March though!\nI've never got a game breaking bug and I've been playing since D1, I put 55 hours into the game in less than a week from release and all that I had to fix was closing MSI Afterburner and Nvidia Shadowplay because they made my game crash randomly.\n\nSo, a little list of the serious cons I found during my gameplay:\n- there are two or three dialogue choices later in the game that are badly written. Sadly, they're quite important. They're mostly related to the Djikstra quest lines.\n\n- rewards of sidequests are silly and useless way too often. I returned a precious sword after traveling across the world and my reward was, "after adding some more coin" according to the guy, 20 crowns. A bottle of water can cost 16 crowns. This repeats itself way too often, also the haggling mechanic is borderline useless when 9 times out of 10 you can haggle only for 5 crowns. Boggles my mind why CDPR thought it was fine - I enjoy questlines, but I also enjoy realistic rewards. This would literally be a 5 second fix, too.\n\n- as I said, skill development needs a rework. Right now going for the "signs" skillset turns the game into easy mode.\n\n- An important character becomes silent, or rather single response (I call it "Garrus Syndrome" after the endless "calibrating" in ME2.), for the latter half of the game. Which in my case it was 30 hours give or take. She takes important roles during this period and it'd be nice to ask her input on how things are going, or maybe one more quest with her. CDPR is already working on this, though.\n\n- inventory could use a weight filter... but they're working on it, patch 1.07 will fix a load of little stuff like this.\n\n- THE WATER LOOKS LIKE ♥♥♥. Seriously terrible compared to everything else! If this game had GTA V's water it'd look 9000 times better.\n\nAaand that's it. If I had to give it a score, it'd be a 10/10 even with the little blemishes and the graphics downgrade, because it went in a territory no one dared to step before, came out graciously with a relatively bug free release, and CDPR is taking great care to fix all issues in the days post release. You're not just playing, you're experiencing a story... I can't put into words how many emotions TW3 will bring out of you - PLAY IT.\n\n","July 11, 2015","true","174.3"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thor1138/recommended/292030/","Thor1138","Þórr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thor1138/","1594 products in account","First of all, let me say that I'm a huge fan of the franchise, started playing when the Witcher 1 Enhanced Edition was released, since then I've read all the books twice and replayed Witcher 1+2 several times each. Witcher 3 is the epic conclusion to Geralt's story (but hopefully not the franchise).\n\nThe graphics are simply stunning. Yes, the game doesn't look like some of the early trailers, BUT all the gameplay trailers CDPR released up to half a year prior to release accurately depicted the final product, and anybody expecting any game to look like 2-year-old trailers is at least very naive. So this is not the "bait & switch" or anything some people made it out to be, you knew exactly what you were getting prior to release and the final product looks AMAZING. I can confidently say this is the most beautiful game I've played so far. The game had me literally go "wow" in some places (Kaer Morhen for example), some of the textures like leather on some armour, fur etc look photorealistic almost, the weather effects are amazing too. This is the first game where I literally enjoyed just riding and exploring the landscape, watching a storm move the trees or the sun go down. Yes, there's also some textures that aren't so amazing, but don't forget this is an open-world game and the overall graphics are the best we ever got to see in a video game so far.\n\nThe soundtrack is the most beautiful I have ever heard in my almost 20 years of playing video games. It will be hard to have sword-fights in future RPGs without missing the intense Slavic singing. The "main theme" is also grandiose and gave me pure chills when I launched the game for the first time.\n\nThe combat is decent. Nothing special, but also very servicable and most importantly FUN. You have your standard fast and heavy attacks, dodge, parry/riposte, your Witcher signs and bombs and now also your crossbow, which mostly serves to bring flying enemies back to the ground or apply bleeds to enemies via one of the special bolt types (which is very useful against higher level enemies, since bleeds are percentage-based).\nThe alchemy system was totally changed from Witcher 2. At first I hated it, but after getting used to it, I must admit it led to me actually using potions I almsot never used in previous Witcher games (like Thunderbolt and Blizzard). Instead of crafting each potion every time, you just craft (and upgrade) them once and then they are always replenished when you meditate and have at least one strong alcohol in your inventory. Potion length has been extremely reduced from previous Witcher games, so it takes a while to get used to it. Lore-wise Witcher 2 was most accurate when it came to potions (you could only drinke them before combat and they lasted a long time), gameplay-wise both has it's up- and downsides. In the end, after I got used to it, I actually kinda liked the new alchemy system.\n\nNow to the most important part in a Witcher game, the story:\nWhat can I say, the attention to detail in the adaptation is just amazing. You can tell from the major to the minor details that the writers care A LOT about the source material. Now, the games may not be canon, but that doesn't change the fact that they absolutely feel like it. You meet many characters Geralt already knows from the books, like Dijkstra for example, who still has a bum leg from when Geralt broke his knee in the books. You will also meet many other characters from the books I won't spoil here, but most importantly, we finally get to meet Geralt's true love, Yennefer, after CDPR shoehorned Triss into Geralt's life in Witcher 1+2, and boy is she awesome! I guess, if you've never read the books, you will not fully understand how much they love each other, but armed with having read the books twice, the first meeting with Yennefer in the game sent literal shivers down my spine, perfectly accentuated by the amazing soundtrack, you could feel how Geralt held his breath.\nThe main story, revolving around Geralt's child of destiny - Ciri -, is purely epic, and for me, this is the best writing in a video game so far, especially since the depth the characters have is not limited to the main quest, but actually many of the minor NPCs have more backstory/depth or are just more interesting than even the main characters of most other modern RPGs (and games in general). All the side-quests are handcrafted, you don't have ANY generic fetch-quests (yes, there are fetch-quests, but they're so well hidden inside good and interesting stories that I can't remember a single one as being a "fetch-quest"). The world is beautiful and if you explore you might find an interesting detail or random encounter.\nThe downside is that the open-world controls feel kinda clunky at times, especially when you can't grab onto a ledge you'd think you easily could reach, but which wasn't intended as such by the devs apparently. This can get frustrating at times, but it can be forgiven seeing as this is CDPR's first open-world game. The riding controls usually feel very smooth, unless you even meet the slightest cliff or hole in the road, then your horse will simply just stop (making jumping over those a pain at times), and Roach also can't swim.\n\nI've not had any major crashes, except for display driver crashes which have disappeared after the latest update from NVidia, so I assume that was on their end, not CDPR's. Other than that I have not had any major technical difficulties with the game, apart from NPCs sometimes "popping in" a bit late, but I blame my CPU which doesn't meet minimum requirements. Apart from that I get a good average 60 FPS with everything on Ultra on a GTX 980 with hairworks enabled (and optimized a few days after release).\nThe only really annoying thing are the loading screens, which give you a short summary of the point in the main story you're at at the moment. They take a bit too long, because of that.\n\nAs for game-length, my first play-through took me about 170 hours and I still have some points of interest left on Skellige (one of the major areas). However I took my time and if you rush it you can complete it much faster, but why would you?\n\nOverall, despite it's minor flaws, The Witcher 3 is definitely my favourite RPG to-date, maybe even my favourite game in general. I give it a 10/10, but I highly recommend reading the books and playing Witcher 1+2 before starting it. Especially the books make some of the scenes MUCH more emotional, thanks to knowing how much certain characters mean to each other.","June 30, 2015","true","354.9"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/recommended/292030/","rock1m1","Rock1m1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/","149 products in account","In Witcher games, you play as a Geralt – a famous (or infamous to a lot) member of the chemically and magically transformed orphans turned monster hunters, called the Witcher. Unlike most games, the game does not hide the fact that your protagonist Geralt is not a hero – nor does he particularly want to be – or a villain, he is much more complex for being labelled as much. It is very common for ordinary folk to label him as a freak, or even a monster, but if he needs a label as the society constantly pushes for, he prefers the term -- a Witcher. He is not interested in politics or choosing sides in the ongoing war, he is only interested in solving the ‘monster problems’ and getting some coins in return. That is the way of life of a Witcher, and Geralt proving time and time again to be the person to call when you want a dreaded beast to be taken care off.\n\nLeading up to the release, Witcher 3 would very often get compared to the Skyrim, and why not? The Elder Scrolls game is considered as the industry benchmark for doing sandbox RPG – the direction where Witcher 3 was seemingly headed. Both games were fantasy RPGs, with a huge world to explore filled with quests and mysterious begging to be discovered. Once the game got released however, the discussion took a turn and instead focused on the stark contrast between the two games. At that point, trying to draw further similarities with Skyrim quickly ends dead in the water though. Where Skyrim puts fantasy and sandbox gameplay at the forefront, Witcher 3 pushes it to backdrop. Instead, it uses it as a setting to explore mature themes which appear not so different to the time we live in. As you work your way to slaying the monsters, the revelations leading to it often paints a darker scenery. Forcing Geralt – hence the player – to ponder: who is the real monster here, the beast or the man?\n\nPlayers are given full reign over the decisions Geralt faces throughout his adventure. They come in all shapes and forms. What is even more impressive, the effects of these decision are very unpredictable, and can be felt right away or…after several hours. This provides an illusion over the decisions, as the player cannot tell whether the decision will have an impact or not, keeping players from making rash decisions and altering the game world in interesting ways. A lot of games highlight decisions as a major gameplay element, but they never tend to be as far-fetching in their implementation like they are in Witcher 3.\n\nSide quests in RPGs provide a great opportunity for developers to explore the game world and provide varied gameplay and story opportunities. But more often than that, the novel idea is pushed aside for the foundation of extending gameplay time and stamp it out for a marketing bullet point. Witcher 3 sets the benchmark for side quests. They are like self-contained stories. Other games could easily package it as small sized DLCs and charge them 5$ for each. I love how the game blurs the line between main quests and the secondary quests. Even the random events have more story in them than most other games do in their Secondary quests. Where many RPGs roundup the secondary quests as means of just extending gameplay time --  often through monotonous means, Witcher 3 takes the high road and uses this opportunity to further flesh out the world and it’s lore.\n\nThe game caters to a lot of different types of players with varying skill levels. Combat in Witcher 3 can be as easy as hack and slash to careful balancing act of preparation, attack, defense and improvisation; depends on which difficulty you play in. If you are seeking for challenging combat, I really can’t recommend enough for players to start from a higher difficulty -- like Death’s March – to have a reason to use the full range of the combat system the game has to offer. Otherwise hacking and slashing your way from the start to finish works with no problem, making the combat system very one dimensional and empty.\n\nSo what do I actually mean when I say the ‘full range of combat system’? Well, unlike most games, the actual combat is just one cog in the wheel to defeat a monster. Going into a fight with little to no clue about the monster you are dealing with is a straight up suicide. Lucky for Geralt he is a professional, he would prefer to go through a series of steps before coming across the monster itself. This is yet another one of the areas where the game sets itself apart from the rest. Unlike most games out there, simply stabbing the monster several times with your blade will lead you to an ominous fate (you think the villagers haven’t tried that?). Many of these monsters have very specific weakness: some are bounded by a curse and can be only lifted by doing a specific ritual; others have specific weakness which Geralt can decipher by interrogating the villagers as well as investigating the crime scene. Once you have all the information you need, you are better equipped in dealing with these abominations. Most of these quests are under the ‘monster contracts’ and are scattered across every settlement. They are quite short but manage to contain all the elements which make Witcher 3 great -- in a small package-- perfect if you don’t have much time in your hands.\n\nWhen CD Projekt released the original Witcher, it was a solid effort but nothing quite stood out for it survive the test of time. With Witcher 2 the studio had a much clearer picture of what their game was and it showed; the game had the exterior of a fantasy game, but deep down it was much more than that. It was praised among the critics and created a strong fan base for the developer. Unfortunately game was still not much accessible to the majority of the gamers due to some design choices and balance issues. With the third and final entry—where Geralt’s story is concerned—the studio in Poland have finally come of age. They essentially took essence of Witcher 2 and expanded in every direction imaginable, raising the game to the pedestal of excellence. The game rewarded returning fans by providing them with the deep engrossing gameplay they know all too well and love. At the same time, CD Projekt listened to feedback and improved the core interface and fixed the nuances of the past games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meat_bug/recommended/292030/","meat_bug","Meatbug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meat_bug/","541 products in account","Easily one of the best RPGs ever made.\n\nGeralt of Rivia's journey has been one with many great adventures - the civil war of the Scoia'tael against the Order of the flaming Rose, the impending threat of the Wild Hunt, the hunt for the Kingslayer - and it's now coming to a closure, as the Wild Hunt returns, seeking out the child from an old elven prophecy.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt continues the story of the previous parts, so my recommendation would be, to not play it without any knowledge about them.\n\nLooking back to the first part of the Witcher, a lot has changed since then, most prominently of course, the graphics and now with part 3 a huge open world to explore by foot or on the back of your horse "Roach".\nThe combat system also got a slight upgrade compared to the second part and plays out smoother and more direct in my opinion.\nThey've swapped the mini-game from part 2 with a card game called "Gwent". If you get the hang out of it and like card games, this one can be pretty addictive. I loved it :)\n\nNow, why do i think it's one of the best RPGs out there? Well, i guess it's the sum of everything.\nThe soundtrack is beautiful and underlines the atmosphere perfectly.\nGraphical wise it's a blast and more than once i just stopped and admired the view.\nThe story itself is captivating, with a lot of interesting sidequests as well.\nIt has lots of interesting and lovable characters and i experienced the whole range of emotions throughout the game, from shock and sadness to bursting out in laughter.\n\nI had the feeling that all the love, passion and commitment really showed and was transferred into the game and onto the screen.\nI know, this is not the most objective thing to say, but that's how it felt :)\n\nAnyway, i think the game and also CD Projekt RED deserves the praise, as they created a great series, with an awesome third installment.\nThe 2 big Add-Ons (i won't call them DLC, that would be a disgrace) are great as well and especially Blood & Wine is one of the best ones i played, adding another huge area, even more great characters, housing, a new Gwent faction and hours over hours of gameplay value.\n\nOf course, a game of such proportions is never without issues and bugs, but fortunately, i never experienced anything major.\nSure, i had also some glitches and bugs or was stuck on a corner, not able to get onto Roach etc. but none of them couldn't be dealt with by saving and loading or restarting the game, so they were little annoyances and compared to the hours i've spent with the game, nothing of importance.\n\nI also liked how CDPR made fun of the Roach-Bugs :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoL1NRh8JOI\n\nSo, if you like third-person Fantasy RPGs this should be a no-brainer for you ;)\nI would recommend to also play the previous two games, even if the first one might be a little dated. In my opinion they are still more than worth it.","June 6","true","172.0"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","1"

This is the first case.\n\nWitcher 3 is one of the BEST RPG games I've ever played, and trust me that I've played many.\n\nLet's start from the negative side, as you're probably looking for that.\n\nThe only reason for NOT playing the witcher, is PC requirements. I can't play the game with less FPS than ~50. That's why I had to reduce my details to medium level, to get average of 80 FPS, so drops won't affect my gameplay much. And yes, I have latest Nvidia Geforce GTX 970, bought especially for Witcher 3. However, price is totally worth it, game has AWESOME and BIG level of details, I just have a feeling like it could be a little better optimized, so I could play on high in 60 FPS. But that's the only issue I had with this game.\n\nNow onto the good things. EVERYTHING. The game feels like, and is, a masterpiece. Awesome story, awesome character, awesome dialogues, awesome quests, awesome atmosphere. Without a doubt a "MUST PLAY" for EVERY RPG fan, and for everyone who calls himself a true gamer. It's one of the few games totally worth the price, and I'm proud of CD PROJEKT RED, that they've managed to create such awesome game, probably the best or at least one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nJust make sure to buy at least ~770/780 GTX to not get disappointed, unless you don't have problems playing in 30 FPSes. Personally I suggest 970 GTX, best price/performance ratio.\n\nArchi's opinion: 10/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/292030/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3203 products in account","CDProjekt Red's most ambitious game to date...\nThe Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt is the conclusion in the trilogy of the Witcher IP series, and arguably represents CDPR's most ambitious project thus far, taking the lessons learned from the first two games and applying them to the Wild Hunt, creating a large, mostly open world role-playing experience where your choices both large and small will matter. Where morality and consequence will have a telling effect on your experience, and where no single choice is always seen as the "best" choice. Full playthroughs of the game clock in at 50-100 hours, and whilst time constraints mean if I wanted to do such a playthrough -and- review the game right the way through I'd not be able to write anything for a few weeks, what I've elected to do is a OCD clearout of the opening zone, which gives a good feeling of "what is to come", and also gives a good idea of what you can expect from the gameplay and graphics and the like.\n\nThe burning question...\nEveryone has seen the VGX footage by now, the absolutely captivating scenery, the high detail, fantastically furnished terrain, the incidental artistry that made it look like we'd be getting an experience that in terms of art and design would blow the predecessor "Assassins of Kings" right out of the water. Then we get close to release, in game footage comes out and what we actually begin to see is that the textures have been substantially downgraded, the details and geometry have been altered, LOD has taken a massive hit in areas (including the use of the old graphic trick of distant fogging to reduce the render budget), and overall, the whole experience feels like it's lost a lot of the fidelity.\n\nWith the 1.0 release, the criticisms came out thick and fast, and CDPR initially denied that there was a "downgrade", opting instead to keep quiet and work on patches to deal with stability, recently they've finally come out and accepted it by way of mea culpa. Presumably because of the fact that there's a Digital Foundry article due soon that would pretty definitively mean they'd have no way to excuse themselves by that point. So now it's damage limitation. The question then is - How big a downgrade is it? First, let's deal with my system specs and my settings :\n\nI run a core i5-4670 (haswell), 16 Gig of Corsair Vengeance ram at DDR3-1600, and an EVGA GTX 770, nothing overclocked, but this system is a good testbed for new games. As of 1.03 I can run the game at 1080p at 60fps, though not a lock at that framerate, at ultra for most settings EXCEPT for HairFX, which as expected wrecks framerates across the board.\n\nThe texturing as of 1.03 with sharpening set to max is a mixed bag, in places it's genuinely high quality, in others it reminds me of those crayola drawings you might have seen with "My first brick texture", with no bump or normal mapping. There's an inconsistency present that implies that either there's a serious chunk of work to do with fixing various elements, or that CDPR decided to skimp on texturing where they thought players would not pay serious attention to and just focussed on areas where players would likely be present. Grass and foliage is a mess, it's made of flat textures that can clip the geometry and other decals as well as other items, compared to the VGX footage it's a long, long way back from the highly detailed, low clip texturing that was present. Again, this is stuff that can likely be improved with future patches but right now it's a step down from what was expected.\n\n"From a distance" the game does look genuinely impressive, but get up close and the details fall apart. This is an open world that's been created using watercolour brushes, and that's a problem for people used to the details of say GTA V, where you can go down onto ground level and there's a lot of incidental detail going on.\n\nThe life of Witchery, poverty, and brutishness...\nThe gameplay also, is something of a mixed bag, both in terms of combat and in terms of inventory manipulation. First and foremost you're now initially limited to three of a given potion, much like estus flasks in Dark Souls, and you can only refill them by meditating, more to the point, you tend to use these "on the fly" as opposed to preparing and using them up during meditation. Gone are a lot of the longer term things like using a mix of potions before a major fight and balancing your toxicity before engaging, now toxicity raises and lowers in a dynamic that is based more on consumable timing (in a bit like estus usage). This might be me donning my PC Master Race flag at this point but the game definitely feels like it's been blunted for the console crowd. A lot of the refined approaches in "Assassins of Kings" have been simplified to make it more accessible, and not in the good way.\n\nThe overall feel is a game that seems more 'hurried' in all aspects, there's more speed in the combat, there's more "rush rush rush" when you're fighting, and a lot of the thoughtful elements in the moment to moment play have been pared back because the console crowd might find it a bit too hard figuring out why you'd want Cat for a specific area and Tawny Owl for another and preparing accordingly.\n\nYet despite this, there's still hope...\nThe big redeeming feature of the Wild Hunt is the roleplay, I can forgive a lot when the writing and the voice acting and the story is as good as the Witcher has become. Assassins of Kings was one of my top picks at the time for it's brilliant story depth and flexibility, and the Wild Hunt definitely shows off the heritage proudly, allowing you to continue in that vein, with choices that already seem to hint at consequences down the line, even in what is supposed to be the "tutorial" area.\n\nBut then there's the price...\nFifty Quid. Nope. So much nope. If you didn't pre-order it and manage to save on it. Or you've got a friend who can source it cheaper through the global markets, so much nope. It's good, but it's not Fifty Quid good. I know there's a push by AAA developers and publishers to raise the price of big budget games up to the level of PS4 and Xbox console prices but get real, this is the internet, and we're not going to pay that for a game that's still not bug free, that -did- suffer the downgrade, and ultimately is a mixed bag overall compared to Assassins of Kings.\n\nVerdict : Recommended, but not at £50, wait for it to come down to a more reasonable price","May 24, 2015","true","9.9"," 55 of 86 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","55","86","5","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sifferz/recommended/292030/","sifferz","Sifferz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sifferz/","363 products in account","As an avid lifelong gamer, I think I am willing to say that this is the single best RPG that I have ever played, and I don't throw out sentences like that often.\n\nHaving played the first two titles, my expectations for this one were quite high. The first was enjoyable enough but has aged fairly poorly, and the second is a brilliant title with stunted combat. This time around, however, they got it all right, and in an open world to boot.\n\nWhen talking about the sheer *size* of this title, you don't quite do it justice. Typically, when a map is littered with hundreds of interesting tasks, the value of the individual tasks themselves tends to run thin. Even in remarkable titles like Skyrim, you'll see the same dungeon with the same enemies time and time again. This title realizes the exceptionally difficult goal of making every interaction meaningful. Every side quest has an interesting story, many of which branch off into further, more interesting narratives, and the voice acting for these quests are stellar on all fronts.\n\nFurthermore, the "choice and consequence" element ,as it were, is executed more brilliantly than ever. Choices you made dozens of hours ago will become relevant long after they have left your mind, and often the consequences of your actions are thoroughly unclear in the moent - as they should be. You make decisions on the fly that feel right, or at the very least, feel like the least awful. Ultimately, the consequences of these actions remain satisfying throughout, and showcase the talents of a team of exceptional authors.\n\nAdditionally, the combat, is simply brilliant. It might feel a touch problematic at first, when you don't have access to your Witcher's tools such as potions and bombs - but once you do, the battles come together with more demanding strategy than most real time ARPG's are after. Falling somewhere on the spectrum between Arkham's FreeFlow and Dark Souls' slow, punishing excellence, the title makes you feel like a Witcher by demanding you use the tools at your disposal. I would highly recommend playing this game on Blood and Broken Bones (Hard) or higher, as the game's design shines at that level.\n\nAs for problems, no game is without them. A litany of inconveniences are found in the title, such as the hundreds of pointless "ignite" prompts for candles found on top of essential chests and quest items, causing Geralt to comically fiddle with a candle even during some of the game's more dire moments (Due to be fixed in an upcoming patch). Controlling your horse, Roach, can be pure suffering at times. The graphics are beautiful, they really are, but the grass is another story. While it looks great in motion, if you ever stop and look at the grass or a tree's leaves, the sudden decline in quality is downright distracting. Inventory management is problematic, at best, especially when your crafting inventory starts to grow out of hand, which it really, really will. These are all, however, nitpicks.\n\nThis is all to say nothing of the brilliant mini-game, Gwent. This is to say nothing of the 8 weeks of free DLC packs. This is to say nothing of why you should support CDPR on the basis of their reputation alone (you really should). This is to say nothing of the hundreds of moments from this game that will stick with me forever, from the combat to the dialogue. This title is a fine sendoff to one of my favorite protagonists out there, and furthermore, is perhaps the finest RPG out there. Don't miss this - you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you do.","May 28, 2015","true","143.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBaconOverlord/recommended/292030/","TheBaconOverlord","Bacon Overlord®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBaconOverlord/","3707 products in account","Pros:\nGreat story (if you like a constant and almost neverending chase)\nGood graphics\nNever had any slowdowns or graphic issues, stayed at 60 FPS or above even during hectic scenes.\nThe witcher battle system was adequate for most battles even though there really were only two sword swing animation variants.\n\nCons:\nClunky controls (at best), especially when trying to line up to loot something.  Trying to stop or pivot and go in a different direction?  Forget it.  I can't count the number of times I've walked up to a drop off and tried to turn around and leave and had him walk right off it because he couldn't just turn around even though I was pressing back toward the way I came.  He has to walk in a little half circle to turn back.. just annoying.\nUnlootable containers in several different parts of the main map and even the current DLC\nStory gets really fragmented and broken if you skip too far ahead.  Almost as if it can't keep up (Example would be not recruiting anyone for the fight at Kaer Mohren), etc.\nWay too many times there was no quest indicator (circle) when the quest objective was outside of the area I was in, requiring me to use a fast travel post.  Using TAB while on the map didn't target anything either.  Required a fast travel to another location a couple times to clear up.\nCombat AI needs work.  When you hit the attack button and your character stands there or when you are trying to attack a single monster and you jump to another one (totally in a different direction).  Forget heavy spin attacks... they simply don't work.  Light spin attacks work, but good luck changing direction.\nWay too many points in the game where you get stuck from swimming into areas that are too shallow to swim in, but can't stand up.\nSwimming also has several issues when you try to get out of the water.  The grass may be at eye level, but you can only "get out" of the water in specific areas or you'll get the infamous "can't do that right now" as you are standing in front of a wall that sticks 3 inches out of the water and can't pull yourself out.\nThe same is true for climbing.  There are several (way too many) areas where you can't climb a location that's less than eye level.  And others where you can climb a piece of grass...\nThe storylines with Ciri require you to play her... without leveling her or upgrading her gear, etc.  One can assume that's meant to make the battles more challenging I guess.  But, in the end, it just belittles the amount of time you put into leveling Geralt...\n\nI give it a thumbs up... but barely.  The glitches and issues made the game frustrating in certain points moreso toward the end.  I felt like I was playing one of the early Tomb Raider games in some instances.  Unless you plan to use a gamepad, I wouldn't recommend this game if you're used to Fallout, Elder Scrolls and other easier to control games.\n\nEDIT:\nI forgot to mention:\nThe UI isn't very intuitive either.  It works like a console game.  If you press "M" for map, be prepared to navigate back out of the console-menu tree.  Which means pressing escape a bunch more times than you thought to get back to the game.\n\nThe inventory system is a mess.  It doesn't scale with your level with some types of weapons (uniques for example), but with others it does... but it doesn't make sense because a level 5 bandit can drop a level 30 sword.  How was he using a level 30 sword?  But, you can turn around and kill the bandit chief (level 10) and get a level 10 unique weapon.... that's useless since you're level 30.\n\nDon't bother trying to sell the unique weapons or armor to a merchant like Hattori... the items will stay in their inventory forever and you'll never be able to get any new items on their offering side.  At least not in the several weeks I played (in-game weeks) after I tried selling things to various merchants.  Whenever I would come back... the items were still there and no new items were available.\n\nCrafting presents another whole set of issues when (and if) you find a diagram for a sword for your level.  By the time you gather the materials, you've already out leveled it (they don't scale to your level for some weird reason) and you're more likely to find a better weapon off a level 1 mob since everything BUT unique items scale to your level.\n\nLots and lots of issues.","January 11","true","80.5"," 57 of 92 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","57","92","6","9"

But we must say: every new step in the digital universe based on the polish masterpiece is a new, different look. Geralt of Rivia is back, one last time. After the events of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, war breaks in the Nothern Kingdoms. Nilfgaardian Empire conquers everything in it's path, and few forces remaing, commanded by King Radovid of Redania. Almost at the end of the war, in the middle of the bloody battlefield of the aftermath, Geralt and his old friend, Vesemir, seeks for Yennefer of Vengeberg, a sorceress, Geralt's old lover. But this mission will take you to a larger task: to stop the Apocalypse, as the Wild Hunt, multi-dimensional warriors invades the Continent, as they're after Ciri, the girl of the profecy, with Elder Blood, Geralt's former apprentice. That's the base for the story, but believe me: it goes very further. As we search for Ciri, we will know a lot of stories, including arcs, like the Baron quest, maybe the best mission in a video game this year. The story is amazing, simply takes the best of the witcher lore and make it the end of Geralt saga with epicness. Every choice matter and it will have implications in the story. HEAVY IMPLICATIONS. We have 36 endings avaible and 300 variations, not to count every quest end, as there are a lost of mini stories. Speaking of quests, this game have the best ones availble for open world RPG. Every quest has a different story, with different objectives. It's not "go get the item and give me back" like the boring quests in Skyrim. It actually has content. And in the quests, The Contract ones shine. Track down a monster talking to people, following the trails and discover how to beat it and what the monster is. Explore his weakness... There's a lot of strategy in. It's incredible and you feel like a real witcher. There is also some events around the world to complete, and different location in the map, as this is the first Witcher to be open world. And i have to say: it's big. 136km², one of the biggest map in gaming, bigger than GTA V and Skyrim, togheter. The map is divided in some areas, the bigger ones being Velen and Skellige, that are pretty different, Velen being the aftermath of war, with connections to Novigrad and Oxenfurt, two beautiful and big cities based in XVII netherlands cities, it's amazing, giant and with a ton of NPC. I mean, there is surely THOUSANDS in Novigrad. That's how you do a real city in a RPG, see Skyrim? Skellige is the nordic-based island archipellago, with snow, boats and a lot of underwater exploration. Yes, you can swim and dive in the water, with treasures and other stuff in the bottom of the sea. Other news to Geralt movements are a kind of parkour: it's a very fluid movimentation and jumps. Both maps are beautiful and have one of the best art direction i've ever seen, with dynamic weather and day and night cycle, making totally beautiful scenarios. The combat is very fluid and again, one of the best. It has a lot of strategy involved, as you can make potions with a lot of combinations and there is also tons ans tons of armors ans weapons, including a crossbow, which you can change even the bolts used. You have your horse, Roach, and the enmies also use, so there's some horse combat, aswell horse races. You can also use boats in the map, and a crossbow while using the boat or exploring underwater. There's also runes and gliphs you can put in your equipment, and there's even horse equipment, like saddles, and a trophy (like a head of a monster) ou can put in his back. You can change your hairstyle, beard style, shave up...Your beard even grow up over time! The combat is also very gory, with a lot of dismemberment and blood, with very cool finishers. Alongside the combat as a Witcher you have your signs, kind of "magic" you use to help you out. This time you can choose two different methods of using them, for example the Igni sign, which releases fire, you can make a fire blast to multiple enemies or a continous flame from your hand. Other details includes a currency system. For exemple: you may free a location from monsters, the vendor there will sell you things for a smaller price, and that will have impact in another region price. There is also 3 kinds of coins in the game which you can trade-in in the Bank of Novigrad, aswell taking a loan from there. In some places near and in Novigrad you will find brothels too, for some diversion, and the game includes romances with Triss and Yennefer, for example, with a lot of sex scenes (developers says that there are 16 hours of them in-game).The game includes fast travel system, with signposts in some locations you acess to fast travel. There is even weapon/armor degradation putting some more realism into the game. In fact, maybe there is even other aspects i probaby fogot, cause there is 200 hours-content, plus 16 free DLCs, a lot of monsters to hunt. This is probably the most immersive game ever made, with everything feeling alive, the population, the world, the animals. One thing that impresses is the AMAZING level of detail...in everything. The swords, clothes textures, all original and well crafted (ah, there's also an impressive crafting system with a lost of materials found in the world). There are dozens and dozens of books and glossaries in game telling the story of the world and characters...the lore...it's impressive. Not to mention there's a game inside the game. Gwent, the card-game like Hearthstone. It'd very fun and addicting, and it's cool to collect the cards, beating certain players to get unique ones. For the technical side: the optimization is quite good after the patchs, and the graphics are one of the best out there, truly next-gen and with beautiful results in the scenario. High-quality textures. The number of bugs in the game is big, but i did not find any game-breaking one, just normal ones for the outstanding size of the game. Ah, and the soundtrack. My favorite one this year. ALL the songs are remarkable, with cheers to The Fields of Ard Skellig. Holy ♥♥♥♥, so many feels. Also the bugs problems, alongside the terrible horse AI and NPCs making the same commentaries over and over again are probably the only bad things about this game. And the are totally irrelevant. Well, that's it. I complete the game 100% and soon i'm gonna make a run in Death March difficulty, using New Game + free DLC. The joy to complete one more time in the hardest setting the best RPG ever made will be unforgettable.\n\n\n+High Replayability\n+Choices and consequences for every act\n+Intriguing and Epic story\n+Remarkable and epic soundtrack\n+Big Immersion\n+Customization, lots of weapons, armors, potions and skills\n+Realtime weather and day-night cycle\n+Charismatic characters with backstory\n+Beautiful and big open world\n+Superb graphics and amazing scenarios\n+Hundreds of quests, talk and events\n+A lot of possible endings\n+Variety of monsters.\n+Sailing in Skellige\n+Long campaign\n+Treasure hunting\n+Glossary, books and additional lore\n+Well-crafted romances and sex scenes\n+The epic conclusion to Geralt's saga\n+Free DLC\n+Epic intro and menu\n+Big cities and a lot of NPCs\n+Good optimization\n+Witcher contracts\n+Boats and horses\n+Underwater exploration\n+Animal life and whales!\n+Amazing and strategic combat\n+A lot of itens/food\n+Well-done crafting system\n+High-quality textures\n+Horse combat\n+Crossbow\n+A lot of map activities\n+Currency system\n+Weapon/armor degradation\n+Alchemy ingredients and plants\n+Ciri gameplay\n+Customizable hair and beard\n+Beard grow over time!\n\n-Horse AI\n-Some bugs\n-NPCs doing the same commentaries over and over again\n\n\nThe Witcher III: Wild Hunt put an end to Geralt's saga with joy.

The graphics, gameplay, story, music - every single aspect of the game is absolutely outstanding. Even the side missions- ESPECIALLY the side-missions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shameproof/recommended/292030/","shameproof","XpansionPak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shameproof/","231 products in account","Before playing this game, I had almost given up on the Western RPG genre as a whole. But this is now my favorite game of all time.\nEvery quest in The Witcher 3 is written with care and finesse, but at the same time it's all very procedural and unpresuming. Think Elmore Leonard more than JRR Tolkien. I was not at all surprised to find that one of the writers for this game had written crime novels set in Classical Greece before working on this game.\nThe writers have a lot of fun with dialogue. They borrow mechanics from The Walking Dead, Dragon Quest, and Grand Theft Auto. Sometimes what appear to be heavy choices turn out, believably, to not matter. Sometimes an innocuous choice turns out to be significantly more important than you thought. Sometimes a conversation option represents something Geralt wants to say but wouldn't have the gall to say. These conversations are where the "RP" in RPG happens. They're acted out exceptionally well in Polish, and very well in English. The characters have also been hand-animated to have excellent lip sync, expressive posture, an interesting tics. They didn't try this, but I think that the writers/actors/animators of The Witcher 3 have enough mastery over human conversation that they could make a 2 hour long quest in which you just sit down and talk to one person, a la My Dinner with Andre.\nThe story for the most part is pure entertainment, but occassionally it will surprise you. Seeds planted dozens of hours ago will flourish into moments of emotion and depth. Reviews have compared The Witcher 3's setting to Game of Thrones'. It's a fair comparison as both have dreary realistic settings. But The Witcher 3 more frequently pierces through  its grey-brown cloak, delivering moments where you're moved by a character's compassion and optimism.\nThe setting is true fantasy. It's a cohesive world, and at the same times, it's an amalgamation of thousands of memes from European and Slavic culture. This is a world where witches fatten children up with sweets, trolls tell riddles, and salt is sprinkled on doorsteps. You'll continously learn more fascinating things about the setting, all the way through the last act of the game.\nThe graphics are beautiful, but you could determine that yourself. Novigrad in particular is as impressive as any city from an Assassin's Creed game, and more interactive.\nI haven't talked too much about the moment-to-moment gameplay, and I don't wish to. It's good, better than most RPGs and many action games, but it's not the point, either. Combat is to The Witcher 3 what driving is to Grand Theft Auto IV. It's a means of carrying the player throught the story. If it was any more engrossing, I think it would distract the player for The Witcher 3's more ambitious goals.\nThere's a little too much junk to loot, but that's OK.\nThe WItcher 3 is a really special experience. I thought I knew what it was going to be, going in, and I thought it wouldn't be that interesting. I was wrong. It's a cut above every other RPG I've played. It's remarkable to see a game bite off so much, and then chew it so competently.","April 14","true","130.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Put in 27 hours before reaching Skellige Isles. Upon arrival, I took a good hard look at my surrounding and was simply awestruck. If I were to be honest, I nearly teared up at the amount of work that went into the game. Exploring most of Velen along with the quality of the side quests already convinced me to buy this game, but Skellige Isles basically induced guilt onto me for pirating the game.\n\nI wasn't proud of what I did. To atone, I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't touch the game at all until I bought it for real. Glad to say that I was able to successfully carry out what I sought to do. If a CD Projekt Red employee is reading this, I deeply apologize for my immature and cheap behavior.  I'll never pirate any of your games ever again, and I'll encourage my friends to do the same.\n\nFor people who are on the fence about getting this, there are already other fantastic in-depth reviews that can give you a good idea on what the game has to offer. With the Steam refund system in place, you can always get your money back anyway if you end up disliking the game.

One can hope.\nCan't wait for the next and final DLC.\nPlaying real life gwent... It's so awesome.\n\nSide note: been practising HEMA for some months now. I must admit that Witcher 3 has some outstanding accuracy over swordsmanship and armors compared to other games.\n\n_____________________________________\nUpdate: 180 hours in the game:\n\nI passed the point that there is everything there is to be done in this game along with 100% achievement completion.

Voice acting and digital face expressions like OMG. And free DLC already out.\n\nBasic bugs here and there, some can be annoying as hell.

The size of the open world in this game is simply mind blowing, and it's not just a bunch of emptiness and filler. Pretty much every square inch of the world is drenched in absurd detail, and it's so ridiculously good looking you almost can't believe it. So yeah, I was impressed. Beyond that, the story is a great conclusion to the previous two games (though the plot connections are more in the history of the world and the characters, rather than specific story lines, so it's probably OK for newcomers). The characters are written and voiced really well, as always. As for the gameplay, it's pretty good overall. Although the combat can get somewhat repetitive after a while, there are enough different types of scenarios to keep you on your toes, as far as changing up battle tactics and selecting different items and potions to use, etc. As for the story, the main quest is great, but there are also tons and tons of side quests, which make up the main meat of the game. Some of the side quests are very simple and short, but many are just as in-depth as the main story quests. There is very little pointless filler, aside from some collectible-oriented quests. The variety of quests is also excellent - there's a great balance of combat, exploration, and detective work. Oh, and on top of all this, there's also a full-fledged collectible card game you can play, which is really fun. The game does have a few downsides and annoyances that come up every once in a while, so it's not exactly perfect, but the negative points were inconsequential to me, when taken as part of the whole package.\n\nI've put over 150 hours into this game (though that's playing with a 100% completion/exploration type of mindset, so your playtime may vary, depending on how deep down the rabbit hole you go), but either way, have no fear that there isn't enough content for the price. In summary, I can say with no reservations that this is one of the few $60 games I've ever played that is actually worth every single penny of the asking price, plus more. So if you enjoy action style RPGs, don't hesitate to pick this up. The only reason I would say not to buy it would be if your PC isn't able to run it well. This is a game that deserves to be seen in its full glory at maximum settings to truly appreciate what a work of art it is.","February 8","true","180.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","2"

Trying to convince anyone who reads this review to buy this game would be folly as the decision ultimately lies to you, the reader. Instead i will try and summarize the strong points that make this game a masterpiece and avoid to do it a disservice in the process.\nArmours and weapons. First and foremost they are lore friendly, realistic, cool looking and perfectly introduced into the Witcher world with limitless variations both in number and perks to better suit your playstyle and needs.\nImmersion. The plains, the woods, the seas all look vibrant and colourful. The creatures that inhabit them blend in harmony making it feel even more alive. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, so here you go: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=477959170\nExploration. The world of the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is ten times bigger than any other action RPG out there. Be it from caverns and underground caves to coastal shipwrecks, the loot alone makes the search rewarding and there is always more to find.\nStoryline. The books being the driving force behind it, the game pays homage and is truly faithful to the source material. The story is gripping and compels you to progress further to find out what happens next and you feel more connected to the characters compared to the dull npc's most rpg titles suffer from. Characters have true depth, a real personality and story behind them, including the protagonist. I will take Geralt over the mediocre looking mute "dragonborns" and undead any day of the weak. You come face to face with real life everyday problems such as crime, prejudice and racism that will put to the test even your own morality.\nGameplay.The combat system is simple enough to grasp and become accustomed with. The movement is fluid enough so you can get in and out of combat and engage several opponents or single them out and you can perform most actions relatively easy. Same goes for the inventory, especially the sorting option can be a life saver when you face the task of searching a potion ingredient or a certain quest item. Ingredients of utmost importance can be found in your alchemy tab, to create the various concoctions and oils needed to prepare before entering a creature's lair, be it two legged or not.\nReplay value. After your first playthrough it's almost certain you'll find yourself taking an entirely different course.The game has a total of 36 different ending variations and avoids becoming repetitive while managing to keep things fresh at the same time.\nGlitches and bugs. The developers offer their support to the fullest and release patch updates to fix even the most trivial of issues. The game itself doesn't need a rainstorm of mods to function properly or make it barely playable. The npc's respect the physical boundaries inside the world and interact as they should and my mounts don't continue galloping in midair when i am sprinting down a hill, to end up dragging me to their deaths.\nFurthermore, the release of various free DLC's from their part combined with a flawless launch puts most devs out there to shame. Preordering this title on Steam has been a mistake on my part, so if you are serious about getting this title i would recommend heading over to GoG Galaxy. Their DRM free version and support over there is to be commended.\nRole playing. Every decision you take affects the challenges you face, how the others around will perceive you and behave towards you. The creators introduced a unique approach with a plethora of choices, choices you sometimes have to make in a limited amount of time, where the consequences of the moral choices you make appear almost immediately or way later as the story progresses, immitating real life to the point it becomes frightening how much work they put into it.\nThe only action RPG that weaves sidequests into main quests making them matter and have an actual impact in the main story.\nMini games. Gwent. Best mini game inside a game ever. It's simple and yet addictive.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451209903\nHorse racing. One of the most fun to play and competitive in game activities.\nBrawling. Think of it as a medieval version of fight club. Loads of fun with bashing peasants faces.\nSoundtrack. One of the best game soundtracks of the last five years to say the least, heavily influenced from slavic folklore/ ethnic music, frankly nothing could fit the tone of the game any better.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQS4o_bYA_M\nAnything else i add beyond this point is simply redundant, so go ahead and pick it up cause this is the game of the decade. Who knows, maybe this gaming experience will eventually lead you to grab a copy of Andrzej Sapkowski's masterpiece and you will find yourself dive headlong into it's pages.\nMy verdict 1000/10 The title that set the bar very high and my expectations even higher for all the RPG titles to come.","July 11, 2015","true","807.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","7"

Could you imagine being able to do so while actually enjoying it? No, unless you were really into that kind of thing. A lot of people aren’t into literary works, and so numerous deeper ideas don’t surface unless pointed out by the teacher.\n\nWhat if I told you that you could enjoy an epic work, quality to that of a Shakespeare or one of many writers throughout the ages, without having to feel bogged down, confused, flipping through a dictionary, and waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel? The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is that work.\n\nSure it’s a game, but by labeling it as such I personally think does the excellent title an injustice.\nDon’t be confused or feel out of place when you say that leading FPS titles have no story, or just don’t feel like they have substance, meat, or content. EA, Ubisoft, and many others set the bar so low; I personally think that the quality of stories and titles is as close to rock bottom as possible.\n\nThis is the first game I’m proud to say that I spent 68 hours going through, just to get to end as quickly as possible. Not that I wanted to rush or get it over with, but I was interested if the ending was even remotely capable of doing the title justice. Was getting to the end a challenge in terms of difficulty? Some parts were, but I felt like I actually accomplished something. I didn’t feel as if they pushed me, dragged me, or even helped me complete the title. That’s with the “old school” difficulty enabled. There are many other difficulty options to explore, but I tend to like having the feeling that I just wasn’t given the ending, I had to battle for it.\n\nAll the free DLC is a demonstration that CD Projekt Red really does care about the PC gaming ecosystem. They are even the people behind GOG (Good old Games). They aren’t interested in repeating the same old story time and time again, purely to rake the cash in.\n\nBeing able to save when I wanted to—what a big change that was. Most modern titles could learn from this—it’s not “next gen”—it’s just straight forward. It’s hard for me to remember being able to tell a game “I want to save here”, as the idiotic trend of “checkpoints” or whatever horrible monster the console crowd has cooked up for us persists. The auto saving system is quite well built as well, but I would recommend doing manual saves.\n\nSpeaking of which, this was again another first in the area where I felt like the PC market space was treated as it should have been. I could throw all the quality sliders to Ultra, have actual hardware tessellation, and make my machine actually work. Even with the latest and greatest GTX 980Ti, the game proved a challenge to it. Surround gaming is certainly possible, but not with Ultra settings enabled (35 FPS).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=555976898\n\nMaybe I’m some “graphical nerd” who likes to be able to say things like “ultra” and “slider all the way”, but it was clear to me – the graphics enhanced the story. I didn’t play the game solely for the graphics, or to see some funny scene. The graphics helped make the plot enjoyable, and more “realistic”, it terms I wouldn’t be able to describe.\n\nSpeaking of which, the story is really about fatherhood, growing up, and many other things. For now it would be best to focus on just the concept of fatherhood. Ciri has grown up, we know this, but how Geralt handles his daughter (or stepdaughter?) goes to show the challenges of being a father. And this is not something you expect from some badass guy who could slice you up in the blink of an eye. The title does a fantastic job of showing a wide range of emotion, all at the right times. Remember though, you have in a say in this. The entire story is choice driven, your decisions matter, heck, even from previous games they matter in The Witcher 3.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=556013276\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=555999129\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=556014999\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=556021292\n\nIt took me a while to think what I was going to write after playing. Some would describe it as “right in the feels” or such. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just writing a review that would prove popular just for the sake of being popular. Just as the craftsmanship apparent in the game, I wanted to make sure that my review did the same as well.\n\nNegatives? Well there’s a reason why it’s not ten out of ten. In a list: Cinematics don’t use Nvidia’s Hairworks or DLC outfits, some objects clip incorrectly for a few seconds, and some objects have fade-in/fade-out issues. These are all minor, and don’t detract from gameplay.","November 16, 2015","true","68.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","3"

It was worth every penny. The game features a huge and very deatiled map. Environments range from plains to swamp and mountains. Besides of main missions there are a lot of side quests that can be done which will reward Geralt either with swords, crafting components or diagrams. Wildlife is full with bandits, animals and monsters. Swords can be crafted, dismantled or repaired. Certain types of swords are relic type which means that the sword can do greater damage if stones are applyed to them which can be purchased vendors or can be found at ? marks on the map. Geralt's ability can be upgraded by levelling up or drawing from Places of Power. Signs can be used druing attacks that can make enemys vulnerable.

Wow. This game is truly astounding.\nI went into playing this game not really knowing what to expect, although I had heard good things    about it . The Witcher 3 because of the significant difference in pacing.\nHowever, they're two completely different games and the Witcher certainly proved itself to me. From the amazing sceneries to the engaging story, this game is definitely praiseworthy.\nHowever, the most compelling part of the story for me was definitely the characters. The character development in this game is amazing, and I truly began to feel a sense of\ncomfort and love for nearly all of the characters. I loved the characters and lore of this game so much, in fact, that I actually played through the game multiple times,\ncovering the main story and various side quests. It is very easy to put in over 150 hours into this game . This game does not fail to impress and I can't wait for the last DLC .\nI wish every developer must learn from CD Projekt Red for making a good dlc for a worth buying season pass. Heart of stones expansion is great dlc which i ever played, hopefully Blood and wine also do the same cuz it is the last journey of Geralt so it will be amazing too .\nHopefully you give it a shot, in my books its a must buy . I bought A retail GOG version first on the release time now i bought this game again on steam so u can guess how much this game means for me .

The main story is catching and you just can't stop playing, but the side-quests aren't less interesting. The creatures are stunning and every combat is intesting for itself. Collect your favorite gear, level up, put runes on your favorite sword to make it even more powerful. Discover your own playstyle and make it perfect.\nBut there isn't just the game itself. The DLC's could be their very own games. Writing this a few hours before the release of Blood and Wine, I can say Hearts of Stone was a whole new adventure. The bossfights are epic, they have new mechanics which makes it even more challenging fighting them.\nAfter all, riding around with your loyal horse, just enjoying the beautiful world of witcher, as well as fighting powerful creatures and stealing where Geralt can get his hands...\nThere are just little bugs, but you can forgive that compared to the huge world and all the beauty you will come across.\nIt is worth every single cent.

This game did that to me. Yes, it really is as good as everyone claims. It's one of those games you simply cannot put down. I found myself thinking about it way too much and itch to get back to playing it. Not many games do that these days, but this is definitely one of them.\n\nGraphically, it looks absolutely astonishing. The environment, characters, textures, attention to detail, god, even the hair looks amazing. The weather and day/night effects are also top notch. You can truly get "lost" in a game world as lovingly crafted as this one.\n\nThe music is also very well done, it fits perfectly with the game and really helps to set the tone and emotional impact of certain events and areas. Truly, not enough praise is given to it, but trust me, it's really well done. Voice-overs are also a strong-point here. The characters (especially the "main" ones) are done extremely well and really help to immerse you in the world and form attachments with the characters.\n\nThe story and quests are also very well put together. Much less of the "go here, fetch this" crap that most RPG's use to pad out a game with content and much more involved and intriguing stories that mean just as much as the main quests in some cases. The addition of specific Witcher contracts, which allow you to go full on detective are also great fun. Some of these require a little research and preparation, rather than just running to a point on the map and button-mashing, giving them a surprisingly deep and complex vibe. There is also lots of content to keep you entertained - and as stated above, it's not just rubbish padding (I am looking at you, DAI).\n\nAt this point I am really struggling to find much wrong with the game. I suppose the only thing that is a little lacklustre is the combat - which can be great sometimes, or very frustrating at others. It could do with a little polishing given the amount of it in the game, but it is by no means a deal-breaker - and certainly an improvement over Witcher 2's. To be honest, it grows on you as well - being quite different to most RPG's I have played, but once you get used to it, suddenly it all seems to come together and work. So really, this is nitpicking. I found the keyboard and mouse controls difficult to get to grips with, but a few rebinds later and all was well (dodge key being bound to Alt by default was a personal bugbear). Also be sure to turn on "Hardware Mouse", or else the mouse never feels "right". Quite why it is defaulted to "off" to begin with, I don't understand.\n\nThe "Gwent" mini-game also never captured me (I just avoid it wherever possible). This is personal taste however, and a lot of people seem to really enjoy it. Never quite clicked with me though. Each to their own. Thankfully you can just skip these - including the "find them all" quest related to collecting every card in the game. So what we have here is an optional feature that some will love and play (no con to the game) and others will not like and skip (no con again), making this whole "issue" a non-issue.\n\nYep, that's it. I honestly cannot name anymore cons. Absolutely everything else about this game is good - better than good. So, all in-all, this could well be one of the best RPG's I have played in a long time. It is nothing short of a masterpiece. I don't give away 10/10 ratings often, but this game deserves it.\n\nP.S. Team Yen, all the way.\n\nJimbo Rating: 10/10","January 18","true","121.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","3"

Other than that you can ride/walk where ever you like. Don't expect to survive though, there are enemies scattered around the world you will not be able to handle right away, even if you can go there.\n\nFairly soon after I got to Velen and was just riding along the road to my next assignment, game across a ?-point and thought "oh well, might aswell pick up som xp" before moving on... Got turned in to a pincushion by bandit archers 10-levels higher than me (didn't have deflection yet). ALL RIGHT, I like it. Just because I can go anywhere, doesn't mean I CAN go anywhere...\n\nI loved the combat system already in W2, so no complaints from me. But if you are not in to Geralts fighting style (twirling and jumping around) skip this one. Quite different from other games in the genre. Do NOT play this on easy difficulty, you will just be clicking away on enemies and will not bother to learn the other areas of combat (avoidance, signs, potions, bombs) because you won't have to. You will miss out on a lot. On higher difficulties rushing in and button smashing will only get you killed right quick. Geralt is not a tank knight...\n\nStory wise, so far so good. Only come across one 'world changing' choice, but there are sure to be more.

My first playthrough was on Death March with about 95%+ completion/ exploration spanning 144 hours.\n\nOkay let me start by saying GGAT. Greatest Game All Time. Move over Zelda.\n\nWitcher 3 Takes over a few months after the events in Witcher 2. Nilfgaard Is on the Attack once again and the Northern Realms are in shambles. Everything south of Redania is under Nilfgaardian occupation and in a move of genius/insanity King Radovid attacked his, leaderless ally, Kaedwen and taken it has his own. This sets the stage of Red versus Black, Redania versus Nilfgaard, with Temeria serving as a No-Mans-Land growing more destitute and plagued as time goes on. An epic backdrop for this fantastic story to be told.\n\nOur hero Geralt, having recovered his memories, sets out to find his beloved Yennefer of Vengerberg. Geralt received a letter from her saying that she would meet him in White Orchard. So after a fantastic plot filled tutorial our journey really begins. From the very beginning we see that witcher 3 has improved upon 2 in more ways than just stellar graphics. The combat is still very much like 2, but now we have reposte as a staple ability not a researched one. NICE. Second we have a new dodge move, instead of a full roll its a mellow jump back cut that I like to call The Matador. Once I finally got a stong handle on the fighting it became so much fun to mix and match everything. Especially when an almost nonchalant chain of Matador dodges are executed to evade and slice a whole mob of drowners and nekkers without taking a hit. Reposting is also very strong, and for my tastes very fun. Reposting in this game is a nice mix of an Assassin's Creed meets Chivalry: Medieval warfare style. One can not just sit back and cheeze hold reposte and get it to work. It has to be timed perfectly by watching the enemies attack animations like in Chivalry or kind of like the Batman games. There is also the good old hold and wait block as well, but more things will knock back and stun and just negate a turtle blocking style. The larger monsters in the game often cannot be blocked, reposted or Matador'd. So proper, Witcher 2 style, super roll dodges are needed.   Whats best of all is that they are all balanced and stong/weak in certain situations so you can and must use the full arsenal to excel. A wonderful job was done making witcher 2 better, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel into something new and most likely stupid. Combat is great in this game. It might not be the end all be all that some people want, however, I love it.\n\nAlong with the combat the new gear is well done also. There is a lot more of it. Instead of daggers Geralt gets a crossbow, much to the discontent of Pope innocent II and indigenous griffins. There are way more things to craft. There are Witcher sets as well that are really powerful. They have upgrade tiers as well, so as you progress you can upgrade them to improve their stats and looks and everything else about them. Each set is based on a Witcher school so each has a playstyle focus. Cat increases raw damage ( my favorite, because you know.... I like to hit dragons for 1000 damage a strike and what not) Griffin increases sign intensity, Bear increases adreniline generation and some others. There are more potions, like Whale which increases underwater breathing and new "potions" called Decoctions, which are made from monster specific mutagens that grant long term buffs. For example a favorite decoction of mine is the Ekhidna. When stamina is used (signs) life is regenerated. Combo that with full adrenaline and a Superior Blizzard potion ( signs dont cost stamina with full adrenaline) you truly become The Beatdown and can juggernaut fight most things in a proper Skellige manner.\n\nThe skill trees have been tweaked and changed. They are in 3 familiar arcs, but there are way more to play with. I love trying to mix and match skills into uber builds. I had such a nice time in Witcher 2 doing so. Witcher 3 has even more. The major change, however, is to the mutagens. Instead of specific skills with a slot, there are 4 level locked hub/ slots that branch into 3 skills. So say one wants to use Red Mutagens to get 5% more sword damage. First you drag and drop a sword tree skill into one of the 3 "box" slots then in the mutagen slot, that attaches to that box and the 2 others of that hub, you place your Red Mutagen. Giving you 5% more attack power. When you have 3 sword tree skills in a hub with that Red Mutigen you get 15% overall bonus. It makes it so you need fewer mutagens, but it creates a nice tension between which skills to mutagen and which not to. I still really like Witcher 2's style but I like this one just as much.\n\nThe open world is a nice addition that most people, Skyrim fans especially, will like. True, witcher 2 was wayyyyy more linear but I felt it was just right. Not too much that you needed way points and a horse and not too little that it was a Call of Duty level. Witcher 3 goes big though, tons of points of interest all over. Secret caves, bandit camps, places of power, side quests, horse races, barfighting, cities, hamlets, military instillations, wild game, monster nests, Special named uber monsters tied to quests. So to make getting around the world easier the player is given 2 new things; Waypoints and a legendary stallion named Epona..oops I mean Roach! Roach is fun to ride, race and jump with. There are times when the movement can get wonky, in thick shrub or when theres junk to block all directions of movement. I did get stuck every now and then and had to put up with the turn around struggle. To go backwords you have to spin the horse around in a small radius, which can be annoying in the previously mentioned instances. I found jumping a lot made the horse control much easier in those sticky spots. Overall though I found Roach to be fun and necessary. I had a blast jumping and sliding off death drop mountain heights and not taking any damage and doing horse wheelies while sliding down snow mountains. Tony Hawk approved horse. The Waypoints are tried and true, bread and butter waypoints. Usually 1 per hamlet and a bunch in the major city hubs.\n\nThe major city in the game is Novigrad and it gave me nostalgic feelings of Baldur's Gate and Amn (Docks, Temple, Merchant Square anyone?) . It is the main city due to its wealth, location, and importance to both sides of the war. A sort of Jerusalem in feel. The look is more modern Assassin's creed style, of course, but it felt... right. Yeah theres more filler homes that I cant go into than I would like, but overall theres plenty of merchants and active npcs and guards to make it feel real and enthralling. Even the smaller towns and villages accomplish this and also do a good job of showing the horrors and ruin left in the wake of the war. Novigrad even pulls a sort of Shadows of Amn with the underworld factions being the true powers in play in the city. A good job is done really getting the city to come to life with the plot as well. The radical agents and ideals of the Temple cracking down on mages ( from the happenings at the summit in Loc Muine in 2.) The criminal power plays. The people just trying to endure. All of it splendidly done.\n\nHere we go. The plot. Amazing. This truly is one of the best stories of all time. Not just for a video game, this is a masterpiece on par with Shakespeare. I laughed, I cried, I felt anger and extreme bloodlust at certain characters. I really felt in alighnment with Geralt. As people continued to give Geralt the jerk around, we both became more angry, soon choices almost turned to butchering innocents to save Ciri. In some places I wish the player did have more freedom to kill.

It's also filled with amazingly attractive women for you to fall in love with and an array of mythical creatures for you to slay.\n\nGeralt is back and looking better than ever in the 3rd game of The Witcher series, and the Northern Kingdoms are yours to explore. It's the biggest and most ambitious game yet by CD Projekt Red and from the very start of the game, you'll realize that Witcher 3 is that quality and grand scale aeventure that you didn't really think was possible in today's space of the gaming industry.\n\nThis well-written story spans across a widespread of land that varies with everything from green fields with jaw-dropping sunsets to snowed in mountains with white-out blizzards and within each of these climates you'll find the various creatures that inhabitat them, all of this helps to bring these mixed terrains to life with an unmatched immersion for the rpg genre. You'll always have something to do and it will always make some sense as there is an actual purpose to it. Grinding doesn't actually feel like grinding, it feels like positive-progression.\n\nI really like this game for a number of reasons, I look at this game as a Jrpg's soul inside the body of a Western rpg's body. I'm sure anyone who knows the difference of the two will agree. It's great that even though the main story is linear, that there are other mini-stories within the main story that give the player choice which ends up influencing different endings and overall experiences around you while the main quest is a set stone.\n\n\nPros  Gorgeous cgi like in-game graphics\n200+ hours worth of main story/mini-quests combined\nIncredibly stupid optimization - looks and runs beautifully on a potato\nCombat has been dramatically improved over the other Witcher games\nGreat dlc\nDifficulty options that change the feeling of the game dramatically, no really... play the game on death-march, disable the mini-map and UI.

Game of the year.\n\nIt's a very long game, or it can be, if you play every single quest through. However, at no times does it feel like busy work, the padding lesser developers (looking at you, Bioware) would fill the game with just to make it seem longer. Every quest in Witcher 3 has a story, unique and utterly interesting, and many tiny, seemingly unimportant quests and decisions follow up with you in the later game to let you know about impact they had.\n\nThe world is incredibly large and filled to the brim with interesting stuff. It's very hard to find repeating asset, everything feels hand crafted and beautiful. I recommend at some point to stop and just watch the wind through the trees and question if you ever seen anything so good?\n\nOf course, that kind of graphical beauty comes with a heavy hardware price, playing this game on less then stellar machine could affect your enjoyment of it, perhaps.\n\nFully recommend entire series, although it's hard to play graphically dated Witcher game, but Witcher 2 is still holds up.\n\nThis is without doubt the best game of the 2015, if you haven't played it yet, but thinking about it, get it.","August 2, 2015","true","191.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/292030/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","Witcher 3 doesn’t do anything wildly original. The combat system is a variation on the one in Witcher 2, and everything else functions much as you’d expect. What makes it special is the quality of the writing and the quests. In other open world games you expect that there will be content which is useless filler. Whether it’s collectibles, simple “collect 10 wolf pelt” quests, or something similar. Vapid crap which is only there to add hours to the game. Witcher 3 doesn’t do any of that.\n\nIt took me 73 hours to finish the game, and of that total running time I’m struggling to come up with a single minute that I would rather not have played. Some parts were slightly weaker than others, but on the whole there’s nothing that stands out as an obvious waste of time. All the fights felt motivated by the story, and were quick and to the point. In Dragon Age Inquisition there was so much combat, and each encounter lasted for so long that it became a chore to do anything in the game. Witcher 3 on the other hand is a much larger game, but doesn’t suffer from that. There are loads of sequences in the game where you can go hours between fights, and the larger combat set pieces are relatively restrained, never overstaying their welcome. It gets to the point, and then moves on.\n\nI can’t remember the last time I cared this much about this many characters in a game. It’s often dark and miserable, but it’s also one of the funniest games I’ve ever played. When you’ve gone through hell, the game does a brilliant job of building back fun and hope into the story. It makes it feel warm and human. All the quests and decisions you’ve made in early parts of the game come back to haunt you 50 hours later, in ways I didn’t expect. I know the script must be a hideously complicated web of decisions that trigger minor and major events all across the game. But Witcher 3 pulls it off with such confidence that it looks easy. These aspects make other big budget games look like a joke. I hope Bioware and Bethesda take notes. They have barely even tried to do anything like this.\n\nThis sets the bar for RPGs, readjusting my expectations for games. Playing it I sometimes felt sorry for all the developers who now have to go back to the drawing board and aim higher. Will they learn the right lessons from Witcher 3? It isn't about the size or the visuals. It's the uncompromising attention to story and characters. The closest example I can think of in another game where I felt this connected in each moment to the character I was playing is the Shenmue or Yakuza series. And comparing something to those two is the highest praise I can give anything. I almost feel hesitant to recommend Witcher 3 because I can’t believe how good it is.","June 8, 2015","true","104.0"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

This time I pre-ordered on Steam & on launch I overnight 560 ti's in SLI and was able to run the game on Ultra with Ubersampling to what I regarded as the most gorgeous RPG visually - thematically - in terms of character relations and dialogue - the detail in every area of the game the endless choices and entirely separate CH 2's well written and delivered. Roche's Ch. 2 being far darker in tone - I had my little affair with Ves, I kept my Blue Stripes Tattoo on my neck before transfering saves to TW3\n- No I will never have that Naked Lady Tat removed!\n\n- The Witcher 2 became my all time favorite Role-Playing Game. Top 5 games of all time. The Witcher 3 was a sure thing it was just "When?" - Adam Badowski reached out to me due to being one of 50 gamers who had written articles/reviews on The Witcher 2 PC release to accept an XBOX 360 review copy 10 days ahead of launch so we had been able to use our time spent on the PC version to ease through the content while evaluating the 360 port (art changes etc). I have the Dear Reviewer letter hung up behind my monitor; and gave the 360 Version a solid 9.6 on a 10/10 PC release - They chose 3 reviews to be featured and 5 to be displayed - I was lucky enough to have mine displayed.I knew it was only a matter of time as the rave reviews from critics and fans came in for TW2\n\n- The Witcher 3 was hinted at in the Cyberpunk 2077 Trailer which blew my mind but at the same time I thought "Its not The Witcher?! lulz Goodbye Bioware/Mass Effect!" I was part of the dorks online with slow motion over each frame finding the Easter eggs/hidden messages - it gave a date! Surely enough that date came and The Witcher 3 was announced - and shown.\n\n- We'll flash forward past me being disappointed at the delay of the game into 2015 & another delay (?3rd? or was it just Q1 2015 to March to May?) - Articles on major websites popped up after the March to May delay with bait-click BS "is The Witcher 3 in Trouble? / Doomed?" - It was not... and now it was May 18th; A week I slept a maximum of 12 hours in a 7 day span.\n\n- Everything that drew me in about The Witcher 2 was present but presented a thousand times over the expectation I had, which already had been set exceptionally high - It would be impossible for CDPR to deliver the game.. the finale that I had hoped for. Yet some how in an industry filled with every hyped title never living up to the hype or personal expectations... CDPR somehow managed to take my high expectations and the building hype prior to launch and EXPLODE like a Quen shield's break forever changing how gamers view not only Role-Playing Games, not only Open World Games but /games/ in general. The amount of hard word and care for attention to detail put into every small corner of any portion of the massive world; endlessly well written side quests and monster contracts that kept pulling me so far away from the main story that after 268.9 Hours played - I have not completed the game yet! I am level 38; I am the Worlds Gwent Champion; Greatest Horse Racer in the lands; Greatest fist fighter in all of Novigrad and Skellige (which was an amusing side quest! PUNCH DA BEAR!) -\n\n- The Politics inside Novigrad alone are praise worthy to participate in and alter, wether the rival factions that initially have strength over the city - to a string of quests that may or may not have you make a major choice with some old friends from TW2 in that games "title" over in Oxenfurt.. all breath-taking. I walked a man on a protection quest and found out it was a fisstec (the worlds Heroin / Opium of the masses) deal - I discussed this with the man who had hired me... He said it was pure fisstech and only for High paying customers of a small base; knowing many users of recreational substances I let myself out of character and said.. sure - if they want to pay let them pay... but I also should have realized when you have pure anything... you want to maximize profit - so you cut it; and sell it everywhere - soon after I began to see more and more fisstec addicts; at brothels the girls would use fisstec before sleeping with me and I uttered in shame/shock combo out lou during my live-stream "have I doomed the people of Novigrad? What happens if this no longer is a free city and the supply runs out? Will the withdrawals be lethal?! have I put a plague on the city?"\n\n- Moments like that in The Witcher 3 are ones never forgotten and discussed among friends, colleagues or random people on a forum. I figured that the A+ combat mechanics and INSANE detailed monsters in the world (with every new Creature to the trilogy being a step up in absolutely every-way... perhaps the Kayran holds a place in my heart from TW2; but the Kayran also didn't dissapear into crows and mist while shooting razor sharp brances at me from the ground). I prefer Feline armor sets (keep on upgrading!) to be the best for my play-styl of fast stamina regen with Dexxer idealism CRIT CRIT CRIT.\n\n--- The Witcher 3 is my all time favorite Role-Playing Game and is tied as my all time Favorite Game. It honestly deserves a 10/10 - Gwent alone deserves (SERIOUSLY) a 10/10 It's that damn well designed.\n\n- As for the First Expansion Pack -\n- This I can claim that I have completed in my 268.9 hours THUS FAR with this master-crafted game. Hearts of Stone is a Haunting -at times- and delightfully light-hearted at various points with TW1's Oxenfurt Medi-Shani! I just typed out specifics and ran out of Steam Review Space! Hearts of Stone = 9.9/10 Overall 10/10 B&Wine should be astonishing!","December 30, 2015","true","270.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/recommended/292030/","rust_decay","raZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/","394 products in account","Attempting to write about this game makes me run into the same problem I had when playing it - The Witcher 3 is overwhelming. In several ways.\n\nIf you have played one of the previous games, you can expect more of the series' staples: a highly detailed, rugged fantasy setting with a twist as it's borrowing heavily from Slavic folklore. Because of that, the setting manages to feel familiar and fresh at the same time. In said environment, you're forced to make non-binary decisions that have the potential to bite you in the ♥♥♥ later on. It's also nice to see that CDPR stepped up their writing game. Some of the main questlines could be among the best in a role-playing game so far.\n\nWhile the combat system still leaves a lot to be desired, it's a clear improvement over its predecessor's. The action-oriented Arkham Asylum style fighting is back, but with less annoyances this time around. Meaning: more movement options, less weird hitboxes, less dying from an opponent jumping in from off-screen. There are nitpicks, however.\n\nThe potions enhancing Geralt's abilities were crucial to winning fights in previous games, but now they last barely long enough to make toast. They can be applied during combat now, but you only get two quickslots, meaning you have to open the inventory and apply new kinds of potions manually once your charges are depleted. And there is no way to switch between bombs other than the quick menu, which amounts to the same thing - it breaks flow.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, The Witcher 3 is a bit of an open world game. The areas are massive and reward the player for exploring every nook and cranny. It really pays off since the best gear can be acquired that way. Additionally, optional quests, random encounters, treasures and monster contracts are sprinkled all over the world. There's also the card game for the times you want to take a break from monster slaying.\n\nThis is where the game's aforementioned overwhelming nature shows itself. At some point, the secondary quests just keep piling up and you don't know where to start. There's so much to do that at times you don't feel like making any progress at all, which is sometimes crippling the narrative. You get one cutscene in which Geralt proclaims that he needs to find someone asap only to ride off into the sunset, play cards and get drunk. Even without the optional tasks, the primary and secondary quests are enough to fill two games worth of content. The Witcher 3 is in dire need of a monster slayer itself because it is a content BEAST.\n\nUnfortunately, making any game open world comes with certain downsides and The Witcher 3 is no exception. The tragedy about open world games is that the sheer amount of content they feature is usually bought by sacrificing direction. Where a more linear game would feature a few well-developed, splendidly paced quests, open world games go for sheer numbers, resulting in standardized, forgettable tasks that become menial. While The Witcher 3 tries its best to avoid this, you can’t shake the feeling of engaging in busywork at times. It doesn’t help that the rewards for doing monster contracts, for instance, are rather miniscule and mostly serve as an excuse to spend more time with the game.\n\nStrangely enough, The Witcher 3 tends to be inconsequential about its open world aspect: You can explore, but all points of interest are already laid out for you on the map. You can do what you want, but quests have a level recommendation and attempting a quest maybe five levels higher than your own usually doesn’t end well. And the game doesn’t tell you which level is recommended unless you accept the quest. The absolute worst part is that gear has a level requirement, too. Which may lead to the following scenario: You’re stumbling upon a monster several levels higher than yourself, but for some reason you think you can take it on. After several tries and the exhaustion of all your resources you pull through. The prize for your effort? Top quality gear you're allowed to use after 10 level ups. Yay.\n\nThe implementation of an open world environment also comes at the expense of uniqueness. While the areas look gorgeous, they’re hard to tell apart sometimes as one grassy field with shaking trees chases after another. Still, maintaining that level of detail in an area as big as Velen with no loading times in-between is pretty damn impressive.\n\nThere are other nitpicks like the lack of item storage, overly enthusiastic weapon degradation, hefty falling damage or a certain glitchiness, another open world game staple, but it’s really just that: nitpicking.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is a fantastic game and among the best story-driven RPGs in recent years.","May 30, 2015","true","123.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Don't read if you don't want that)\nPlayed about 16 hours, I enjoy the game, the biggest gripe I have being certain glitches.\nMight get patched, but the jumping mechanics in this game are really broken in non-linear areas, such as cities. I got my way into a place I assume I wasn't supposed to be in and then, spent 10 minutes looking for a way out, until I decided there was not one and fazed up a birdcage by spamming the jump button and flew out. Other problems include objects spawning in, such as pikes and spears, before the people holding them did, finding a random floating wooden sword, and seeing the fabled flying warg. Only really one that ruined my experience. Besides that, one quest with no specific objective (not a glitch) is really nonsensical in a way I have to find a massive beast that apparently can tear off a horses head, yet upon perusing the signs in the area, whaddaya know, not a single ♥♥♥♥ given. Same with innkeepers, peasants and the like. My friend also has trouble with lag apparently, though not much(?) Also it destroys my time.\nI literally listed, just then, all the bad things I can think of, which kinda shows its a pretty great game. I enjoy playing it.\n\nEDIT: I found a mission, a guy died, for some reason I felt alot worse about it than I did the story missions, decided to try another way, and then felt guilty about it. And he DIED ANYWAY.\n:(\nEDIT-EDIT: It's 50 bucks now which makes it a must buy. Seriously, I've played over 100 hours and I've only played through the game once. The amount of content rivals Skyrim.

I had heard of the hype this was receiving prior to its release, but did not pay much attention to it. However, after seeing some gameplay videos I thought it would be a decent purchase.\n\nIt definitely surpasses 'decent.' The amount of content you get for what you pay is substantial. The Tutorial area itself is about 8 hours long (White Orchard) and is a very good way to start out the game. The later areas are all unique and varied, with their own music for their atmosphere. For example, Novigrad, the city, has a very happy-styled music, whereas the Velen region features a quite depressing one. I think my favourite area is Skellige because of its classic fantasy look to it, feeling more suited to the game's genre.\n\nWhile the combat is not amazing, the higher difficulties make you play how you're meant to play - utilising the bombs, potions and oils to defeat your opponents. It is a better experience on the higher difficulties - however the beginning of the game will be harder than the rest of it, as starting out you have limited potions and only the basic oils.\n\nPeople like to compare The Witcher 3 with Skyrim. In my opinion, it's like comparing apples and oranges. While they're both 'fruit' so to speak, they are quite different. Skyrim's focus is on exploration and immersion, The Witcher, while having some exploring in there, does not emphasize it and instead has a priority focus on the story, which does engange you from the very beginning to the end. Bear in mind, I have yet to finish this game at the time of writing this review, and I'm 90 hours in. The sidequests are abundant and interesting, no fetch quests, each are quite unique and fun, sometimes linking to the story. The Witcher Contracts are extremely fun, tracking down powerful monsters which are usually on par with your level so as to keep the fight interesting.\n\nOverall, I think The Witcher 3 has lived up to its hype and it deserves a 10/10","June 28, 2015","true","156.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","2"

The devs also promises free post-launch content), multiple dialogue choices & multiple endings, able to use your witcher 2 save file for story continuity, customizations on the option menus, fast travel included (finally lol), autosaves & manual save slots, expansive open world environment, crafting & alchemy, awesome soundtrack, fantastic visuals ... I mean damn this game looks sick! Character designs, voice acting, & mocap. Final level of the game was epic, & the ending unravels based on the decisions you've made throughout the game (3 major endings + mini endings, which CDPR claims to total 36 unique endings)\n\ncons: game volume levels are inconsistent, hair physics tanks fps count, character pop-in's when you are riding on the horse, movement & turn delay is clunky, swimming controls are really clunky, inventory/character menus is drastically better than the previous witcher games - but still a hassle to use & much room for improvement, no horse customization, the game does not reference you on how oils & bombs replenish quantities (meditation), ive come across several bugs & crashes (also the higher the video settings the more likely to get video driver crashes), a few quests were poorly designed & scripted, minimap pathing can be sometimes wrong (especially multiple vertical layered maps), none of the witcher contracts included a dragon =(\ncandle sticks are placed in all the wrong damn places!!!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/292030/discussions/0/613958868362794178/\n\nOverall, this game is the most ambitious fantasy RPG ive played to this date. It offers a full RPG experience - player choices that fit the players play style, an overwhelming amount of content, & post-launch support & content promised. It has improved flaws from previous witcher games, most importantly the TUTORIAL (ffs), & the inventory interface (although still plenty of room for improvement). I have one pressing complaint - I do not agree entirely in the circumstances that led to the major ending that I received. But since there are multiple endings, you might like the one you get. And by the time you get to the end, you've already spent over 100+ hours of gameplay that was well worth your time. Once you start playing Witcher 3, finding a reason to stop becomes ever more difficult.\n\nWitcher 3 Wild Hunt has my highest recommendation, one of the best fantasy RPG ive played, & a must have for all RPG gamers!\n\n=====================\n\nHearts of Stone review:\n\npros: great expanded story with new characters & quests, charming humor - as always, higher level gear & upgrades, creative new levels\n\ncons: there seems to have been an issue with this dlc or a patch that caused a disable on audio of character voices (I fixed the issue by changing my computer sound settings to stereo)\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed the main game - then this expanded content will definitely be your fancy. The story kept me immersed, new monster types had me thinking on how to overcome them, and the final challenge (although a bit trial-and-error) was creatively put together with a satisfying conclusion.\n\nWitcher 3: Hearts of Stone has my recommendation.","June 1, 2015","true","164.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","2"

I've read all the books and I'm so engrossed in the lore that I can probably recite some of the elder speech phrases by memory.\n\n\nThe Graphics of this game are a 10/10 for me. Even on Low this game looks stunning. I mean absolutely stunning. I'm using a Radeon R9 270x (2GB VRAM) and I run this game on Medium/High settings.  It looks amazing. I catch myself in awe staring at the sunrise or sunsets.. The attention to detail in Novigrad completely leaves me shocked at some points.\n\n\nThe Gameplay of this game would have to be a 8/10. It plays extremely well, and I hardly ever find myself thinking, "Damn this sucks.. It's too clunky..". The only time I have EVER thought this game felt clunky is when I'm on Roach(the horse) and Roach is stuck trying to make things convenient by following the path. Overall though? Combat is intense on Hard+ difficulty. The multiple ways you can play this game is addicting and I kinda can't wait to try them all throughout multiple playthroughs.\n\n\nThe Story of this game? 9001/10 I can't even tell you how happy I am about the story in this game.. If you're a long time Witcher fan you will be in heaven. The characters you get to meet.. from the books, or even just from previous games. The side quests are even detailed enough that they have their own stories! That's just impressive in my book.\n\n\nSidequests..Things to do outside of the main story? Gwent is addicting. You will find yourself wanting to collect every single hero and special card you think exists. The side quests in general are very fun and detailed... but Gwent.. Gwent is truly a special little mini game.\n\nOh by the way, the game is DRM free even with steam. You can launch it regardless if steam is even running on your PC.\n\n\nCD Projekt RED has delivered on it's promise and this game is truly a masterpiece in my eyes. It's everything I wanted and more. The fact that this game will keep me occupied for many many months should speak volumes about it's quality.\n\n\n\nAll the hype, all the waiting.. was worth it. 10/10 game.\n\nThank you CD Projekt RED.\n\n\nTL, DR:\n\nCome for the amazing story experience.\n\n\nStay for the Gwent.","May 25, 2015","true","101.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","0"

Simply put, this is one of, if not, the best games I have ever played in my life. I'm not prone to hyperbole, but this truly is the gold standard for games going forward in my eyes. There's just so much thought put into every little detail that you really want to stand up and applaud the developers.\n\nThe story is top notch. These are excellent characters with fantastic lore. The world-building is unparalleled and everything feels like it has a purpose. The quest designs are fantastic as well. If you want to be reductive, yes a lot of the side quests are fetch quest, but just like the rest of the game they have enough thought and care put into them that they are still enjoyable and often have a compelling story.\n\nI have seen people gripe about the combat and controls - they were perfectly fine to me. Combat is secondary in a game like this for me, I play it for the story. But I did find the combat to be fun and rewarding. Although I will note that I didn't play on the highest difficulty, I didn't really use much in the way of alchemy. Quen, however, is your best friend.\n\nAnd who can forget Gwent? What a fantastic mini game. I spent hours scouring for every last card and crafting the perfect deck. It's been said before, but this game is dying to be played on an iPad.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is a crowning achievement for CD Projeckt RED. They have truly crafted a masterpiece here and I would be hard pressed to find someone who likes RPG's to not enjoy this game. This just makes this wait for Cyberpunk 2077 even harder. Not sure how they will try to top this, but I can't wait to see them try.\n","June 14, 2015","true","128.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","1"

Not to mention Geralt is hot as hell I don't mind looking at him during playing.\n\nI do suggest playing it on the hardest difficulty. It makes the combat a lot more fun because you can't go all yolo on them. You have to plan your fights, look at who your opponent is and kill the weakest first. The only time I kept dying was at the very first fight with the ghouls. I wasn't aware of the fact you could walk away and leash one by one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrewylf/recommended/292030/","sabrewylf","Sabrewylf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrewylf/","192 products in account","So far the majority of negative reviews are coming from people with older machines that have some difficulties running the game. My computer is very new still and I too occassionally get a crash. I have confidence performance tweaks are on the way though.\n\nNow, The Witcher 3 is absolutely a great game. I haven't been this invested in a single player game since Skyrim, and that's coming from someone who just now got into the series. The story is very accessible.\n\nIn short: you are playing as Geralt of Rivia, a witcher. Witchers are people who have undergone all sorts of mutations to make them more efficient at their job: killing monsters for a living. They have feline eyes, faster metabolisms, and even have limited knowledge of magic. Because of that though, witchers are looked down upon in the same way as other non-humans (such as dwarves) are, despite them making the world a safer place. The story takes place in a medieval dark fantasy setting and is filled with intrigue, drama, and sex. All of this is sprinkled throughout a huge world with a staggering amount of sidequests.\n\nThe soundtrack is great. I'm the kind of guy who will not hesitate to turn off a game's sound and blast some metal over it, but this game really gets it right.\n\nFinally, combat and getting around. Movement feels kind of sluggish at first, and especially if you want to loot that one body just 2 feet in front of you the controls are sometimes a tad too sensitive. You get used to it though. The combat is best compared to Dark Souls and Monster Hunter in my opinion, as long as you're not overlevelled or playing a low difficulty setting. Every enemy and monster has one or multiple weaknesses. Maybe you'll have to equip a bomb or lure him into your magic trap. If you're a traditionalist, applying a variety of oils to your weapons will increase their effectiveness versus a specific type of enemy.\n\nBut most importantly, every monster has distinct attack patterns. You'll see an attack coming and you will be able to dodge or parry it. Kiting and not being greedy with your hits is essential or these monsters WILL take half your life in a matter of seconds. And if you're playing on hard or very hard, meditation will not restore your health. Only food will do that, and a witcher's pockets aren't exactly jingling with coin as it is... Combat is difficult and has its intricacies, and that's just what makes it feel rewarding.\n\nAll in all I really think there's something to be found here for everyone. Players who are in it for an immersive experience and don't really care can breeze through the gameplay on the easy setting, yet not miss out on the great atmosphere the story brings. Die-hard gamers can test themselves on the third and fourth difficulty settings. The second difficulty is where most, as well as myself, will feel right at home.","May 23, 2015","true","100.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

I have only scratched the surface of the game, but ~43 hours in I can report the following notes with in depth (but spoiler-free) explanations farther down.\n\nThe good:\n\n- The largest single-player fantasy sandbox RPG I've ever seen\n- Beautiful graphics help keep you immersed in the game\n- Hours upon hours of fully voiced quest dialogue\n- The writers did a top notch job creating funny, interesting, and emotional dialogue\n- Decisions you make actually make a difference, and always feel meaningful\n- Stable and smooth running out of the box. I've experienced a single (crash to desktop) in my 40 hours of playing\n- Great character customization options allow for a variety of play styles\n- Challenging and exciting combat\n- Great built-in card game: Gwent\n- Beautiful soundtrack that never feels overly repetitious, and hasn’t got old yet.\n\nThe bad:\n\n-	 Somewhat rare but slightly Irritating mount pathing issues\n-	 Challenging and exciting combat (If it gets to be too much, make sure you lower the difficulty!)\n\nOther thoughts:\n- The game has an extraordinary ability to suck many hours of your life away in a given sitting. This isn’t bad, but it’s probably not good either.\n\n\nNow for the in depth reviews of the points I made above. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is my first Witcher experience. I came to the game with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. The game world feels absolutely massive. I’ve spent hours exploring points of interest and unknown territory, looking for loot and challenging encounters. The world is completely open from the start, limited only by your own power. Indeed, if you decide to explore immediately as I did, you will find monsters much too powerful for you to defeat. Combat in this game is very challenging. You will want to spend some time researching monsters you encounter in the games bestiary, learning their weakness so that future encounters won’t be quite as difficult. I find myself constantly referring to the bestiary to make sure I know the weaknesses of the monsters I will be facing. This, combined with the seemingly intelligent NPCs make even simple combat exciting. The game has several difficulty settings, so if you find the combat to be too much of a trial, lower the difficulty instead of suffering!\n\nThe alchemy system in the game is great – tools you can and I dare say have to use if you want to be successful, but never a chore. I haven’t had to do anything that felt remotely like a chore or boring task in the game – everything you do has meaning or purpose. Choices you make during dialogue decisions absolutely have an effect on the future. YOU WILL SEE the choices you make affect the world, and the people in it. Something that caught me off guard was the amount of depth and consideration given to side-quests in the game. Doing side quests are not only interesting, challenging, and fun - they are  truly rewarding! Again, there is a real focus on making everything a player does have meaning and consequence. The constant interaction between NPCs in the game world and the player create an incredible immersive feeling that keeps you drawn into and focused on the game world. The graphics are incredible (I’m playing on moderate hardware and running at high to ultra settings) and help keep you immersed in the game. The game is highly optimized and runs quite smoothly. I have yet to experience any poor frame-rates (below 30-40fps) or stuttering.\n\nCharacter development is done by leveling up and obtaining bonus skill points throughout the game. Each skill point spent makes a meaningful difference, and there is something for everyone as far as catering to different play-styles. The built-in card mini-game, Gwent, may be hit or miss with some players. I found it to be very fun and easy to learn. I have been striving to build my card deck and I can’t wait to explore the various stages of Gwent challenges.\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe Witcher 3 is my first Witcher experience, and it is certainly one of the best single player RPGs I’ve ever played. I dare say it’s one of the best single player games created to date. If you like RPGs, hack and slash combat, or even just a challenge, give the game a try.\n","May 22, 2015","true","74.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

But it's easy and fast to travel around it, yet it does feel big and there are lots to explore on every corner. Voice acting is good as well, but voice of Geralt may sound ''forced'' to newcomers. Background sounds are very nice, mystical sounds of nature and soundtrack of the game fits together well.\n\nI also can clearly see with the upcoming patches, most of the optimization issues and bugs will get solved. Don't let these make you think before buying this masterpiece of a game, it is not logical to expect no technical issues from a game with a world this big. ''Do I think my PC can run this game?'' is the only question you should ask yourself.\n\nIf Skyrim was GOTY with all the bugs, glitches, poor AI, boring combat; this game is Game of the Century, period.","May 21, 2015","true","87.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Reading reddit and other forums every day, I still cannot get this experience out of my head. But I want to resist that desire, wait for both expansions to come out, hopefully forget a bit more of the story and enjoy the second playthrough all the more.\n\nThis is a third game in the Witcher series, and third one I'd give 10/10. No other company managed this.  No, 10 does not mean the game is perfect - there are some small issues here and there - but it means that this is an unforgettable experience unlike any other. In fact, it kind of became my favourite game of all time. Why?\nIt is simple. There are two things I love most about games - exploring beautiful new worlds, and enjoying well written, interactive, nonlinear narrative.\nAnd Witcher 3 delivers both. Oh, how it delivers. The world is one of the largest ever in an RPG, all without sacrificing any of the detail, beauty, or wonderful variety. From swamplands and murky battlefields of Velen, to majestic Skellige isles, through stunning valley around Kaer Morhen to the expansive free city of Novigrad, the world in Witcher 3 has no equal. And of course, as someone who read all the Witcher books several times over the last 16 years, enjoying all these places recreated in such stunning detail is an extra special treat. Arriving to Novigrad was expecially heartbreaking, after remembering the ending of the short story "Eternal Fire".\n\nAnd then there is the storyline. This is the best written game since Planescape: Torment. Every quest is beautifully written, makes sense in the world, has an actual context. All characters feel real. The way some book characters, like Dijkstra or Keira Metz or of course Yen and Ciri, were brought to life, is unparalleled. Frankly, this might just be the best adaptation of anything ever.\nIs it perfect ? Of course not. I have two issues with the story. They are fairly insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but still...it is something I wish was modified in upcoming patches or DLCs. Elaborating further would require spoiling, so I will avoid that.\nThere are few more small issues with gameplay, like Roach not always doing what I want him to do, or inventory being a little unwieldy with a controller, but these will be improved in patches, so whatever.\nAnyway, to wrap this up. Witcher 3 is the best game I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. It combines two things I love - exploration and storyline - into a single package, at higher quality than anything else. Other companies should carefully study this game. Maybe we could get less stupid boring fetch quests in other open world games if they do. One can hope.","June 26, 2015","true","247.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I don't even know where to start. The sidequests have a lot of variety, they aren't tedious at all and they make sense, for example you won't come across someone who will ask you to deliver something to someone else or something stupid like that. They're all interesting and unique and they play a role in the story.\n\nThis game has sooo much content that even after 100 hours I still really haven't done much. You'll be getting 200 hours at least and it does all this while still having AMAZING graphics, sure it was downgraded due to consoles but the graphics are still absolutely beautiful. And it does all this with a small file size and reasonable price. The game is also getting more and more content since CD Projekt Red has been releasing A TON of free DLC that EA would normally charge like $15 for and the only paid DLC in this game adds AT LEAST 50 hours of gameplay to your game.\n\nHonestly, there's not a single bad thing that I could say about this game, just buy it!","December 26, 2015","true","120.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGreatGibbons/recommended/292030/","TheGreatGibbons","Gibbons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGreatGibbons/","317 products in account","I can't recall having played, if ever, a fantasy RPG game quite as enjoyable and engaging as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\nIt would be an understatement to say that this game is my favorite game of the year. It's quite possibly my favorite fantasy RPG game of the last decade. I've played tons of fantasy RPG games from Diablo, the Elder Scrolls series, the Dragon Age series, and so much more... The Witcher 3 gives me everything I ever loved from those games and then some. It throws me in a world that seems more real then the rest, but yet so surreal at the same time that it remains completely fascinating. One of the truely special things about the Witcher games is that nothing is ever so black and white. Characters in that game feel so much more relatable and down to earth. It's never as simple as good and evil. Nothing is super obvious and you really have to think about your decisions. There are long term consequences to your actions and I was really surprised to see some of my choices I made early in the game come back and bite me in the ♥♥♥ later on. It's not all bad, but boy do I have some regrets and I love that it makes me feel that way.\n\nI enjoyed the main story throughout the game and even more so that some of the side quests seemed to tie into the main storyline in very interesting ways. Speaking of the side quests, I can't get enough of em'. They are so well designed and well written. Every side quest has a purpose, every single one. There are big choices to be made in side quests, and their consequences. There are no filler quests or time wasters like a certain other game I played last year... AHEM AKUAHA * DRAGON AGE * Aghkgh .. .eh.. ah.. Yeah, Dragon Age Inquisition. Side quests in that game bored me to death. But not Witcher 3. Oh no. I enjoyed my journey all the way to the bitter end.\n\nI want more! I do. Even after 185 hours, i'm still craving more Witcher 3. I don't usually start a second playthrough so soon after finishing the first, but boom there it is. If an awesome story and sidequests weren't enough I also found the combat to be super visceral and engaging. They've made huge strides and improvements since Witcher 2 and every movement and swing of the sword is very fluid and the animations for Geralt are something to behold. On that note lets also talk about the graphics. I believe Witcher 3 is the best looking game i've ever played on PC to date. I know the graphics were toned down a little and aren't exactly what they showed at E3, but it's still the best looking game around.. probably even better looking with the mods that are sure to come. Besides i'm pretty sure it wouldn't run all that great for most people if they didn't tone it down a notch. It's not all that bad, stop your whining kids. They did what they had to do to make it functional. I'm glad they did, honestly. It looks glorious at the highest settings and i'm getting a good enough framerate. Hops between 48 and 60 fps since I have Nvidia hairworks enabled.. which I personally thought looked pretty cool. If you can have that enabled and maintain a decent framerate I recommend keeping it on.\n\nThere's about a million great things I can say about The Witcher 3, and all the negative things about it were already fixed in patches, or are being fixed in future patches. The developers show their love to the game and their fans by keeping ontop of things and not only that, but they've been releasing free top quality DLC periodically. I'm talking full fledged quests, fully voice acted with choices and consequences of their own. New outfits for you and your horse. New outfits for other characters. Some more cosmetic stuff, and nice little additions. But those free quests man, damn that's awesome. Anyway, here's hoping that other companies and developers take a couple pages out of CD Projekt Red's book. More games of this caliber would be most welcome, especially if their aimed towards the PC community first and foremost as they should be.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Mhm. Without a doubt.\n\nFinal Verdict: (5 out of 5)","July 8, 2015","true","383.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

I really can't remember enjoying a game so much since I was younger and Final Fantasy X came out.\n\nThematically the setting is gritty and unforgiving. The populace goes hand in hand with their surroundings to create this depiction of a war ravaged land.\n\nMusic is a huge passion in my life and the soundtrack playing throughout is never boring to me. Particularly the battle sound track (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mez7zaB6PoY)\n\nIt's really great to see the risks and changes that Eastern European developers take to go against the grain. Even if they follow a more traditional formula like let's say Metro 2033/Last Light (Games I love), they focus so much on the atmosphere, that I'm lost in their story.\n\nIn The Witcher 3, the side quests are meaningful and all very different. In one sudden interaction, I came across a captured Nilfgaardian soldier who deserted. I told the peasants to release him, they refused and I ended up killing four or five peasants to save one man. The game doesn't try to force ideology down my throat but instead implements situations that cause us to self-analyze, even if just for a moment.\n\nEven the dialogue has me interested, where in Dragon Age or Skyrim, I would quickly skip through it. Now I intentionally try to hear all the dialogue of the characters in the game.\n\nThe Witcher 3 has now set a new standard in what I expect from open world RPG games.","May 22, 2015","true","133.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

The gameplay is solid, combat is incredible, the soundtrack is FAN-♥♥♥♥ING-TASTIC, the graphics are some of the best I have ever seen, the game looks BEAUTIFUL, characters, story, voice acting are all incredible. There is so much to do and explore in this amazing world and 95% of it is fun, unlike most big RPGs like this, where half the content is grindy, repetitive and boring. I seriously cannot put into words how incredible of an experience this game is, so I won't even attempt and I'll try to keep this short. The only bad thing I can say about this game are the glitches, but I haven't run into a single gamebreaking one yet, and CDPR seem to be doing everything they can to fix those ASAP, unlike most developers nowadays. But the pros outnumber the cons at least 10:1.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best games I have ever played. You can see the passion and the hard work that CDPR put into this game. It is truly a beautiful and immersive experience. Some parts will make you laugh, others will make you cry and, when the music kicks in and you draw your sword, you will feel like a Witcher.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs and even if you don't, I'd consider giving this one a shot. There is enough content in here to justify a $120 price tag, so don't worry about that.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the best games I have ever played and the best RPG I have ever played by far.","February 5","true","136.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

When the game got a lot of hype around it right before it's release date I did begin to question if the game would live up to the hype because I am used to playing a lot of overhyped games that just disappoint in the end. After playing the Witcher 3 for 80+ hours for about 8 days in a row I can say without a doubt this is one of the most amazing games I have played in a very long time.\n\nWhen you play the game you can see how much dedication and work CD Projekt Red has put into this game. Most RPG's will have a main quest and a story quest and with most of them I just stick with the main story and do maybe a few side quests just to level up and not be underleveled. When I do side quests in this game I don't do it for the XP. I do it for the story because the amount of work that has been put into even the side quests is amazing. Think of it this way. There is more story in one single side quest of the Witcher 3 than there is in the entire story of the game Destiny by Bungie.\n\nThe amount of time I have put into the main story and side quests is about 60+ hours. Looking for the witcher gear and finding the materials to craft them, another 10 hours. Playing Gwent another 5 hours. Exploring the world of The Witcher 3... I've lost count.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough to people who are looking for a game that finally is rewarding and shows off the dedication of developers who put in so much of their time and heart into the creation of this game. Easily worth the $60 price tag.\n\n","May 27, 2015","true","152.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

CD PROJEKT RED has reached a zenith with this game, one which surpasses perhaps all of their previous work. This game goes above and beyond to entrap you into its world. And oh it is a world you want to be entrapped in.\n\nIt has been a while since I last played a game of this intricacy. From the story to the gameplay, to the lore. Everything is nuanced in such a way that you simply can't help but be enticed. It works off of the rich lore set by Andrzej Sapkowski, from whose work the trilogy was based on, and although non-canon, the game compliments the book series perfectly.\n\nThis is certainly one for the books. A game that will assuredly be looked at as a hallmark of Open World games for years to come, and its developers cannot be praised enough for the phenomenal work they have done here. It's simply one of the best games ever made.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and BUY THIS GAME!","May 28, 2015","true","152.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","9","10","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/recommended/292030/","GerDeathstar","Deathstar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GerDeathstar/","407 products in account","After months and months of teasing, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is finally out. Polish developers CDProject Red have promised more of the same in the story-department, but also many improvements and, indeed, innovations for the Witcher-franchise. But let us start at the beginning.\n\nThe Witcher 3, like its predecessors, tells the story of Geralt of Rivia, mutated monsterhunter extraordinaire. After battling amnesia in The Witcher 2, Geralt is finally in full control of his mental capacities, which was about time, as his already white hair seemingly turns grey. Beginning the game, you have one mission: Find Ciri, your foster-daughter. This is all the motivation needed for Geralt to embark on his journey, which again takes him into the Kingdom of Temeria, now conquered by the Empire of Nilfgaard. The world of Witcher 3 constitutes the first major innovation promised by CDProject Red: It's open and sandboxy. White Orchard, Valen, the free city of Novigrad and Skellige Islands are the major areas you are set loose upon, plus a number of smaller, one-off locations without their own surrounding area. Each of the major playing fields offers a sizable map with numerous points-of-interest for you to discover. These include villages with shops, services and quests, but also sort-of random encounters, like a camp of deserters, a monster lair or just some wayward NPC looking for some hired muscle. Interesting to note is that each of the major areas is within itself completely devoid of loading screens. This includes the interior for houses and caves.\nAs you would expect, an open world like this will likely cause even the most focused of minds to stray from its path, that being the main story, and that is a good thing. Unlike the contract-style quests from its predecessors, The Witcher 3 got rid of all "Kill X [Creature]"-quests and instead focuses on missions more akin to what you would read in the Witcher books. Contracts are usually about a monster of significant strength threatening some peasant's livelyhood - the sort of quest you would really need a Witcher for. After inquiring about the beast, a short investigation will begin, during which Geralt has to track the monster and find out more about it. The ingame bestiary also records any creatures you have faced or learned about and will give you pointers to help you defeat it. Upon delivering a trophy (usually the head), Geralt will be paid the agreed upon amount of gold. Simple, but much more involved than the quests in previous installments. Indeed, some side-quests are more fleshed out than bits of the main story, skipping them would be a loss.\nCombat has also seen some improvements and now feels even more freeform than before. Of course, the main mechanics stay in place, with light and heavy attacks, steel and silver swords as well as your magic signs to cast in combat. Even with the improvements, fighting multiple opponents in The Witcher 3 can still be unforgiving, even on normal difficulty.\nLastly, the inventory has been revamped. Although it can still get pretty messy once you have amassed a whole truckload of alchemical ingredients, it allows you to sort by type and for crafting it will pick the right ingredients for you. Witcher-potions now have more complex recipes, but one vial allows multiple swigs before needing to meditate and refilling them with any alcohol from your inventory - handy. The only ever-present point of critique would be the somewhat clunky controls (mouse and keyboard). Upon first starting the game, it is advised to do some tweaking in the options (protip: Turn ON hardware cursor!).\n\nThe Witcher 3 is a fairly significant milestone in modern day RPG-games. It convinces both gameplay-wise and in its graphics. The world looks absolutely beautiful, even after the alleged "downgrade" since the 2013 trailers. Plus, even before releasing the modding tools, there are already mods for the game to improve its looks even further. Naturally, running the game on max settings will require a very beefy machine, but standard PCs should still be able to run it on high.\n\nThose who absolutely did not find any enjoyment in the previous Witcher-games, especially in The Witcher 2, will probably not find a game here that is different enough for them. Also, while it can be played without having completed the first two games, it is advisable to at least read up on the story so far, just so you know who everyone is and where the characters' motivation is coming from. Also, it is worth noting that although Witcher 3 is in its core an open world game, it still tells a story - that of Geralt. This is why there is no character customisation (although you can cut his hair and beard now!) and certain things just are not up to you as the player. That said, The Witcher 3 is a solid RPG and easily a candidate for 2015's top games. A normal playthrough, doing an average amount of side-questing, will last anywhere between 60 and 100 hours. Plus, DLC is already on its way (paid and free).","May 29, 2015","true","130.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Even if you haven't played first 2 games, it's not a problem at all. Open-world design is really well implemented. Everytime you set out for a specific quest, you will find yourself in a very different place exploring amazing landscapes, getting even more quests and being part of amazing stories. Really, side-quests in this game doesn't feel like side-quests. Even MMORPG like "get that, pick this" style quests have intriguing stories and does not feel boring. There are some side-quests in this game that could easily be a main story for another game. Graphics of this game is really good especially at sunsets it looks damn good. But deactivate HairWorks because it really kills the fps and imo Geralt's original hair is better but I can't deny that HW looks damn good on monsters. There is a mod for activating HW just for monsters you can check it out. They gave us 16 free DLC and some major some minor patches every few weeks. They really listen to their community. This game easily takes at least 60 hours to complete generally but if you don't want it to end and want to explore every square meter of it then it would take a whole lot more and the price is really low for this kind of entertainment.

This is not a biased review, because I love the books and played to completion the previous two games.\n\nSTORYAfter the invasion of the Northern Realms by Nilfgaard, the witcher Geralt of Rivia sets out on a quest to find his lost love Yennefer of Vengerberg and their protege Ciri, the Child of Destiny. Saying more of this will spoil the entire game. But compared to the previous entries, the strongest point of the game are the side quests.\n\nGRAPHICSEven though the graphics have been "downgraded", the game looks really beautiful, with great weather effects, fluid animations, gorgeous hair physics, growing beard and incredibly detailed and varied environments. The game is beautiful, especially if your gaming rig can run it at Ultra settings.\n\nGAMEPLAYCOMBAT\nThe combat is an improved version of the first game: the control are responsive, it is really satisfying to cut a drowner in half or to burn a soldier alive. This time around you also have a crossbow with unlimited bolts, and each time that you meditate items like bombs and potions restore. Now that's amazing.\nHORSE RIDING\nProbably my favourite addition to the game. The horse Roach controls really well, his stamina recovers really fast and you deal extra damage when attacking enemies while riding it. Enemies also tend to miss you while riding, but I don't know if it's a bug or just skills.\nCUSTOMIZATION\nYou can fully upgrade Geralt, his weapons and Roach by buying new armours, saddlebags, blinders and swords. This time around the Inventory is easier to navigate through, and the Skill Tree has been heavily changed: you can buy skills to then equip them as you go along, and you can add a mutagen to improve said skills if it matches the colour.\nSIDE ACTIVITIES\nPlenty of things to do: fist fights, horse races, playing the card game Gwent, saving villagers, destroying monster nests, finding shrines, eliminating monsters from settlements... You will spend a lot of time doing everything but the main quest.\n\nCHALLENGEAs usual, the game is challenging, but the improved controls and targeting system make things less frustrating when battling normal foes. But the real deal is killing big monsters like Griffins, Shriekers, Werewolfs and many more. The game is more accessible than the previous two, and if you have beaten TW2 I recommend starting on Hard difficulty, otherwise yoi will breeze through the game without problems.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting is phenomenal, as always. The score is one of the best ones I've ever heard, and it makes slaying monsters really satisfying and fulfilling. The sound effects are also really nice, even though sometimes the sound from a sword slash doesn't play.\n\nREPLAYABILITYOver 200 hours of gameplay, plus free DLC, plus two expansions that will add more places to explore and quests to complete, as well as different choices that change the outcome of many parts of the game make this a game that will last for many years to come.\n\nI love this game. It is one of my favourite games of all time. I love the story, the side quests, the combat, the depth and the horse riding. If you like RPGs, The Elder Scrolls, fantasy games, open world games or simply video games in general, you will fall in love with it.\n\nStory: 10\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 10\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 9.5\nReplayability: 10\n\nENJOYMENT: 10\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","May 23, 2015","true","70.8"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","26","42","2","0"

Also,i found myself at the end of the game without anything "exp-worthwhile" to do.\nExample : killing a monster will grant you 100 exp? You could get 700/1000 by just doing a little part of a main story mission,even a small dialogue sequence will prove what i've said.\n\n2 - The gear (armors/weps) available is really limited : there are only 4 witcher school sets. The other armors you can get/craft/loot in the open world are really inferior compared to a Griffin/Ursine/ Cat/Wolf School set, so they're basically obsolete (except the Undvik armor set) .\n\n3 - The incompleteness of some core mechanics / items: crossbow - recipes' "pinpointing" - sword drawing\n\n3a) Crossbow : useful against flying enemies and TOTALLY OVERPOWERED underwater,which is a nonsense,honestly. Using it on ground enemies won't grant you significative advantages unless wasting many points on it.\nSIDE NOTE : aiming with this tool is awful and to underline that the devs were so smart (*cough*) to introduce a crossbow achievement (Master Marksman) that will only emphatize the inconveniencies associated with this weapon.\nGOLDEN RULE #1 : if one of your mechanics isn't exactly polished...DO NOT EMPHATIZE it more than necessary!! ( Batmobile's case *cough* )\n\n3b) Recipes' "pinpointing" : if you need to craft / produce a particular Oil,Mutagen,Bomb etc. you can pinpoint (block/underline) that recipe so you always know which ingredients you're missing and which ones you need to buy from vendors in one second....and that's awesome! BUT you can also obtain some ingredients by recycling items that you already have in your inventory. A good idea would have been being able to use this feature even in the reversed way so you would have been able to spot which items were good to be destroyed to reach your goal. Money isn't infinite,you can't buy ingredients everytime just to complete your recipes.\nGOLDEN RULE #2 : if one of your mechanics is great, try to apply it in many ways!\n\n3c) Sword drawing : when you approach an enemy,the correct sword will be drawn out by Geralt...the problem is...sometimes the proper sword won't be picked at all and you'll find yourself punching golems with you bare fists. (This is a smaller issue though)\n\n4 - The lack of  "epic monsters and bosses"\nYou won't face epic enemies / monsters with unique mechanics and caracheristics. This game was supposed to be about a monster slayer. As a witcher...you will face almost the same enemies over and over again. Pretty lame,considering how great some locations and environments are.\n\n5 - Bad and poor enemy variety / numerosity\nThe are few enemy types with two-three minor variants. This is a huge letdown in the long run.\n\n6 - Witcher contracts are too "plain-vanilla"\nWitcher contracts (26 in total) are really linear,they don't usually have any political consequences and the ending choices you can take aren't really that important,except in one case (  Bloody Baron  ). Having some more deeper and more complex contracts would have been great.\n\n7 - Lack of dungeons\nForget about Forelhost and Volskygge from Skyrim. There aren't underground areas worth to be looted and explored ( except those ones where u can find oils' formulas   and the cussing vampire\n\n8 - Awful inventory management\nInventory arrows and pointers are hard to be spotted ( specially into the mutagens' menu) and you can't keep some favourited / most used items on a special list like you were able to do in Skyrim,Dungeon Siege or Diable .

You can still "quick-use" two items of each type everytime,but isn't enough.\n\n9 - Disturbing secondary NPCs' face modeling :\nYou'll find the same 4-5 standars male/female faces applied to all the NPCs with some disturbing outcomes : you will find the Nilfgaard ambassador face exactly identical to that one belonging to a peasant. This isn't exactly realistic and...logical.\n\n10 - Lack of a bounty system + lack of guards' overall intelligence\nHuman NPCs are stupid,they'll hardly leave their starting spawing points --> you can barrage them with your bombs and they won't split up to dodge them.\nThere aren't bounties to be paid in case you commit a crime and sometimes guard will cheer up for you/ignore you if u attack their teammates.

This kills the realism.\n\n11 - Technical issues :\nThis game has...MANY bugs: shoddy controls,quests never checked once completed,key NPCs stucked in choke points,random NPCs spawing during key dialogues,items disappearing from time to time,leveled gear requirements screwed up,achievements that were screwed up more and more times by several updates---> check my screwed unlock date.

They have also been updating the performance and fixing little annoyances, like those annoying torches over treasure chests. I had defaulted to medium-low on launch day, I am now running on ultra/high at a solid 40-50 frames.\n\nThe story is a long epic, with little diversions and side quests that feel like they should have their own whole game chapters.\nThe side quests have memorable dialogues and twists and turns that give you multiple different endings and scences, begging to get you to play this game again and see what each one has to offer. Some of the quests involving curses get me so indecisive, becuase ghosts always trick me and I end up someone dying or something happening and I just lose myself and get really sad.\nEach section of the main story touches on a moral choice, like family ties, racial differences, domestic abuse, sexual preferences, you name it. The grey perspective of no right or wrong really gets you to think about what would be the best choice in a world full of evil monsters, and even if you make the choice which you think no one gets hurt, sooner or later you will find a repercussion or three of what you decided to do in your situation.\n\nExploring around the games distinct envrionments is really something wonderful. The swamps of Velen are just fetid mud and composting corpses and monsters ready to drag you to their hellhole homes. Novigrad is a contrast to this, green rolling fields and tall swaying trees, pictuesque and lush. The cold hard islands of Ard Skellig are beautiful, but they house many fierce denizens and the people are just as harsh. The view from Kaer Trolde is possibly the most beautiful scene ever made onto a computer sceen.\n\nPlaying around with combat can feel a little clunky on a keyboard, horse combat takes a while to get used to. When you go on an expedition to a high spot and hit the wrong button and make Geralt jump off a cliff is rather bothersome. But all these movement skills come with time, and are easy to get adjusted too.\nRoleplaying as a witcher on a monster contract when you read up the beastiary and prepare potions, bombs and oils makes this just a wonderful experience.\nWhen you reach end game content and the specialised Witcher gear the powerful bonuses they give each talent tree are huge, which makes many other armor's obselete, but this doesn't mean much if you think the armor looks cool, like the Ursine set, but c'mon devs, griffen armor is just 'the dad bod' of armors... That aside the armors are extremely powerful and make other armor you find relatively useless, sidetracking you to find the nearest shopkeeper to battle him at gwent and then make him lose his money as you thrash him and then sell him your unwanted gear. The difficulty scale is very noticable when you are lower level, as your gear comes with less augmentations and you possess less skills and equipment, but higher tiered combat is more forgiving, excpet some of those pesky bosses!\nThe visual downgrade from E3 2014, while noticable, does not subtract from this game looking beautiful, check out my sceenshots to see how good they are! There are some mods upgrading the visuals, I am yet to try them out,  but personally they don't look to do much.\nEvery inch of this game is perfect, going home to Kaer Morhen is beautiful, seeing little clues left around from previous games is heartwarming, the devs rememeber their games and make them flow so well. When you arrive at White Orchard, see the devastation left behind in the war between Nilfgaard and the North, it really shows you how destructive it can be. The little township had changed hands, fights between natives and newcomers are all about to boil over and there is barely anything that can prevent this, the Nilfgaardians swagger around and then they get disrespected at the tavern, then they beat up the natives, it is really a spectacle to watch.\nNothing about this game made me want to stop playing, but my choices made me weep during the ending, seeing old and new friends die...\nThe perfect ending to a perfect series, this game is a must play for honestly everyone, it is probably the best game I have ever played.\nDLC hype is building","September 14, 2015","true","173.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Characters such as Geralt, Sigi (won't attempt to spell his actual name), the three Wolf School Witchers, Ciri and Yennefer are very well played. At the same time these characters' performance and involvement in the game vastly overshadows the roles of other characters such as Triss, Vernon Roche, and Iorventh(who didn't even show up).\n\nCombat has the potential to be extremely satisfying but needs some fleshing out. The combat system works perfectly for 1v1 combat. The new rolling system and movement system allows for bossfights to feel crisp and clean and is a huge improvement over Witcher 2's bossfights. Combat against multiple people can become tricky due to how many factors are out of the player's control. There is no way to precisely select the intended target and occasionally Geralt decides to automatically sheathe his sword or to enter the casual walking mode.\n\nCharacter development was completely changed from Witcher 2. I really enjoyed how the player could equip certain skills and how mutagens worked now. No longer is the player forced to get skills he does not want to get on to the following skill in the tree. At the same time, many skills were simply percentage increases in damage or toxicity. The only skills that I felt actually changed gameplay and allowed the player to innovate their playing style was the active/channeled ability modes added for witcher signs.\n\nThe environment is well portrayed and each region is portrayed uniquely. Through many regions lack any memorable landmarks resulting in the minimap becoming the only means of navigation. Throughout areas such as Velen the war between Nilfgaard and Radovid are ever present, though disappointingly no battles are ever fought in these areas despite the game's attempts to present the tenseness of imminent battle. In fact, I do not remember a single Nilgaard or Redanian fighting at any point in the game.\n\nThe loot system was what I felt needed the most change. Certain items such as Ekimmara hide are used in countless recipes yet rarely appear in the game. Others actually have a 0% spawn chance in the world such as Cherry Cordial which can only be bought from a specific merchant. Things like meteorite ingots and ore which I never found any use for can be found in random peasants homes while steel only seems to appear in chests in quest areas.\nThe leveled gear drops also became hugely irritating. It is understandable that the game wants the player to be equipped for his/her level, but this mechanic really starts to stand out when Witch Hunter Swords and Skillege swords dropped by every human opponent scale from 60 damage when you first find one to 200-350 towards the end of the game. Why bother holding onto unique weapons when 30 minutes down the line somebandit will drop a common longsword with equivalent, if not better, damage to your current swords. Armors were also disappointing, almost all armor (not including the witcher school armor) looks identical but with a different color scheme and bigger numbers.\n\nOverall, if you're most interested in some fantastic storytelling, the ability to squeeze 40-60 hours out of each playthrough, or are just a huge fan of the Witcher series this is a great game.\n\n-SPOILER ALERT-\nOne major concern I had with the storymode was how rushed everything started to feel after the Kaer Morhen scene (which in all honesty should have marked the end of the game). Instead the plot becomes incredibly linear compared to other Witcher 2 games (even more so if you consider the scale of this game) where the only thing the player really has a say in is whether or not you leave Ciri on a high note. After that things were all 'Happily Ever After', so much so that I was utterly baffled that I was still playing a Witcher game.","May 27, 2015","true","230.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/292030/","dowlphin","Dandowlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/","265 products in account","INFO: Not all, but some of the issues mentioned below have been fixed now, making it better value for money than at launch, especially when on (30%) discount.\n\nThis game is very long. If you ever claim you can play through in less than 3-digit hours, people will laugh at you for the rest of your life. You'll never hear the end of it.\nYou will mainly watch the story unfold. Traveling, buying and selling, crafting, fighting and preparing for fighting are minor parts. I'd almost say story is 50% and everything else makes up the other half. At least it can feel like that.\nThis game definitely deserves the tag "story-rich".\nIt has many similarities to The Witcher 2. Influence on unfolding story through dialogue choices seems equal - i.e. not extreme but also not minor. Also, as in Witcher 2, the outcome of dialogue choices or even the words that Geralt speaks are difficult to predict. (One time I offered some guys a drink and the next moment Geralt was throwing vulgarities at them and it ended in bloodshed.) Some dialogues can turn bad way too quickly without warning, and that's frustrating or even WTF-inducing. The example I mentioned isn't the worst one. Especially frustrating is that in several crucial situations, in this world that is so 'gray', your only dialogue choices are black and white, avoiding the reasonable and skillful middle path.\n\nWatching the subtleties of Geralt's mimic in dialogues is a delight though.\n\nI haven't encountered QTEs so far, and I think they aren't there, which is a nice change from Witcher 2. There are timed dialogue options occasionally though, and they feel properly placed.\nWitcher 3 feels less console-like in gameplay, although certain design details still have that flavor. Combat is fun, because it's a good mix of Geralt charging towards enemies and you still being able to deviate from that. (I use lots of rolls in combat, which makes the whole experience a lot more dynamic.)\n\nTechnically, the game had some unpleasant surprises. Considering that this is supposed to be a top-notch title, some design choices are quite bothersome, mostly regarding UI and controls. Certain basic shortcomings that you simply wouldn't have expected with such a high-effort title and from CDPR. Although if you have read my review of The Witcher 2, you'll understand that I'm not too surprised.\nAs Polish as the devs are, as much does the game lack the same.\nfor reference:\nmy Witcher 2 review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/20920/\nmy Witcher 1 review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/20900/\n\nCharacter movement is significantly sluggish, which could be considered realistic, but Skyrim for example manages realistic style that still behaves more swiftly. Still, the way controls work in Witcher 3 entices you to think about what you do. It's the same approach as with the fact that battles are just a minor part of the game. You are supposed to think about what situations you are getting yourself into and what your immediate next moves will be.\nSo this can be accepted as the distinct Witcher style. The devs try to stay true to the original material and honor it by shaping the game around that, and that's cool.\nAlthough sometimes you might have to walk ridiculous detours because of the way navigating and terrain-interaction is implemented.\n\nThe game lacks documentation. A manual only available on GOG, and it's extremely basic. There are many questions that might occur that are not answered in the also basic in-game tutorial glossary, and reading up on the net was often unsuccessful, too, since this game is so new. So I had to try many things by myself, and there I started to be annoyed by the inefficient loading screen design. (I and some other people get studder during cinematics, and they are also played at every savegame load.)\n\nWhen I first started the game and was looking at the main menu, I noticed the mouse cursor wasn't moving smoothly. I then realized that the game defaulted to a 30 fps cap. Very odd. Smells like console. Anything above 30, even if fluctuating, is better than locked to 30, so I changed it to 60 fps cap.\n\nI am using a GTX 760 and had to set most graphics options to medium (the other levels are low, high and ultra), and it's not ideal; especially some dialogue scenes have big framerate drops. The good thing though is that even if you set everything to medium, the game still looks beautiful. Higher settings are apparently made with highend and future hardware in mind.\n\nYou can choose to either import a Witcher 2 savegame to apply the choices you made there to the story of Witcher 3 or set those states through a dialogue in the game. Nice way of doing it. Just, again, I had to search the net for information on what "simulate Witcher 2 save" means, because the game doesn't tell you.\n\nThe game has no function to disable UI for taking beautiful screenshots or avoiding spoilers. In a beautiful game like this, there should be a configurable key for "UI-less creenshot", but instead on GOG Galaxy there isn't even a way to take screenshots at all without external tools. (A modification seems to exist now that makes it a little easier. Or maybe people actually go to the options menu and deactivate a dozen settings each time.)\nAnd press-space-to-skip appear whenever you press a key during a cutscene or dialogue. It does this even when you disable display of tutorial info. Various other UI aspects could use improvements.\n\nSome things harm immersion a bit: Time warps and cuts for things that could have been implemented in a more elegant way. Rain drops can form on the camera, which is basically fourth-wall-breaking.\n\nAutomatic sword drawing/sheathing creates a barrier between player and avatar and bothers me a lot in terms of usability, too, also regarding your (in)ability to deflect arrows from distant enemies.\nAlso annoying: Sometimes in open fist fights you're not allowed to use a defensive sign.\n\nCrafting: The materials system is very complex. You can convert so many things up and down into other materials. But alchemy is in contrast less complex since you only have to craft a potion type once and it all gets replenished during meditation. Simplification, yes, but not one I would outright call bad.\nIt's relatively realistic. You don't have to worry that you might need more and more items of the same type for higher-level stuff. If you make a sword for example, it's usually always one ingot. This helps in predicting how much material you need to carry around as reserve.\nThe economy is designed in an interesting, relatively realistic way with need-based prices and limited vendor funds.\nDetail-talk aside, it just feels special, typical Witcher-style and there's nothing wrong with it. It's nice to have a somewhat different system.\nYou will not focus on gaining XP and leveling in this game, or you will drive yourself nuts. It's such a secondary aspect of the game, and it is fun, because you can defeat significantly higher-level enemies if you are being smart. It feels very well-balanced there. Equally, you can get yourself killed easily in outleveled content if you are being reckless. If you still find it too easy, up the difficulty setting and/or be reckless.\n\nDice poker was replaced by a collectible card game. Several achievements are related to playing it well. Forget the Wild Hunt. THIS is a nightmare. CCGs are way too complex for my taste. Just like the materials system, where I decided to sell almost everything and not dismantle into resources.\n\nBut hey, if you are still wondering "Should I buy it or not?", then you don't seem to know the Witcher series. Get the first two games when they're on massive discount and if you like the things that those two have in common, you will like Witcher 3.\n\nBaw się dobrze!\n\n- Geralt of Review","May 27, 2015","true","150.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","3"

You'll find yourself easily wrapped up in the world, the stories, the characters...they truly come alive. This is an action RPG so there's a nice blend of story and fighting and how much of each is really up to you. I turn on subtitles and spacebar my way through cutscenes (not all, but many) and it still took me 74 hours of gameplay to finish this storyline of this game. There's still plenty more I could do if I wished; there's an amazing, unreal really, amount of exploration you can do.\n\nThe world feels open and the monsters and people varied. The quests and skill trees offer a huge amount of variation, and believe me when I say that every single decision you make does matter, and will change your game. Some choices change little, and some have ripples that will spread to the very end of your game.\n\nThis game goes from fun and silly to thoughtful, wistful, emotional, all at once. You can play Geralt as he is, or you can roleplay his character as you like, making decisions in your own way (heartless, ♥♥♥♥♥mongering, sensitive, lovestruck; it's up to you).\n\nAdditionally, you do not have to have played the previous games to enjoy this installment of The Witcher--I've watched a few people play some of previous games but had no experience in them myself. I jumped into Witcher 3 and loved every second of it. If there is one game in recent years I would recommend, it would hands down be this one. First game in a long long while that I've finished and thought the developers deserved every penny of the full $60 game I purchased.\n\n**NOTE** When I first began to play I too (as many negative views imply) felt the controls were wonky and downright difficult. I optimized my graphics card settings with Nvidia Geforce Experience and it was night and day. If you find the controls lacking, try changing your settings.

What a way to finish the trilogy.\nI will start by saying thankyou to CDPR for creating a game I can willingly say has made me not want to finish a video game and for allowing me to have the most fun playing a game I have come across. You honestly did some amazing work and I hope you get more awards this year to show it.\n\nThis is the only game where I have seriously not wanted to finish, purely because its the last one and the storyline is incredible. If you are still debating on whether to buy this game I highly suggest you should its one game I have been truly mesmerised by the depth of it.\n\nIt is a real shame that this game is coming to end and I like the way they finished it with a bang and made the game with true dedication, none of the half hearted ♥♥♥♥ that developers are starting to accustom to.\n\nI cannot say it enough I miss the fact there will not be another Yennefer or Triss (depending on your choice), Ciri and Geralt adventure and with that said I will be playing this over and over again in deep misery that this is the last installment to be.\n\nHope I helped and goodluck fellow adventurers.\n\nEDIT: As of about three hours later I stupidly decided to finish the story. I am upset I chose to do so as now it is finally over and there is no more. I FEEL EMPTY.\n\nP.S: I sincerely hope for you the player you choose correct. One ending is extremely sad and watching it hit me in the feels. I have never experienced that with a game until now. FOR YOUR SAKE CHOOSE CAREFULLY.","July 20, 2015","true","86.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

All those positive reviews you see on the store page do not lie. The amount of content you get in this game is worth more than its pricetag.\nPlaying the previous game is not necessary but id reccomend it to familarise yourself with the many characters, current events etc.\nThe game reflects on developers who care about their product and customers. Game was running perfect on ultra when i first bought i and after a recent update i reckon i got a 30% performance boost topped with a bunch of free content.\nAmazing gameplay, a rich story that you can alter and replayability makes this GOTY for me.\n\nOnly thing to be wary of is that this is quite a resource heavy game. An average rig may not be enough to provide the gaming experience you would like.

The visuals are fantastic, the music is generally great, I liked most of it, and the gameplay is fun without being a dumb button masher like a lot of games today. It respects the gamer's intelligence, without being too punishing.\nThe amount of meaty side quests is grand, and most of them are really fun, some more so than the main story so I would strongly recommend against skipping any.\n\nFrom the middle of the game on, the story gets you immersed like few games can. Characters are well crafted, very interesting and beautiful. Especially Ciri and Yen.\nBut generally speaking, the acting is absolutely dead on, and so is the story.\nTwo things that make a good game great.\n\nVery few aspects can be irritating.\nOne minor issue I have is with some areas constantly having loud and bad music, such as in novigrad, where you have that song with the shakira wanna-be screaming in it.\nAfter a dozen hours of that non-stop, it starts piercing your ears. I would've preferred a more soothing background music while walking around and having conversations.\nIn other areas though, it is just perfect, a mix of silence and atmospheric tunes.\n\nBottom line is, If you're a fan of RPG this is a pure classic and you will regret not playing it.","August 16, 2015","true","136.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

The reason games like The Walking Dead and The Last of Us get so much flack is because they're light on gameplay, but heavy on story. The story in Witcher 3 is great, and extremely interactive. You have a few oppurtunities to change the outcome of the game drastically. I won't go too much into the story, since I love this game for its gameplay more than anything else it offers.\n\n*Audio, it is immersive, rich and balanced. The voice acting is great, and the ambient music adds a lot of life to wherever you adventure. The audio is also dynamic, the music in Novigrad changes pace as it reaches dawn, and gives a relaxed but intimidating atmosphere. If you're an audiophile, you won't be left wanting more. This game is definitely best played with a good pair of headphones.\n\n*Combat, not as it appears at first. At first, it looks rather simple. But when you start playing, you realise you have allot of ways to fight. You can practise and become more effective using complex combinations and potions/oils, or you could mash buttons. Either way, it's up to you, and the difficulty scaling shows that. If you don't care for combat, switch to the "Just The Story!" difficulty. This makes many enemies killable in one hit. If you want a challenge, switch to "Death March!".\nThe combat is as dynamic as the audio.\n\n*Scale, it's not something I usually point out in games. This is because many large scale games are quantity over quality. However, somehow, CDProjektRed managed to give us a HUGE map, saturated with content, secrets and amazing loot. Just avoiding the beaten path and straying into the road can give you an insanely amazing experience. Wouldn't you like to travel from a cozy village to a norse/scottish-esque collection of isles floating on ice cold water? Make sure you never take the road, because I garuantee, you'll venture into at least 50 caves/dungeons on the way. I've played almost 200 hours, and I'm not even a quarter through the content in this game.\n\n*Graphics, something people mention when a game isn't a game, but a tech demo to show off how powerful your rig is. But in this case, the graphics hand Witcher 3 a big hand. I'm sure Witcher 3 would still be great with a more cartoonish style, but the realism in Witcher 3 does a great job of making the world really feel alive. The city of Novigrad is so convincing. And I, honestly, would love to live there. The children running around playing, the brawls in the alleys, the merchants and huge crowds, and the drunks that come out at night, all make this city feel REAL.\n\n*Gameplay in general, is actually pretty solid. You'd expect such a huge RPG would be a bit loose on it's hinges, and for the game to be boring after you "finish" the main story, but there is literally chance for you to spend THOUSANDS of hours on the amount of content in this game, if you take your time and enjoy the atmosphere. None of the side quests are boring, and even the most mundane kind of side quests, like "go here, kill that", are fun in witcher 3. Can't say the same about any other current RPGs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCons?\n\n\nThere are none. I've played this for almost 200 hours, i'm not bored, and I've yet to find a single flaw in this game.","October 30, 2015","true","242.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alwarren/recommended/292030/","Alwarren","Alwarren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alwarren/","314 products in account","After about 20+ hours in the game, I can wholeheartedly say it is the best witcher game so far, and a great game all around. Graphics is great (give me a break with all that downgrade stuff, yeah the E3 trailer looked better, so what), smooth, and the game plays like a charm.\n\nThings I like:\n\n1. Large, organic world. The world feels real, and looks absolutely gorgeous. Nothing seems out of place, roads make sense, villages are integrated into the landscape. It looks and feels believable.\n\n2. Combat is challenging but not impossible. I am playing on "Blood and Bones" difficulty. It gives you a sense of danger, making it exhilarating to enter a stretch of dark forest knowing that there are things that could kill you easily, making winning a fight even more rewarding. It can cause some frustration sometimes, though.\n\n3. Excellent voice acting, music, and graphics.\n\n4. The folklore. There is a very rich background of lore surrounding the world, things are explained and make sense, adding to the believability of the game.\n\nThings I don't like so much:\n\n1. The density and location of random monster encounters. There are way too many of them, and they are in illogical places, meaning directly next to a travelled road or a settlement. More than once, you can see drowners lurking directly under a cliff of a village, or a nest of endregas directly next to the road. There is also little variety in these monsters - wolves, wild dogs, drowners, and an occasional nekker or bandit is what you find. If you see a bear and are below level 6, run.\n\n2. The main storyline is 90% bloat. While I like it so far, and a lot of the side quests you have to do are really really good, the standard scheme is always: Go place, talk to someone that has information, which he/she will only divulge with if you do them a favor. It's no surprise the game's main storyline supposedly runs for 30+ hours, because it has so much sidetracking that it practically consists of said 90% sidequesting.\n\n3. Side quests, witcher contracts, and random stuff is all very nicely done. The times of "bring me six drowner brains" are gone, every side quest tries to tell a story, some small, some larger. However, more than often I have felt that it was just a bit too much. Example: I am supposed to escort someone from A to B. Along the way, all of a sudden we get attacked by wraiths. Kill all wraith, repeat three times. It would have been sufficient if there was one or at most two encounters. At the third, it just gets annoying.\n\nIn general, though, I recommend this game. It's one of the best to come out this years, and certainly one of the best RPG's ever. The flaws I mentioned can be annoying but are generally forgiveable. I would put it on the same level as Skyrim, the only thing that Skyrim has going for it is that you have more different roles - obviously, here you are restricted to playing the witcher. But this limitation also means that there is nothing in the game that you cannot do - there is no thieves guild quest package you'll never see if you don't play a thief, for example.\n\n9 out of 10 points.","May 25, 2015","true","90.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Good luck finding a game that does that.\nWeapon, gear and loot system which everyone that plays RPG adores, and to top it all off it is a BEAUTIFUL MASSIVE OPEN WORLD!\n\nI was amazed when I saw the smallest attention to detail in this game, and consdering all of that it performs REALLY well!! Considering your PC is on par with the PS4 console you could easily pull off 1080p @ custom settings that will look even better than the PS4 version, and believe me I've played both, my budget gaming laptop destroys the PS4 version in terms of looks and performance! I am being quiet about my main PC as it wipes the floor with it. There are no performance issue with the game, this is a PC VERSION and not some cheap lousy port.\n\nThe story was amazeballs too, not mediocre and shallow like Fallout 4 and hell, it's longer but that may vary because I did not want to rush this game, that's how enjoyable it was!\n\nCD Projekt RED also releases periodic DLCs, and its not just some frigging skin for your sword.

I won't go into too many details because I know many have already covered it. Every single quest is very unique and believe me you won't run out of things to do for at least 100 hours.

Even the side quests make you want to know what happens next in contrary to side quests in other RPG's where they are just a bore but you have to do them for leveling or something. My  mom  loves to watch me play because of the story, she says it's so well written that she prefers watching me play this instead of watching a TV series.\n\n-Combat is by my opinion close to flawless for a medieval third-person RPG. There are so many ways to defeat your opponents and it is extremely fun but yet so diverse and skill-based, esspecialy on higher difficulties, and maintainsto provide a challenge.\n\n-The graphics are  beautiful  .Full stop.\n\n-The world itself is very detailed and actually make you feel like it is alive. It makes you feel like you are in a real dark fantasty world. Killing monsters in overrun villages makes the people repopulate the village allowing you access to blacksmiths/armoreurs/merchants etc.\n\n-Taking Witcher contracts actually requires preparation (assuming you are the appropriate level). For instance, I tried killing a level 6 monster when I was level 3. I tried to killed it but I was demolished. I loaded a save game and read the info in the beastiary log for that certain monster and prepared everything that I needed to kill the monster. It actually worked but it was still a very tough battle. It makes you feel like you are a  REAL WITCHER  .\n\n-I never RP'ed like this in my entire life. For a guy who read a few Witcher books, making it visual and playable, is like a dream come true. Though The Witcher 1 and 2 were amazing for their time this game just stands out.\n\n-I haven't finished the game but I have so many hours on it because both my dad and I are playing on different save games. Even though he doesn't speak English well he enjoys the game but I still have to translate some stuff to him. He says this game brings him a lot of joy because he works all day and when he comes back late at night he can't wait to play.\n\nConclusion:  I r8 8/8 m8 it is gr8.","July 27, 2015","true","544.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

The Witcher 2 was a step in the right direction, but it wasn't quite there. I only got about three quarters of the way through it. To say that this game hit the nail right on the head is an understatement.\n\nFirstly, the combat is a strong suit. It's very skill-based - when you're a lower level, you can take on higher leveled enemies if you're good enough. The game forces you to use everything at your disposal effectively in unison to take down enemies. Witcher contracts are some of the most fun experiences I've had in any game. Each one leads into a completely unique opponent.. You will have to learn what type of enemy you're going against, and how to fight it.\n\nThe open world is absolutely massive. Each plane has its own people with a completely different strife that you can observe. The long travels you sometimes have to do are complimented by the utterly beautiful soundtrack. The story writing for each braching side quest, and main story is spot on - complimented by the great voice acting and spectacular charaters. The amount that there is to do rivals even with Skyrim. It is easily 200+ hours long to complete everything. The main story will come to a close with many different endings and character outcomes.\n\nThe tremendous amount of effort put into this game paid off, making a serious candidate for game of the year. It will be hard for Fallout 4 to beat this.\n10/10 Geralt really hates portals","June 21, 2015","true","129.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Research and attention to detail are the first two words that come into my mind, as all quests, characters, environments, monsters, lore, stories....everything is so interesting, diversified and captivating, pushing the player to discover and explore for countless hours.\n\nI played 170 hours straight for like two months in a row, nearly every day of the week, and without doing boring grinding tasks or fetching some stupid object from A to B. In this game you hunt an incredible amount of different monsters, search for treasures, solve mysteries, craft armors and weapons, delve into polytics and above all, make choices that really matter, while trying to save the world and all the people you care most about.\nAll this at your personal pace, you are not forced to do anything if you still don't want to, you can roam around the ENORMOUS game map searching for new adventures and epic loot; the writing and characterization are so good that some secondary quests are at the main quest's same level, if not even better.\n\nGraphics and sound/music are top notch level, atmosphere and beauty come out of every little piece of this game, though optimization could have been better, with new patches worsening global framerate or temporarily disabling secondary functions like achievements.\nThe Witcher 3 is a big step forward compared to the second chapter also from a gameplay and user interface point of view. Combat is more rich and fluid, now you can enjoy sword fighting like never before, still using Signs ("magic powers") to eventually complement your style, all this in a fast and cohesive way. Conversely, I did not like the crossbow implementation and never really used it at all.\n\nWhat to say more? I could speak for ages about this game, but I will only add that if you played the first two Witchers, you can't avoid playing this one, it is the best of the trilogy. If you never played one of these games, please make yourself a favor, buy it, as The Witcher 3 is one of the best action rpgs ever made, if not even the best!\n\nThis is the first time the quality of a game convinces me to buy its Season Pass, I already played the first expansion and can't wait to play the second one next year. CD Projekt scored big, actually this is the only game developer I would buy from with my eyes completely closed!

In my mind Witcher 3 bears comparison against any open world game, even GTA.\n\nAs odd of a comparison as that is, the world of Witcher 3 makes me realize how lazily GTA 5 was done (with an incredibly larger amount of resources and personnel than CD Project, they accomplished much less) and it makes the elder scrolls series look like a b****.\n\nThis game is gritty and real too, doing the best job in gaming history of confronting complex issues of racism, sexism, hegemony, the corruption of power, etc etc., and you will want to punch lots random A-holes in the face for the racist ♥♥♥ comments they hurdle at you in the streets routinely (calm down geralt, take a deep breath: they're not worth it).\n\nHell, this game blows EVERYTHING out of the water. Even the hype did not do this game justice, and that is something i thought i would never say about a AAA title. I still haven't finished it, yet I've already played it even more than I played skyrim.\n\nEvery step in this franchise has just been better and better than the last but with Wild Hunt they really outdid themselves. No repetitive/boring quests here either, this game has an unbelievable amount of content with an insane level of quality in each and every little thing.\n\nYou should buy it even if it's not on sale, and even if you're scared of monsters (you can just ignore those witcher contracts) although you should not buy it if you like the sun or have ambitions in life (besides monster slaying).","June 26, 2015","true","499.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeuscm/recommended/292030/","zeuscm","Zeus_CM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeuscm/","298 products in account","The most anticipated RPG of the year! Witcher 3 The Wild hunt concludes the award-winning studio CD PROJECT RED's trilogy about the witcher Geralt of Rivia. This is theirs the most ambitious title with which they wanted to show high quality Witcher 2 storytelling in a much bigger open world format. Many were skeptical that they will succeed in doing so. Was it worth the wait? Did CDPR succeed in their ambition?\n\nThe Story\nThe world is in chaos. Several kingdoms are fighting for supremacy, but none of them are aware that "winter" is coming. Everyone is on the edge, villages are burning and monsters are behind every dark corner. The story follows witcher Geralt of Rivia as he is desperately trying to find Ciri, a royal daughter, which he himself raised as his own, which disappeared when the Wild Hunt attacked their home. The Wild Hunt are sinister elves from another dimension trying to take over this world as they destroyed their own. To do that they need Ciri, which has a special power that will allow them to completely transcend to this world. In order to find Ciri and defeat the Wild Hunt, Geralt must gather his old friends, but one does not simply do that, as they have problems of their own. For the first time you encounter your first love, Yennefer, which you forgot about long ago as you suffered from amnesia. Now that your memory is back, do you stay faithful to your new valentine sorceress Triss or do you go back to your old love of your life? That is just one of the many decisions you will have to make throughout the game.\n\nGameplay\nWitcher 3 is a huge world filled with things to explore, full of secrets, hidden dungeons and many dangers. By completing side-quests and the main story you will get 100 hours of story rich gameplay at a minimum, and to explore the whole world add at least 50 more. Since the story is not linear and in order to experience all possible endings and romantic conclusions add another 100 or so.\nWhat impressed me the most in this game is the amazing quality and quantity of the side quests. Almost every side quest is unique with its own short story. Some seemingly simple tasks can get very complicated fast as you uncover the story behind it. Moral dilemmas and critical decisions you will have to make are present in almost all quests. Many of those side quests directly affect the main story so it is very important to do them all for the best story experience.\nThe combat system is an upgraded version of the one in Witcher 2, with a greater emphasis on the action and combination of spells, potions and bombs. Skill leveling is better organized and much easier to understand. It is split in 3 categories. Swordsmanship, magic (signs) and alchemy (potions and bombs). There is also a fourth neutral category with useful effects for any skill tree.\nEven though it is easier to combine multiple skill trees, for those that like hybrid builds, CDPR didn't follow through with that idea entirely, because of the mutagen system. Mutagens are substances which are dropped by monsters that are used for enhancing one's stats. Every mutagen can has a type that is linked to a specific skill tree. Using only one type of mutagen (e.g. blue mutagens) and leveling only one skill tree (e.g. signs) it will grant you the strongest possible stat increase. Because of that fact pure builds are the strongest while hybrid build are at the great disadvantage, which is a shame.\nOne build I looked forward the most since Witcher 2 is the pure alchemy build. Using powerful bombs and enhanced potions was something I didn't try before. To my sorrow bad UI design made that impossible. Since you can only put 2 bombs/potions on the quick bar you need to constantly pause the game, open your inventory and put new bombs on the bar in order to use them. Shame. However, fighting with swords and spells is better than ever in trilogy so at least that made me happy.\n\nOne of the best things in the game, that doesn't have anything to do with story or anything, is the Gwent. One of the best minigames I've ever played in any game. It is seemingly simple card game, where you build deck and collect cards throughout the world like in Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh. Gwent is so addicting and popular that there are even real life card available to purchase.\n\nArtistic impression\nSoundtrack is something special to me, which in combination with beautiful graphics, really expresses the rawness and brutality of the beautiful Witcher world. Voice acting is heterogeneous and top quality, as it is its quantity. You will rarely encounter the Skyrim situation where you have a feeling there were only a handful of actors working on the game. Character animations are the best I've seen since L.A. Noire. The only thing I hated is CDPR using terrible nVidia Hairworks that doesn't run well even on nVidia graphic cards. Why not use much better AMD TressFX which works well on both AMD and nVidia cards...?\n\nBugs and patches\nThe game of this size is prone to bugs. Some quests can get stuck and in order to proceed you need to reload, so it is advised to save often. In rare cases that doesn't help though. Luckily, CDPR fixes bugs very swiftly and releases bug and performance fixing patches every now and then for all platforms. Free DLC every other week is just an added bonus.\n\nConclusion\nCombat system is very satisfying except the alchemy thing I mentioned and game not supporting hybrid builds well. Graphics are top-notch and you can disable horrible nVidia HairWorks and you will not miss it. In my option hair looks better without it, although monster hair is glorious in some cases with it on. The fact that Geralt's beard grows in real time is a proof of the quality and details CDPR put in this game. Soundtrack is extremely well fitting which in combination with realistic presentation of wind blowing, lightning system and weather effects, creates a very unique atmosphere, it truly brings the game to life. Non-linear story and high replay value make this game a 'required reading' for all gamers!","August 21, 2015","true","237.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

That's what i can summaries in simple sentence.\n\n\ntldr version review (scroll for deeper version):\n\n[+]\n- Amazing variety of quests\n- Deep sidequest content\n- A lot of surprise element in main/sidequests\n- A lot of variety in story/backstory of world/npcs/monsters\n- Multiple solutions on how quest can be approached -high value in replayability\n- Cutscenes was done really well - made the game 'alive'\n- Sword fighting is really engaging and fun. Higher difficulties are recommended\n- The card game gwent is simple but amazing\n\n[-]\n- Minus main characters, the game somewhat lack variety in 'world' npcs. so many lookalike.\n- Game world loading need improvement - some merchant/blacksmith/npcs in some part of location required player to meditate before them appear\n- Roach - the horse, need a big tweak\n- After acquire the witcher weapons/armor, others type of weapons/armor pretty much can be discarded without prejudices...plus thus other armor was fugly...\n- Couple of distraction activity like treasure hunt/Point of Interest/Undiscovered Location bug needed patch\n- Skellige lack of in land distraction type contents\n- Smuggler's Cache was too much/dull/drag to collect\n- Inventory management and sorting need to be rectified. Too cluttered/Not sorted as it’s should be.\n\n\nFull version review:\n\nWitcher 3 is a game changer, it improve by miles from previous game. The stories are no more focus on political garbage, but now focus on Witcher stuffs. The storytelling has matured a lot. More story about the world they currently live. What and why it got into current state. The Story about it’s current inhabitants whether it’s human or monsters, both are defined in this game. The cutscenes bring the game alive even more.\n\nThere are a lot of activities for players to enjoy. Even the sidequests are deep and flesh out. There’s a lot of quest that might be long with deep storytelling or even as short as couple of interactive dialog that bring smile to your face. The game has been built with ‘easing’ the entry of newcomers in mind. Story element of previous game is not really that important if you want to venture into this one. A lot of it can and will be explained within this game..\n\nIt's beautiful looking game with a strategic and fast/fluid combat mechanics. It's hard at first but rewarding along the journey. The world is vast with contents and now it’s yours to explore. The outcome of decision you make along the way may or may not favourable, to you or the people you interact with. The results may appear right away or not at all until hours of hours of gameplay.\n\nYou choose what you like, there's no definitive right or wrong. Most of the time, it's just a lesser of two evils ..... it's your choice.\n\n"In Witcher's world, there's no right or wrong, only decisions and consequences."","June 15, 2015","true","203.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I've never come across a game as stunningly beautiful as this one. The rain looks realistic, the water is smooth and flows as it should. The sunlight shines through the leaves and leaves something for other game engines to look into. There's even mod support, for a richer experience. I will touch on that later in this review.\n\nGAMEPLAY Let's talk about combot, so the way your character is handled in this game, is fairly nice. It plays like any RPG/MMO should. Yes this game is singleplayer only, but the character movements remind me of another game, like TERA. The combat is smooth, your counterattacks are swift and swordplay is not clunky. The developers really put a lot of time into how this game plays, and they did a damn fine job.\n\nSTORY This is a very story rich game, I find myself staring at my screem for hours, listening to the characters talk. The conversations are deep, and aren't meaningless. You squeeze every bit of information you need out of each character, when it's needed. You're able to choose how your character is treated, from a moral standpoint. But the thing is, no matter how you treat others, you're still going to suffer in the end. Someone may die, someone may get hurt. There is a good way to end a quest and a bad one, and it seems that almost all quests end in both ways. I haven't even scraped the surface of this game's story yet, as I'm writing this I only have around 5 hours of play time.\n\nMOD SUPPORT Ahh, last but not least eh? This game features brilliant mod support, of course it's not quite like Skyrim, but you don't expect that from a game like this, you expect a story. and that's what you're given. The mods that I've come across were all for visual aid, from lighting improvements, to weather changes and fixes. You can make the graphics look "true to life" if you try hard enough, and have a system that can handle it!\n\nAll in all, I'd say this game is a must buy! The story is wonderful, the gameplay is smooth, and the graphics are beautiful! This is a very solid game, and I'm proud to have it in my collection.","December 31, 2015","true","14.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","4"

I'm truly relieved as I feared the PC will run like the potatoes. Discard any concerns you have about graphic downgrade, the game is stunningly beautiful and with a GTX 980 I'm running a solid 60 FPS at 1080p, granted the hairworks hit the frame rates down to 59, but it's not really a game changer. The game is well optimized and run great considering how big the world is and the landscape, lightning and faces details are gorgeous. As for the gameplay, it's head and shoulders above Witcher 2, very pleased especially about how smooth the combat is, and the story is so damn immersive that I have to cut this review short and get back to it. So many things to do in a truly grandiose open world grander than anything you've seen before.\n\nIt's a monumental achievement of staggeringly aching beauty, the Witcher III stands proudly as the greatest video game of all time, regardless of genre. Geralt's final, epic ride, is the high water-mark by which all future games will be judged and found lacking. Indeed, it's only disadvantage is that it completely ruins every other title on the market right now by nailing every single aspect of game design with almost supernatural clarity and perfection. If you play one video game in your life, make sure it's this one.","October 13, 2015","true","328.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ifiamalone/recommended/292030/","ifiamalone","dinosaur°","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ifiamalone/","48 products in account","The Witcher 3: WIld Hunt is an Open World RPG game, created by CD Projekt Red and published by Bandai Namco Games (Australia). This instalment is a sequel to 2 previous games. Wild Hunt sets after the Assassins of Kings. You are playing as Geralt of Rivia, he finally restored his memory after the Assassins of Kings event, he is looking for his adopted daughter, Cirilla or Ciri for short. The story of the game is really long, that doesn't mean the game is repetitive and bland. It gets interesting during the story because of the choices you've made, it affects the characters and environment. There are some side quests, Witcher contracts and treasure quests included. The previous 2 games, it was nearly an open world but with limited space. This instalment, it blew my mind because I really wanted to explore the whole universe of Northern Kingdoms, it's like going to the Disney Land for the first time. The atmosphere and the landscape, it's just amazing and lively. Wild Hunt's combat system has been tweaked and revamped as well. The previous 2 games, using signs weren't that useful, on Wild Hunt, it is really useful and dodges aren't that bad. I wish that dodge system was limited with stamina, so the combat would be more fun and tactical. The crafting system is deep and satisfied. I love the armor sets and weapons as well. The previous 2 games, there was a mini-game called dice poker and now they made it something interesting and different called "Gwent". It's a card game(similar concept of Hearthstone) and suprisingly works well.\n\n+ Pros +Characters are amazingly well done and developed throughout the story (also the voice acting as well)\n+Story is darker with complex\n+Side Quests and Witcher Contracts are surpisingly interesting\n+Combat System tweaked and revamped\n+Crafting System\n+Graphics\n+Controls are tight (controller is recommended, depending on how you play)\n+Atmosphere are lively\n+Musical Scores are top notch\n\n- Cons - Few glitches (Like not really bad glitches, unlike other games)\n\nIn this review, the game lived up its expectations. I highly or just "Shut up and take my money" recommended game, like really. The combat, the story as it progresses, the satisfied crafting system, lively atmosphere, the graphics, this game has everything. It's such a grand journey for me because the characters, the story of the game. It's sad to see this game will be the final journey. The glitches aren't bad and laughable. Personally, this is my favourite narrative story of all time. I had a great time with this game and I can't wait to buy Heart of Stone and Blood and Wine expansions to do another playthrough.","May 11","true","153.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

True, its world isn't as open as Skyrim's, but the characters are far more developed and real. I always found Bethesda NPCs a bit on the two-dimensional side.\n\nIt may not have as many explorable areas as Dragon Age Inquisition but even the side-quests (and there are many) are (almost) always interesting, have a unique backstory and refrain from DA:I's generic "collect x of y" or "walk from A to B to C" approach.\n\nThe graphics are awesome and the love for detail is a joy to behold. Pack on top of that a really customer instead of revenue oriented developer (many DLCs are for free, where do you see that today in big high quality games) and you have - in my opinion - a game worth every single cent you spent for it, even at full price (which I don't regret paying for it).\n\nThere are a few clouds on that bright sky too, of course. The things that bugs me most are the controls whcih seem to lag just long enough to be a bit annoying and the camera which tends to go to unfortunate angles during combat. That leads to you not being able to see your enemy from time to time until you move your character. And while the music is very good, the tracks are very short, so after 100+ hrs there is a certain repetition that might annoy a few people.\n\nThose are minor gripes though, as are the few bugs I encountered. They do nothing to lessen my enthusiam for and enjoyment of this game.\n\nA month ago I'd say if you ever play one RPG franchise in your life, play the Mass Effect Trilogy. I would qualify that now and say if you're into fantasy RPGs play The Witcher 3. You can deepen your experience and immersion if you played 1 and 2 and even further if you read the books, but even if you didn't this is a great game.\n\nCD Project has reached a status for me that Bioware has almost lost: I'd buy any RPG game from them immediately at release at this point.","October 31, 2015","true","396.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","5"

So it only makes sense that as developers we apply the same principle to everything we do here in CD PROJECT RED.”\n\nStarted the Witcher series from the Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. At the first glance, I DO NOT like it. What I remember from the first try of the witcher 2 is that Geralt is a strong dandy good with his swords, sleeping with bunch of women, while not being detected by his lover of yores. Apart from some of the cool-looking graphics and scenery, the bloody killing scenes in the shi thole Flotsam and Loc Muinne, the awkward combat with Letho of Gulet and the kayran, the clueless sex scenes with who res in the Inn make me feel nasty. At some point deeper in my mind, this game is a blueprint with high potential aiming to rise to the best RPG this world has ever fuc king seen, yet still needs big, substantial improvements.\n\nWell that just makes it so sweet to say after the release of the Wild Hunt, for this game is the most brilliant masterpiece I have ever played. The witcher 3, learnt from the lessons of both the witcher 1 and 2, combining the two worlds in its predecessors and adding new regions, generates an open-world game map with massive areas to explore. HUGE as it is, there are 4 main open worlds in the Wild Hunt, with Velen—No Man’s Land, The Free City of Novigrad, Skellige and Kaer Morhen respectively. If you haven’t got an idea how big the game is, each individual open world is bigger than GTA V Los Santos and there are thousands of small quests or stuff to do combined in the open world. Quite noticeably, those small things to explore, do not count as redundant parts of the game. Even a small bandit camp you came across may contain another small quests that may lead you to a letter written with mid-century English and a treasure box that you need to use your Witcher sense to claim with that letter you’ve found. You may meet your old friends in the witcher 1 and 2 in a common witcher contract; depending on the choices you made, these characters may end up in different consequences which makes real-life perfect sense. You may rescue a merchant in need from a monster nests who later on will be willing to provide cheap and fabulous witcher gears to you. Multiple regions of the world, a great number of side quests and witcher contracts, over 100 different kinds of enemies you will encounter…all of which lead you to an adult fantasy you will never forget.\n\nThe Witcher is about choices and consequences, not about good, or evil. That is why the choices you make during the game has so much impact on both the immediate and the long future. Countless choices you make during the game, from the attitude you treat your daughter Ciri (which may leads to different final endings), to a small witcher contract pay that might not satisfy you, creates a strong sense of identification between the player and the protagonist. For a long time after I finished the Witcher, I imagined that I was playing as Geralt of Rivia, the butcher of Blaviken, fighting for the ones I love. The plot and the pace the story was so well-written that I lost the sense of time when I was playing it. Because every single NPC in the game is a vivacious character, choices you made make so much sense in the aftermath of the world. Even small storylines you encounter during the game provide a later-time consequences. You may come across an old woman cursing the heredities who ruined the pyres they pray on. Sometime after you punished those punks, the villagers would go back to the repaired pyres to pray. You may also choose to betray a group of Scoitel unit who made a living on ambushing the military necessities of the Redania Company. Sometime later, the captain of the group will come to you, insulting you and threatens to kill you……\n\nYou think the witcher is just about killing monsters? Dead wrong. As a witcher holding the neutrality principle, you got to see numerous thought-provoking phenomenon even mimicking the world we live in today. Wise choice of the writer to create a protagonist, not meddling or interfering with most of the events around you, just sitting beside as an audience, perceiving the matters that happens around you. After banishing, killing all the sorcerer and sorceresses, new non-humans get hanged and killed. “People never stop finding excuses for themselves, what they want to find is a scapegoat.” The time when you first reach Novigrad, you will see a she-elf being rudely questioned by some humans. Once you interfere with them, you got no polite appreciation (no matter what choices you make). Instead, the elf blamed you for not letting her own to resolve the matter. The best choice of this small activity turns out to be not interfering, just watching them to solve the problem by themselves! The game does not encourage heroism as demonstrated in a lot of other games. It’s a game that prompts bystander views. The comprehension of Hamlet varies from reader to reader. Your choices, therefore, greatly manifests your own values and you know what, the world that the story ends is the world that you create by yourself.\n\nAnd that is why I highly recommend this fabulous adult fairytale to all of you, “The Witcher”. As a gamer, this game helps me GROW UP. Not a lot of games actually does that. With only 59.99 dollars to spend, the game also offers 16 free DLCs and the paid DLC “Heart of Stone” is already up on shelf that creates some more fascinating tales of the White Wolf. If you haven’t bought the game yet, that would be an absolute ♥♥♥♥ing pity. Once you were in for the path of destiny with your steel and silver swords, you will never forget your once-in-a-life role-playing as Geralt of Rivia.\n\n----------------“If I’m to choose one evil to another, I’d rather not choose at all. ”","December 20, 2015","true","586.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Blood textures and other "wet" textures do look plastic as ♥♥♥♥ tho. On the other hand, character models are GORGEOUS; especially Geralt. Which is nice. So far (1.5 h in) no boobs. Will return to that topic again when relevant. Dat ♥♥♥ tho.\n\nAs to game play: The combat mechanics are solid, but the movement mechanics can be a bit TOO fluid at times, with stairs being the bane of my existence. I'm especially fond of the fact that the signs (and expendable weapons such as grenades) have been beautifully integrated in a quick-select menu. Gone are the days of the witcher 1.\n\nAs to the game's actual performance... there's never any lag, no loading screens, and the movement between indoors and outdoors is as smooth as could be. Good job so far, CD projekt.\n\nOne thing to note, though; Introduction is a BIT long. felt like I had to watch about 20 minutes of cutscene; although this was all rendered in the engine, and looked pretty damn good, still. And 'dat ♥♥♥. The witcher living up to it's name in the... ehem.. lower regions? Anyway.

Don't go into it expecting a fast paced action rpg. This game is slow, but that pace is very intentional. It's the closest games have come to the writing level of books. Every character is so well written. Not only that but so many small actions have constantly growing consequences, hence the slow pace. It feels like a living, breathing world. The first act can drag a bit, but it's worth it to stick with it, because that drag is building a series of decisions that come back to haunt you toward the end. There's no good or evil, just consequences. Everyone has compelling motives, even the wild hunt. I've never had such an understanding and sense of duty when facing a final boss in a video game. This is, without a doubt, the best open world rpg of all time, and quite possibly the best epic told in video games. The characters are so endearing and interesting. Nothing is ever as it seems, and it creates a sense of ownership over your decisions. I never reloaded a save in order to keep a character alive or get some different outcome. Just buy it and play it. CD projeckt red is also an incredible developer, and, if anything, that should be rewarded with financial success. My favorite game of all time. Don't go in with preconceived notions of what an rpg is, or an action game, or a story based game. Understand the unparalleled scope and scale of this game, with a consistent high quality all around.\nNow onto the dlc... I have never played a game story with this much depth, ever. Hearts of Stone could easily be analyzed like a classic novel. The depth and complexity of the themes it tackles are unparalleled in games. Then they throw in the best boss fights of the game, and new combat upgrades, and this little ten dollar expansion puts most fifty dollar ones to shame. That's all I will say without spoilers. If you own the witcher 3, Hearts of Stone is a must buy.\nSPOILERS FOR HEARTS OF STONE\nIn classic Witcher fashion there are three acts to HoS. The first, the heist, establishes the wealth and rivalries between the wealthy novigradian families. The second is a wedding, showing the unity and possible financial troubles of two of these novigrad families, and then the final act deconstructs the marriage of Olgierd and his wife. The emotional journey this creates allows the writers to explore the theme of love in a way no other came can come close to. what other game, for an entire third, sends you to a wedding with no combat, and yet it becomes the most memorable part of the game. Finally, after helping Iris let go of her past by taking the rose (or not, you monster,) you confront Gaunter O' Dimm and have the option to also release Olgierd from the guilt of his past. In classic literature, specifically the heroes journey, the hero travels to hell, usually through a cave, to confront their fears and come out prepared for the final confrontation. Guess what the only way to get to the devil in order to free a mans soul is through? You guessed it, a cave. Gaunter has such depth he nearly overshadows Eredin. He mimicks the temptations of the devil to Christ in the wilderness, promising bread, armor (protection), and weapons (power). He then proceeds to claim that his bread will never run out (bread of life) and drink that will never run out (living water, or in this case vodka). He mirrors Christ until you realize it's a mockery, and he really is the devil. Geralt is able to take Olgierds debt, and cancel it in order to free his soul. The Witcher is all about reimagining famous tales, and CD Projeckt Red clearly couldn't help themselves. Finally at the end (if you save Olgierd) Geralt recieves Iris. As he takes it from Olgierds hand he cuts Olgierd. Olgierds wife, Iris, was plucked by the divorce rose given to her, and at the end of HoS Olgierd is cut by the sword Iris. There is so much depth that could easily go unoticed. The writing on display is unparalleled in games.","December 25, 2015","true","161.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/federicogonzaga/recommended/292030/","federicogonzaga","Earl of Trollbridge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/federicogonzaga/","624 products in account","PS: I beat this game on a different platform. Do not mind the meagre play time please :)\n\nEarlier today I was wathcing V-sauce's video of "Why Do We Play Games?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5jDspIC4hY . In this video, the speaker, Michael said that life is a game because everyone affects each other. Also, we will most likely experience the outcome of the choices we make in the future instead of right after we make them. Of course I am not here to talk about life. I am in no position to explain what life is as life is such a vague and cosmic concept. This game, however, offers me to live the life of Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer of an enchanted world, to the greatest extend.\n\nThis game feels so real. I beat this game earlier today and was absolutely stunned. First of all, Geralt feels so real. Geralt is not some random guy. He is the butcher of Blaviken, a "man" who murdered half of the town of White Orchard and dragged the elderman's body with a horse all the way to Novigrad. However I do not think Geralt as a bad person. He is a professional monster slayer who knows what kind of oil and potion fits his goal. He sometimes refuses payment because he thinks the payer needs it more. He loves women and make sexual jokes with his partners. He is also a great father who knows how to cheer Ciri up whenever she is upset and trusts her frever. Secondly, other characters feel really as well. Ciri is brave and sometimes stubborn, Yennifer strong-welled and sophisticated, Triss passionate and lively, Dilkstra cunning and dangerous, Roche patriotic and trustworthy, Dandelion vain and funny, the Bloody Baron grumpy and remorseful, etc. I remember their names so well because to me it feels as if they are all real people with a life of their own. I played The Order 1886 and loved it but it could not be compared with this game. That game failed in constructing characters and I barely knew anything else other than me being a soldier of the order. Now I barely remember anything about that game but I can still recall most of the things took place in the first and second Witcher game.\n\nEveryone's fate intertwines. I was literally stunned by the fact that some side quests and witcher contracts only make sense if you follow the main storyline. In the end when you figure everything out during a bathroom break and you are like "dude this game though!" Geralt's choices shape the entire political landscapte of the world he lived in. You could side with some factions and be a machiavellian or choose to stay out of everything. Or you can just be a idealist like me. I didn't side with anyone in particular and participated in a lot of political manuveurs and did what I believed was the right thing to do.\n\n♥♥♥♥ happens. I did some stupid things I regretted in this game just like I did in my life. I killed Keira Metz by accident. When I learnt that she could fall in love with a great comrade of mine, I felt so bad that I almost started a new game. I chose to let the prison guards torcher Triss to make the plot more deceiful but when Triss screamed I literally wanted to blow the cover, kill everyone to save her. I felt even worse when the little girl I yelled at in the early stage of the game showed up at last and helped me. Other than the ultra realism, this game also did a great job in telling you that sometimes you just have to live with the choices you make. Deal iwith it. Period. Some of these choices will benefit or backfire you at last for some people's fate, especially Ciri's, is tied with what Geralt choose to do. A wrong move can kill a lot of people. And trust me, you don't want to kill Ciri. I got a good ending. When I watched the "bad" ending with Ciri died I felt kind of depressed. ♥♥♥♥ that ending man. I knew Geralt would do anything for her, so he did.\n\nThis game is the best one I've played in a while. 10/10 would play again.\n\nEdit: The face he Geralt had when he thought Ciri was dead, the way Geralt cheered Ciri up, and how Ciri remembered these things really make me cry.\n\nEdit 2: I beat this game on PS4 instead of on PC so I cannot make sufficient arguement on the graphics on PC. I heard they are much better than on PS4.","June 3, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I mean it's got 'Wild Hunt' in it's name. That says everything!\n\nIn The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you play as returning protagonist, Geralt of Rivia. A witcher who now seeks to move on in his life and continues his saga, going back home to Kaer Morhen. Settling in and finding peace wasn't the hard part. Facing a group of icy horsemen called the Wild Hunt willing to end his life while pursuing the emperor's runaway daughter is.\n\nI don't even know where to start. The seamless and continuous world of Novigrad's cities, to the dangerous countrysides of Velen; also known as 'No Man's Land'. The seemingly endless number of quests to do, chasing down Witcher contracts and killing griffons, Ghouls, and other beasts that await your bloody death. Not to mention the amount of things to discover and explore when you're just roaming around on your horse, which I've found doing more than fast travelling, as this fantastical realm is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.\n\nChoices. It's a word that some games define it very well, like BioWare's Mass Effect and Dragon Age IPs. You get to choose what your character does, where they go, and so forth. Every choices makes a different in the world that affects someone. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has implemented this in an extraordinary way. Think about what would happen if you saved the lives of bandits in their camp, originally to have you killed. Will they continue raiding other nearby villages? Or will they be inevitably caught in their demise, killed by a feral beast that lurks around their camp? Every single one of your decisions affects something in this world. Whatever happens on the road is as you see, and it's not even scripted.\n\nI ride on my horse from the rural hills of Velen, and into the city of Novigrad, finding monster nests, caves, thieves, wolves, and not to forget the men and women in distress when they're being attacked. These are just things along the way to a story quest that I follow, but end up getting lost in the world, wanting to explore it and choosing to help those in need. I don't even continue on to the story quest-- roaming a bit more of the areas around me, and occupying myself with the side quests.\n\nThe combat has been changed and it's almost completely different from the previous Witcher games in the series in terms of smoothness and fluidity. When I evade or roll out of my enemy's attacks, it all just flows. For your fights and encounters to go the way you want them to, you must time your parries and attacks correctly.

It's a massive game, with well-written character interaction and plot, and heapin' LOADS of content. To make the deal even better, its gameplay mechanics have been so drastically improved since the last two games, with combat and movement as a whole feeling a lot more flexible and responsive than it did in Assassin of Kings. Overall, it creates for a challenging and compelling package that'll keep you occupied for well over a month.\n\nMore specifically\nGood stuff:\nNo shortage of options and content. You can play this game just about any way you like and succeed in fights, and as long as you pay attention to what's going on in combat, stick by some sort of principle when you engage in quest conversations, and not be afraid to explore, you will do great at this game.\nGorgeous. Not only is the graphical quality in this game potentially incredible, but it's very well-optimized once you get the right settings. Now, I'm a lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and just used GeForce experience to tweak the settings, but on that configuration there were barely any instances I had of frame dropping or slowdown. It's a beautifully optimized and stable game overall, with its most notable feature being how it streams loading as you travel. Artifacts such as hitching temporarily for loading, and even LOD models, are nigh invisible.\nMassive and Engaging. Overall the whole game does a ton to successfully world-build itself, even without having to waste too many words on giving literally every single person dialogue (i.e. Oblivion or Skyrim). In particular, the city of Novigrad has to be one of the best designed locations I've seen in a game to date, almost feeling like a to-scale design of a whole city.\nBest combat in the series. You're not going to run into the same sort of awkwardness that was present in Assassin of Kings - attack timings and hitboxes on stuff such as dodge-rolls feel spot-on and are natural to adapt to. Signs also feel much more organic to transition in and out of, and the aiming on thrown/ranged weapons is much smoother. Granted AoK could use mods to fix some of those issues, but this game manages quite well right out of the box. What also is very nice is how you can generally learn how an enemy looks, and from that, deduce the sort of battle tactics to take to counter that - For example, a human enemy's got a huge axe or hammer? Don't block, roll out of there! Or just do a quick attack to hit them mid-swing.\nAnd if the game's base content wasn't enough, it has heaping loads of free DLC, which is almost unheard of nowadays. A good deal of it is cosmetics and alternate costumes for characters, but there is quite a bit of small side quests thrown in as well.\nAlso as an aside, gwent is way better than dice poker.\nBad Stuff:\nInverted Learning Curve. This problem plagues ALL of the Witcher games - the hardest content is always at the start, before you've had a chance to build up resources or experience to fight most enemies. Granted this has probably more to do with my playstyle than with the game itself to some degree (see extra tips), but yet it's still something that's gotten me on each of the games I played.\nNot gamebreaking bugs, but weird bugs. You'll be sure to run into weird errata such as suddenly losing the ability to block, all fire disappearing from the game, or even getting an extreme close-up of the back of Geralt's head. Usually the bugs are fixable, at worst, by restarting the game, but it's still curious to end up in that sort of situation. Thankfully the game still is getting a stream of extra DLC and bugfixes at the moment, or so it seems.\nSometimes ambiguous dialog choices. With how important it is to take a stance concerning ingame characters and their opinions, having it a little unclear what Geralt might mean by the following line sometimes is a bit detrimental. Though sometimes the results are much funnier because of it (recalling: accidentally telling Roche "♥♥♥♥ you" right at the start of the 2nd game.)\nLight on (Challenging) Fighting. Now, considering the history and general style of this game series, this is to be expected. I just think it's a bit of a shame that it's relegated to mostly taking a backseat when the fighting system has been so well-tuned. Of note, specifically, is its lack of truly difficult enemies at most points, because while the game as a whole offers basically a limitless number of opportunities to fight, often it's not something that will end up threatening you.\nNot all exploration's rewarded appropriately. This, along with the backwards learning curve, I'd consider the game's worst flaw. Part of that very well might just be part of the game's style, trying to differentiate itself from the likes of Skyrim which literally places big heaping treasure troves at the end of any ruin or fortress you raid. What's the question-mark on your map? Sometimes it's a great Place of Power. Other times it's a guarded treasure that contains loot you've outlevelled at your point, or a monster nest that grants a tiny little bit of extra XP. Most caves or structures you might stumble upon tend to have pretty good hauls, but on a whole those tend to be much more obscure to find due to most of them not being marked by default. In short, expect to be wandering around a bit, running into many map borders exploring strange shapes you might spot on your map - and be prepared for some disappointment. Tying in again with the lack of challenging fights, most of the stuff you might spot on your map can end up just being a time-waster.\nMy Tips:\nHaving cleared the game, my personal tips on how you'd want to play it for the best enjoyment include:\nStick by a principle. This game is such a strong embodiment of the literal "Role-Playing Game" in that you really do need to play the role of Geralt in some sort of consistent and effective way to get far and secure allies. Decide who you want to befriend or protect, and choose options carefully in dialog to secure that, because being a yes-man or an indiscriminate killer will not generate good things.\nDon't try to be a completionist. Please, please, please do not. This game is massive and if you attempt to do everything as soon as it's available/feasible at your character level, it will burn you out. This is a big problem, because if you get burnt out, it will dampen a bit of the effect and impact that the later parts of the main story might have. Instead, my advice will be to do the quests and/or treasure hunts you need to secure a good build, and once you got a good appropriate level for the main quest, start going out from there. If you run completionist-style and try and cram everything you can before progressing, you'll usually find the battles to be way too simple, and, if like me, a bit thin on patience to concentrate on what's going on.\nAll of this really ties into my issue with the 'backwards learning curve' I discussed above. By keeping completionism to a minimum on your first playthrough, you'll be able to get into what's going on in the main story and have a properly-challenging experience. Don't worry about missing out on things either, because completing the main story also will grant you access to a free-roam play mode where you can pick up the quests you might've missed on your own terms.\nDon't rely on waypoints or map markers. There's a lot more than meets the eye to the world in The Witcher 3. Don't just set out to explore question-marks on your map. If you see an interesting structure in the distance, or you spot some odd rectangles or walls on your map, go out there and explore! More often than not, it's a site for a hidden quest or contract, or some treasure!\nI've hit a word limit, this game is good. BYE!

Contracts are just amazing, the story behind them, the monsters you hunt is so interesting and thrilling that it makes me over excited, i recommend completing every single contract, it is worth it.\nEnemies There is huge variety of monsters you will encounter in this huge world and because of this i was never tired of enemies and exploring this world.\nWorld The world of Witcher 3 is huge, starting from caves to elven ruins and hidden treasures ammount of content is huge and i loved to get to each "?" and i can say it was worth it even with all those smuggler caches.Few thing that weren't so good:\nBugs Because the game is so huge bugs are inevitable, i personally encountered few and only 1 of them weren't funny, animation bug and that you couldn't dive were ok as if you reload save there will be fixed only bug i didn't like was that for me didn't spaw enemy with key because of which i had to leave 1 guy trapped in prison forever.\nSmuggler cache There were way too much smuggler caches in Skellige.Overall decision.\nI recommend this game to everyone who like rpgs with heavy choices which will eventually affect the ending of game, if you want to buy game on which to spend huge amount of time i recommend it again because i completed everything i found(contracts, side quests, "?") in 150 hours which is a lot and i haven't yet started DLC. If none of above is what you wanted then you should better skip this game. If you are interested in score i will give to this game then i can without a doubt give it 9.9/10\n\n","April 2","true","194.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I mean it's got 'Wild Hunt' in it's name. That says everything!\n\nIn The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you play as returning protagonist, Geralt of Rivia. A witcher who now seeks to move on in his life and continues his saga, going back home to Kaer Morhen. Settling in and finding peace wasn't the hard part. Facing a group of icy horsemen called the Wild Hunt willing to end his life while pursuing the emperor's runaway daughter is.\n\nI don't even know where to start. The seamless and continuous world of Novigrad's cities, to the dangerous countrysides of Velen; also known as 'No Man's Land'. The seemingly endless number of quests to do, chasing down Witcher contracts and killing griffons, Ghouls, and other beasts that await your bloody death. Not to mention the amount of things to discover and explore when you're just roaming around on your horse, which I've found doing more than fast travelling, as this fantastical realm is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen.\n\nChoices. It's a word that some games define it very well, like BioWare's Mass Effect and Dragon Age IPs. You get to choose what your character does, where they go, and so forth. Every choices makes a different in the world that affects someone. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has implemented this in an extraordinary way. Think about what would happen if you saved the lives of bandits in their camp, originally to have you killed. Will they continue raiding other nearby villages? Or will they be inevitably caught in their demise, killed by a feral beast that lurks around their camp? Every single one of your decisions affects something in this world. Whatever happens on the road is as you see, and it's not even scripted.\n\nI ride on my horse from the rural hills of Velen, and into the city of Novigrad, finding monster nests, caves, thieves, wolves, and not to forget the men and women in distress when they're being attacked. These are just things along the way to a story quest that I follow, but end up getting lost in the world, wanting to explore it and choosing to help those in need. I don't even continue on to the story quest-- roaming a bit more of the areas around me, and occupying myself with the side quests.\n\nThe combat has been changed and it's almost completely different from the previous Witcher games in the series in terms of smoothness and fluidity. When I evade or roll out of my enemy's attacks, it all just flows. For your fights and encounters to go the way you want them to, you must time your parries and attacks correctly. Every time you execute an attack, the enemy may go into a flurry of attacks and stagger you, gaining the upper hand in the fight. Nevertheless, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a challenging game set out to kill you.\n\n-     10 / 10","May 23, 2015","true","515.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Basically on the political side, witcher 3 story is very disappointing. I was expecting much more.\n\nWhat i liked\nOther than the political side of the story progression, i love everything about this game! from the rich open world to the beautiful graphics. The main story revolves around Geralt (the witcher) trying to find Ciri and save her from the wild hunt (specter Knights). There's also plenty of side stories and quest lines. Witcher 3 has a HUGE amount of content with very well done and interesting sidemissions that actually have an impact on the overall story, a tone of monster hunting contracts and random events, There seems to be an endless amount of stuff to do. Combat isn't easy and you have to use potions, oils and the witcher's powers to win fights. You can also fight on horseback but it is awkward and doesn't control too well. CD project red delivered on everything they promised and much more. This game is one of the best RPGs of all time and is a MUST BUY! but i do recommend you play the first 2 games or read the books before playing the witcher 3.","May 31, 2015","true","150.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This probably is or is one of the best RPG games that I have played in some years. Some complain about how short it is but I completed the game in about 75 hours but to be honest with the enormous amount of in depth and intriguing side quests and Witcher contracts to be completed I don’t see how you can complete the game in such short hours and then complain about how short the game. The problem is your so excited to play the Witcher 3 you dash through the main quests. I do not recommend this as one problem is after you complete the main quests your stuck with a lot of side quest that you have no motivation to complete. Having said this is you complete lots of side quests along side the main quest line you will be levelling up and enjoying the experience much more and realising the game is as long as you make it.\nThis game should be tried by all it has amazing graphics, beautiful scenery and an enormous open world to explore. There are hundreds of small treasures and areas to explore that will require a Witchers touch. Plenty of NPC amazingly voiced to talk to. They all have their own personality which really brings the towns and cities alive. The customisation with your gear is vast and its all about learning along the way but upgrading and finding new gear is always the key in these type of RPG games. The new and improved combat can at times be a bit 'funky' to say the least but being such a customisable game and being an RPG open world something sometimes is going to bug out, but having said this the combat most of the time is flawless with devilish finishing moves and devastating signs.\nOne of the most important points for me being not only a open world free roam RPG but also the fact that this is a Witcher game is that dialogue, choices and relationships you build. The dialogue is brilliant with every NPC you talk to. You will make decisions which will affect your later decisions so be careful what you say. The choices you make via dialogue are truly game changing later on. For me the choices you make through dialogue should not affect your end result so dramatically it should be more what you do than what you say but this still adds a great feel to the game.  Relationships are a huge aspect of the Witcher games especially now that you lost lover Yen is back along with Ciri. But every person has a different level of humour and a different relationship with Geralt. Which is exactly what makes you feels the connection and build a rapport between you and other characters.\nAll in all this game really came out on top of the expectations. There are of course always some minor detail that can be polished but this is why we have updates to clear the slate of any problems that you find. But this game really has the lot excellent gameplay, Gorgeous graphics, brutal combat, amazingly voiced characters, brilliant story line and a huge world to explore.\nI would definitely recommend this game. :)","May 27, 2015","true","75.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

For one thing, it's HUGE, and there's so much to do and see. Yeah, you have a selection of main quests, but you never really feel rail-roaded into doing them, and you can pretty much go at your own pace, doing whatever you want. I find the combat nice and fast, and challenging enough, and would strongly recommend people don't use the locking system while attacking (it's a bit ♥♥♥♥♥). But overall I'm really enjoying the game and would highly recommend it. As with other Witcher games there's a good depth in choices, consequences, and characters that keep you engaged throughout. Certainly anyone wanting a deep RPG with Deus-Ex-like choices, and Age Of Amalur-like combat and cityscapes need look no further. It wouldn't surprise me if this became my game of the year (and we're only in May) - it's that good, and has mod support for later expansion.

It has a very interesting Polish lore behind it, very well designed and voiced characters, great main and side quests and beautiful design/visuals.\nI hesitated with buying Witcher because I was not sure if I will like the setting but I was dead wrong. Game really sucks you in no matter if you like medieval/fantasy setting or not.\n\nYou can follow the main story with lots of pretty good looking cut-scenes or go for side quests and exploring. Game world feels big and you will be overwhelmed by amount of little quests and activities you can do.\n-I strongly recommend doing Bloody Baron quest - one of the best things I have experienced in this game.\nCombat can be simple button mashing at times but I have to say - sword fight animations that they put here are fantastic and killing enemies feels very rewarding. And prepare to die a lot too, Witcher is not very forgiving.\nYou can also craft armour, potions, weapons. A lots of it!\nAnd yes, there is famous nudity but done in a very elegant and mature way.\n\nI have only one issue - Gerald has mind of his own and in some areas wont do what you want him to do. The controling the guy can be extremly frustrating at times especially in thight interiors.\n\nI bought Witcher 3 at the full price and I must say - with this amount of content, free dlc`s and great replay value it was absolutely worth every penny.

That’s exactly what Wild Hunt has achieved here. The Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, and in many respects simply one of the bests and most exciting game in recent years. It captivates players with artistic vision, a huge world and an epic story. The developers were not looking for cheap applause - game design is uncompromising, consistent, thoughtful and nuanced. There is no saving the world, here, no great evil force pervading the landscape, or a doomsday clock ticking down to inevitable destruction, with only you to stand in its way. The story of Wild Hunt is a personal one, set in a huge and unrelentingly beautiful world. The game is massive. This is in two ways - one of which is the scale of the map. It’s bigger than Skyrim’s world and after tens of hours you’ll have barely scratched the surface. It’s a beautiful world, too. You stumble in a beggar and a quest with a magnific and well built story starts  and then you realize that is just a SIDE quest, thats pretty much the quests in a nutshell: It is one better than another. Not only do you care about the characters and want to see how their stories end, but you want to scour every inch of The Witcher 3's glorious game world. It's a world you want to get lost in, a world where fast travel is an afterthought and a world you want to keep exploring in case there's something you've missed. The variety of quest is outstanding. It has to be given how many there are, but you can find yourself searching for a person of interest one minute, playing cards the next, then starring in a play soon after.\n\nThis is the new standard for open world role-playing games. There is no such thing as a perfect game, but The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt come as close to perfect as any RPG to date.\n\nA monumental achievement of staggeringly aching beauty, the Witcher 3 stands proudly as one of the (if not the) greatest video game of all time, regardless of genre. Geralt's final, epic ride, is the high water-mark by which all future games will be judged and found lacking. Indeed, it's only disadvantage is that it completely ruins every other title on the market right now by nailing every single aspect of game design with almost supernatural clarity and perfection. If you play one video game in your life, make sure it's this one.\n\nQuality like this doesn't tend to arrive until way later in a generation, so we doff our caps to the team at CDPR for breaking tradition to deliver one of the best RPGs we've ever played. Make some room on your hard drive and shelf, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt deserves a permanent spot in your gaming library.","December 4, 2015","true","264.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This is truly a masterpiece of a game, and I’m not referring to the rigged IGN reviews. This game is so rich in its story and open world. The fact that people say that the combat system is crap does the game no good. Yes I do agree that the combat system can be a spamathon sometimes but there is a deep and knowledgeable combat system in the sense of the oils and potions you brew in preparations to each fight. Each monster is truly unique and are even better if you are slightly under-levelled. Each huge monster that you face (which can occur in the wild) are like boss fights and you learn them. You learn how they attack, defend and ultimately what there weak to. There are only a handful of monsters the game tells you what they are weak to and you essentially wing it from there making the monster fights that little greater and much tenser. Now the quests, the main story line quests you could say drag on a fair bit in some cases but the game rewards you for the hardship you undertook. The characters are amazingly written and have there only unique quirks and great voice actors making them believable. Then there is Ciri, The star of the show you may say. Probably the most and believable character, and definitely the best wrote. I won’t spoil too much but the ending of this game is incredible. Secondary quests are also imaginatively written to the extremes of (Spoiler Alert!!!) a plot to kill the king which effects the games ending drastically. Of cause there will be fetch quests but that is the nature of RPGs.\nIn conclusion 10/10 would save Ciri again\n\nEdit* Now having completed both DLCs i can firmly say that The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is my favourite game of all time (Seriously you can check my profile desription if you wish) and i would easily reccomend this game to anyone in a heartbeat if they are prepared for the heatwarming yet dark tale that is The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt (And the DLCs)","May 29, 2015","true","82.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Turning off Hairworks will boost your fps.  For me, Hairworks on Geralt only used an extra 10 frames per second.\n\nEven on High settings, this game looks amazing.  It must be fairly well optimized since I've seen no stutter in frames with such high quality textures, long draw distance, many NPCs, and lots of animated foliage.\n\n(I use a Logitech F710.  Witcher 3 was designed for a gamepad.  No, that is not a betrayal to PC gamers.  Alternatives to KB&M have always been around.  The great thing about PC gaming is having many control options available.)\nThe control scheme is very similar to that of Witcher 2.  The only complaint I've had so far is that the movement (outside of combat) is a little clunky.  Sometimes it's difficult to get Geralt turned to face a certain direction (the horse is even less precise) but this is a very minor issue.  The swimming controls can be a bit frustrating until you get the hang of it.  Combat, however feels good.  It's been improved since Witcher 2.  I noticed that Geralt attacks with precision whichever enemy I point the control stick toward, allowing me to seamlessly dance from one enemy to the next, keeping them all in check (as you imagine an outnumbered master-swordsmen would fight).  It is essential to utilize all available combat mechanics in this game such as rolling, dodging, magic, and alchemy.  Unless you're playing of Easy, spamming only sword attacks won't work well.  Each enemy acts differently too making it rewarding to study their movements and learn how to react and exploit weaknesses.  The combat system is quite deep and makes you fight like a professional witcher.  (Geralt is not a damage absorbing demigod.)  It is also necessary to read up on beasts and monsters (in the glossary or found books) to learn about their strengths and weaknesses.  This is especially true for Witcher Contracts.\n\nCrafting is now a big part of the game and everything you pick up can be broken down into crafting materials (junk now has a purpose).  Weapons and armor deteriorate with use and eventually need to be repaired.  This is not a tedious affair, though, since items degrade pretty slowly and you can always carry repair kits instead of finding a blacksmith or armorer.  You'll collect an entire library of diagrams for weapons, armor, potions, blade oils, bombs, etc.  Gathering ingredients is useful since every craftable item is integrated in a meaningful way.\n\nThe main map, mini map, quest log, and quest markers are all very useful and ensure that you won't feel lost (you can also turn off mini map markers).  I've yet to find a side quest that felt like padding or busy work.  In fact, most quests are complex and lengthy affairs (in a good way).  Leveling up and gaining abilities is unique (limited ability slots and mutagens) yet straightforward.  You can fast travel to and from sign posts after you've discovered them, though traveling by horse is efficient as well.  There are several open zones to explore, and they are massive and packed full of points of interest and beautiful scenery.\n\nAnimations, lip-sync, and voice acting are all top notch.  The contextual music is moody and entertaining.  Sound effects are varied and immersive.\n\nI highly recommend Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, especially if you like action, role-playing, open-world, and great stories.  It's clear that every aspect of this game has been carefully developed and optimized to produce a high quality product.  A glossary full of useful information will help newcomers understand the world and lore a little better, but if you've read the books and played the previous games you'll notice and appreciate many more intricate details throughout.","May 19, 2015","true","158.4"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"

The majority of the time I find myself exploring this vast environment on horseback and stumbling across nests of monsters or hidden treasures, rather than questing.  When I am not exploring I find myself constantly challenging NPC's to Gwent, a very addicting collectible card game along the lines of Hearthstone.\n\nThe story is very interesting and really draws you in right from the start.  The side quests range from really challenging, such as monster hunts, to really amusing, such as searching for a man's lost goat.\n\nMy only complaint with this game is the controls, they are pretty ♥♥♥.  They combat will take a lot of getting used to for most people.\n\nI feel like Iv'e barely scratched the surface of this game.

No, not Thomas the Tank Engine flying in the sky breathing fire and throwing rails at people, but truly the best open world fantasy RPG out there.\n\nI have not spent much time in this game thus far, however, I can say without a doubt that this will be one of the few games in my huge library that I am going to be playing nonstop until I complete. I have a habit of buying games, playing them, and then almost immediately regret for wasting money on whatever it was. This game is not one of those. I immediately fell in love with the game in the first 5 minutes, and no it's not because of Yennefer's bum.\n\nTo not really spoil anything, the story is set after the events of Witcher 2, as "the Black Ones" are now occupying the throne, which has left many residents of this land uneasy. Beasts, monsters, e.t.c., are all roaming the Earth, and you being a Witcher, have the best chance of beating them. What I find like a very nice touch to the story telling of this game is when you quit the game, and come back to it, it gives you a nice little recap of what happened previously. i.e. "Yennefer has eluded Geralt for years, blah blah blah, now it seemed she was only a few steps ahead." This is awesome for people like me who like to play several games around the same time period and may suffer memory loss since their last session of playing The Witcher 3.\n\nIn terms of polishing and bugs, I have no idea why so many people are complaining on the forums. I have not encountered a single bug in the game so far. I don't have that great of a computer and I've been able to run on high with about 50FPS steady. The world is absolutely breath taking.\n\nI am extremely happy that they overhauled the combat since the previous Witcher game. I always liked the story but Jesus, that combat just always made me not want to bother playing. It was so clunky and felt like a very low budget MMO. I am very glad to see they decided to change it for the third installment.\n\nThe world is extremely immersive, many games like to include side stories which end up just being completely annoying and irrelevant to the main story, or world in entirety. Every side quest I have encountered so far has added more to the story as a whole, and teaches you about the world of the Witcher series. They added a very fun card game to this installment, called "Gwent" which plays very well. I can definitely see this minigame becoming a stand alone in the future, or people literally just launching the Witcher 3 to play this minigame.\n\nThe Witcher 3 gets a whopping 9.5/10 from me so far based on my first impressions of the game. This may change depending on whether the story doesn't stay interesting and turns very lackluster, or if the game at any point becomes unplayable. All being said this game will definitely be tied in my top 2015 game, probably to join it will be Batman: Arkham Knight, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain.","May 18, 2015","true","44.9"," 44 of 81 people (54%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","54","44","81","8","3"

See, The Wild Hunt is less a sequel to the previous Witcher games as it is to the Witcher books. I, for one, have thusfar greatly enjoyed it, but I have read the books. The Wild Hunt basically assumes that you have played the last 2 games, read all the books, and remember minor characters like Dijkstra, Crach an Crate, and Kiera Metz. This is manna from the heavens to Witcher fanboys like me, but I think it alienates potential players who aren't already initiated. My suggestion is that you play the first 2 games, read the books, then play Wild Hunt.\n\nThe world is wonderfully constructed. For the first time, I actually feel like I am walking around in the world of the Witcher. The story is also written in Sapkowski's style, mixing borderline Grimdark with his signature caustic wit (something the last 2 games forgot about and is a welcome breath of fresh air in the third installment) One thing that bugs me, for all their attention to detail in referencing events and people in the books, they seem to have carefully avoided mentioning the actual reason that so many factions want Ciri, writing it off with a simple "because of her Elder Blood" I have a feeling this was done to avoid freaking out American audiences with the topics of incest, forced breeding, and so on that made Ciri the character that she was. Although they did throw in a nugget about her being a lesbian, so there's that, but it is rather frustrating when I try to act the way Geralt actually would around Emperor Emhyre or Avallo'c (two of the most despicable people in the universe) but I can't because the writers of the Wild Hunt are so desperately avoiding mentioning WHY we all hate those characters.\n\nAs for the combat, it's Assassins of Kings on 'roids. Fighting a pack of nekkers feels like an actual struggle, and a very skill focused struggle at that. The new side-step move combined with the revamped parry mechanics do wonders for all the problems of the last game.\n\nGraphically, the game is beautiful. I recomend you try Ultra with the Nvidia Hair effects turned off, as my Radion R9 290x handles those settings at 60fps no problem. This game is SUPREMELY optimised. I have noticed a few texture popping bugs and the distance rendering behaves rather strangely in cutscenes, but otherwise, it's a masterwork.\n\nLong review Short, I recommend this game with some reservations. If you have not read the Witcher novels by Andrez Sapkowski, FIX THAT, then play this.","May 25, 2015","true","231.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","4"

I've got my fingers crossed for some inventory improvements, considering the game's quantity of items for crafting, equipment, potions and other Witcher tools.\n\nAt full price, this game is worth it all day long - at competing prices elsewhere on the internet this game is an absolute steal.","May 25, 2015","true","159.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Or, like me, just have them chilling in your games list unplayed? DOESN'T MATTER!\n\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. This is a game that can actually call itself 'next-gen' because it's miles beyond what passes for it lately. It stands on its own as a remarkable experience.\n\nThe graphics are technically great, but the art direction is fantastic. The world is truly alive and sprawling, just begging to be explored. The minimum requirements are a little more demanding than they should be, if you don't quite have what it calls for there's a good chance it will still be very playable. If you do have a nice shiny new GPU, this is the eye candy you've been waiting to throw at it.\n\nEven only being vaguely familiar with the Witcher universe, this game quickly engrosses you into the world, the lore, the characters, and the perfectly knit gameplay that makes you feel an active part of it. Without losing the cinematic level of quality.\n\nThe combat is well balanced. This is no button masher, but it's not complicated either. Higher difficulty levels actually require attention and planning to make it through. Enemies are not forgiving, and rushing anywhere unprepared will be met with a very quick lesson on what not to do.\n\nThe story is enormous, yet fully voice casted with attention to making every single line of dialog be well delivered and acted. I can't imagine how they did it without being a narrow on-rails game. This thing is huge and intricate, with everything being of substance. There are no useless fetch quests, everything is rich and detailed!\n\nI think you get the idea, it's incredible, and you don't need any previous experience with the series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hedless7/recommended/292030/","Hedless7","Hedless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hedless7/","105 products in account","Having Played 50 hours of this amazing game, I feel I'm nowhere near writing a full review, but I'll do it anyway.\n\nAs an opening statement, I've read all the books (translated) played 11 hours of Witcher 1, and completed Witcher 2 so i'll make references back and forth.\n\nFirst off, for the first 49 hours I'd been playing on low textures, because I'm an idiot and should've put them up to high/ ultra, but for the record, the game still looked amazing and I never looked at the graphics again after the Balcony scene. This is mainly because the game is so immersive, the story so detailed that frankly I was so focused on what I was doing the world passed me by, but I enjoyed exploring, finding a cave in the middle of nowhere, only to be savaged by a Golem way higher than me was very satisfying, especially when I came back levels later, studied it's attacks, learnt it's weaknesses and capitalised on them. The combat is way more enjoyable than Dark Souls for me. With Signs, Sword attacks and various potions as well as an expansive skill system, you can really create some fantastically focused builds.\n\nControls in combat are smooth, while out of combat, they can be a little off at times, often walking back and forth over an item before i'm able to pick it up, underwater controls were actually my biggest weakness in the game, but it's a controller game just as 2 was.\n\nThe game is vastly superior to 2 in so many ways (i'll mention this more as both differ in style over 1)\n\nInventory screen is vastly better, i'm not removing my items while trying to equip others and it's all round much better. Though the skill screen is annoying in that often I end up removing my mutagens by accident\nQuests have consequences, both side and otherwise, heck even the random events have consequences both good and bad so it really gets you thinking at times about the potential results of your decisions. Won't mention any here because spoilers but they can really take you by surprise, often the result not occuring for hours later, heck I didn't see the result of one of my decisions until 30 hours later, and that was just a random event.\n\nThe world is massive, no I mean Massive, even Novigrad, the biggest would take a good 15 minutes around the outside (roughly), i've been lost in there so many times.\n\nQuests are like nothing we've come to expect from RPGs recently, ALL quests are brilliantly voice acted, they have interesting storylines and you often don't feel like it's just a fetch quest, there is more intrigue, and all round you actually want to explore to find everything.\n\nThere are so many references back to the books which never fail to make me smile, Heck the entire ballad in Novigrad is a reference to the first blood "The Last Wish". You can also find a compressed version within the game. The story of Ciri turning up in Kaer in a dress, again a reference to the book. And the "Basilisk" that was a Wyvern random event, that was a reference to the book whilst it was actually Ciri who called the gentleman out pointing out the differences between the two creatures but it was still in the game in some form. All of that makes me respect CDPR even more for so much relation to source material as well as forging their own path. It's a fantastic mix.\n\nLet's try to wrap this up because I'd rather not keep more of your time when you should be playing so:\n\nPros:\n\n- Massively detailed world\n- Combat is fun yet still hard, even at level 17, you lose your focus against a swarm of level 4 drowners, you're going to lose your vitality quickly\n- Benefits to exploring, and you actually feel like you want too\n- Quests as aforementioned as so detailed and often allow you to make a choice you think about\n- Combat is not always the solution, you may choose to let someone free rather than killing, they could take a chance turn their life around or sink deeper into darkness, who knows\n- This is candidate for game of the year in my book, best game I've played in years\n- Contracts give you the story, the preparation and all the tools to take on some of the best designed creatures in the world. so exhilerating to take down some mighty behemoth after one hell of a tough fight\n\nCons\n\n- Clunky controls at times, especially underwater\n- Odd bugs, such as characters floating around, or leaving their hair behind, seriously, Triss looks scary without hair, personally i've experienced no game breakers\n- The mutagen system is confusing at first, not realising you had active skills, I messed up my first build and needed to respec\n- If you miss some gwent cards in the prologue, or a merchant dies, you ain't ever getting those gwent cards (hopefully this will be patched, as people who didn't pay attention during the prologue have that achievement locked for them\n\nOverall though, this is an amazing game and I think it's going to be the game of the year, so I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have so far, now, stop reading, draw your silver and get back to making crowns","May 27, 2015","true","106.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The open world is gorgeous, the story was stellar and the characters excellent, with great voice acting all round. There are a lot of quests, contracts, treasures and secrets to find, as well as interesting NPC's to meet and places to explore. Novigrad especially looked fantastic, as cities go. Lots of references from the books thrown in which makes it very rewarding for fans of the series. I was most impressed by the quality of a large number of the side quests, which could have easily been part of the main questline, as well as the excellent Witcher contracts, which really made you feel like a professional monster slayer.\n\nThe leveling system is deep and rewarding, giving you XP for completing quests as well as small amounts of XP for every monster you kill, so you can level up and assign points to four skill trees. Sword skills, alchemy, magic and a passive skill tree. You can't earn enough to max all of them out, so you'll have to commit to a play style that suits you best and stick with it, which offers good replayability as you try different skill sets.\n\nIn all, the amount of content on offer here is substantial and i cannot recommend The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt enough. Either watch a recap of the first 2 games online and get this one, or better yet play through the entire trilogy and you won't be disappointed.","June 1, 2015","true","231.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The Story continues where the second game left of where our protagonist Geralt is still looking for his lost love Yennefer and try to find answers what really happend to him. Then the game starts and its immediately drops you in this vibrant and gorgeous world with full of life , interesting places/peoples and you just never want to quit the game. The game combat is varied and its incredibly good and fluid at the same time you can use things like bombs , signs , various oils for your swords , alchemy potions , and even a crossbow for hunting down beast or even humans. The world is huge with varied locations and there is just so much things to do in it , from doing classic things like doing quest , exploring , talking with various intresting npcs to even horse racing or playing Gwent. (ohh god this card game is so addicting...).The music and sound design is just perfect , really bringing the atmosphere together. The RPG elments are also on-point. Ohh and also there is 16 free DLC for this game ... CDPR you guys done it , made a masterpiece.

The game is well optimized. The animations look awesome, especially with the combat finish moves. And if you want to take a break from the witcher life, there is an addictive mini game called Gwent.\n\nThere are a variety of inventory weapons and items with different abilities such as 40% chance to freeze enemy, etc, which can be filled with different runestones to add more strengths. The leveling-up system has four branches here each with their own color: "combat", "alchemy", "signs" and "others". Join these traits with same colored mutagens and it will increase its stats. There are merchants and blacksmiths to sell and buy items for potions and crafting armors.\n\nI spend less time dismantling and crafting items so can't say much on this. Also I don't see much use in the alchemy branch of the system. There are few wierd glitches and horse riding controls can be kind of wierd, bumping into things and people. Another main concern is that some candles are placed right beside some interactive items and quests.

Often, you find yourself thinking that "this scene would make a great painting" or "look at how much detail they put into this!"\nThe characters are perfect. Geralt is a badass, Yennefer and Triss are as strong as ever, Ciri plays a great leading role, and just about everyone in the world "adds" to the world in some meaningful way.\nThe world/level design is excellent; the environments feel realistic and lived-in. Each environment is unique as well. For example, there are snow-covered peaks, pitteresque orchards, busy towns (and a legitimate city), and even castles.\nThe story and quests are amazing, with no fetch-quests or mindless killing contracts.\nThe music is incredible!\nThe combat can be a bit annoying at times, but it does have its fun moments. If you plan on buying the game to cast magic spells, you should know that magic is not at all a major part of this game.\nSome of the technology in this game is so cutting-edge that you have to see it to believe it. Loading screens are virtually non-existent, and in Novigrad, the capital, you can walk right into a building and see the city outside through the window.

You won't ever find too contracts to be the same, each and every one of them has its own background, story, etc. And, not to mention that you can inmerse yourself as deep as you want in The Witcher world, given the huge amount of history you can find in books, notes, talking to NPCs...

The story is just extremely captivating, with appealing characters ( Triss especially ). Saddly, I just finished the main quest and most of my level's secondary quests in ONLY 50 hours. This is one of the few games I mostly play for the story, and not for the gameplay. Do not get me wrong, the gameplay is fluid, but it is just not what I found the most enjoyable element of the game. Having finished the story line, I was rewarded with THE awesome ending I was hoping for; The Witcher III really is Geralt's last epic adventure. The soundtrack is extremely immersive, especially the one in Ard Skellige. Having finished the main quest, I honestly doubt I will really enjoy replaying it ( nothing like the first time, they say ).\n\nBased on my sole opinion, I would rate this game 9/10.\n\nNEW EDIT: I actually found a way to extend my gameplay and I just am enjoying my new playthrough in Death March ( I was in Broken Bones before ). 20 hours in this new playthrough, I am focusing on doing all side quests and collecting Gwent cards ( looking for the 100% achievement ). If you are a bit bored or do not know what to do in The Witcher III, try doing as I did ( focusing on the side quests is a MUST, otherwise you will end up as I did: level 40 only having tons of level 10 quests )","May 25, 2015","true","274.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Let me give you my two cents:\nHas this game received more than 250 awards? Yes. Did I become a fan boy? No.\n\nHave I played The witcher? Yes (at release day with all the numerous bugs). Did I like it? Yes. Did I become a fan boy? No.\n\nHave I played Assassin of Kings (Witcher2)? Yes. Did I like it? Yes. Have I become a fanboy? No.\n\nHave I played The Wild Hunt? Yes (HoS too).

Nor did I get a Gerald/Ciri tattoo, or traveled to beautiful Poland to ask CD Projekt for autographs (cool as they may be).\n\nBut this game offers a wicked narrative, S.U.P.E.R.B. graphics (on the proper gig, mind you), immersive gameplay, which will reward a player with hundreds of hours of fun (211.1 at the mo’, but B&W isn’t out yet).\nYou will manly try to ignore a tear at Geralt’s fatherly affection towards Ciri (I am the father of a daughter meself), or puff up your chest at Ciri’s antics.\nRarely will a bug throw you off balance, and even then, it will grab you by your breeches and drag you back in in a jiffy.\n\nYou came here for advice? Here it is: get the game! Get it now.\nIf you are short on money, wait for the sale period and get it. Buy the hell out of it.\nOf course, you can be a rebel and torrent it, but then again, how will the artists who gave us this masterpiece will be able to give us another?

Inside the house I saw what was probably his wife, and two children, in an apparent suicide. The children laid in their beds and were covered in flower petals. I didn't see a  quest for the area, so I checked reddit. Apparently this scene disturbed others who wondered the same thing. There was no quest to figure out what happened. It was just there; open to interpretation on the events which led to their deaths. Some posts speculated, but it was soon discarded as scenery. Still I felt bad and wanted to find out why for the sake of closure. I kept searching but never found an answer.\n\nI'll probably never know why that scene was put in, but its the best example immersion I have ever witnessed in any game. It still bothers me when I think about it. Out of everything I've done in the game, helping or destorying villages and monsters, I couldn't save that family.","May 20","true","64.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/droctagon/recommended/292030/","droctagon","dR ocTaGoN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/droctagon/","84 products in account","I'm going to start off by saying that I rate The Witcher 3 as one of the best games ever made, and I've been playing PC games for over 25 years so I don't make that statement lightly.\n\nI only have one gripe with the game so I'm going to get it out of the way first, and that's that there’s a major disparity in how useful the different skills are.\nAs an example let's say you have a choice of three combat skills which are +5% fast attack damage, +5% strong attack damage or +2% crossbow critical chance.  The fast and strong attack options are going to be good depending on how you play, and putting points into one or the other will further sculpt your style of play down that path, so this feels organic and works well.  However because it’s a core part of witcher lore that witchers fight with swords, the crossbow does exactly f*ck all damage and is only used situationally for either bringing flying monsters back to ground, or for the limited situations where you need to fight underwater.  A crossbow attack takes about three times as long as a fast attack, and even a critical hit only does about 1/4 as much damage, so it's like going 'Oh dear what a tough decision I have, do I want the skill that turns Geralt into a 7 foot tall demi-god who eats rocks and sh*ts lightning bolts, or the one that allows him to p*ss his pants in the line for the bookstore?'\n\nRight. Moving on to the plethora of good things I have to say about the game; the writing is absolutely top notch.  I would put it slightly behind Planescape: Torment but on par with Baldur's Gate 2, which basically means top 5 of all time.  Everything from the dialogue between the main characters to the peasants grumbling about their peasanty bullsh*t feels natural and believable, and there's excellent voice acting to back it up.  Some of the conversations between Geralt and the emperor Emhyr var Emreis (voiced by Charles Danse who played Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones) were so good they made me jump up and down in my chair.\n\nWitcher 3 is a huge game in terms of content and yet the quests are varied and interesting.  Rather than creating a 100 hour RPG with 80 hours worth of fetch quests CDPR have created a game where you'll genuinely feel like you’re part of the story and will consider the possible consequences before you act.\n\nGraphically the game is stunning, and although I'm not a huge one for graphics I'm surprised by how much the painstakingly constructed animations (particularly the facial animations) contribute to the how immersive the game is.\n\nThe combat mechanics are great and from what I'm told they scale well with difficulty (I haven't played on the lower difficulties so I’m relying on second hand info).  It looks like they've used motion capture for a lot of the combat animations and it shows. If they haven’t then /mindblown.\n\nAll of these things combine to make The Witcher 3 an extremely immersive and engaging RPG and a triumph of modern game design.  I haven't been this impressed by a game since Planescape: Torment and Baldur’s Gate 2.  Do yourself a favour and play it.","December 23, 2015","true","439.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is also now my benchmark when playing a game.\n\nThe game\n\n- is Ambitious. and they pulled it off.\n- has a good storyline.\n- has an adequate battle system. Might not be the best, but it is perfect for its own\n- is excellent on voice overs. I never get tired of all those accents and Geralt's boring voice.\n- has the best DLC's. Good free DLC. Hearts of Stone DLC is just superb.\n- is wide! I can't stop the complentionist in me to get to all those question marks even though I finished the game.\n\nSome notes:\n- I feel the movement is a little bit clunky. I don't know if it's by design but I can say it's not smooth. Even with the alternative movement setting, I just feel it can do better.\n- I'm not really sure about this but the UI seems a bit slow (30fps ish). I don't know what a 60fps UI feels like but when you play the game then hit that start button to open up inventories, maps or quest, it just doesn't feel right to me.\n- Crafting system could be better. Since it's a world with too many items, it's just hard to find the components you need using the UI.\n\nI strongly recommend that you buy this game.

Those are few little mistakes for a BIG game like this. In the other hand those awesome quests and challenging bosses are going to make you forget the bugs, the quests are so interesing not just the main but the contracts and the side quests, and if you bought the expansion pass those two are interesing as the base game itself. There's always something to do, getting some Gwent cards, killing some monsters, chilling around with some women or trying to find Ciri, I don't know how someone can get bored from playing this.\n\nThe art is beautiful, in general the game looks so good plus The witcher universe is fascinating so warning, If you like good RPGs and challenging combat be careful, this game is going to absorb your life, specially that new game + option when you're done but have some achievements missing.\n\nHope this was helpful and thanks CD projekt red for this amazing game, you guys have made many advances if we compare the other two games with this one.

Well, this is one of them.\n\nThis is what games should be. You think the price is too high? For the quality and amount of content you get, the price should easily be triple. Witcher 3 has only one focus as a game, and that is quality. This you can see in every aspect of the game. You will stop to listen to every dialog, you will stop to admire the scenery and you will stop to think and feel as the game challenges you emotionally. This is a complete experience, and the dedication of this company for its game is all too clear.\n\nThis is how you do a damn game, this should be the industry standard. Nothing in this game feels like just another checklist feature, or a paper/cardboard feature.\n\nCompared to what I think is its main competitor, the game follows the already set in standard. Dragon Age Origins was a good game, while Witcher 1 was decent. Dragon Age II was a shallow game while Witcher 2 was a good game.

Does the game live up to the GOTY? Is it properly optimized? Is it a work of art? Is it everything it I want it to be? Will it cure my chronic passiveness? NO, not the last one.\n\nThe game is god. So many beautiful experiences are packed so tightly, I have never had my mouth open in awe so often in any other game, at all. Altogether a full on beautiful experience and a beautiful finish at the top for the Witcher series, my absolute favourite as far as series go.\n\nNothing has come close to this experience yet after so long after so many months. Graphics are godlike, sounds are godlike, songs and immersion is godlike. The combat system and controls were a little crappy until the devs fixed it, it was after I finished the game. Most infuriating part was Roach deciding to socialize with a whole pack of high level wolves, then walking into a tree as I try to steer him out of there, then chickening out and throwing me off. Instakill. Fu Roach.\n\nAnyways that is fixed now. And PROPS to the devs as they still were fixing minor bugs months and months after release. I'm talking about 13 page minor bugfix notes. I have never seen any other big name dev do something so awesome after they sold the game. And they lowered the price a lot and it wasnt that high to begin with. With the Fallout 4 crap hitting the market at double the price for an insanely buggy and very poorly optimized game which still didnt get 1 non-beta fix after months of being on the market, I am very happy CDPR got the goty for TW3. I hope they show an example to other big names a little.\n\nWhat else. Play it. You wont find an experience as good and refined anywhere else, not yet. Probably not for another half a year I think.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/292030/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","This game is a very difficult game to review for me. Most things I'm about to say have probably been said by some other reviewer out there, but I can back up most of their opinions. Witcher 3 is a massive game. A very very massive game at that. The major issue with these games, however, is the fact that they're usually bland with generic filler side quests. Witcher 3, however, is an incredibly polished game with side quests that aren't meaningless, along with a world filled to the brim with something interesting going on around every corner. For reasons like these, Witcher 3 has been highly praised by the entire gaming community. In fact, people are going as far as calling this one of the best games of all time. I don't think Witcher 3 is the next Ocarina of Time or anything like that, but Witcher 3 is definitely a really, really, really good game.\n\nGraphics\nI'm going to say this now: THESE GRAPHICS ARE "DOWNGRADED?" Are you actually SERIOUS with that? I find that incredibly laughable. Well, gamers nowadays do have ridiculous expectations (look at Fallout 4 if you need an example) so I guess that explains it. Witcher 3's graphics are INCREDIBLE, to say the least. The entire game is absolutely gorgeous, and is probably one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Just look at a few screenshots some people have taken for this game. One or two of them could easily justify my opinion on this.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay has had mixed reception. Some found it to be intense and enjoyable, while others found it to be really boring. I think the combat, for the most part, was very enjoyable. I found it much more fun actually being a little more tactical about how to approach an enemy rather than mindlessly chop an enemy up into tiny pieces. That being said, there are two flaws with the gameplay. The one that is more important, however, is how easy the game begins to get as time goes on. In the beginning, you'll be struggling with how to spend your money, and what skills you should level up. As time goes on, you'll be swimming in money, so that isn't a problem. Plus, since you have fancy armor and most of your important skills levelled, the game won't be as difficult or intimidating. That being said, if you don't overlevel yourself, then the game is still difficult in a much more exciting way. The other flaw I have with the gameplay is how AWFUL the fistfights are. I can't stand them. They're boring and usually really unfair, and that seems kind of ironic seeing how you're playing as a superhuman mercenary. However, to make up for this, the world is massive and discourages going through the main storyline immediately, something I'm glad for. It is encouraged throughout the game you do the side quests, and it's actually very worthwhile. They feel like actual side quests rather than filler content. To give this game even more depth, you have a game inside a game, called Gwent. I'm not addicted to Gwent like other people, but it is actually pretty fun to play if you're bored. Overall, the gameplay has a lot of depth, although it does have a few glaring flaws.\n\nStory\nI've never read a Witcher book or played any of the games, so I walked into this not knowing much aside from who Geralt of Rivia and Triss Merigold were, along with knowing what witchers are. Because of that, the main story didn't appeal to me as much as other people, but it does get really exciting when you get farther into the game. The Battle of Kaer Morhen was one of the best parts to the game in my opinion. However, where this game shines most is how interesting the side quest stories are. As I said before, the side quests FEEL like side quests, instead of "kill this" or "fetch this for me" in basically every other open world RPG game out there. Because of this, it gives Witcher 3 even more depth and makes it even more detailed. The story overall gives this game life, and because of that, this game has gotten well-deserved praise.\n\nAudio\nThe voice acting is rather mediocre, personally. I did find it to be pretty forgettable. However, this game's soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It fits the mood perfectly, and makes up for the somewhat bland voice acting. The combat music is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat, while the overworld music is somewhat calming with a sense of sadness in it because of how dark and depressing the Continent really is. Not much to say here, but the music is extremely good.\n\nReplayability\nOverall, I wouldn't say that Witcher 3 is the strongest in the replayability. However, that being said, the game makes up for this because of the number of things you can do instead of just blowing through the main story. Those people who have 80-100 hours on the game are playing through it normally, along with some of the side quests. If you want, you can crank up the difficulty and do another playthrough. This makes the game 100x more exciting, and you might be able to get about 50-100 more hours of fun from doing that as well.\n\nVerdict\nOverall, I think Witcher 3 is an incredible game. It's massive, full of detail and depth, has an outstanding soundtrack, and so much more. It's not a perfect game and is not the magnum opus of the gaming industry. However, this game is definitely the new benchmark RPG for this generation because of the fact what it did right, it did extremely well. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this game, as long as you don't mind some points in the story where it'll slow down a bit.\n\nGraphics - 10/10\nGameplay - 8.0/10\nStory - 9.0/10\nAudio - 8.5/10\nReplayability - 7.0/10\n\n**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**\n\n\n.:9.4/10:.\n\n+Incredibly detailed\n+Gorgeous graphics\n+High quality side quests\n+Amazing soundtrack\n+Tons of depth\n+Huge world\n\n-Late game somewhat kills the mood\n-Fistfights","January 10","true","48.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Deep and rich story not only during the main campaign, but also the secondary missions and side quests.\n\nGraphics are astonishing, the quality of the characters expressions is exquisite and unique.\n\nThe world is pretty interactive when it matters and it also bring the franchise trademark, which is an adult, mature storytelling, filled with morally dubious and ethics intriguing decisions to make, which also have an impact over the story and how the world responds to the players decisions.\n\nThe only con I would highlight is the game "concession" to consoles, which makes it inventory and interface managing a little bit outdated and arkward on the pc.

These two girls are incredible, three-dimensional characters).\n\nIt's also literally the best game I've ever played.\nThe story, the graphics, the voice acting, the gritty fantasy world, the interactions you have with the characters, the numerous things you can do, the massive variety of quests... the IMMERSION. I've never been so immersed in a video game, a movie or a show. The entire tale of Geralt of Rivia is so deeply enthralling that I intend to replay the story and every side quest all over again just to re-experience the phenomenal world of The Witcher. I hope to do so at least another 5 or 6 times. In the next month.\n\nIf you've never played the other games or read the books, fear not. There's a lot of references to characters and events from the previous media, but CD Projekt Red did an admirable job of ensuring there's slim to no confusion -- and you'll get almost as attached to the characters as those of us who have read the books or played the previous games.\n\nSpeaking of CDPR, never has there been a developer so invested in the satisfaction of their fans. You've got to give these devs a hand because they welcome critiques, suggestions, comments or concerns. Putting out quality DLC weekly is undoubtedly excruciatingly hard work -- especially on top of the more lengthy DLCs and additional game(s) they're working on simultaneously -- work that CDPR has been more than willing to provide for us, their fans, for free. If you're looking for a game that, should you have an issue with a bug or glitch, you can contact the developers and see that glitch fixed in the very next patch... then you've found the right game, the right company.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let me elaborate upon my opening:\nA little buggy (hilarious bugs that occasionally break your immersion but absolutely are not game-breaking)\nHas some obnoxious characters (incredible characters. Even the irritating characters found in various side quests and heard belching and farting around Novigrad [...yep] can pique your interest -- What is their story? Where are they from? Where are they going? Why do they think their own bodily functions are so funny? I don't know, but I'd love to find out.\nYennefer and Triss... No words. Just. Play the game and you'll experience these two incredibly strong, awesome sorceresses.\nAll in all, this game is truly a masterpiece. If ever you've wanted to immerse yourself in another world, if ever you wanted to play as an extremely sexy male protagonist with snow white hair and a face that has been put through a blender, if ever you've wanted to experience the thrill of cutting off creatures' heads and hanging them as trophies over your horse's saddle...\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is for you. The best gaming experience of the decade. At least. For the foreseeable future, it's my go-to recommendation for anyone interested in a mature, open-world RPG. Or any game. Everyone needs this in their library.\n\nSo pick this up, ASAP. None of that "wait for a sale" BS. No. CDPR deserves every cent of the full retail value, and more.","August 5, 2015","true","135.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I was so scared near the end not gonna say why due to spoilors, but im glad of the last cut scene is all im gonna say... it might have been the failure of this game had it not been what it was... anyways simply rushing the story-line on the easiest difficulty was WELL worth the 60$ I literally just beat the game and am already yearning for DLC. MSG to the makers... PLEASE MAKE DLC HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH CIRI!!!!!!!!!! and maybe throw in some reunitation with yen and triss. if you really want this game to stay on top you gotta continue this great story line that you have set up. please dont fail us.. also some form of multiplayer or coop campain would only make this game EXTROINADRY not that it already isnt... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME. I will not deny there are some bugs in this game, but only a few game breaking. Easily resolved by reloading a recent save.

Yes.\nDoesn't that mean it looks terrible now?  No.\nBut isn't it a console port?  Are you asking if they released a different Witcher 3 game for console and PC?\nSo, how does it look then?  Fantastic. Beautiful. Breathtaking. Detailed.\nDon't you need two Titans to run this game on Ultra?  No. My GTX 780 works fine on Ultra.\nIsn't the game poorly optimized?  At 1080p on Ultra with a steady 60 frames, I wouldn't say so. My rig struggled to do the same with other recent AAA titles.\nBut what about the crashes?  Update your drivers and make sure to grab the day-one patch. Most of the complaints were made before the 30 MB update.\n\nAlright, so how's the story?  Do you like Game of Thrones?\nCombat?  It's hard. Really hard.\nI heard the combat was terrible.  It's a matter of opinion. You have to be careful. If you're used to button-mashing then you probably won't enjoy this game.\nOthers say the controls are terrible on PC.  Try a controller. My rule of thumb: if it's third-person it's better with a controller. Mouse-and-keyboard is for first-person.\n\nIf you don't enjoy this game, it isn't the game's fault. The Witcher 3 still resonates with the hardcore RPG crowd. If you didn't enjoy the other two Witcher games, there's likely nothing here that will make you enjoy this one.","May 20, 2015","true","31.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There's a lot of references to characters and events from the previous media, but CD Projekt Red did an admirable job of ensuring there's slim to no confusion -- and you'll get almost as attached to the characters as those of us who have read the books or played the previous games.\n\nSpeaking of CDPR, never has there been a developer so invested in the satisfaction of their fans. You've got to give these devs a hand because they welcome critiques, suggestions, comments or concerns. Putting out quality DLC weekly is undoubtedly excruciatingly hard work -- especially on top of the more lengthy DLCs and additional game(s) they're working on simultaneously -- work that CDPR has been more than willing to provide for us, their fans, for free. If you're looking for a game that, should you have an issue with a bug or glitch, you can contact the developers and see that glitch fixed in the very next patch... then you've found the right game, the right company.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let me elaborate upon my opening:\nA little buggy (hilarious bugs that occasionally break your immersion but absolutely are not game-breaking)\nHas some obnoxious characters (incredible characters. Even the irritating characters found in various side quests and heard belching and farting around Novigrad [...yep] can pique your interest -- What is their story? Where are they from? Where are they going? Why do they think their own bodily functions are so funny? I don't know, but I'd love to find out.\nYennefer and Triss... No words. Just. Play the game and you'll experience these two incredibly strong, awesome sorceresses.\nAll in all, this game is truly a masterpiece. If ever you've wanted to immerse yourself in another world, if ever you wanted to play as an extremely sexy male protagonist with snow white hair and a face that has been put through a blender, if ever you've wanted to experience the thrill of cutting off creatures' heads and hanging them as trophies over your horse's saddle...\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is for you. The best gaming experience of the decade. At least. For the foreseeable future, it's my go-to recommendation for anyone interested in a mature, open-world RPG. Or any game. Everyone needs this in their library.\n\nSo pick this up, ASAP. None of that "wait for a sale" BS. No. CDPR deserves every cent of the full retail value, and more.","August 5, 2015","true","135.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was easily the highlight of gaming in 2015 for me. For one the amount of endless hours I spent playing this masterfully crafted piece of art is undoubtly alot, the real question is if I regret it and no, I enjoyed every second that I spent on the game.\n\nIt has some of the best graphics that a PC game has to offer. It also delivers an experience that can last up to 200+ hours of gameplay/story. One of the biggest immersive, yet breathtaking open-worlds to grace 2015.\n\nSo much f*cking quests and side-quests it's unbelievable. The characters and world design are amazing and really captures the feel of the game completely, with tons of characters that are extremely likable.\n\nIt has an amazing perk system and the signs are very fun to use to get the upperhand on the opponents in battle. The combat on the really high difficulties can be insanely fun, it forces you to learn the enemy's attacks and attack patterns while dodging at precise times to overcome each enemy and it makes you feel like a badass.\n\nSpeaking of badass, Geralt of Rivia while not being the most intriguing character on the surface is a complete and utter badass, capable of getting all the puh a man, no a witcher can possibly need.\n\n2015'S GREATEST PORN SIMULATOR. 10/10","December 22, 2015","true","459.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So many returning characters and being able to import your save for your story decisions as well as understanding the story a lot better.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in my lifetime, there has been no game I've played with a better story. The story makes you feel so much empathy towards other characters, there are some moments that you will cry, laugh, and fell guilty. This game also has choices of dialog that will effect the story, the choices can really impact the stories pacing and even turn around the main plot. The gameplay is excellent, it's hard to find a game that's difficult yet very rewarding. killing basic enemies is easy, but the boss monsters are right at dark souls difficulty. This is open world too, but don't expect the freedom of Skyrim, the game relies more on story than freedom which I think is a fair trade. As much as I love this game, I must say it's not exactly perfect but close, because too many bugs hinder this game. There are a TON of bugs, but nothing ground breaking as far as I know. even though there has also been a lot of debates on the downgrade, I still think this game looks jaw dropping gorgeous. All the little details in the cities, and interiors. The scale of this game is amazing, I praise you CDPR for spending all your time on this masterpiece and hope to see more.","May 21, 2015","true","42.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Does the game live up to the GOTY? Is it properly optimized? Is it a work of art? Is it everything it I want it to be? Will it cure my chronic passiveness? NO, not the last one.\n\nThe game is god. So many beautiful experiences are packed so tightly, I have never had my mouth open in awe so often in any other game, at all. Altogether a full on beautiful experience and a beautiful finish at the top for the Witcher series, my absolute favourite as far as series go.\n\nNothing has come close to this experience yet after so long after so many months. Graphics are godlike, sounds are godlike, songs and immersion is godlike. The combat system and controls were a little crappy until the devs fixed it, it was after I finished the game. Most infuriating part was Roach deciding to socialize with a whole pack of high level wolves, then walking into a tree as I try to steer him out of there, then chickening out and throwing me off. Instakill. Fu Roach.\n\nAnyways that is fixed now. And PROPS to the devs as they still were fixing minor bugs months and months after release. I'm talking about 13 page minor bugfix notes. I have never seen any other big name dev do something so awesome after they sold the game. And they lowered the price a lot and it wasnt that high to begin with. With the Fallout 4 crap hitting the market at double the price for an insanely buggy and very poorly optimized game which still didnt get 1 non-beta fix after months of being on the market, I am very happy CDPR got the goty for TW3. I hope they show an example to other big names a little.\n\nWhat else. Play it. You wont find an experience as good and refined anywhere else, not yet. Probably not for another half a year I think.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/292030/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","This game is a very difficult game to review for me. Most things I'm about to say have probably been said by some other reviewer out there, but I can back up most of their opinions. Witcher 3 is a massive game. A very very massive game at that. The major issue with these games, however, is the fact that they're usually bland with generic filler side quests. Witcher 3, however, is an incredibly polished game with side quests that aren't meaningless, along with a world filled to the brim with something interesting going on around every corner. For reasons like these, Witcher 3 has been highly praised by the entire gaming community. In fact, people are going as far as calling this one of the best games of all time. I don't think Witcher 3 is the next Ocarina of Time or anything like that, but Witcher 3 is definitely a really, really, really good game.\n\nGraphics\nI'm going to say this now: THESE GRAPHICS ARE "DOWNGRADED?" Are you actually SERIOUS with that? I find that incredibly laughable. Well, gamers nowadays do have ridiculous expectations (look at Fallout 4 if you need an example) so I guess that explains it. Witcher 3's graphics are INCREDIBLE, to say the least. The entire game is absolutely gorgeous, and is probably one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Just look at a few screenshots some people have taken for this game. One or two of them could easily justify my opinion on this.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay has had mixed reception. Some found it to be intense and enjoyable, while others found it to be really boring. I think the combat, for the most part, was very enjoyable. I found it much more fun actually being a little more tactical about how to approach an enemy rather than mindlessly chop an enemy up into tiny pieces. That being said, there are two flaws with the gameplay. The one that is more important, however, is how easy the game begins to get as time goes on. In the beginning, you'll be struggling with how to spend your money, and what skills you should level up. As time goes on, you'll be swimming in money, so that isn't a problem. Plus, since you have fancy armor and most of your important skills levelled, the game won't be as difficult or intimidating. That being said, if you don't overlevel yourself, then the game is still difficult in a much more exciting way. The other flaw I have with the gameplay is how AWFUL the fistfights are. I can't stand them. They're boring and usually really unfair, and that seems kind of ironic seeing how you're playing as a superhuman mercenary. However, to make up for this, the world is massive and discourages going through the main storyline immediately, something I'm glad for. It is encouraged throughout the game you do the side quests, and it's actually very worthwhile. They feel like actual side quests rather than filler content. To give this game even more depth, you have a game inside a game, called Gwent. I'm not addicted to Gwent like other people, but it is actually pretty fun to play if you're bored. Overall, the gameplay has a lot of depth, although it does have a few glaring flaws.\n\nStory\nI've never read a Witcher book or played any of the games, so I walked into this not knowing much aside from who Geralt of Rivia and Triss Merigold were, along with knowing what witchers are. Because of that, the main story didn't appeal to me as much as other people, but it does get really exciting when you get farther into the game. The Battle of Kaer Morhen was one of the best parts to the game in my opinion. However, where this game shines most is how interesting the side quest stories are. As I said before, the side quests FEEL like side quests, instead of "kill this" or "fetch this for me" in basically every other open world RPG game out there. Because of this, it gives Witcher 3 even more depth and makes it even more detailed. The story overall gives this game life, and because of that, this game has gotten well-deserved praise.\n\nAudio\nThe voice acting is rather mediocre, personally. I did find it to be pretty forgettable. However, this game's soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It fits the mood perfectly, and makes up for the somewhat bland voice acting. The combat music is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat, while the overworld music is somewhat calming with a sense of sadness in it because of how dark and depressing the Continent really is. Not much to say here, but the music is extremely good.\n\nReplayability\nOverall, I wouldn't say that Witcher 3 is the strongest in the replayability. However, that being said, the game makes up for this because of the number of things you can do instead of just blowing through the main story. Those people who have 80-100 hours on the game are playing through it normally, along with some of the side quests. If you want, you can crank up the difficulty and do another playthrough. This makes the game 100x more exciting, and you might be able to get about 50-100 more hours of fun from doing that as well.\n\nVerdict\nOverall, I think Witcher 3 is an incredible game. It's massive, full of detail and depth, has an outstanding soundtrack, and so much more. It's not a perfect game and is not the magnum opus of the gaming industry. However, this game is definitely the new benchmark RPG for this generation because of the fact what it did right, it did extremely well. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this game, as long as you don't mind some points in the story where it'll slow down a bit.\n\nGraphics - 10/10\nGameplay - 8.0/10\nStory - 9.0/10\nAudio - 8.5/10\nReplayability - 7.0/10\n\n**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**\n\n\n.:9.4/10:.\n\n+Incredibly detailed\n+Gorgeous graphics\n+High quality side quests\n+Amazing soundtrack\n+Tons of depth\n+Huge world\n\n-Late game somewhat kills the mood\n-Fistfights","January 10","true","48.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

With Dragon Age Inquisition taking 2014's Game of the Year. This year another RPG game takes the crown in the name of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. A lot of RPG games have very great stories and presentations but no other game redefines the genre itself than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a massively open-world, action RPG game. Following the events of The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, the player once again takes the role of Geralt of Rivia. With his memories restored, Geralt now begins his search for his lover, Yennefer of Vengenburg. Their reunion would then lead to another search but this time, they'll be looking for the Child of Prophecy, Ciri. But finding Ciri is not the only thing the witcher should worry about as The Wild Hunt itself is also in pursuit of her.\n\nPRESENTATION - GRAPHICS: 10/10 MUSIC/SOUNDTRACK: 10/10\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt features a massive open world that removing the HUD can actually get you lost in a few minutes. The game's world is so engrossing that just following the main roads isn't enough. Drifting away from the main path is tempting especially for those who love to explore, as the game offers a lot of things to be discovered whether it's a bandit camp, a nest of monsters or better yet, some hidden treasures. The game also features a day and night cycle that largely affects not just how much can Geralt see through the dark but also some quests that requires to be done at at a certain point of the day.\n\nLike the first 2 witcher games, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt brings back its traditional way of having conversations with NPCs and other important characters. Some of them, however, requires the player to make a choice quickly as there will be certain points in the game that responses will have time limits. The game has very much improved on this part as compared to The Witcher 2 because the characters now show more emotion whenever they deliver their dialogues and how they react to what you have to say. It has also improved the game's graphics adapting a more brighter and more lively appearance compared to The Witcher 2's dark and serious graphics.\n\nSTORY - 9.5/10\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's story is weaker compared to what The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings has offered. But what pulls The Witcher 3 apart from other RPG games is the content of its sidequests. The Witcher 3 has a lot of sidequests scattered across the world map and each sidequest will always have a story of its own and a grueling decision for players to make. As how Witcher games go, being a hero is not always the answer and sometimes you have to choose well which is the lesser evil. The way The Witcher 3 challenges players to make difficult choices is one of its strong points as each choice carries its own consequence that may somehow affect other quests. The Witcher 3 has redefined what a sidequest really means to a game and that not only the main quest should have a solid storyline. After all, it's the sidequests that actually let's you know more of the game's world.\n\nGAMEPLAY - 10/10\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has also improved the game's combat system making it more fluid and elegant. A lot of players complain about the game's combat system but they somehow fail to see that this is an RPG game and you are playing as a witcher and not a swordsman who just hacks and slashes though everything. The combat system adapts to a witcher's fighting style. Monster battles are very unique in The Witcher 3 as there will be times that you need to prepare first before going for the kill as there are certain monsters that require you to use oils on your blades and drink potions and decoctions for additional status affects. The game's world is very unforgiving because even if you have a very high level, the player will still be prone to death whether they battle a low level monster or not. Despite such, the game doesn't prevent players from great challenges. Quests are labeled with what recommended level should the player pursue each one but you are still allowed to take it even if you're a lot of levels below the recommended level though a skull mark on a quest means certain death.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt also features a skill tree that will depend on what the player's preferred fighting style is. Whether you fight more with your blades or with signs or both depends upon the character build you make. The game also features fast travel points but with how unpredictable the The Witcher 3's world is, I somehow rarely used it since there are a lot of surprise/sudden events that occur in towns or on the road.\n\nI already finished the main game for over 100 hours yet there are still tons of things to do. Aside from hunting monsters, there are also treasure hunts that can help you acquire better and stronger witcher gears. There are also fist fights and horse racing but my favorite one is the Gwent card minigame. What's more is that upcoming expansions will then add more content into the game though it'll be not relevant to the main questline.\n\nPROS:\n+ Great graphics\n+ Great soundtrack/Voice acting\n+ Sidequests are full of content\n+ Choices matter\n+ Beard growth\n\nCONS:\n- Some minor open world bugs\n- Weak main story\n\n\nOVERALL - 9.8/10\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a MUST play. If you're looking for a game that's full of story content then look no further. I recommend this game to those who enjoy open-world/action/RPG games and to big Witcher fans out there. Whether you choose to romance Yennefer or Triss or both, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is no doubt one of the best games in 2015!","March 1","true","172.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This is game of the year for a reason.\n\nI clocked in a total of around 87 hours at time of writing this. I did a lot of the side quests, some treasure hunts, some witcher contracts and there is still so, so much more to play of this game yet.\n\nThe characters are amazing, there is so much depth throughout the characters you meet along your journey and they all add something of note to an already amazing tale.\nI can't actually believe it's over... I mean, it's not entirely over there's still 2 expansions.\n\nI will gladly buy the expansion pass, I will also gladly and with complete trust, be preordering Cyberpunk also and CD Projekt RED are truly amazing. They've supported us, the gamer, they've given us so much and I would love to give something back, and if that means throwing money at them for future releases I am certainly more than happy to.\n\nI haven't been able to sit and play a non multiplayer game for more than an hour or so at a time for well over a decade. This was the first game in a long, long time where I would literally lose an entire day just playing and experiencing everything this game had to offer, and there is just SO much it has to offer.\nI thought experiences like that were lost to me. A fond, distant memory of my childhood, never to be repeated or experienced again. This game however, has brought it all back in full, for me to experience, appreciate, love and spend hours upon hours in awe of a game is a wish come true.\n\nThere were ocassional bugs or glitches, though I only experienced one that was kind of 'game breaking' in that one of the boss fights (towards end game), I was left with an inactive boss, he just stood there, unflinching, not moving, just waiting for me to swing away.\nThough this and other small issues are easily overlooked as the rest of the game was just completely amazing.\n\nAgain, Thank you CD Projekt RED and anyone/everyone involved with creating this masterpiece. You've reminded me what it feels like to become fully immersed, enchanted by a game. I look forward to playing through the expansions soon.\n\n","January 8","true","90.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","2"

It's strong story foundation shines through every element, supported by great design and painstaking detail. It is heartbreaking, horrifying, hilarious, thought provoking, beautiful and inspiring.

You simply won't find anything that hasn't change for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story, which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes from this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something what makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the felling you are in there, in some village , city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which makes from every single battle - an unforgettable thing,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally something dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childish or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to put an end to his misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealth person (which he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content. Many of the things I struggled with had been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them.\n\nAll in all one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).","November 8, 2015","true","95.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So many returning characters and being able to import your save for your story decisions as well as understanding the story a lot better.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in my lifetime, there has been no game I've played with a better story. The story makes you feel so much empathy towards other characters, there are some moments that you will cry, laugh, and fell guilty. This game also has choices of dialog that will effect the story, the choices can really impact the stories pacing and even turn around the main plot. The gameplay is excellent, it's hard to find a game that's difficult yet very rewarding. killing basic enemies is easy, but the boss monsters are right at dark souls difficulty. This is open world too, but don't expect the freedom of Skyrim, the game relies more on story than freedom which I think is a fair trade. As much as I love this game, I must say it's not exactly perfect but close, because too many bugs hinder this game. There are a TON of bugs, but nothing ground breaking as far as I know. even though there has also been a lot of debates on the downgrade, I still think this game looks jaw dropping gorgeous. All the little details in the cities, and interiors. The scale of this game is amazing, I praise you CDPR for spending all your time on this masterpiece and hope to see more.","May 21, 2015","true","42.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The start can be slow and combat might feel infuriating and frustrating, but once you get a grip on it it feels really fun. The world is just massive and unlike some other RPGs I've played it doesn't feel dull, boring or bland at all. All the sidequests have their own little story behind them, they're not just kill and gather type of quests. The graphics (even after the "downgrade") are just amazing with the weather system being just stunning. The world feels really alive, with soldiers and bandits patrolling the roads, deer and wolves roaming the forest, the cities are like an ecosystem of their own and the dangerous monsters lurking in the caves and dungeons. It's the first RPG where I just could immerse myself in to. I played 7 hours on almost at one session. It even has it's own collectible card game, and it's not even a small one.\n\nMy pros:\n- Good graphics, weather system must have a note of its own\n- Combat is fun and challenging (I play on the highest difficulty)\n- Huge open world\n- Story is good, there's been a good few surprises\n- The card game, Gwent\n- Very immersive, it really feels like you are an witcher\n- Top-notch quality voice acting\n- Best bang for your buck. Since 5/28 I've played 67 hours and feel like I've done just half of what the game has to offer\n\n\nNeutral about:\n- Gwent, it feels too luck based\n- Game performance. I feel like I should better performance with OC'd 970 and OC'd i7 4790k 4.5ghz + 16gb ram.\n- For some, slightly including me, the combat even on the highest difficulty might feel just a little too easy. I might just be really good at the game, don't know.\n- The game has so much content it might feel overwhelming for some. This is a huge bonus for me though\n\nMy cons:\n- Somewhat clunky controls (using controller, prefer it over kb + m)\n- Occasional bugs, few crashes\n- Some very muddy textures\n\nMy tips for new players:\n\n( Might contain really light spoilers. Not story related )\n\n- Play on highest difficulty. It is really challenging, and killing boss monsters feel really rewarding\n- Don't start playing gwent too late\n- Invest in alchemy\n- Try to keep all the ingredients, trust me, you'll want them later on\n- Learn about strong monsters before encountering them\n- Learn to dodge, try not to roll too much\n- Loot pretty much everything. You'll be rich as f**k in a short while.","May 26, 2015","true","115.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","5","6","4","0"

I'm going to see how well it holds up after completing it, soon. So, let's begin the list of reasons why I love this game.\n\n1) It sticks to the key points in the story it originated from.\nI read the books first, before i ever played this game, and there is no describing how happy it makes me when the characters are chatting and they bring up the story of Dandilion and the Djinn from The Last Wish. I wont go any further into it because additional tidbits involve semi-spoilers, but if you read the books, the game is that much more wonderful.\nConversely, you by no means have to have read the books, or even played the previous games, to understand what's going on in this one. Sure, it helps for background stuff, but you'll still understand everything going on at all times, (except maybe the unicorn) so dont let that stop you from this amazing experience.\n\n2) The story itself is wonderful, in my opinion. The level of depth and detail to each character is so amazingly well done to the point where you can get reads of their opinions from the body language during a dialog scene, and you almost always have the ability to steer the conversation how you want it to go, defuse a situation or make it worse, start a blood fued or end one, etc etc.. The voice acting, too, is quite spectacular, and characters lips and faces are some of the most expressive I've seen to date.\nThere is one part in the story, for instance, where you listen a lady sing (she's part of a performing group) and it is hands down the best singing I've heard from a video game ever. As someone who went to an internationally acclaimed school of music for his voice, it was a fantastic experience.\nShortly after that, someone is greviously injured, and the person who loves them looks at you and says "Geralt, find them. Find whoever did this... and kill them." with such emotion that I wanted to shed a tear in sympathy and was furious as hell at the same time.\nThis is also the only game that I've enjoyed or gotten a great benefit out of 99% of the side quests in it, instead of doing them for the xp or something.\nFor instance,   I felt good after I helped an old lady find her best frying pan.\nI took the moral high ground and didnt take money after bringing someone the news that their loved on was dead, and got a reputation as a decent person, instead of a vile witcher, in that area.\nAbandoned villages can be repopulated, meaning more blacksmiths, armorers, herbalists, etc.3) The actual gameplay, combat and movement and such, is very well done. On the two easiest difficulties, you can be pretty confident, maybe a bit more care is needed once you get to big boss type stuff. But as soon as you go higher in difficulty, you feel very mortal in a very dangerous world.\nEach monster belongs to a class of some sort (ie necrophage, hybrid, spirit, etc) and each has a general weakness, like oils, but every single monster has a different attack pattern and/or ability, and usually a spell weakness that can be exploited. No cookie cutter formula here. You have to be able to anticipate the attack, dodge or roll out of the way the right way, and then know how much time you have to hit it before it strikes again. Feels like the glorious offspring of skyrim's open world and dark souls-esque combat, for a good reference point.\nThe world you fight these monsters in is, in a word, GORGEOUS. Each continent feels distinctly different, each area has it's own clothing style and accent, and every single bit of scenery is vivid and wonderful.\nAs an aside, the clothing and armor in this game is a world apart from anything else I've seen. As you journey, you can unlock different sets of "Witcher Gear" which grow more powerful as you upgrade them, AS WELL AS change their appearance. For instance, I played with the Cat School gear, and it starts out as a short sleeve shirt with a hard vest, then a light longsleeve with padding, then chainmail on the sleeves, etc etc. Really gives you the feeling that your armor is evolving with your character, and you're improving it and refining it as you grow more accustomed to it. And it stand out as clothes instead of a body suit, unlike most every other game I can think of.\nThere are some times that hitboxes and models can be a bit buggy (geralt can jump/float up a slant sometimes), and the occasional body bounces a bit further than it probably should, but it is honestly more funny than annoying, as it happens so rarely.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the story is 10/10, the gameplay is 9.9 out of 10, the world design and depth is 10/10, and the only regret I have after playing it through is I'll never get to experience playing it for the first time again. Such a wonderful journey.\n\n\nalso, dont forget to check out the (at this time) like 14 free dlc things that are all great.","November 12, 2015","true","164.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

The side quests all got cutscene and main story is well crafted with over 30 possible endings . The map freedom is huge and there is a lot of side activites to take part in. Graphics looks really sweet with good fps,  much better then console versions. The game is packed with easter eggs like from games of thrones and more. The detail in this game makes it one of the best game released lately. Though even if everything is good  i must say the combat is too simple,  you mainly use right and left mouse button for the combat and all the signs which triggers with Q. Ofc the combat is bit dynamic as you can dodge aswell but overall the combat could have been better. But if you like rpgs you must play this game!

Bloody Baron, Possession were some of my favorite side quests in the game. Soundtrack has done justice to the game. Detailing done on swords is amazing. A lot of focus has been done on dialogues and all the stuff that requires reading in this game.

I found a great deal for a GOG CDKey on a 3rd party website and took it. But I wanted the DLCs, and I can't buy stuff from GOG because of its payment methods, so I also bought it on this Steam sale. The fact that I paid twice for this game should speak for itself, but I'll write a more in-depth review too.\n\nI'll start off with saying that I'm a fantasy fan. So I might be a tiny bit biased. However, biased or not, this game is brilliant. Great story, great stroytelling. Great gameplay. Great graphics. Great voice overs. Great sound editing. I really cannot recommend it enough.\n\nI'll just list some pros/cons because I like lists.\n\nPros:\n1. AMAZING Stroy, with great storytelling.\n2. It's long. Very long. Long main questline, many, many interesting side quests, some of them unique.\n3. Great Writing! The dialogues are great, and they're really funny at times!\n4. Great gameplay, great combat, challenging at higher difficulties.\n5. Great graphics. It just looks awesome!\n6. Great animations. They look refiend, and real.\n7. Big map! The map is rather large, and there are many thigs to explore!\n8. Amzing dev! CD Projekt Red got developer of the year, and they deserve it. They listen to the community, they have implemented many things that people requested, they even worked on a holiday to fix a bug they had introduced on an update!\n9. Lots of easter eggs. Take my advice, read every book, letter and scroll you fine. You'll not regret it.\n10. Mod support. Not as vast as Skyrim e.g., but it has a Modkit and officially supports mods.\n\nThis game is amazing, but not perfect. It has a few cons, and I'll list them below.\n\nCons:\n1. Too many pointless collectibles. There are a lot of these "quesion marks" on the map, and most of them are useless.\n2. Too demanding. It looks great, sure, but it's too heavy on system resources, also, it doesn't scale that well. I mean, GTA V looks great (not as great as this, however) but it also looks ugly on low and runs on low end hardware. This game, however, doesn't run well on low-end hardware that well, and it doens't look that ugly on low. But it looks amazing on Ultra, and require equally amazing hardware.\n3. Mod support not as good as Witcher 2. Witcher 2 had better mod support.\n4. KB/M controls aren't great. I am only a PC gamer, and have never owned a console, so I can't really be biased towards controllers, but I can say this game is best played with a controller. There's little need for aiming (which, for the life of my I can't do with a controller) but fighting is just better with the controller. In fact, I bought a controller just to play this game propely.\n\nOkay, so all in all, amazing game. Title of the "Game of the year" was very well deserved.\n\nIf you're still skeptical on buying this, don't be. It's great. Just buy it.\n\nI give it 9.5/10","December 23, 2015","true","513.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

The only gripe I would have to say is the combat could be a little more developed. But after 130hrs in-game and DLC still coming if you are still on the fence about Witcher 3 definitely worth picking it up if you like RPGs and other games like Elder Scrolls, Metal Gear Solid, Fallout, and Diablo.\n\n\n\nOld Review after 10hrs:\nAfter getting it to work with patches and driver updates as well as spending an hour fixing the graphical settings so the game didn't crash every 20mins or so. It's been quite enjoyable and expect to sink many many hours into this one. If you didn't like The Witcher 2 all that much I'd suggest giving this one a go.

Huge maps, satisfying difficulty, lore, gameplay and story. Haven't had a single moment where I felt bored. So many quests to take and each one has a relatively unique story and doesn't feel like filler just for the sake of having content. They're thought out and each have their own story. The world is basically free of loading-screens, allowing you to seamlessly travel from one place to another on foot. Pretty much a masterpiece in terms of content. Money well spent.\n\nThere are currently a few bugs I frequently notice:\n- Game freezes at inventory screen; seems to be fixed if you turn off FPS limiter\n- Nvidia hairworks lags like mad; just turn it off completely really.\n- NPC's (in particular, filler peasants / guards) will appear literally right infront of you sometimes, a bit immersion breaking.\n- Sometimes mouse input is ignored. If attack button isn't working in combat, hit Q to cast a sign and it should fix it.\n- Softlock can sometimes be a bit awkward, as well as when the game determines you're in combat or not.\n- Not a bug, but horse movement is a bit poor at times.","May 23, 2015","true","150.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The game looks great in 1080p except I won't be blown away till i see it in 4K SLI.  The more time I invest in this game using a Keyboard and Mouse though,  the more apparent it becomes that this game was intended for a Controller, which I have no real problem with being a free roaming RPG.  However, when the game presents bugs that won't let me make choices using the keyboard (fast travel, selecting cards within the card game) but it WILL let me use my controller, it becomes an issue.  The crafting system has also been revamped, a change i'm not too fond of compared to the first two Witcher titles, however restocking has never been easier once a consumable has been crafted.\n\nThat being said I am excited to play to the end which is saying alot more than any of the dozens of other games i've purchased and have barely touched. The pro's of good story telling and interesting characters outweigh the con's.  The bugs I can deal with. I'm excited to learn more about the Wild Hunt and explore a large world map.\n\n","May 29, 2015","true","55.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

But since it released the game has received the amount of support that I expected from CD Projekt Red, and when I went to edit the review they had changed so much that I figured I'd save time by just rewriting it. Overall The Witcher 3 is easily one of the best RPGs I've played in years, if not the best, and it improves over the previous games in almost every way. There are still a few minor annoyances like the new XP system and the quest menu, but they aren't enough for me to consider them anything that would turn someone away from the game.\n\nI'd still definitely recommend playing the first two games first if you're new to the series, both because the game features a lot of returning characters from both games and because the main storyline builds on things that are only loosely explained in 3 and detailed more in the first two games, so while it's possible to enjoy the game on its own, you'll get a lot more out of it from playing the whole series even if you have to force yourself to finish the first game (which a lot of people seem to not like). It's worth buying either way, and since it's still getting active support and there are still a few free DLCs left on the release schedule (along with two expansions coming later on) it's probably only going to get better.","July 18, 2015","true","212.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Omnis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinbomnis/","370 products in account","An incredibly large open world RPG which draws you in and doesn't let go. An RPG which gives flavor and depth to all of its quests with brilliant writing and characters that are actually human. The world itself is incredibly gorgeous and detailed, from the trees to the swamps to the cities. The combat system is as deep or shallow as you want it to be, and you have the option of wanting to play the game as a master swordsman, a powerful mage, a cautious alchemist, or any combination of the three. Geralt of Rivia is a far better fleshed out protagonist than most RPG heroes, with his own backstory, unique skills and abilities, and philosophy, certainly no audience stand in here. I've beaten this game once already and can't wait til I have the time to enjoy it properly a second time around. This isn't just my vote for Game of the Year of 2015, but it is also possibly my favorite game I have ever played.","November 25, 2015","true","62.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Huge maps, satisfying difficulty, lore, gameplay and story. Haven't had a single moment where I felt bored. So many quests to take and each one has a relatively unique story and doesn't feel like filler just for the sake of having content. They're thought out and each have their own story. The world is basically free of loading-screens, allowing you to seamlessly travel from one place to another on foot. Pretty much a masterpiece in terms of content. Money well spent.\n\nThere are currently a few bugs I frequently notice:\n- Game freezes at inventory screen; seems to be fixed if you turn off FPS limiter\n- Nvidia hairworks lags like mad; just turn it off completely really.\n- NPC's (in particular, filler peasants / guards) will appear literally right infront of you sometimes, a bit immersion breaking.\n- Sometimes mouse input is ignored. If attack button isn't working in combat, hit Q to cast a sign and it should fix it.\n- Softlock can sometimes be a bit awkward, as well as when the game determines you're in combat or not.\n- Not a bug, but horse movement is a bit poor at times.","May 23, 2015","true","150.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

This my friends was the game my life was waiting for. Yes my life, not me but my life. I don't think my life will ever be the same again. Could I describe how much awe I am in? No not really. Check video reviews, or read about the game cause this game is a generational masterpiece.\n\nOh make sure that your system requirements can handle it. The game is quite demanding on specs. Don't get carried away and purchase the game then complain saying it has issues running on your system. If your system specs meet the minimum then you should be fine. Though I would recommend the recommended for some qaulity assurance. Regardless whether it is on High or Low. The games looks beautiful and is huge in scope. Did everyone mention how large of scope this game is? Did Everyone also mention how interconnected each region is? Yes Regions, each region is a size beyond that of a normal game scope. And there are many regions. Combat system is amazing. Difficulty can be quite high but this is a Witcher Game afterall. A war torn land? Check. A in depth combat system? Check. A moral line that can be broken at any time? Check. Oh did I mention that the story is ******* beyond good as well. Yup. Oh also you can hunt monsters. Who doesn't want to hunt monsters? Like that is soo badass.\n\nI end on that note to continue hunting. Buy the game people (But please buy the console version if your rig cannot handle it. I urge this. So many people have foolishly bought the game without any hindsight and found that the game either runs sluggishly or not at all so do take my advice here).","May 19, 2015","true","6.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Its taken a step back in the right direction and renewed the feel of the first Witcher game.  There's a real atmosphere that i always felt was missing in Witcher 2, a dark, frightening world sense, something you cant put your finger on. Contracts are also improved, some you have to take time to look into, not simply go and kill a monster.  The graphics are very impressive, more so if you have the kind of rig to run the game at ultra spec. And lets not forget the new game Geralt gets to play, I've already spent far to much time on that alone.\n\nSo yeah, in a nutshell then, if you loved the first game, or even the Witcher series as a whole, you NEED this game in your life, or to replace your life, which is very likely.

But I seriously recommend trying the hardest difficulties as they prove a decent challenge. Please note however, the first zone you are left to explore is just the starting area and serves as a prologue to the game where you get most of the tutorials, also the combat isn't particularly difficult during this part of the story. So don't be disappointed if you find the starting zone rather easy, soon you will find yourself in a much bigger area filled with so much content and many enemies over your level, you will learn to choose your fights carefully, specially at the starting levels.\nThe feeling of adventure is always there and you can find more often that not something fun to try next time you visit a place.","May 25, 2015","true","146.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The comparison of this game to Elder Scrolls: Skyrim is one even I myself have done and discussed with many other gamers I know who were on the fence about this title. Very few games have accomplished amazing graphics, story, combat, ui, crafting, character development, exploration, questing, etc. all within one game. The norm has become focussing on a few of those areas and lacking in the rest. The Witcher 3 has hit all of those marks and more for me, I've not enjoyed an rpg this much since the launch of Skyrim.\n\nI'd recommend this game to any gamer, whether casual or hardcore as you can loose yourself into it just as much in 30 mins of play as you can in 3 hours. I went from barely giving Witcher games a thought to becoming a new fan that will follow whatever this IP comes up with in the future due to this game. I'm a hardcore pvp gamer who rarely finds the time to or has the patience to do pve or enjoy stories, yet I can't get enough of this game and haven't played another game since it's release, nor do I plan to for weeks to come. This is just further evidence at how well done this game is, in the end after over 15 years of hardcore gaming (hundreds of games) this game has become my number 3 favorite rpg of all time following Kotor 1, and very closely behind Skyrim.\n\nThanks for reading and best of luck in your adventures,\n- Alomar (hooked)","May 25, 2015","true","162.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Sad to see the series end. I felt every action I took in the game had an impact somewhere else. The contracts to complete on the endless varieties of monsters feel rewarding, and every side quest, no matter how sizable, felt important and like it was supposed to be in the storyline, which is more than can be said for many RPG games. The in-game world is beautiful, as are the details that went into each piece of armor and each individual character, even peasants and common guards.

The kind of good way that there are not many other games with similar atmosphere and feel. The game has a solidly fun but not overly polished combat system, even still it manages to stay interesting for a very long time because the difficulty varies due to the vast array of different enemies you can face and their strengths and weaknesses. The game has a story albeit a fairly uninteresting one since the game universe is not that old and lore full yet, it's the smaller stories that are more interesting, the ones of side quests given by local peasants in their small villages that are more fun and interesting than the main story. Although the game manages to keep fresh and interesting for a very long time during your playthrough, the game does have a number of flaws. For instance the controls sometimes bug out and do something else than you want. And there is no animation for eating food in your inventory. Mostly minor things like that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/srvnormandy/recommended/292030/","srvnormandy","GeriatricSix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/srvnormandy/","274 products in account",""If you're looking for a "skyrim experience" then go plough yourself"\n- Punished Jensen, 2015, "A half-♥♥♥♥♥ review of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"\n\nRight now I have 51.1 hours played. Of those 51 hours, I spent at least 27 drifting around the starting area killing monsters, reading books, taking screen shots of geralt's glorious beard, and frolicking in the woods. Barely even touched the main story since I can't help but explore every single nook and cranny I come across. Did I mention you can frolick in the woods all you want? When I'm not shouting like DSP going "♥♥♥♥IN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T, I COULDN'T BLOCK THAT!" or "I'M PRESSING BUTTONS, AND I'M STUCK ON NOTHING!" or especially the famous "I DIDN'T DO THAT!" I'm truely having a blast playing this masterpiece. As someone who's played and loved The Witcher, then suffered though the witcher 2's console combat while still loving everthing else, I can truely say it's a big step up. You can actually dodge attacks properly this time around instead of playing "The Roller 3: Another Roll" like I was initially expecting. If you're not some pleb that plays on easy or normal, then congrats, you got yourself a challenging game with challenging combat for a challenging challenger such as yourself. All about timing and not being a dumbass. Combat is fast-paced and with the way you move and don't have that aweful 2 combat that made fighting groups a nightmare now, you really feel like a Witcher, instead of like 2 where you were a guy with 2 swords who occassionaly does a pirouette in combat, loves to roll around in the dirt and who has a hard time fighting more than 2 pot bellied bandits at once especially without rolling away.\n\nSigns are no longer trash like in 2, where you had to put points in witcher training to unlock the other skills, then pour MORE points in those skills so you can FINALLY use aard on more than one person. in 3 ya start out with all your skills, and they're useful like they were in 1, where aard can blast multiple people away. igni can burn multiple people, axii stops em or takes control of em when upgraded, yrden slows em down, and that one sign I'm too lazy to name still saves your skin.\n\nThe weapon variety is nice, though I've only used the other things like axes and clubs for coins. The crossbow is a pretty cool addition to your equipment, though I mainly use it for hunting deer, rabits, and harpies in the sky. When your not finding new weapons, you'll find plenty of diagrams to make some pretty neat swords and whatnot for that cool guy with the beard you play as (if you don't play with a beard in game with a beard in real life, you ain't playing the game correctly).\n\nRemember those ballin jackets from The Roller 2? The ones you'd probably wear outside on occasion that gets you thumbs-up from neck-beards and strange looks from the normal citizens that wear yoga pants with holes in em that, if you stare for to long at they'll call you a pervert while you're wondering why they would even wear that in the first place if they DIDN'T want people to stare at? Yeah, those neat jackets that none of your pairs of cargo shorts go with. Those are gone. Instead we get some armors that you'd keep in your attic for when times are hard and you need paper to keep the power in your generic laptop with a 1366x768 resolution laptop that got 8 fps on the Roller 2 powered along with your microwave  for your ramen noodles. While they perform well and keep you very well protected, they don't look cool, which is the most important part. The best looking armor is your starting armor, and it's effectiveness really starts to wane after the start. So basically, ya wanna look cool? You're punished. You want armor that protects you well? Well, here ya go, though I'll be laughing at you behind my lvl 1 Kaer Moran Warrior Jacket while wearing a monical with my beard swaying in the wind.\n\nSTORY! Well, of this is your first witcher game, then kill yourself. If you skipped 1 and jumped to 2 just to play 3, then kill yourself. If you read all or at least most of the books, played 1 AND 2 and killed letho then you need to kill yourself. If you at least played 1 and 2, then your an ok guy who still never understands any of the neat references the games make at all as you turn into dsp and go "wut?". Shaming aside, the story is pretty good soo far, though for me it's all about being a heavily mutated proffessional monster slayer who loves frolicking in the woods. Things make sense. You are neither being confused nor spoonfed a story like a telltale or sony "game". You're a witcher. You go in, have geralt say some wise-♥♥♥ things, avoid a few fights here, slay some plebs there, plough a few wenches here and there. You want the actual story, play it.\n\nGrafix. They're still damn nice even though THE DOWNGRADE OF DOOM was true. Though it's nowhere near as bad as some may have told you. The game on ultra blows the console version out the water. The game on high blows the console versions out the water. the game on medium blows the console version out the water. The game on med-low IS the console version, with a cinematic 24 fps that never stays at 30! And don't forget, one of em can't even do 1080p! (But don't tell them that ;))\n\nBest game I've played in years, and only game I've pre-ordered in years without feeling ripped off. Always trust slavs and ♥♥♥♥♥s with your money (except Sergei who owns STALKER now, spending the games budget on more cars doesn't instil trust you) japs, maybe, even if they can't make a non-vita/mobile game to save their lifes that isn't a VN. And even then the ports are trash.\nAlso did I even mention how much I've enjoyed frolicking in the woods? Really brings me back. See, back in my day I found some woods and started frolicking in them and...\n... so I said to the wench, "It ain't ♥♥♥♥ if you were frolicking in the woods BEFORE you were seen."\n\nDamn fine game.","May 24, 2015","true","396.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I expected a game with a decent amount of content and a polished presentation.\n\nHowever, by the end of my 150 hour playthrough, likely the first of many, I was convinced that Witcher 3 is one of the best games I've ever played. A masterpiece.\n\nSuperficial stuff first, this game is gorgeous. Have to stop myself from taking too many screenshots. Wind, rain and other weather clearly all have an effect on the environment. Trees sway in windy conditions and everything looks appropriately wet in a storm. I'm not running it on ultra either and it's definitely one of the prettiest games out there.\n\nThe music is fitting of each area. The murky swamps of Velen get somber string tracks that fit the feel of the area's subplot, while Novigrad and its surrounding areas get city-appropriate music. None of it is annoying or hard to listen to, just adds to the mood of the stories that the game tells.\n\nThe game's massive amount of content and massive world blew me away. Witcher 2 was set in very beautiful, atmospheric, but small environments. Witcher 3, like its predecessor, remains beautiful and atmospheric, but it's also huge.\n\nThe gameplay is notably similar to Witcher 2, and I have little problem with this. Leveling system isn't perfect but it's not a bad design. Finding new gear, armor, weapons, etc is all still quite enjoyable. Just what you'd expect from an RPG. Plenty of replayability, multiple ways to play it, etc -- you get the idea.\n\nOh, yeah, there's also Gwent. Gwent is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.\n\nWhile a lot of the explorable places of interest and caves are repetitive and not as involved as a dungeon in an Elder Scrolls game, the size of the world itself easily rivals an Oblivion or Skyrim. I expected an open world, but never one of this scale.\n\nThe game is absolutely filled with quests, contracts, and treasure hunts which, perhaps excluding the treasure hunts, all have great writing. Quests I expected to be simple and straightforward proved instead to be complex moral dilemmas.\n\nI was impressed after the first few quests that did this, but this game is consistent, and throughout the game you'll be confronted with meaningful choices and stories that will challenge you to think. I have never seen a game of this scale and size that has such consistently good writing in the stories it tells. An incredible accomplishment.\n\nEven witcher contracts are given more intrigue and suspense by the 'Aragorn-style' witcher senses mode they added where you reconstruct crimes, whereabouts of others, and the prey you're hunting. It's not huge, but it definitely adds a dimension to the gameplay and makes sense given Geralt's occupation.\n\n*SOME VAGUE SPOILERS AHEAD*\n\nThe story is, like the rest of the quests and stories, phenomenal, with a couple missteps (also super long, guessing 50-60 hours). Unlike Witcher 2's conspiracy-ridden narrative, (which switched frequently between chasing Letho and uncovering someone else's dumb plot to do this or that) Witcher 3 wisely decides to, early on, give the player a clear motivation -- a compelling and personal motivation for Geralt. It's an easy and effective way for the writers to get the player invested in both Geralt and Ciri's stories.\n\n(While I'm no crazy feminist, I thought it also worth mentioning that both Cerys and Ciri proved intelligent, strong-willed and multifaceted female characters. Writers did a good job with pretty much all the characters)\n\nThe more personal/focus on finding Ciri part of the story lasts from the end of the prologue to the end of the player's time in Skellige. Given how long this part (Act 1) of the game is, I had thought the story would end with finding her.\n\nThese initial 30-40 hours involve retracing Ciri's footsteps, learning about how she's changed, and why the Wild Hunt is after her. In order to retrace her steps, you'll have to, as you would expect in an RPG, do favors for others. This would be bad were they fetchquests, but each set of chores you're forced to do before finding out about Ciri's story ultimately proves a meaningful and compelling subplot of it's own.\n\nIn acts 2-3 of the game, the player finds Ciri. Ciri, Geralt, and their allies bring the conflict with the Wild Hunt to a head, among numerous other conflicts. A lot of this part involves how other characters want control of Ciri and her powers, the player's decisions in how they interact with Ciri, what Ciri's destiny is, and the end of the world.\n\nThis is to say that the story quickly shifts from a very personal, emotionally-driven narrative in act 1 to a very broad, complex, and fast-paced narrative in acts 2-3. The game warns you of this change indirectly and the demarcation between the two is pretty obvious.\n\nI expected the narrative, having lost its focus on retracing Ciri's footsteps and learning her story, would spiral out of control trying to juggle so many characters, subplots, and themes at once.\n\nRemarkably, it didn't spiral out of control at all. Everything comes to a clear and satisfying end and most of the events are given appropriate foreshadowing and buildup. The 'White Frost' could've used a bit more explanation and exposition -- why is it happening, why does it exist, etc. However, for the most part, the ending of the game is handled well.\n\nOf course, I just mean everything leading up to the ending, the actual ending depends on the decisions you made -- and those have huge effects.\n\nNot a perfect narrative, but a very strong, compelling and long one, and most games make so many missteps in their narratives that Witcher 3's is definitely exceptional.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is exceptional in so many ways that calling it anything but a masterpiece would be a great disservice to it.","July 22, 2015","true","400.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I truly lose myself in this game, the story just pulls me in. I LOVE IT!\n\nAlso, I wasn't sure about getting this at first because of some problems I had with Witcher 2.

Benchmark has been set for pretty much every other developer, currently running 2715 x 1527 and even sub 60FPS the graphical fidelity makes the game a pleasure on the eyes, knocked back to 1920 x 1080 / 70+FPS for fights that have a lot of mobs on the screen.\n-Longevity. First playthrough came in at around 80 hours and I missed A LOT of stuff. Currently on my second playthrough and build Which I fully intend to take into NG+.\n\nCons\n-Can be too long for somebody who doesn't 'dig' the lore and backstory.\n\n11/10\n\n'Lambert, lambert...

Will take at least 100 hours of play time to complete everything. Lots of cutscenes where you control the dialogue. Your choices in these cutscenes literally change the course of the game which leads to nearly countless replay opportunities.\n\nThe world and everything in it is beautiful. High quality textures, lighting, etc. Best looking game of this sort I've ever played. I run the game with a GTX 770 and AMD 8350, 16 GB RAM and get a constant 50+ FPS.\n\nCrafting, side quests, collecting, mini games, it literally has everything. Not to mention all the free DLC. This developer made one of the best games of all time with Witcher 3.\n\nThe only thing missing IMO would be something similar to the Hearthfire DLC in Skyrim where you could build/customize your own home to display your trophies and other collectibles. It is not necessary though and I fully enjoyed the game without this.\n\nDEFINATELY NOT FOR CHILDREN. IF YOU ARE A PARENT BUYING THIS I WOULD RECOMEND 14 AND UP.
