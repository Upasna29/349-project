It is relatively easy but still poses a challenge, it has beautiful graphics (not necessarily realistic but none the less beautiful) and it is entertaining.\n\nThere are things that could be inproved and full price is a bit steep for what you get but if this game is in the sale then TAKE IT because you will not be dissapointed! Thumbs Up!","December 10, 2014","true","10.9"," 51 of 72 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","51","72","0","0"

Sometimes it can be annoying when the young people can't afford the prices and the rich people need more workers so to please everyone (lowering prices and increasing workers) you make no profit so simply ignoring their needs makes much more money.\n\n6.5/10 This game taught me to be heartless for money.
