I did however enjoy their other demo, with a supernatural twist, Cafe O Mermaid: The Drowned Mermaid. They also have another game, How to Take off your Mask that has been greenlit.\n\nPlease consider this review an initial impression .East Tower - Akio is part of a series of four inter -related games with three more due for release having been already been greenlit:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=329794198&searchtext=East+Tower\n\nSome demos can be played here: http://www.roseverte.net/east/en/\n\nThis is described as as a girls mystery comedy visual novel. Though the ideas presented in this such as a virtual reality world and hackers aren’t necessarily new it makes a change from a typical high school setting and slightly older characters. The japanese voice acting is also good. I think they could be interesting enough for any male visual novel readers as the love ending is easy enough to avoid/skip .Please note that you will not get a perfect game, which is very quick and easy, by doing this.\n\nI feel that the pricing is slightly high for the content and the artwork is just passable.However  this is at the lowest end of visual novel pricing and appears to be in line with other titles.My recommendation is if you don’t already own this from a bundle is to wait for the other character routes as you may be left wanting more.","May 6, 2015","true","4.5"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","37","44","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/354950/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","The story of East Tower: Akio shocked me a bit at first. It is about a girl that likes to dress like a man and act like a man. She is given the opportunity to test a new virtual reality game, in which everything she imagines comes true. And, as anticipated, she chooses to have a male appearance in this game. Because of some hacker, she becomes trapped in this virtual world with other 4 people and she teams up with another boy to find the escape. This is an Otome, so I think we can all imagine where this is going...\n\nI didn't know at first how to feel about this opposite gender orientation but I decided to continue playing and what seemed in the beginning to be a game about transsexuals turned to be Sakuya's story of discovering herself and accepting her gender through love. And this is the only reason for which I decided to give this game an upvote (because I enjoyed the idea of “Love conquers/changes everything”), despite the fact that I didn't like quite a few aspects.\n\nFirst of all, her love interest is a bit controversial too, he often makes you wonder if he is bisexual or not, since he is attracted to Sakuya despite her male appearance in the game -- all of this culminating in the declaration that he likes her even in her male form.\n\nSecondly, the dialogues are a bit childish and nonsensical at times, and there's a whole chapter before the end that did not make any sense at all to me. I tried to find a deeper meaning to it, but I failed miserably.\n\nThirdly, it is a visual novel so we expect to have only a few backgrounds, but I didn't expect them to be THAT few. Even more so, most of them have a lot of repeating elements.\n\nAs gameplay, you are supposed to get through 7 stages of the virtual game. Each of them has a set of 2-3 choices. There are usually two right combinations, one that counts towards the romance ending and the other one that counts for the normal ending. All others result in an immediate ending and you are required to play through the stage again, starting from the beginning. The normal ending seems quite dull and emotionless, while the romance path unlocks an extra steamy scene. The effects of the choices you make while playing aren’t always easily foreseeable according to the ending you are going for, so you have to play through pretty much all of them to see their results.\n\nAkio is the first episode of the 4 which the series consists of; considering how short this visual novel is (a bit over 1h for unlocking both endings and achievements), I think its price (4,99€) is a bit too high for the quality that the game offers.  And considering that you might want to try the other 3 episodes, the price of the full series becomes excruciatingly high.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","May 27, 2015","true","3.5"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","30","39","0","5"

Very short. If you are going to get this series then you are better off buying all of the East Tower chapters at the same time. The art is meh, but the overall storyline is interesting; I have found this game more interesting than some games that have had amazing art, but crap story. Its a pure visual novel with choices, so no stat building or anything. It is very easy to 100% this game in one sitting.\nThe main character is female, but she tends to dress and act like an boy. She convinces her fmaily member (brother, cousin? I  don't remmeber) to let her participate in this virtual reality game demo aimed at guys. She dresses up as a guy and the games begin. In the game everyone appears as their heart really desires, so the MC is male in the game world. Also everyone gets trapped in the game, and the main focus is to get out. The game is romantic, but you only interact with whatever East Tower-Character Name you purchased. Since this is East Tower-Akio, Akio is the romanceale guy.","December 12, 2015","true","2.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/354950/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Sakuya is a woman wishing to be a man since an incident in her childhood. She makes everything in her power to look like one. Her cousin Daiki works for Dreamworld and needs her help to try a new virtual attraction called West Tower, reserved for women. However, Sakuya managed to convince him to let her try the East Tower, reserved for men. She ends with four other testers, trapped in the virtual world, though she's happy to see that she's a man in it...\n\nThis is the same beginning in each Each Tower game. Once in the virtual world, Sakuya will team up with one of the guys. In the first of the series, she's Akio's partner, whose virtual form is a child. East Tower is an attraction that will confront everyone to their own insecurities and fears.\n\nI will go straight the point: this is a visual novel, where you have choices to make. Each stage must be cleared to advance in the story, you don't have any skills or relationships to improve/destroy. However, choices are mattering: you can get a bad ending immediately where you have to begin the stage again (not the entire story), a best friend ending (by scoring A on each stage) and a romance ending (by clearing each stage with a S). If you follow the romance route, you'll end up with an extra chapter. However, some stages don't have a A rank, only a S one - in that case, for the best friend route, it's considered as if it was a A.\n\nChoices are generally made during the challenges proposed for the team. It's much rare to see them outside of them, before or after them. True, without skills or anything to worry, the game is easier than any other visuel novel I've already played (apart Shan Gui, which is more an interactive book), even the first Heileen was more complex and even Blue Rose was more complicated. I don't mind at all this lack of difficulty.\n\nI find very interesting the fact that the guy will be your best friend at the end, as the bad ending isn't a "you're alone", "you're killed", etc.. However, should you choose to pursue him, it means that your character is also evolving and accepting herself more.\n\nLet's speak about Akio. He seems very calm, cold and trusting no one than himself. However, thanks to Sakuya, Akio will reveal the reason of this attitude and will also evolve and be more friendly. It's a very interesting evolution. I really liked being in a team with him. I'm now with Takashi and while it's also interesting, I still prefer Akio, maybe because his voice was soothing.\n\nIndeed, the visual novel has voice acting... in Japanese. I don't understand a thing but as the subtitles are in French (else, they're in English), I could follow the story. The only character not voiced is you. However, I find it really good. It's always fun to hear something in a foreign language, it's reminding me some good memories with some anime.\n\nAs for the style, it's really in a manga style, reminding me of The Rose of Versailles or anything directed to girls - because it's clearly stated in the official website that it's a visual novel for them (but everyone is welcome to play it). I loved it, even if Akio seemed a little weird. I also loved the HUD, kinda hi-tech and with a good shade of green.\n\nThe music is very good too, very adapted to each scene. I really liked it.\n\nEast Tower: Akio is a little good moment I've spent. without having to think too much. It's not the best visual novel out there, I admit that, however, it's still worthy of a purchase.","April 6","true","2.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

On the one hand, I appreciate original concept, on the other there are some issues with it. So basically our female protagonist is taking part in some sort of virtual reality contest. There's an important gender-bender element - she wakes up in a male's body. This is something she clearly wants, not only inside this game, but in general. At the same time she's still interested in other males... But for same reason she's creeped out by the two males dating...? I didn't really understand that part and the logic behind it. Also, although she clearly want to be a man, whenever she find herself interested in her teammate, she's transforming back to girl....? It's another weird thing, because even though this game don't get too much into serious issues, there are few moments that seems to show and critique how judgefull people can be. While in the same time, I feel like the message is: "Well, she may acted like she want to be man herself, but nope, she just need this right man to change her mind". I like the whole explanation that this is: "about person, not about their gender", but still, the "I wanted to be a man, because everyone says girls are weak, but now I just want you" it's just... Meh. It's not something important in terms of gameplay, it's just something that bugged me within the plot and I couldn't get past it.\n\nAs for general things:\n\nPros:\n+ writing is pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but there are funny and cute moments.\n+ interesting concept\n+ interesting protagonist (especially if we compare her to regular female protagonists in VNs)...\n\nCons:\n- ... but as the game progress and I've learn her motives, she seemed more childish than strong\n- short, even as for part of a series\n- romance is so... out of nowhere, really. The "seduction" scene felt very awkward and rushed\n\nIf the other parts are about the same length and quality, I can't imagine it being worth almost 30 euros.\n\nBut as for game that I've got as a part of a bundle, it was still rather enjoyable experience, despite all the flaws. Try it if you like visual novels.","January 1","true","4.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/354950/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","East Tower-Akio is a fun, otome visual novel made by the same developer as dUpLicity~Beyond the Lies, the developer's first game to make it on Steam.  For those who weren't fans of dUpLicity, I can say that East Tower-Akio is very different and in ways, it's an improvement.  For one, the art style is better and the faces are more realistic although they are still in the anime style.  Also, the writing is more light-hearted but that is no surprise, as the East Tower series takes on a more comedic tone although it has mystery as its main element.\n\nAs there are already summaries of the story posted, I won't repeat them.  Rather, I'll give what I liked about the game as well as some negatives.  I liked how you can pursue two paths here-a friendship and a romance path.  On my first playthrough, I went for the friendship path, as I usually reserve the romance paths on my final playthrough.  Akio is a serious character but once the MC gets to know who he truly is underneath, I found myself to like him, as he comes to care for the MC in return.  So the story itself appealed to me.  Also, I liked how it takes place in a virtual reality dreamworld.  Although it's not the most original idea, I like the concept of being in a world where you can imagine your dreams becoming reality through sheer willpower.  As I mentioned earlier, the art is better as well although it's a personal preference.\n\nAs for criticisms, I only have a couple.  First, I noticed that there were a few awkward phrases that could have been reworded better.  However, as they only appeared in a few lines, this is such a minor criticism.  As for the other, this is more of a personal preference but I wasn't a fan of how this game is split into four parts rather than just made into one huge game with four paths.  Now I do understand why this was the case but I tend to prefer playing VNs that have all the paths readily available so I can choose which one to play first.\n\nOverall, though, I did enjoy this first game in the series and getting acquainted with the mystery behind East Tower.  I can't wait to try out the other paths soon and see how they compare.","August 30, 2015","true","4.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/recommended/354950/","dandk","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/","1554 products in account","A short average Visual Novel with an entertaining storyline, the first part of the East Tower series delivers an hour of acceptable immersion as we are introduced to the struggling female protagonist entering a virtual dream world attraction with a group of men, one of which serves as the romance interest for this particular game, competing their way through stages contributing to increasingly contrived feelings and advancing the deeper plot.\n\nGameplayThe game itself is divided into seven stages of the meta-level game, each of which must be passed during a complete playthrough. Being a practically linear VN, the story only branches extremely lightly with bad choices leading to restarts of each stage, while good choices lead to either S- or A-rank passes, depending on the quality of the choice. These are the only decisions the player makes throughout the game.\n\nStoryApart from the very superficial first impressions of the characters, the VN does accomplish to use the stage design to gradually form a bond between the protagonists, slowly revealing their pasts and secrets and bringing them closer. With that said, the entire romance part is still dangerously cliché. Thanks to the unusual setting, the overall combination, while definitely not groundbreaking, does manage to deliver some fresh air to the genre, but not in the sense that it would lure in many people that are not positive towards VNs in the first place.\n\nThe ending is simplisticly conclusive but does provide a cliffhanger for the next episodes in the series.\n\nGraphicsAs many recent VNs suffer from, both characters and backgrounds are crudely rendered and severely lack dimension. Faces are portrayed awkwardly and it subtracts from the realism in an otherwise fine story. The amount of backgrounds and character expressions is extremely limited and some are repeatedly used in less appropriate settings. This is an example of many recent VN publishers that have started to favour quantity over quality, and is overall reducing the average of the genre.\n\nMediaThe main protagonist is supposedly the player's avatar, despite a lot of events in the game seemingly not designed for that. Because of this, her speech is not voiced, while all the male characters' are. I find this to be a very poor choice from the developers as not only could this be interpreted in the wrong way, but it simply destroys the atmosphere when one character is mute while others talk (GTA V anyone?) It makes the game feel incomplete.\n\nThe cutscenes are also the trademark of low-budget VNs, a mixture of theme music with clippings from the game's character portraits and with random quotes from the game passing by the screen (as seen in the Steam trailer). In my opinion, if you cannot make a proper intro, you'd be better off not passing off that kind of work as one and just skip it entirely.\n\nOn a positive note, the various mood music throughout the game does manage to hit its cues and set the atmosphere as it should.\n\nAchievementsAll achievements in the game are very easy to obtain by the length of two playthroughs, picking S-rank and A-rank choices, respectively (saving at a branching point to obtain the carrot ending). By completing S-ranks you unlock each stage's epilogue which eventually unlocks all the CGs. There is a great 100% in the Community Guides section.\n\nOverallEast Tower - Akio manages to deliver a decent, refreshing story covered in the average artwork of mediocricy that is dominating certain mainstream VNs today. It is quite short, and prospective buyers should most likely obtain this in a bundle key or similar for it to be worth it. However, if your mind is tuned for a little trip down VN lane with a drop of feels, then I do believe you can get a good experience out of it.\n\nPros  Cons  Entertaining story  Quite short  Poor artwork\nGameplay: N/A\nStory: 7/10\nGraphics: 5/10\nMedia: 5/10\n\nOverall: 7/10","August 6, 2015","true","6.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

If this review peaks your interest, I would recommend buying the whole bundle as it is cheaper than buying each one individually. And the 4 games together give about 15+ hours of game play.\n\nI was surprised at how much I ended up liking game. I think a lot of that has to do as a Otome game addict I was getting a little burnt out on the mobile games. (When I say burnt out, I think I have played the main story line of more than 80 characters on mobile otome games.) East Tower Akio is the first installment the series. The order which the game is recommended is Akio, Takashi, Kuon then Kurenai. I would recommend this game even to just VN fans (not necessarily otome fans) because it explores interesting themes and has a great overarching plot.\n\nThe story is what got me hooked on this game, I love a different story than your more standard otome game that ET has. The Akio story line is just the very start of the whole ET series and made me interested in buying the whole ET series. It is the first building block to the whole ET series. I especially like how this game explores gender related sexuality in a very interesting way. Gender fluidity is something much different to be explored in a VN/Otome game, especially for a Japanese market. Sakuya (the MC, name changeable) bends the standard female protagonist role, rebelling against the female stereotype, actually starts the virtual game as a male character.  I think that Akio maybe my favorite character out of all the boys.\n\nThe voice acting is very nice for an indie game. I liked some of the unique voices in the game (Daiki specifically). I wouldn't say that there is any blaring miscasts in the voice acting. Of course this being an indie game, there aren't the big shot seiyuus (voice actors) to really make the voice acting really shine.\n\nI was not big on the art style that ET has, but I grew attached to the characters anyway, which is a good sign as the likeability of the character is not just based on the art. I would say the thing that bothers me the most is the roundness of the faces, especially the young versions of the characters. I think of all the VN/Otome games ET has to take the cake on roundness of faces. There are more CGs than I was expecting for an indie game. The backgrounds in ET are interesting, I really like how the game world is portrayed. I would really say that the only (slight) drawback to this game is the art style, but it is still nice in its own way.\n","August 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It felt more natural and balanced drama-humour better than Akio, and i grew to love Takashi as a character. But still, the first two, they're only the beginning.\nI fell in love with East Tower during Kuon's story. In my opinion, it's much better written than the first two, and balances out everything surprisingly well, even though plot gets more complicated than in previous games. It completely sucked me in and made me enjoy every second i spent playing.\nAnd then, finally, Kurenai. Now that one is good. I shouldn't be surprised, since there are signs like, you know, order of routes or increasing price, and yet. I still can't believe how Kurenai managed to meet all my expectations and then exceed them.\nKurenai tells you everything you wanted to know and more. It uncovers the whole story, and doesn't leave anybody out. The amount of choices combinations is just stunning, and it took me about half of my play time to hunt everything down. Which is both a good and bad thing (i can now recite some choices order from memory after clicking them repeatedly a couple of times), depending if you like that kind of thing or not. The whole story is actually really interesting and even though some things are predictable i still found myself thinking "but... maybe it's actually not true?". East Tower manages to make you wonder and teases you all the time. I, for one, couldn't resists and beat both Kuon and Kurenai in one sitting.\nThe best thing in all of the routes is heroine. She isn't your typical shoujo/otoge heroine, oh no, she is a character in her own right and it's impossible to overlook her. I think i loved her the most in Kuon's route - her comments and thoughts were just so relatable! She's absolutely irreplacable and that is a thing many games with female protagonists fail to deliver well.\nThe other characters are just as good. I guess with Akio and Takashi you just don't spend as much time as you do with Kuon or Kurenai, so naturally they don't feel as developed and complex, but they have their good moments. Kuon is really interesting, and i personally like that sort of character with that sort of plot (avoiding spoilers is so hard!). Same goes for Kurenai, who managed to capture my heart almost instantly. Even the side characters are great and i liked them all.\nI know some people make fun of/dislike East Tower's graphics, but i genuinely like them. Although sometimes they look weird/anatomy is wrong, i absolutely love colouring, textures, and how diverse positions/expressions are. I think only in Akio i was frowning at art, but East Tower captures you with its plot and completely overshadows its graphics. It should also be noted that there's a lot of cgs, the winner being Kurenai (117 cgs, although a lot of them are different versions depicting one scene; still, that's impressive!).\nThe music is also really good, some of the tracks are still stuck in my mind. Music also completes the picture; when i turned it off for a while i felt like something was lacking and playing was less enjoyable.\nAll the voice actors are good, and i'm so glad we can enjoy japanese voice acting in these games! It feels so right.\nSo, to sum up my review: East Tower series is really good. I enjoyed every second while playing it and felt it was so worth my money. I recommend it to anyone, whether they like visual novels or not, because East Tower is a good, solid story, that definitely deserves more praise.","May 18","true","6.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nothing to heavy, nothing trying to change the world. Just a bit of fun with some interesting characters. I enjoyed it enough to want to play through all the endings, and there is enough of a mystery that I want to play the next chapters. If you're an otome fan, it's definitely worth a go.","August 4, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechakingkong/recommended/354950/","mechakingkong","Mecha King Kong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechakingkong/","746 products in account","East Tower - Akio redefines visual novels by removing branching storylines and replacing them with a linear story. The limited choices in the game don't affect the outcome, they just affect how much of the story you'll see. For example, in a typical level, the first choice you make will decide whether to progress to the next choice or whether you'll have to start the stage again. If you pass that, the second choice will decide whether you get the standard stage ending or the standard stage ending plus a romantic scene. Get all the romantic scenes and you'll get the big romantic ending at the end of the game.\n\nBecause of the linear narrative, it can feel more like a film than a game. Whether you enjoy it or not will depend on how much you enjoy the story. I thought it was creative and interesting. Thumbs up.","August 13, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

From the very first chapter nearly right up to the last chapter you will be staring for 1.5 hrs at basically the same stenciled forefront, with the same animated background running on a loop, over and over again. It NEVER changes. Things that should look 3D, look fake even on a 2D scale. The only thing that changes is the characters which fade in and out as you click your way through a hodge podge thrown together romance story.\n\nNow don't get me wrong this is not my first visual novel, i've played through a few and they were all pretty good and entertaining and many cool pictures or backgrounds, but such is not the case here. Though the story mentions things like dream chambers, rooms of treasure, hideous monsters, none of them will look good. In fact even the game 'Biglands a game made by kids' has better and  more interesting art work and that's really saying something.\n\nNow lets look at the story. A girl who wants to be a man is paired together with a man who wants to be a woman in a new attraction at an amusement theme world where participants enter dream chambers and have to go through a series of 7 tests and save the princess in the end. Once inside they find out that there is a hacker controlling the game from within preventing them all to leave. They also realize that this dream chamber serves to make all their darkest desires come true. Hence before you know it, hotel rooms with King Sized beds are popping up everywhere.\n\nThe romance side of this story is as cute as a seagull dry reaching a half eaten sardine and the morals that you will learn from this story were no doubt drafted up by a blonde sniffing painted dry salts. The only thing this game has taught me is that it is apparently wrong to prefer meat over curry rice. It is also wrong to aim a rocket launcher at a puppy that snarls at you and more ultimately it is unforgivable to hold a carrot with two hands or kiss someone who looks exactly like you, just to see what happens. This game has made me so sexually confused that I was praying that the amusement park would forget to pay their electricity bill and be turned off, so I could watch everyone suffocate to death in their dream capsules. Alas that did not happen in the LOVE ENDING!!!???\n\nThe biggest thing that really gets my frilly knickers knotted up is the price and the sly advertising behind it all. They recommend that you play all characters of the game in a particular order to get the full sense of the story. They recommend Akio - Takashi - Kuon - Kurenshai. What they don't tell you is that only one of them is playable with the price here which is $5.00. There is no way on this planet that this novel is worth $5.00. Plus the further you go the more it costs. Each one progressively gets more expensive and the whole collection will eventually cost you $30.00. I can only gauge the worthiness of that price from what's available in the first episode. To play through the story it will take you 1.5 hrs - 3hrs if you want all achievements. Also the last episode has a R rating in comparison to the PG  rating which is in this first episode.\n\nInstead of buying this I would recommend buying for $5.00 a bag of carrots and hold them in your hands and then go and eat some beef knowing your being really, really naughty...\n\nExcuse me now while i go and blast alien scum in another game and regain my masculinity thanks...\n\n","May 14, 2015","false","3.8"," 19 of 40 people (48%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","48","19","40","14","1"

It's rewarding when you see the outcome of your own decision, even it is a scripted scene rather than physics-sandbox games like Kerbal Space Program. At the end, you get the illusion of controlling your own adventure and that's satisfying enough to have fun.\n\nThis game, being a visual novel, is already in "lazy programmer's game" category. No physics. No real time mechanics. Just displays images and text, yeah? The only thing it has to do right, is to give you the illusion of you controlling the adventure.\n\nIt fails miserably. For example, you are given two choices, and the choices seem to depend on your own personal thoughts (like "which meal you want to eat", meaning there's no clue which one is correct choice) and one of those choices always leads to "GAME OVER / BAD ENDING". And worst of all, it makes you play the stupid level all over from the start.\n\nIt's so annoying I didn't even want to proceed into further levels after getting a few BAD ENDING screens. The only thing that has been good for me is the foil trading card... so.\n\nNothing to do here.","May 5, 2015","false","0.9"," 13 of 46 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","13","46","2","2"

But by itself, as a game for around five bucks, it was really, really short. The main character was different from the usual otome protagonists, which is nice. Though the "reasons" she had to turn back into a female was really meh and if someone gets suspicious about the writer's core beliefs from that, I can understand why. The male of this game, Akio, was alright, but his backstory could have been expanded/talked about more. It was too abrupt. Anyways, it's an ok game. I don't hate it.","March 14","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
