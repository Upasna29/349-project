The scale of units depends on whether you play as the individually superior Germans, organised into divisions, or the numerically superior Soviets, organised into corps. Battles occur along what were historically organised as single operational fronts by the attacker. This game has an incredibly functional and elegantly minimalist UI, which makes planning and manoeuvring simple to execute.\n\nStrategy heavily focuses on logistics. Instead of drowning players in a sea of minutiae and micromanagement, the mechanics elegantly strip away all the non-essentials for this scale of warfare. All players need to be concerned about are maintaining supply lines—and how to cut off those of their enemies. Resupplying your own troops is done automatically at the beginning of each turn. Terrain features that support or hinder logistics, such as railroads, bridges, mountains and rivers, are the most important strategic points on maps and are furiously fought over. Although weather rarely becomes an issue for most maps due to the corresponding historical dates, the Russian winter at its fiercest can seriously limit your supply and unit movement range.\n\nUnlike almost all other games of this scale, the presence of logistics means that encirclement attacks work realistically, where you surround enemy units and cut off their supply (e.g. food, fuel, munitions). After being out of supply for 2 turns, a unit's combat effectiveness is incredibly compromised. After 4 turns, enemy units are unable to attack. In other games, encirclement merely increases the surface area from where can an attack enemy unit (i.e. multiple friendly units can attack the same enemy). As with German strategy in the first half of Operation Barbarossa, sometimes it's better to bypass large enemy formations and hit their rear supply lines using more mobile divisions (e.g. armoured, mechanised, motorised or cavalry units) than to fight a grinding battle of attrition focused on the complete destruction of the enemy.\n\nDespite deceptively simple mechanics, this game is quite realistic at portraying the effectiveness of strategies of the period. There are three main realism problems: (1) No fog of war, though formations at this scale are almost certainly known to enemy reconnaissance; (2) No command structures, which assumes that command delay is less than 24 hours; and (3) Air supply is not subject to anti-aircraft attack. There are far more complex and detailed games that achieve greater realism, such as Gary Grigsby's War in the East (Matrix Games[www.matrixgames.com]), but the overall effectiveness of those strategies is largely the same as in this game but include far more micromanagement.\n\nThe singleplayer AI is very well crafted, but there is a serious caveat: it's limited to planning one turn in advance. This makes the AI devastatingly effective at conducting defences, launching counterattacks and striking at supply lines, but unable to follow through strategic attacks. This is why in singleplayer you can only play as the attacker. To increase the difficulty, instead of simply achieving a marginal victory, you can take your chances at achieving a brilliant (i.e. perfect) victory by reaching all the objectives in record time.\n\nThe multiplayer community is small, but you should usually be able to find at least one or two games every day through the following Steam group (Unity of Command Multiplayer). Unfortunately, there is no matchmaking service, which is why people use this group. Be careful though, as strategies that work against singleplayer AI are usually unsuited to facing off against infinitely more crafty human players.","December 4, 2013","true","147.4"," 114 of 120 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","114","120","0","3"

That´s what this game is about. Capturing objectives while keeping your units in supply so they don´t run out of juice on the front lines. All within a tight turn limit.\nIt´s an intriguing and (to me) novel concept.\n\nThe bad:\nIt´s frustrating beyond belief. Not because it´s hard (it is) but because it´s to damn random.\n+Pushing an enemy off a tile is random.\n+Getting "Overrun" results, which allow you to attack again in the same turn, is random.\n+A battle can randomly turn out to not go as predicted and you don´t defeat a unit that you needed gone (the game shows you the expected outcome before you attack).\n+Bad weather which heavily favours the defender (you are never the defender) may randomly show up and completely screw over your push for the objective.\n+Specialists (expensive and often crucial) within your units may or may not be among the casualties when the unit fights.\n\nThe problem with that is, the game does not give you the time for this kind of randomness. The turn limits are so tight that any one of these events can screw you over. Sure you might still beat the mission but the game differentiates between normal, decisive and brilliant victories. Many follow up missions are barred behind decisive victories and some even behind brilliant victories.\nSo you try over and over again, without any change in strategy (once you got it down) and hope that you get enough "Overrun" results with your armoured units and you hope that your push doesn´t get stuck in bad weather until you finally beat it in time.\n\nDue to this, I can´t really recommend it as much as I like the concept of the game.","December 28, 2014","false","18.0"," 95 of 131 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","95","131","5","7"

A strategy game lets you explore many different paths to victory against an opponent that is reacting to you. You can create your own strategy to beat the enemy. This game on the other hand, is more like a puzzle game.\n\nThe units are set up in predetermined positions. The AI is extremely passive and just reacts to the very few outcomes you can do by scripting. The AI stands absolutely no chance in a fair fight. The only reason why the campaign is so hard is because you are usually extremely outnumbered, you have a limited number of turns to get your objective and the supply line mechanic is designed so you are at a disadvantage as an attacker. Combined with the extremely closed scenarios, the AI just reacts to your predictable movements with strategies scripted by the designer. I frankly do not find any fun in that.\n\nTL;DR This is not a strategy game. It is a puzzle game where you play against the level designer to beat a level in a few turns with an overwhelming disadvantage. If you like that and pretty graphics, try this game.

To know what you get I guess you have to read the rest of this wall of text. I promise it will be a nice and informative read while covering most of what you'd want to know before you buy the game or one of the two DLC's.\n--------\n\nUnity of Command is an excellent game that manages to achieve a thing rarely achieved by wargames that deal with WWII on the operational level: It's accessible to newcomers and easy to learn, it's simple on the surface and in its gameplay but it still has enough depth and complexity to offer interesting decisions for veteran wargamers, because almost every decision you make carries some weight when it comes to the end result. There are other wargames comparably excellent to this one, but they make most newcomers want to vomit blood out of their eyes - because the developers place their confidence in you being willing to read a 100 page manual alongside playing their game and they assume you will look past the hideous and needlessly overcomplicated user interface. (I'm looking at you Korsun Pocket - excellent game, terrible learning experience).\n\nNone of these things are an issue in Unity of Command. The user interface is excellent and very user-friendly. You don't have to click on a unit to get information about whether it can still attack or move, you see it at a glance because each unit has tiny icons below and around it, that tell you everything you could possibly want to know about your or your enemies' unit at a glance without wasting your time and clicking every unit to check manually.\n\nAnother point where this game shines is its "realism". I know this word is hard to swallow if you're a "serious" wargamer and you look at Unity of Command. But this game basically models the higher-level essential things of what war in the eastern front at the operational level was all about. For the Germans it was about advancing as fast and as far as you can to take key objectives without outrunning your own supply or your supply lines being cut off by the enemy. The flipside of this naturally means encircling your enemy and cutting of their supply to weaken them and eventually starve them out completely. Also it's about breaking through (sometimes multiple) defensive lines of your enemy. Pick the weakest link in their line, punch a hole with a massed attack at that point, and then squeeze through everything that has wheels to advance as fast as possible towards your objectives, while your slower infantry divisions advance behind your motorized divisions and worry about securing the supply line for those advancing units, whilst simultaneously trying to encircle and destroy the enemy. The deceptively simple game mechanics of  movement and attack (whilst also considering rivers, terrain features and weather effects on your movement and attacks) are excellent at modelling all of the above - and in the end I think the gameplay mechanics really model everything truly relevant in the context of this large scale warfare level.\n\nEach of the units you'll see in the game represents several thousand, if not ten-thousand men and each single single hex represents 20 kilometers. Almost all you ever do in this game is move and attack with your divisions, move and attack. But where to move? What to attack? What to attack first and what with? Where to break the enemy line? How do you cut off their supply lines to starve them out? You also make important decisions in the form of "theatre assets" (air raids, building or blowing up bridges, extending the range of your supply depots etc.) Also you have to decide about reinforcements as the game progresses over turns (each turn represents 4 days), so new reinforcements may come into play - on your side as well as on the side of your enemy. Sometimes you need to take a specific area at the edge of the map so your own reinforcements may enter from there, at other times you just replace some losses that your divisions in play suffered already (which sensibly you can only do if they are in supply).\n\nSo yes at first glance your options seem somewhat limited but they always make perfect sense in the context of modelling the war in the east. You could bomb a city where an enemy infantry division has entrenched itself, but each air attack you launch on that city has a chance of turning the city into ruins, giving any enemy division within it even more defense as fighting on a pile of rubble increases their chances to hide and ambush if you launch an attack into that city. Some divisions have artillery attached, but if you move that unit its artillery attachment ("step") won't contribute to your attack value, it will only contribute in your defense and attack after you end your current turn and they have set up. This game is just full of gameplay details like this which make absolute sense. If you enjoy pondering these kinds of decisions with a feeling that virtually each small decision matters for the outcome, then this is a game for you. You can also play this game okay without paying much attention to the deeper details - you won't excel at it but you could still play very competently and there aren't that many details to know either, the complexity of your options and decisions arises from the interaction of the gameplay mechanics and the finer details.\n\nAlso there are "Zone of Control" mechanics meaning every (non-weak) unit in a hex extends a zone of control into all six hexes around it (as long as those hexes are inside the own territory), meaning enemy divisions who move into these hexes are immediately "pinned down" by the division controlling the zones around it and so the pinned unit can't move any further this turn. This leads to excellent tactics, where some of your units "clear" those zones of control and get pinned, while others advance through and past those friendly pinned divisions and thus can advance deeper into enemy territory without getting pinned themselves. You'll learn what that means and how important zones of control are soon enough, because the nothing short of excellent AI will constantly make intelligent use of this mechanic to exploit any hole and weak link in your own defensive lines which may have looked good and solid enough a second ago when you ended your turn, but proved to be as fragile as a butterflies wing a moment later. Also the AI is excellent at defending any objectives you need to take. It knows exactly what your objectives are and dynamically and competently adapts its defensive lines to hinder your progress at every turn. Good times.\n-------------\n\nI do have some gripes about Unity of Command as well however, but they are nowhere seriously bad enough to spoil the fun and experience you can have with this game. I've come across at least two maps that are ill-conceived for 1920x1080 resolutions, because there is a limit to which point you can drag the map view around and some of your user-Interface elements can end up blocking a part at the edge of a map that isn't greyed out and where the actual gameplay still happens (though you can quickly enable and disable user interface elements with hotkeys, so the problem is merely annoying, not gamebreaking). Also there is little variety in terms of music, but the music that is there is really nice. (And it's not as if I can't mute it and play my own music anyway).\n\nIf I had to criticize gameplay I would say it's mainly this: Your performance is solely ranked based on how timely you take objectives and nothing else. Rarely this can lead to stupid outcomes where I took Stalingrad on time with two completely weakened divisions, my other forces virtually obliterated. I'd have lost on the next turn, but because I took everything on time it was a "brilliant victory". Troop loss should have been included in your performance rating. Also random outcomes and weather can prevent you from achieving the best possible rating.","June 25, 2014","true","96.1"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","2"

The 1.3 hours are not accurate.\n\nPros :\n- supply lines are the best feature of the game. You need to protect yours, strengthen your salients while piercing the frontline, extend with caution when the front has collapsed, and it's very rewarding to pocket enemies. It adds a real layer of tactical depth to the game.\n\n- suppression and weakening of units is nicely implemented.\n\n- and that's about it\n\nCons :\n- No fog of war : all units (and their strength, and type) are always visible, not matter how far they are, even in forests or with bad weather. Why you would remove such a critical (both historically and gameplay-wise) element is beyond me.\n\n- Passive AI, challenging only because of the usually tight turn limit : seems programmed only to make you miss the "brilliant victory", which is incredibly tough to get (needs perfect play and weather : no hex wasted, luck in all rgn fights).\nIf you don't care about "brilliant victories", there's no challenge once you've mastered the basic rules. On my real first try at the "Black turn" campaign, I had all decisive victory except for Moscow, where the (random) weather  pinned my offensive for so many turns.\nThe real game in "Unity of Command" might as well be about  "getting 100% brillant". The problem is that the game is not satisfying and rewarding enough for me to care. It's simply not good enough.\n\n- meagre gameplay : that's what made the game quickly repetitive and boring. You don't control your airforce, you don't control your artillery, there's no naval force, did not see paratroops... meaning your panel of actions and tactical choices each turn is very limited : thick ground, and that's it. You can't combine the way PG let you combine 20+ years ago, or build these fat infantry/flak/artillery mutually defending clusters.\n\n- The game lacks the entrenchment "finesse" of the old PG : entrenched units had and could be softened/suppressed/peeled in different manners, while in Unity of Command it's binary : resists/breaks through the use of a specialist unit, of sheer force. It might as well be a justified by the fast pace the developers intended to give their game (most battles must be resolved in 5-6 turns), but it's a poor choice, as it makes the game more arid.\n\n- no real campaign (as it seems to be) : defeat means game over, normal or decisive victory lead to the same results. No branching.\nCould be wrong though, as I never achieved brilliant victories in campaign (couldn't be arsed).\n\n- no deployment : even in campaign mode, the starting positions of all units are predetermined : really absurd, and twice. First, if I'm Zukhov or Paulus, why am I tied to the choices of other Zukhov or Paulus ? Second, since you can't place your units were you want, you can't use where needed the units you previously overstrengthened or augmented with a specialist token. Meaning the huge amounts of prestige spent doing so are used to their full potential only during the battle you did it.\n\n- music is generic and unatmospheric at best. Best muted.\n- etc.\n\nCould go on with the cons\nUoC could have been so much more enjoyable.\nA real disappointment.","May 31, 2015","false","1.3"," 85 of 127 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","85","127","3","7"

Because the game focuses on the Operational level of warfare, it is entirely possible to win a decisive victory without destroying the enemy's army if you pay attention to maneuver and logistics.

This game delivered but also gave me something new. The main innovation, suppy lines, has a big effect. One must think about encirclement and weak points instead of wiping out every unit in one's path. It's also important not to leave your supply lines exposed as having them disrupted even once can mean the difference between victory and defeat.\n\nThe mechanics are fairly easy to master and the game can tell you how many units you can expect to destroy/lose in any given encounter. There are many interactions to consider (terrain, weather, entrenchment) and since its an operational level game you can be winning individual shootouts yet lose the big battle because you are acting too carefully. The game takes about 20 hours to fully master but provides replay value as you can try to win every battle with a brilliant victory or just try a slightly different approach.\n\nUnlike PG you can finish each scenario in one sitting. The size of the maps is pretty manageable. There's no such diversity of units as in that game but I didn't really miss it. Ultimately the most interesting thing about the game is making decisions of how many units to commit, where and for how long and doing it all without outrunning your supply lines, often this requires coordination between units.\n\nMy two complaints are: the AI is a little weak, enough to provide a challenge but not enough to really surprise you and often committing foolish errors; the other is that battles can only be played in a pretty strict sequence. So if you finish a campaign and want to replay a battle from near the beginning, the later battles will become inaccessible.\n\nI loved the game enough to buy all the expansions and play them through several times.\n\nMy wish for the game would be that units carried over somehow. It was great to see my units in PG progress from green to elite and encouraged me to be careful and avoid throwing units into meatgrinders. Although bashing at a city while suffereing bad losses in order to achieve your objective is often needed in UoC and is an interesting part of the game since it forces you to take risks.\n\nI'm still looking for a game that would combine this kind of battle simulation with an economic simulation since as they say WWII was won in the factories.","November 22, 2014","true","38.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Yes, this might appear to be like many other board or video game strategic wargames. What separates Unity of Command, however, is the cat and mouse aspects of defending your own supply line while simultaneously attacking your opponents, to prevent your troops from running out of supplies (ammo, clothes, food, one would assume) while taking away these necessities from your opponent, giving you the advantage. Without saying much more and probably repeating what others have said, UoC is one of those games that appear simple on the surface -- youu load the deceptively small game, play through the tutorial, and then load up the campaign or scenarios hitting the ground running -- but after your first and second round you begin to realize that it will be hard to master. Sure, the initial handful of scenarios are easy, even for the relative genre newbie, but the difficulty begins to quickly ramp up, never treating you with kids gloves. It is important to note that the game is difficult without being unfair, or using cheats to compensate for lackluster AI: you won't find those problems here. All of the aforementioned, should be noted, sits pleasantly under one of the most pleasing UI design choices in any wargame I've seen. Like the game itself, the art direction and UI can be summed up as simple, effective, and beautiful. This relatively inexpensive game will serve you with many hours of fun for a long time.

You command either the Soviet or German forces on the European eastern front of WW2. The game is accurate to history reagarding the sequencing of Stalingrad, and a perfect way to carry out the battle as you may seem fit. But remember the game is just that: Stalingrad with surrounding skirmishes, and nothing but that.\n\nThe combat is comparable to Civilization V's: hexagons with finite movement for units. The main difference between Unity and Civ's combat systems, however, is the logistic behavior. Units have supply gauges that change with the availability of resources, toggled by supply line efficiency. Of course, if the enemy captures a section of your supply line, it will not be efficient for you! So a main component of the game's objective is supply line management, a category of logistics.\n\nOne might think that this game is simply strategy combat, and therefore boring. Within an hour of gameplay, that person can testify otherwise. The dynamic weather/landscape and intelligent AI kept me engaged for sure; the enemy always has something brewing in the pot. You can notice its strategy, often focusing on your weak and vulnerable units to find a path to your supply line. Other times it makes deliberate retreats when you do that same thing to them. It's truly captivating.\n\nIf you are interested in a microcosm of Civ V's combat and then some, this is the game for you. Nothing daunting, just casual strategy fun.\n\n9/10","November 25, 2015","true","8.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

My congratulations and thanks to those that made this game for getting their history right. The individual divisions and corps that are in the battles in this game were in the actual battles as well, along with the correct opposing generals. Those involved in making Unity of Command really did their homework!! As a newbie, I appreciate the individual scenarios starting 'easy' and working their way up to difficult. It allowed me to learn the game, although for an old man, those 'easy' senarios were anything but. The game is well thought out. Like the real Eastern Front campaign, you fight the weather, supply lines, terrain and the Russians with panzer, motorized and infantry divisions. The original game features the Stalingrad campaign, the DLC features the Russian offensives of 1944, with additional DLC taking on the 1941 German invasion of Russia. My favorite is Operation Typhoon, the battle for Moscow. Like Field Marshall von Bock, you command six entire armies and over two million men, the largest land force under one commander in history. Unity of Command is a strategy video game and chess with panzer divisions all in one. It's challenging, frustrating, addicting, but most of all, it's fun.

It's perfect for me because each map takes a little less than an hour, so I can still get some excellent strategy in a limited amount of time, or chain together several battles when there's more time. The game is like a tabletop wargame but with all the benefits that a computer can bring. The game isn't quite as random as another reviewer mentioned as long as you become very familiar with your units and their various strengths and weaknesses. Beyond pure armor versus infantry, you can add modifications to your units like recon, artillery, and motorized. With the right combination of units, good planning, and just a tiny bit of luck, it's definitely possible to score brilliant victories (which are very satisfying, as the time limits are very tight and totally unforgiving).\n\nThe historical accuracy of the game is excellent, and is strictly adhered too--it's a game that's more about the strategy of a specific battle than a 'map painting' game like EU4. The game is also not about logistics, which is enjoyable in this context. Someday, a WWII game may come along that makes logistics enjoyable and also can do battlefield strategy, but until then, I'll play CIV when I want to build a giant army and then be bored for two hours while the computer fails to execute the most basic defense, and I'll play this game when I want a tactical challenge.","April 14, 2015","true","14.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The Supply Line feature is also very realistic. While it allows you to potentially thrust deep into enemy territory along the railroads, any enemy presence on those lines will cut off supply.\n\nThe game is good for both a defensive and offensive strategy, where units can entrench themselves, making a line of them near-impenetrable even with tanks, or by equiping your units with "specialists," or specific units, such as StuGs, T-34s, or Engineers, you can give them a huge advantage on the frontline. But above all, my favorite feature is the one that urges you to minimize loss of life. If a unit is destroyed, the overall morale will drop, and your troops will be less inclined to stand their ground.\n\nOverall, this is a strong choice if you want a turn-based strategy game.","December 2, 2014","true","13.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I like this game a lot.\n\nUnity of Command is simple to learn and fairly fast-paced. You can sit down and run a scenario in 10-15 minutes if you want. The graphics are simple, but they function well and everything is very smooth. It's very easy to keep track of individual units based on their veteran status and nationality.\n\nThis is really a game about logistics and prioritizing targets. The absolute most important thing to do in every scenario is keep your supply lines open and, if possible, cut the enemy's. Everything else is secondary to that. The AI does not care about what might happen in the theoretical future; it will send suicidal attacks your way if it means cutting your supply for even one turn, because losing that turn means losing your chance at a brilliant or decisive victory. This can be frustrating, and I would often sit here and think "What, really, all these soldiers are going to march to their deaths with absolutely no chance of survival? They just cut *themselves* off from supply too! Idiots!" Yes. They will. Every time. The AI is doing what it's designed to do.\n\nMy only gripes with the game are that several of the later scenarios are almost entirely dependent on luck to achieve a 'Brilliant' victory necessary to unlock certain scenarios. Granted, the historical probability of these scenarios is almost zero, but that shouldn't excuse forcing the player to execute a rote strategy again and again until the dice fall his way. Because each unit's strength is represented only by up to 7 (and usually 4-5) points, having the odds fall against you just slightly completely alters the timeline of your attacks. I don't mind having to replay a scenario multiple times and being forced to try new strategies - that's part of the genre, after all - but sometimes Unity of Command drags this out a bit too much. The replay value isn't great, but mastering the campaign and the DLC should take you no less than 12-15 hours, and the online function adds some value.\n\nAll in all, a highly polished little strategy game.","November 26, 2013","true","30.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

That doesn't mean that the game is dumbed down but just that it uses the essential elements (combat and supply lines) and in addition keeps the scenarios to a manageable level.\n\nThis also means it's far easier to understand how to play the game - there's nothing more frustrating than coming back to a game after a few months and realising that you've forgot how to play it - and scenarios can be completed in an hour not a week.\n\nAs with any strategy game there is the question of how's the AI? The answer, fortunately, is relatively good. No it won't put up a good as a fight as a human opponent and like most AIs it's much better in defence than attack but it with give you a challenging game without having to resort to artificial help.\n\nIf you like turn based war games that are stream-lined ensuring it's a war-game then this comes highly recommended and there's also two DLC's to keep you happy afterwards.","March 7, 2014","true","19.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They never tell you enough about the mechanics, they never specify how each mechanics would affect the units. So many things are untold abou this game in tutorial and manual that it makes player to give up the game entirely before they get the hang of it. The Devs should've included more thoughtful introduction to this game for sure. While the ones who developed might see it as "obvious," to people who are going into this game the ♥♥♥♥♥ that computer throws at the player is infuriating to say the least.\n\nNow that's out of the way, don't let my rant about the tutorial make yourself hesitant to purchase this game. There are many "strategic" games available in Steam store, but there are so few that actually makes you think for turns. Most of the "strategic games" either encourages player to "turtle up" or go "berserk" (Yes, I'm looking at you Valkyria Chronicles and XCOM). However, neither strategy is viable in this game. You truly have to play in a way that you maintain both offense and defense so that you can spearhead to exploit enemy weakness and protect your supply lines. You know, like real war.\n\nWhat makes this game truly unique is the importance of supply line. So many war games neglect the idea of logistics or oversimplify that application in Unity of Command is quite refreshing. As General Robert H. Barrow said, amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study logistics. True that. It makes you think for everything. This game is literally for those who wants more than just tactical sim. This game is truly a masterful strategy game.\n\np.s. If you see the "negative" reviews, most of them are under 5 hrs. This ties in to my initial rant. Because the game doesn't tell you about it's mechanics to the player, those who couldn't understand thinks game moves at random, or things just don't make sense. It took me good 5~10 hrs to get complete grasp of the game, and now I can win most of the scenarios without any problem.","February 28","true","53.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","1"

Having said that, the game also suffers somewhat from oversimplification, repetitiveness and rigidity. When considering buying the game, consider:\n\nPros:\n-Easy to get into, yet challenging enough to try and master\n\n-Some tactical planning and thinking required, luck and chance is involved so there is some variety in gameplay.\n\n-Quite immersive, the total seems more than the sum of its parts.\n\n\nCons:\n-The AI seems quite simple: you make a certain set of moves and it always reacts similarly.\n\n-Unrealistic winning objectives - sacrifice your army simply to gain possession of a few winning hexes for one turn and you suddenly have "won"?\n\n-No air units available\n\n-Only scenarios where offensive is to be taken (AI lacks the ability to launch a coherent offensive?) - some defensive scenarios would be welcome\n\n-"Brilliant victories" often depend on chance (e.g., chancing in-game weather), yet proceeding in the campaign in some cases requires such victories - the game therefore makes you grind several scenarios over and over again.\n\n-The scenarios always start the same - some alterate starting positions would be welcome for variety.\n\n-After you win the campaign, there's a smiple "Campaign completed" message and nothing else - really?\n\n-Music can get repetitive and the graphics are not the selling point of the game.\n\nOverall, I tend to recommend the game for people interested in the topic and looking for some easy-to-get-into strategy gaming - not at the level of Metacritic (average 84/100), but rather at the level of the user reviews (7.2/10).\n\nIn other words, it's quite ok.","October 13, 2014","true","39.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It is a simple and somewhat interesting rudimentary strategy game, but every little thing has to roll your way to really have a chance to win and you'll need an act of God to win with full prestige as the game progresses. The computer AI is actually not bad but it seems to have better odds of coming up with good rolls of the dice than you. I found it is deeply fustrating to make the neck break turn based strategic goals with a game that requires all your attack rolls to come up big (one or two bad rolls often dooms your chance of beating the turn clock), also any bad weather will set you back a turn or two (which is all the game needs to make you start over yet again). Supplies (always a life blood of an army) gets really freak'n thin in the later scenerios, and good luck getting your lousy Luftwaffe to actually kill something. It is very true that the difficulties make a game more interesting to play, but only up to a point, and this game rockets well past that point to become simply being as much fun as banging your head against the wall until you knock yourself out cold. This is actually one of the worst strategic games I have played in a long long time and I am more than a little upset of even knowing this game exists much less having the terrible memory of paying for it.","April 17, 2014","false","57.5"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

I can't believe it requires a Brilliant Victory to advance in some of the scenarios.\n\n---\n\nAfter over 100 hrs of play, I finally completed an entire campaign (Russia 1943 - 1945).  As many others have said, this is a very difficult game due to the time constraints in the scenarios and having to hit specific marks to unlock remaining scenarios.  I still haven't gotten more than four scenarios into the German Stalingrad campaign before being brought to a halt.\n\nThe AI is unforgiving in most situations, but will leap at the chance to capture one of your supply sources.  I've used that to let the AI grab a supply source with its most capable units, then swung around behind and trapped it there while the rest of my forces go for the objectives.\n\nI'm also not thrilled with German units sitting in cities, completely surrounded, out of supply until all steps are suppressed and they can still repulse attacks from all six sides.  Very frustrating.\n\nStill, I continue to play and see if I can beat some of the scenarios I've never succeeded at.","January 13, 2015","true","425.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just now, for example, an elite German motorised unit made an audacious and successful bid to recapture an objective with the result that I ran out of time to win the scenario.\n\nIt is this emphasis on protecting supply lines as well as captured objectives  that makes Unity of  Command a unique, tense and thoroughly enjoyable experience. It is essential to understand the mechanics behind this to have any chance of succeeding. In particular, defending railway lines through your territory is crucial to keeping combat units in fighting condition at the front line. Even then, most of the scenarios are carefully balanced to give you just enough turns and units to win.\n\nThe only significant weakness is the structure of the campaign itself. Units are not carried over and the scenarios themselves feel a little disjointed. The campaigning element is represented in terms of "prestige points" which are earned for capturing objectives within a certain number of turns. These prestige points can be used in subsequent scenarios to purchase additional units. Individual scenarios can be played and, although I haven't properly tried it out yet, the scenario editor seems intuitive and powerful. I can't vouch for the two DLCs, and whether they bring anything new in terms of mechanics, because I haven't got round to playing them yet.\n\nOverall, this is an absorbing, challenging and refreshing take on turn-based wargaming and deserves a place in the collection of any strategy player interested in the period.\n","January 14, 2015","true","65.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enjoyed the Soviet campaign, haven't played as Germans though as it would be rather painful to replay the attack on my country and capturing it.\nThe specialist arms system, whereby a unit can be assigned an additional weapon, is ingenious. Sometimes it was a game-changer! I also appreciate the well-timed missions. Sometimes it took me many attempts to clear the objectives in time, but I enjoyed trying nevertheless.\nOverall, a great game, if only a bit short, even with all DLCs. A couple more campaigns would be just perfect, but then I don't and probably won't play as German.\nThe historical accuracy is almost complete, and the real tactics may be traced in that the in-game Soviets have to pave their way with bodies of their own, as they get a lot of infantry and often not much more, and almost every German unit is here superior to a corresponding Russian one, the Soviets just have more men to dispose of.

It is a lot of fun and can be challenging to complete objectives within the specific amount of turns. Replaying missions allows you to try pushing through at different points which may lead to breaking through and encircling enemy forces and cutting them off from supplies, or could lead to you trying to charge forward with armor and mobile infantry to reach further into enemy territory. Just watch your supply lines. Air supply drops, air strikes etc can help offer up more variety in missions.\n\nThe basics are easy to grasp and if you are new or curious about these types of games this is the perfect place to start. The games offers more than just basic movement, such as air strikes, entrenching troops to give them a defensive bonus etc.\n\nStop reading this and go buy it!","December 11, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is presented in a straightforward and elegant way, making what could have been an incomprehensible mess into a very accessible wargame. However, do not mistake this for a lack of difficulty. The extremely crafty AI is very quick to put this idea to bed. Attempting to reproduce the stunning encirclements that the Wehrmacht pulled off expertly throughout Operation Barbarossa often ends up in disaster when the AI exploits the holes left by your advancing troops to turn the tables and cut off your supply lines. If you want an easy game, then you are looking in the wrong place with Unity of Command.\n\nSpeaking of supply lines, they are often the key to success or failure. Cutting off the supply lines to a strong enemy force can turn an impossible fight into an easy cleanup operation. Because there is such great risk involved, and it often goes pear shaped, the satisfaction that results in successfully pulling off a large scale encirclement is huge. It's what keeps me coming back to Unity of Command again and again, even though the AI continuously puts me in my place when I get careless or overconfident.\n\nFor anyone with an interest in the eastern front during World War 2 and turn based strategy games, I cannot recommend this game enough.","May 29, 2015","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game works very well. I particularly like the way that it visually represents the action that your seeing, with each of your unit's having pips showing their combat effectiveness. However, the turn limits per scenario are, frankly, brutally unrealistic. In many cases, the enemy would just gang themselves around 1 of my 5 objectives and literally make it impossible to do anything within the rest of the time frame. However, this is done to show the way in which the Russian front battles took place, as the German's frequently relied on the Blitzkrieg tactic to rapidly advance and crush their enemies, forcing the Russians to have to adapt and use similar techniques while countering. The game, I feel could have used either longer time limits, or no time limits, but replace these with much higher numbers of units, perhaps staggering them to arrive after a certain objective is met or a certain time limit expires. However, it's an enjoyable and interesting experience, and should definitely be looked at for fans of Risk type games.","August 25, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It may not be the most advanced of turn based games but I see no problem with this. The game can be rather difficult if you do not make the right tactical decisions so replaying missions is rather encouraged. Each mission feels different in how it's layed out, with some being considerably more challenging with how many units you're given or what your objectives are. With the dlc there is a considerable amount of content, it caught me off guard with how many missions/scenarios there are.

From the outside, it looks like a standard Paradox/Geopolitical combat game, but in reality the combat and strategy plays like Civ. All you need to concern yourself with are the objectives you've been set, the time limit on each scenario and your supply lines. Rather than being given an entire country and told to manage it's economics, politics, diplomacy, research and military tactics all at once, this game deals with none of that. It is purely and simply tactical/strategic warfare. The combats similarity to Civ V (which, I am told, in turn is similar to Panzer Corp so maybe I should be comparing that) is based upon it's turn based, one unit per tile nature. You capture any land you walk on, but are restricted in this by your supply lines, which you can extend or cut off by capturing roads. If your troops are poorly supplied, they may become easy targets or have their movement range progressively reduced or be unable to enter combat. There is a turn timer related to your objectives, and this provides a good kick up the backside and adds a great deal of tension to your strategy, although missing the final objective by one hex can be extremely frustrating should it happen.\n\nOverall, a really good strategy game, it doesn't over complicate it's subject matter and deals well with the simple concepts that it uses.","December 15, 2014","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's got frustrating controls and very limited save functions.  Apparently, you have to meet several "checkpoints" in order to have your progress saved. This gets frustrating if you don't have enough time to finish a campaign.  Also, if you want to restarta  scenario within a campaign, no luck.  It restarts the whole campaign meaning you have to redo all the scenarios you've already finished.  Extremely frustrating. I don't know why they didn't add these features.\nAlso, it's not that great as a strategy game.  The high point for me was the V for Victory series, wayback when.  This is a logistics focused game, but it doesn't really get that right either.  It has some weird calcuating rate where if one enemy unit advances several hexes behind your lines, it gets to disrupt your whole supply line.  This sounds reasonable at first, but think about it.  How can, say, a tank division get past several enemy controlled hexes and punch through without any suppliies of their own AND disrupt enemy supply lines?  It completely ignores spheres of influence. This game basically boils down to the hugely unrealistic strategy of luring your enemy away from their supply lines and then slowly grinding them down (hugely unrealistic) and not very satisfying.\n\nNot recommended.","January 2, 2014","false","47.7"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","0"

A heard a lot of good things about this game and so when it went on sale for a 1$ including all the dlc i bought it. Game mechanics are good but I can't stand the randomness of the movement for the ai. At the same time the game limits the amount of turns you can use. Its stupid how I lose because my troops movement per turn isnt very far and the last objective to capture is far away. By the time i get there im out of turns and I lose despite my army still large and I could win in another 2 turns. There is no strategy except send your tank and armored car units in as fast as you can and hope they don't get blown up on there way there while your infantry sit in the back unused because they don't move far.

It's pure luck whether you:\nForcing the enemy to retreat\nThe enemy becomes weakened (no longer projects ZoC, so you can go around them and attack their other units).\nYour unit gets overrun to attack again (generally ranges from 90%, 40%, or 10%).\n- To go with the luck element, there are absolutely insane turn limitations for the campaign.\nThere are various objectives which you much reach and capture on the map.  You can still win without capturing every single one, but for a perfectionist, you want to get every single one.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the luck mechanics, the only real way of capturing every single objective is pure luck.\nYou can run the exact same strategy, and sometimes it will succeed in time and other times it won't, depending on whether you get overrun or weaken a critical enemy and such.\n\nNote: you don't need to capture every single objective to beat the missions.  But it's still bizarre to me.\n\nPersonal pet peeve:\nIn the first few missions (I didn't get very far in the game)\n- The AI doesn't actually attack most of the time.  Instead, their goal is purely to stop you from reaching your objective, which means they set up their units in front of you to block you.\n\nReally?  That seems utterly inane to me.  They're not here to fight you, they're just here to march in front of you and block you!\nMaybe this changes in the later missions, I don't know, but it really killed my immersion in the game.","May 9, 2015","false","2.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

With this I’d lose my chance at taking an objective before it began losing prestige value. This seemed like a terrible oversight. Sure it’s a great tactic for the AI if it wants to deny you an objective, but the point of retreat is that it shouldn’t have any control over the unit anymore, the AI being able to treat it as an organized advance is nothing short of infuriating.\n\nYeah the AI was tough, very tough, if that’s your thing then good for you. I’d have preferred a casual option though, or maybe one called realistic. For example in the Stalingrad campaign in Operation Uranus I thought the two day objective looked reasonable at first. Little did I know the entire 6th German army would completely evacuate Stalingrad to form a borg cube around two objectives denying me a victory at all. It felt like the enemy AI needed to have objectives of its own besides just denying me my objectives. For example it left cities that were non-objectives completely undefended.\n\nThe predetermind locations of your units at the start of a scenario was a kick in the teeth as well.\n\nThe time limit seemed like a cool idea until I played the game, and I understand that to add challenge to the attacker when you have a huge majority it's neccesary, but I feel like it could have been improved upon. I'd have prefered it to been a campaign feature rather than a feature in each individual scenario.\n\nFinally it had randomized attack features like overrun, which let a unit attack twice. I don’t play strategy games to have to worry about critical hits.","June 28, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Very simple, even too much for my taste. But not "easy to play". It's not a game you would find relaxing and digging into unit stats, enjoying them fighting the enemy and caring for each one. The game is a barebone operational level wargame. And on that level you are supposed to mercilessly spend your reserves to meet the Command demands in an extremely limited set of time. I suppose that's realistic - WW2 was all about OOB and time plans. But that's very uncomfortable. You feel as a Soviet commander who is going to be shot if he fails plans of advance.\n\nAnother downside - the game is not so much a struggle against AI, as a logical puzzle. Spend your troops and overcome resistance in a set amount of time. Not much tactical thinking or gameplay.\n\nSo, if you know you want that - buy the game.

The rules-set compliments the narrative so well, the music gives it a depressing crushing aura, the visual aesthetic while simple compliments the fatalistic aura and the supply mechanic... it's truly excellent.\n\nYou and the opponent's forces rely on supply to keep them working effectively; consequently the game becomes one where you and the opponent (usually a desperate AI) try to sever each other's supply line, while protecting your own. Once the supplies are cut, its just time before the opponent (or your own forces) simply stop working!\n\nAnd that time is the key; the game doesn't measure success in terms of kills, or margins of victory; just the time taken to reach certain objectives.\n\nI couldn't comment on how historically accurate the game is; but after ten or so hours of play I can't help but feel the designers have sneakily taught me "things" about the Eastern Front. I certainly don't want to be a German infantryman, on my 12th day without supplies, trying to hold off a Russian Tank attack.","August 18, 2014","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's biggest weakness is it's lack of customization.  You don't get to pick your units like in PG series. You can carry over experienced units if they happen to show up in later scenarios but it can be very difficult to level up a large number of units.  In addition, the game penalizes you for attempting to attempt a sound military victory and instead forces you to simply get units to objectives as fast as possible without regards to casualties or the state of your battle line, something no commander would ever ignore.  Overall I give it a 6/10, it could have been much more than it is.  The PG series did all of these things with a good level of balance that this game does not provide.","February 16, 2014","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The computer makes the random 'dice-rolls' for you, and streamlines the war-gaming experience. In addition, the computer also adds some very limited random elements - primarily semi-randomized weather effects which change movement rules and cover calculations.\n\nEach game is a particular strategic scenario on the Eastern Front of World War II: many are historical, while a few entail hypothetical operations. The campaign-mode is just a sequential playing-through of those scenarios, with only a slight change in that sometimes you have to win a scenario with a certain score to progress to the next one.\n\nHonestly, the campaign-mode is not very fleshed out, and I don't play it much at all.\n\nBut individual scenarios are great. They range from 6-turn affairs with just 20 units on either side, to 18-turn massive battles with dozens and dozens of units to move around. And the scenarios can be played in single-player, in on-line multi, or in hot-seat multi modes, so if the (remarkably good) AI isn't quite enough, you can easily recruit a friend in your neighborhood to play against you.\n\nIt's alot of fun, and I recommend getting the DLC packs (Red-Turn and Black-Turn) pretty much right away so that you have a good number of scenarios to play through. That said, there are also user-created scenarios on Steam Workshop, I believe, but they vary greatly in challenge and entertainment value.\n","March 20, 2014","true","124.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I suppose is accurate? It's not really a grognardy wargame at all though, and it's much more like a puzzle game -- but that's not to say it won't scratch the strategy gamer's itch (it excels at it). For a niche game, the art design is really fantastic, and the polish is second to none.\n\nThere was a very slight difficulty curve at the beginning, but definitely nothing like other games of the wargame genre. It took me about an hour to really get the hang of it and learn that I was supposed to be thinking strategically (longer term goals, forcing encirclements, getting my enemies out of supply, etc.) instead of thinking tactically (exploiting opportunities as they naturally occur). Once I got that method of thinking down, I was all good.\n\nOverall, it's challenging, and very rewarding when you beat each scenario.

DLC's consists of Red Turn(Which is "Race to Berlin") and Operation Barbarossa(1941 offensive of Germans)\n\nOnly minus sides of the game are first you can't be defender side while playing against AI. Developers say AI has its limitations and "think" only one or two steps forward. Ai is awesome as defender anyway so i'm not sure if i can count this as "minus" side.\n\nSecondly maps has turn points, if you fail to deliver all at the end you fail. You get more prestige points for earlier capture. Sometimes in bigger maps(like Moscow) it makes one crazy to lose at the end because of "turn limit" but you can always restart the map *shrugs* But it is kinda historical if you think Germans' race against winter(which failed) but again it is not a nice feature but i don't mind.\n\nExcept this everything, from AI to maps, from historical accuracy to gameplay, specific units(Romanian, SS, Italian, Hungarian divisions) to randomness(Such as weather change)...

To make a long story short: grab the game, you won't be disappointed.","August 31, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's biggest weakness is it's lack of customization.  You don't get to pick your units like in PG series. You can carry over experienced units if they happen to show up in later scenarios but it can be very difficult to level up a large number of units.  In addition, the game penalizes you for attempting to attempt a sound military victory and instead forces you to simply get units to objectives as fast as possible without regards to casualties or the state of your battle line, something no commander would ever ignore.  Overall I give it a 6/10, it could have been much more than it is.  The PG series did all of these things with a good level of balance that this game does not provide.","February 16, 2014","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definately it's much simplier, but still realistic. You won't have your core units anymore, nor alternative history scenarios (you just have to keep winning). You can't also chose from different types of units - you only have infantry (may be mechanized), cavalry and tanks (although you can add specialized step to each like artilery, enginers or recon). There is no fog of war and the scenerios are much shorter (half an hour is usually enough). No navy and air support is very simple. Still I like the game for the way how supply routes are treated. This is a thing that Panzer General really suffered at. You had to supply your units sometimes, but rarely, so they didn't really feel bad in encirclement. Here it is different. Your units even after one turn of lack of supplies will suffer and after second turn they can't attack. After third turn they are so easy to kill. Therefore in you offensive you really aim at a blitzkrieg - fast advance and encirclement. This adds another dimension which PG lacked. I would really like to play PG with this system implemented, but would I still find time for that? I'd like to play this alternative histories with my core units again - this game lacks a lot of stuff compared to PG but still is extremely fun to play!\n\nDefinately if you loved PG and don't have time for it's enormous scenarios anymore - this is a game for you. Highly recommended. If you have time - why not install original PG on dosbox instead? If you never tried PG and you like hexes then you will be probbably amazed with the game.","January 13, 2014","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game mechanics never get in the way of playing out your strategy.

Even after multiple plays, it is difficult to get a decisive victory condition in the scenrios, never mind getting a brilliant victory, which requires a bit of luck as well as perfectly executed strategy.\n\nI come from a tradition of board war games from S&T, AH, West End Games, Decision Games","May 25, 2013","true","106.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
