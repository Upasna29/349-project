It takes gameplay elements of games like Torchlight 2 and combines them with a level creation system that reminds me of a cross between Little Big Planet and Minecraft.\n\nThe game starts at your house where you can manage characters and access things like the level creator or user adventures. Once in the game you fight off monsters, find keys, and pull levers to reach the end.  As you play your character gains levels, skills, and tons of loot.  You will constantly be scouring the ground for helmets, armor, weapons, and more.\n\nDamage is done with a primary weapon of choice, a heavy attack, or class specific skills.\nAll skills and items carry over between levels and every adventure scales with you so whether you play a an adventure for the first time at level one or replay it at level 5, it’s still fun and challenging.\n\nThe level editor or "Adventure Construction Kit", feels like a 3d modeling program and is simple yet deceptively powerful.  You can place monsters, traps, treasure, and sculpt the landscape as you see fit.\n\nI loved this game and can’t wait for more.","March 27, 2014","true","14.9"," 221 of 244 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","221","244","0","11"

Why have I waited so long? Because I've been having so much fun playing and creating, I hardly use my spare time for anything else! I think it's an outstanding, highly entertaining game! The community-generated "adventures" make this game virtually unlimited in it's original gameplay content.\n\nI should also add that I'm new to both the Hack & Slash and RPG genres...they just never appealed to me before. I bought this game because I think the devs are fantastic, having played both Cubemen and Cubemen 2, but I wasn't sure I would care for it that much. Boy, was I wrong to even think that! Now, I'm completely hooked and having a great time playing, interacting with the community in sharing/playing adventures, and in creating my own. The built in Adventure Construction Kit (ACK) is quite sophisticated yet easy to use. You can be building and publishing great-looking adventures in a fairly short amount of time.\n\nSo whether you're a seasoned pro in Hack n Slash and RPG games, or new to the genre as I was, I'm confident you're going to enjoy this game. If the current "Early Access" state is a concern for you, don't let it be. I would consider this a complete game...that just keeps getting better with each update, as cool new features are added on a regular basis.\n\nNow it's time to go back and conquer more "worlds" as I add to the already 450+ hours I've got in this game! That in itself should tell you quite a bit about how I feel about Fight the Dragon.","October 13, 2014","true","395.4"," 141 of 153 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","141","153","3","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BladeMcCloud/recommended/250560/","BladeMcCloud","Blade McCloud","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BladeMcCloud/","355 products in account","Fight The Dragon is a simple, community-driven dungeon crawler for up to 4 players, populated with maps designed by the players themselves. There are twelve customizable character slots, and four classes to choose from, each with different weapon proficiencies and four unique abilities: the fighter, the rogue, the ice wizard, and the pyromancer. If you've played a fantasy-themed game before, those classes shouldn't be unfamiliar. The playstyles are all a tad different, but early on, it becomes quite apparent that ranged combatants are considerably easier to play, and arguably more effective as well.\n\nThe look of the game is a bit classic. It isn't voxel, and it has smooth textures, but the shapes of the in-game models look quite crude in a few cases. Controls are fairly simple, and the mechanics of the game will come naturally to anyone who is familiar with the genre. The gameplay itself is smooth, if a tad unbalanced; it's rather easy for a map designer to make an area too difficult, whether intentionally or not, by saturating it heavily with certain, more powerful monsters. A good example is a trio of enemy pyromancers- they deal so much damage in such a short time that they will instantly kill you with fireballs and pillars of flame if you stand still for more than a thoughtful moment. Loot appears rather frequently, so it isn't too difficult to find a decent set of gear that compliments how you choose to play. A feature called the 'Loot Shrine' acts as an alternative to the typical store you'd find in the 'safe zone' of a dungeon-crawling RPG. Rather than buying and selling items, the game allows you to 'donate' all of your gold and unwanted gear for a chance at progressively better loot- the more you donate, the better the rewards, which come in the form of rare armor and weapons, extra stat points, increased inventory space, or other miscellaneous character upgrades. Although the game offers you three choices (typically one item and two 'other'), the choices are completely randomized, so you may end up finding some unattractive offers when you decide to cash out. I find this feature to be a refreshing change from the norm, and i've abused it quite a lot in my own time playing.\n\nThe gimmicks that make FtD stand out from similar titles are it's trademark Adventure Creation Kit, and the titled battle against the Dragon. The Adventure Creation Kit(ACK) allows a player to construct a dungeon, then play in it against his own creation, or upload it to the server to share with friends or the community as a whole. The ACK is very user-friendly, and it's fun to play with. The design options that it gives you allow you to make maps of all sizes, or even chain multiple dungeons together to create a full campaign with multiple levels. The designer truly allows for an impressive amount of customization and creativity.\nFighting the Dragon, as many would assume from the title, is an integral part of the game. At any time, provided your character has recieved a Dragon Scroll by completing a dungeon, you may challenge the dragon arena. The Dragon itself is extremely strong; with a massive, constant HP pool and tons of damage output, he's an extremely tough opponent, only killable with determination and lots of patience (and Dragon Scrolls). Each scroll you use gives you three lives to deal as much damage as possible to the Dragon, before inevitably getting massacred and sent packing back into the player-made dungeons. Fortunately, the Dragon's health bar is consistent through attempts, so the damage you deal in each battle will carry over to the next time. Each time you reach a certain point of progress(by consistently putting tiny dents in his health), you will get a shiny red piece of Dragon loot that has a very special effect, but will disappear after you've used it for a certain time. I find that these two features really do make the game a special one, and it allows the player to take a much-needed break from the constant loot grind.\n\nOverall, the game is put together well, and only suffers from a few minor bugs and glitches. The biggest issue I have with the game is a lack of balance and character development; aside from getting a new ability at level 5, 10, 15, etc., your gear makes your character what it is, and there is very little variance between two characters of the same class. Ranged weapons and kiting tactics seem to be the way to go most of the time, especially when the difficulty ramps up so quickly in most cases. The enemies deal a legitimately high amount of damage per attack, and some fights can cost the players a few lives before they can get a grasp on the situation. Aside from those few complaints, however, this is a gem of a game, would recommend to fans of the genre and RPGs in general.\n\nAppearance: 3.5/5, basic textures, mostly attractive, sounds get repetitive and could have more variety.\nControls: 4.5/5, easy to pick up and play, mechanics aren't too hard, everything works how it should.\nGameplay: 4/5, bugs are few and far between, the ACK is fun, character building could use more options.\nReplayability: 4/5, the ACK keeps the game fresh, but enemies get a bit repetitive.\nOverall: 4/5, a good, solid dungeon crawler with some fun gimmicks and extra tools to make the game unique.","December 22, 2014","true","14.7"," 115 of 124 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","115","124","2","3"

And this isn't taking into account the almost weekly updates the game will be receiving, already one in it's first week adding two entirely new sections of props to diversify your creations with. In short, map making is extremely addictive, often time consuming, and in the end EXTREMELY rewarding.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very fun and straightforward, almost arcade-y in a Gauntlet sort of way moreso than how modern grindy ARPGs of today play. There's already a great loot system in place that scales to your level (max 30 currently), with legendary and rare items to find that give you additional stat boosts and sometimes elemental attacks. The adventures themselves are all user-generated (outside of a small handful of high-quality maps created by the develepor to show off what you can make), which is awesome for both the person exploring levels and the people creating maps, because everyone gets a fair chance at having what they made getting played. There is one other mode, a really cool concept which the game gets it's name from where you fight a dragon in an arena with a ridiculous amount of health (millions). Killing the dragon in one, or even dozens of tries is impossible so you'll have to earn Dragon Tickets by completing Adventure maps created by the community in order to keep chipping away at it's health. There are currently no end-game rewards for the dragon that I know of (to be honest, it's so tough I don't think it's even been beaten by more than a few people yet) but it already has a leaderboard to rank you against other players based on damage done. I can't wait to see where this mode goes.\n\n\nThese are only the basics really, the game has so much to do already and there's a lot more to come. If you're at all interested in creating worlds or playing other peoples' then check this out and come by the community hub, the community is very active and the developer is amazingly responsive to feedback and questions!","April 2, 2014","true","249.3"," 98 of 112 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","98","112","0","2"

I never made my own level in such a well designed tool and it was a blast. Seeing the number of people playing is addictive, akin to facebooking. The great thing about UG levels is the spectrum of game style is vast: from arcade to intricate RPG stories with fantastic ramp up in difficulty. The amount of level is enormous, the quality varies.\n\nThe main game loop is: hack, pick up worthy loot, sell the least valuable to get extra goodies, level up.\nOn top of that you attack a Dragon with a ginormous amount of HP, when you die, and you will die very often, you get kicked out of the arena and go back to the main game of leveling up, the HP is kept where it was.\n\nThis makes for a very addictive game.\n\nHighly recommended.","December 5, 2014","true","15.0"," 84 of 94 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","84","94","2","1"

The game is based around player created adventures but lacks a fair implementation of advertising any new adventures.\n\nSearching for adventures at first glaces seems to be very complex but after a while you you notice a poor design choice.  Only the top 24 adventures will ever be displayed in a search, no matter how many tags you select.  What does this mean?  Only adventures with a high rating will ever be visible to other players to play, meaning, your new maps will never get a chance to be played unless someone searches for it by name.  You can search for Easy, Medium, Hard, or Extreme adventures, but you will never see any adventures that are 25th+ place.  Yeah there is a search for newly created adventures, but that category only shows adventures that haven't been played once.  Once someone plays it, your adventure is now unsearchable.  There is a category for weekly, monthly, and featured adventures but those will always display the same 24 adventures in the category, most of which are the same adventures.  Since I have been playing, no new maps were added to featured (about 2 months).  There is an option to play a random adventure, but that only selects an adventure you haven't played yet in one of the top 24 adventure categories, only playing a truly random map after those have been exhausted.","December 8, 2014","false","92.0"," 257 of 345 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","257","345","2","38"

As you can see in my profile i usually dont write much reviews but this game is a exception.\n\nThe devs are pushing updates nearly every day. And every update brings new stuff for the players, like Items, new gameplay mecanics and so on. There also seems to be a community who making maps already, I played a couple of very well made usermaps.\n\nThe gameplay, to be more specific, is a classic dungeon crawler. You have your hero, fight your way through the (usermade) adventures and get loot for that. The enemys stay dangerous so you will not reach the point when you can rush then levels without getting in trouble. Even with a nice shiny suit of armor a big troll can kill you with one or two hits. (Oh i really hate these trolls ;))\nFor every adventure you finish you will get a access to the dragon arena, where you can fight a gigantic (i`m sure you know whats coming) Dragon! The dragon dont regenerate his health between the battles, so you can fight him between your adventures.\nThe controlls work pretty solid, the graphics are lovely, and thanks to the usermade levels you will have an unique adventure every time you play the game.\n\nAns that`s pretty much what it`s all about for me in this game. Having an new adventure every time i play.\n\nI dosent publish my own adventures for now, but im working on it. The editor works fine and making maps is pretty easy. With that editor you can create maps with exact the same features as the developer does. So theres no difference between user maps and developer maps except what the person behind the map-editor does.\n\nWell invested money for me, one of the best games i have in my steam library.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nA very nice game. Lots of loot, traps and enemys. And (thank devs!) it`s not one of these to fast, to colourfull game that makes you headaches. It`s a very fun game and a nice mix of building you dungeon and explore others.\n\nThis game is what i thought or hoped to get when i installed "The quest for mighty loot".\n\nI highly recommend this great game and looking forward for the next updates.","February 27, 2014","true","25.6"," 84 of 109 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","84","109","0","4"

This means lots of diversity.  It also constantly improves the idea of a good "map": as one plays different maps from different users, his own taste for a "good" map diversifies and shifts.\n\nWhat's even better is that, there are quality maps.  Some maps you can tell the designer spent hours on perfecting.  The map creation kit also handles very well-- easy to grasp and almost anyone can build a map. The creation kit is also powerful enough to allow users to create very different environments-- a very elegant blend of simplicity and power.\n\nThe game is easy to get into.  Jump into a game, and click on the bad guys. Key bindings are laid out clearly.  The gear is diversified, and your character changes appearance with each piece of equipment equipped. The loot system is balanced in terms of statistics, and it constantly poses questions like, "would you sacrifice LUCK(magic find and crit chance) for damage?"\n\nThe bad:\n\nCombat... feels a bit slippery.  Sometimes it feels like youre walking on ice: as you take damage you slide around, and so do your enemies.  Your special abilities are limited.  You have only 4.  Worse, you don't unlock all of them until higher levels.  This makes lower level combat repetitive and at times, monotonous.\n\nThere are also certain balancing issues in the game.  As you reach levels 10+, you begin to encounter enemies that can 1 shot you... even with gear deemed rare, extraordinary, and legendary.  (Gear ranks from junk, common, rare, extraordinary, and legendary.)\n\nThe downside to incorporating the gaming community into content creation is that there will be inevitably faulty maps that are incompletable or maps that overreward you/ under reward you.  While I understand the developer has taken steps to mitigate such problems, the issues still exist.  I have encountered very hard challenges on maps marked as "easy".\n\nMultiplayer is bare bones.  You can join on players (though, I have NEVER seen more than 2-3 joinable games within the US at any given point in time).  However, you can't trade, share, or give loot.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nI say hold off on this one.See what else the developer has to offer.  Right now, the game is still rough (of course, its in alpha), and still needs some tweaking.  With the features it has right now, it just isn't worth purchasing for 15 bucks.\n","April 13, 2014","false","7.5"," 135 of 190 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","135","190","0","8"

Do not expect torchlight or diablo or titan quest or any of the other AAA hack and slash games with this one.  What you get is a quirky art style and a ton of bite sized adventures. ( Campaigns are incoming and will likely link together two or more adventures ).\n\nThe main reason to get this game is the fact that the ACK ( Adventure Creation kit ) allows you to design and create a variety of adventures ranging from simple 1 room arena battles to complex dungeons with puzzles, switche,s traps, platforming, and locked doors that require you to get a color coded key - ( Doom anyone? ).\n\nI've only had this game for two days but have already created and published 3 adventures.\n\nIf you want a hack and slash game that looks overly simple but has suprising depth and limitless content, pick this up.\n\nIf you want to create short engaging little adventures that range from 5 minutes of gameplay to 30 minutes of gameplay pick this up.  The ACK is the easiest to use editor I have ever used.\n\nOh I almost forgot that unlike most games, this one has a BOSS DRAGON that you need to earn scrolls to be able to teleport to the Dragon's Lair and try and defeat him.  He has persistent health and this is a must considering he has 1,000,000 health and the firs titme I fought him I managed to deal 50 damage total with 3 lives.

The premise of the game is to adventure in community-created campaigns, finding keys, unraveling small plots, looting better items, and making your way to fighting the dragon by collecting Dragon Scrolls.  It's almost like Shadowrun Returns, but without the developer-created campaign.  There are some REALLY good adventures to go on by the community.\n\nHowever, it's like finding needles in a haystack - the majority of GREAT community-created scenarios are far and few between.  Many fall short between amateur DMs and wannabe writers akin to middle school English class.  75% of the adventures you will partake in often have glaring issues like loot balancing, confusing or short level design, awful dialogue and spelling mistakes and more.  It seems like anyone can create a dungeon with 5 rooms, 50 potions, tons of easy enemies and enough loot to make the game not much fun.\n\nThis game is AMAZING for DM's and really shines in the way of quick pick-up and random co-op play.  It falls short in the way that the majority of the content is shallow or just bad.

If you're looking for good content, I recommend NOT looking at the highest rated content because they happen to be the most bland and generic of them all. It makes me wonder how exactly they became the top rated in the first place, while unique and creative maps go completely unnoticed. This is because of how the game streamlines new content; it does it very poorly. There is a "new content" tab but its clearly filled with "not new content" because of the amount of ratings each map has, as if they haven't updated the new content tab since alpha. You just have to hope that your map falls under the "local unplayed map" pool that seems to be randomly generated for each user, since that is the actual "new content" tab, but this tab seems to only have like 5-7 maps at a time. I published my map yesterday, and as of right now, only one person other than me has played it. This game prides itself for over-saturation of content, when in reality, it's the main downfall of this game. You really have to sift through a lot of crap to find a few gems, or just give up and make your own gems that only you will end up playing anyway.\n\nWhich brings me to why im recommending this game: The level editor.\nIf you like creating your own levels, but are completely stupid and impatient when it comes to using editors (like me), then I highly recommend this game, because not only is the editor extremely easy to use, its also very intricate. You can do practically anything with this level editor. Every interactable item or prop you can place has its own programmable event tab, which you can use to trigger events throughout your level. Events such as "When this monster dies, break down breakable wall" or "When player opens this chest, close X doors and spawn Y monsters in vicinity". There are so many things you can do with this level editor, that you will spend so many hours messing with it and thinking of creative ways to use it. The only problem I have with it is that there's not a huge selection of props, textures, and enemies.\n\nNow you may be saying to yourself "That's great and all, but hows the gameplay?"\nWell, the combat is a bit clunky and needs improvement... But LOOK AT HOW SHINY THIS LEVEL EDITOR IS!\n\nIn all seriousness though, if you like to create your own levels, but don't have the knowledge or patience to use a professional editor, then it is well worth the money. The game itself ain't half bad either, if you can deal with a few bad eggs.\n\n\n","December 6, 2014","true","63.2"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","38","44","0","1"

The look/style of the game and the characters look to be unique. (It also look like a bit "Lego" style) The gameplay is really interesting as simple, just attack monsters, find look, solves puzzles, fight tougth bosses, find more loot, upgrade your character, etc... Most of the levels are made by the community. Then the dragon fight is also really nice as it is hard and fun at the same time (and also really long, since you have to do it in multiple sessions because the dragon have 1Million HP) The game have a lot to offer and is replay value is really high!\n\nThe Adventure Construction Kit is the main thing that made me buy the game, it is really what I always have dream to see in a RPG/Hack'n'Slash game: Being able to build your own levels/adventures in a simple easy way! The number of stuff in the ACK is really big and the dev said to continue to add more!\n\nThe co-op drop-in/drop-out work really nicely and it's always fun to be able to play with a friend in the same room! The online mode is also really nice so you can also play with your friends but also with other people around the world!\n\nThe Customisation of the characters is really nice, mostly from the community too, I found myself that it is a bit hard to create personalised skin/head if you don't have drawing skill.\n\nSo in general you play levels made by the dev but mostly by other people, get loot, upgrade your character and get Dragon Scrolls to fight the dragon AND/OR also create levels how you always have dreamed or let your imagination free.\n\nI really recommend this awesome game and I still can't wait for more updates and props!\n\nThanks 3 Sprockets for this game!\n\n(Note: Sorry for my english, usualy speak French, but wanted to make an english review)","February 27, 2014","true","109.5"," 51 of 68 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","51","68","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chaemirix/recommended/250560/","Chaemirix","Chaemirix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chaemirix/","153 products in account","Disclaimer: I'm not terribly far into the game, nor do I love ARPGs as a genre. I was gifted this game by a friend so we'd have a game to play as a group, and as a result my experience is solely low-levels with 4 players. If we delve further into it and my opinion changes, I'll modify this review to reflect it.\n\n\nThis game has a lot going for it. It has a bunch of small features that really improve the quality of life of the game, things I would have loved to see in other ARPGs. The amount of content being created for the game is awesome to see, and the loot system is pretty well done. That being said, I can't help but feel they really dropped the ball on combat and movement.\n\nPros:\nThe loot system in the game is fairly well done. Judging by a few of the items I saw, some late game items will modify playstyles significantly enough to justify tags such as legendary. I love that you have a reason to pick up all your trash. The loot alter is a fantastic way to deal with that, although I'm not sure what else gold is used for, and as a result it feels tacked on as a system for getting trash loot without actually picking it up. It's certainly convenient but feels underwhelming as a whole. I'm not sure how I feel about Dragon Rings, but it's not a bad idea per se.\n\nOne of the best features of this game is the fact that the community creates content. To be honest not a ton of it wowed me, but there was quite a bit of it that was well done and as a result each run felt much better than a standard randomly generated run would.\n\n\nCons:\nThe game features an incredibly simplified combat system that gets repetitive, fast. It's not an issue by itself, but when coupled by the sliding, non-grounded movement the game just feels very poorly made from a design standpoint. It makes the game feel a bit fast and frantic, with almost no tactics involved. When you throw in a few more players it becomes awful trying to navigate through small areas due to player collision, which simply does not work in a game like this in my opinion. I can only assume most dungeons are designed for one player.\n\nOn a similar note, the game's difficulty does not scale well at all in 4 player groups. We were picking "extreme" difficulty missions every time and I don't think any of us ever took much damage. The only deaths we had were when we had to commit suicide because we jumped into a part of a dungeon we weren't suppose to be at yet and couldn't progress, or we knocked each other off of terrain from collision due to latency issues. It also doesn't seem like there's a lot of actual content in world building. Perhaps some content is level-gated, but we were seeing the exact same sets of environments, enemies, traps, and levers the entire time. If the community is able to bring in new art assets to worlds, this will likely be a non-issue, but the core game feels lacking in diversity.\n\nDespite the name "Fight the Dragon" along with a tag for mutliplayer, you cannot fight the dragon with friends. It's just your standard ARPG run around getting loot game with no real bosses (at least that we've run into), which gets a bit boring. (to me at least, some people love that as a core)\n\n\n\ntl;dr - Fight the Dragon has a great core idea, and I'm sure a ton of people will love it. I just can't help but feel the simplicity of the combat system mixed with the weird floating/gliding movement is holding it back from being an actual great game.","December 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 131 of 202 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","131","202","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterGentleman/recommended/250560/","MasterGentleman","MasterGentleman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MasterGentleman/","155 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe words of the day: simplistic intricacy.\n\nThose two words sum up the whole of what Fight The Dragon (FTD) is all about.  At first glance, the core gameplay appears simple – and it is.  Upon a deeper inspection, however, the intricacies begin to emerge – particularly in its level designer, which I will go into more later.\n\nFTD is essentially Little Big Planet meets a simple overhead hack-‘n’-slash.  A number of community levels and a few tutorial missions await the player within this game.  The interface to select your adventure is easy to use and find what you’re looking for, and there is a search system that allows you to find a level that matches the difficulty you want, whether it’s a favorite of the community, or you can do a direct search for a specific title.\n\nThe first order of business is to choose a character class: Fighter, Black Rogue, Fire Lord, and Ice Wizard.  Each of these classes has their own unique abilities and stats, which offers greater variety and opportunities to customize multiple playthroughs.  The appearances of your character can also be customized (to an extent) afterwards at your home base.\n\nWhile there are many options for combat in this game, the ones that will be used the most are the basic attack and a class-specific special attack (A and B respectively on an XBox controller, which I recommend using).  These moves are all you need if you employ a hit-and-run strategy like I do.  That’s the simple side of it; the more intricate side is that you can also block, dodge, and use another special move as well if you want.  But that feels a bit superfluous sometimes and the majority of your time will be spent just hacking and slashing with your basic moves.\n\nThe game also provides ample possibilities for platforming adventures if combat is not where your interests lie.  Climbing, running, and leaping across chasms and lava appears simple enough.  However, doing it *well* takes  a little more attention and skill.  Then try doing it while some skeleton shoots arrows at you or a pyromancer blasts you with fire.  Or do it over lava where you have to think, “Okay, I have to time my sprinting right and aim perfectly or I’m gonna fall into hot burning lava and – dang it, now I’m dead.  Back to the checkpoint.”\n\nAfter a level, you can donate your unwanted equipment and excess gold to the Loot Shrine, building up enough credit to eventually earn a reward.  The more credit you build up before seeking a reward, the greater the reward.  It's a nice way to reward the people who spend time collecting what is often useless armor or weapons dropped in a level.\n\nBut it is with the level editor that this game truly shines and brings to the forefront the reason FTD works so well.  Looking at a custom-designed level, it’s easy to assume that only someone who has played the game long enough and mastered the minute details could create something intricate and amazing.  At least, that’s the mindset I went into the level designer with.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nWithin a matter of hours, I had created a level that involved a good amount of platforming and combat, tested it multiple times, and then released it to the community.  I had only played the game a few hours before to learn the basic buttons and get a feel for the game.  The instructions on how to use different components and how to connect cause-and-effects (i.e. kill this enemy, door opens).  Enemy stats can be modified to vary every time you enter a level.  There are also a lot of different options for what kind of level you want to create.  Various indoor and outdoor biomes are available, and you can mix and match at will.  You can create a massive level before you reach your “building point” limit, and that is half of the fun.\n\n**To see the level I created in my first attempt, look up Necrypt in the level gallery.**\n\nHowever, there are a few points that should be addressed in terms of what this game does not do so well.\nCurrently there is no way to rebind buttons on the controller.  Sometimes the button combinations to do something are not intuitive or easy (i.e. pressing RB and Y together to switch between primary and alternative weapons).\nMusic tracks for the levels are limited to 9 arrangements that sound very similar.\nSometimes when creating a level, if you accidentally enter “Event Picker Mode,” you can get stuck there and be unable to leave.  Let’s say you place an enemy and you enter this mode .  You have to select an object for it to be connected to, but if there is no such object around, you are stuck in this mode (hitting B does not free you from the mode).\nCombat can feel extremely simple and not be too exciting after awhile.\nA few more options available in the character customization would not be amiss.\n\nAll in all, Fight The Dragon is great fun.  The negative points I listed above are nitpicks at best, and they don’t interfere too much with the overall enjoyment of the game.  And as it is in Early Access still, I look forward to some of the features 3 Sprockets have yet to release.  But if you’re looking for a great game that is constantly growing in a community and bringing forth new features, take a look at Fight The Dragon.\n\nUPDATE NEWS:\n\n11/7\nLOCAL CO-OP\nHaving tried this mode with one of my friends, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  While split-screens tend to be too small to make out details clearly, having a two-player split down the middle wasn't terrible.  That may have been because we had a laptop hooked up to a TV, though.....\n\nOne way that this mode would be improved would be to have the split be horizontal instead, giving a greater field of view for each player.  Granted, the reason that this was not done was to accomodate the vision lost by whoever would have the Keys or other information on their screen, but I tend to prefer seeing more side to side so I can tell what threats are around.\n\nAnother annoyance (which may have been altered in an update just after this experience) was that two people could not be at the home base at once.  Which made the process of transfering goods into the Loot Shrine tedious because one person would have to use the Player 1 controller to drop off loot and money, then he/she'd have to return to the house and switch to the other player.  THEN the controller would have to be handed over to that person so they could do their transfers.  It doubled the administrative tasks needed before we could return to what we REALLY wanted to be doing: adventuring!\n\nDEVELOPER UPDATES\nI'm happy to report that I love the continued growth in content provided by the developers for this game.  Almost weekly there's a new update that adds more to the experience than the last and improves it.  More features for the level designer are being implemented, fixes are being made to some bugs -- all of this attention given to ensuring that this game continues to excel both surprises and delights me, and it makes me regret less and less that the DAY AFTER I purchased FTD there was a 50% off sale.\n\nKudos to 3 Sprockets; you've done a great job with your game.  Now keep at it and continue to impress me more and more.\n\n**Review updates yet to be included/experienced:\nOnline Multiplayer\nThe Dragon Fight","September 25, 2014","true","36.6"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

I've played almost every single game in the arpg genre. While Fight the Dragon isn't exactly like a traditional arpg due to its incorporation of things like puzzles and its lack of a main storyline I feel it more than makes up for it in its replay value as well as its customisability.\n\nIt all starts with their Adventure Creation Kit. This is a simple to learn editor that allows players to create and share their own adventures.\nPlayers can also share their adventures or campaigns online. The game has Steam workshop integration. You can subscribe to custom character modifications that let you change your characters look OR you can share your own creations with others. Adventures (as well as gameplay) are also cross-platform.\n\nThis game has a ton of replay value. There are over 3k player-made adventures, and more are added all the time. There's also four player co-op via internet OR LAN, and two player local co-op! Between single player content and multiplayer it means way more than your moneys worth. There  are features that haven't been implemented yet. Money has no use aside from the games 'loot sacrifice' system. Every player gets a loot shrine. They can add excess loot to get donation tiers.\n\nWhen you've donated enough items to reach the next tier you get to choose a random item of rare or better quality. It means your chances of getting something decent are good whether you accomplish an adventure or not. This game is challenging! It has easy maps but the real fun starts on medium. Maps aren't just about killing monsters. There are puzzles to solve as well. It means that no matter how many times you play the game there's always a new problem to solve which means less chance of losing interest.\n\nI think this game is worth the low price they're charging for it ($14.99, currently on sale (as of 12-10-14) for $11.99), and the developers are constantly adding great new features to it. I think this is a solid buy for any arpg fan or for anyone who loves a good hack and slash dungeon crawling adventure.","December 10, 2014","true","12.3"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","0"

RPG'ish.\n\nthe mechanics of melee attacks, mana/rage attacks, and movement seem like that perfect balance, so that you've got options and growth in what your character can do, but you don't have an overwhelming number of things that you can do that clutter controls and make gameplay fiddly.\n\nthe comparisons are to Torchlight II, and that is a great comparison, a fair comparison, and a compliment to both games.\n\nonce you start playing, if you have a mind and disposition for these things, you instantly recognize how the engine and the level editor are truly going to be best friends, and how creating levels for the engine is going to be intuitve and awesome for a fan with that creative bent.\n\nthe browsing of fan content, and integrating that content into a given users play experience (the workshop/level browser) looks and feels like it could be awesome and literally a game changer for games using distributions systems like steam.\n\nit'll be interesting to see if the community driven content mechanic is able to seperate the wheat from the chaff so that players can get access to "good" levels, and robust, connected experiences.\n\nthe content browser supports a number of filters that give some pretty good control to the consumer for finding the content from the community that meets good criteria, such as 'popular' and 'by a given author'.\n\nthe engine and level development tools are designed to favor small experiences, which will make it interesting to see how larger experiences are serialized by level developers.\n\nwith my limited gameplay experience so far, i have nothing bad to say about the engine ... i _really_ like how it plays, and i like the "art" and look and feel so far.\n\nthe developer is taking a huge chance that the "community" is going to create good quality content that is going to make their game worth playing, vs. bad content making the game "suck".\n\ni'm a little worried about that part, but a) it's too early to tell, and b) i would imagine, if the developers are smart, that they might curate or produce enough of the content at some point, that the game could be played with _just_ that curated content and be complete and good.\n","December 8, 2014","true","5.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The level editor is fairly straightforward, and very nicely integrated in to the game. Because of the level editor, content never dries out, so there is always a new level to play. There will be the occasional bad level of course, because of the nature of user generated content, but even those can at least be enjoyed with good enough company.\n\nI would not recommend this game as strongly if you are not able to convince some of your friends to play it with you too, since that is where a lot of the fun comes from, but it is still enjoyable solo.\n\nThe game is not without flaws, and in a lot of ways does kind of feel like it... hasn't REALLY left early access yet, despite recently transitioning to full release. But most of the issues at the moment aren't deal breakers (things like some equipment affixes not scaling well beyond the early levels), and the developers are still working on the game actively and are very interactive with the community, so I am not really worried about the issues all in all.","December 22, 2014","true","50.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The combat on the other hand is decent enough and actually has quite enjoyable platforming and puzzle elements.\nThe thing is that it won't be as interesting if you don't have an interest in the level creator nor have a friend who is an avid level creator. I really enjoy making levels for me and my friends to play together, so I indulge in that part of the game very much.\n\nNote that the game is still updating as I write this review!\n\nIf I were to put it in bullet points, it would go something like this.\nPros:\n+ Fun and simplistic 4-player dungeon crawling experience\n+ A fairly good selection of classes to play with, could use some more though\n+ Somewhat interesting rogue-inspired dragon main boss fight, accessible any time\n+ A unique and ever-expanding community driven experience\n+ Incredibly simple yet capably advanced level creator in the right hands, with lots to work with\n+ Well thought-out criteria for publishing an Adventure\n+ Randomized Loot System keeps finding loot interesting\n+ Some decent workshop support to make your character look more out of the ordinary\nCons:\n- Inability to 'Fight the Dragon' cooperatively, even though the ability to feels implied in the title screen\n- Combat remains somewhat repetitive, particularly with the lack of variety in skills (updates may change this)\n- Enemy AI regardless of enemy 'difficulty setting' remains predictable (an eventual update, perhaps?)\n- Editor's Building Point and Difficulty systems somewhat strict, making it hard to create expansive and difficult single-adventure experiences\n- Editor only allows selection of regular and 'miniboss' enemies, no real boss-type enemies, resulting in massing enemies to create a sense of difficulty or dangerous boss-rooms\n- All enemies, logic nodes, and props handled on the same layer in Editor, creating some disappointing set-backs (I can't place enemies on top of destructible walls?)\n- Sound effects and music are somewhat limited\n\n- Needs a bigger community, join us!\n\n--- The Long Review ---\n\nTo say it beforehand so that I can get it out of the way,\nI love this game. I understand that it is still being developed and I hope it has a bright future ahead of it.\n\nCOMBAT AND GAMEPLAY\nThe combat is extremely simple with a simple attack button, use button, and skill buttons. There are also potions to use, whether healing or mana which can be found in chests placed by creators. The interesting part about the gameplay however, is that creators can incorporate platforming, traps, and verticality into their maps to build a more stylized playthrough. I appreciate a map that tries to put in a decent story, as well- seeing as the game itself at the core has pretty much no particular story in any way.\n\nCreators can also include switch, key, pressure-plate and enemy kill puzzles into their maps, making a level more than just fighting all the time. By nitpicking through the creator, I could even create these miniature cutscenes or sequences with whatever's available right now, too.\n\nThis game has some super-simple and really effective drop-in, drop-out coop that takes no effort at all. Multiplayer really does make this game worth playing, and enemies try to scale in health and power.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION\nCharacter customization allows you to choose from a variety of heads, and hair- allowing you to scale and position them how you want. Using the Steam Workshop, there are a selection of things there to make your character look more unique than the choices that are given to you by default (I love my pyramid head). If the community were larger, there would be such a great selection of things to turn your character into.\n\nLEVEL EDITOR\nThe level editor is among of the best I've seen, while being easy to get into with many advanced things you can learn. The game offers many different kinds of tiles ranging from many different stones to sand to snow and etc. There's also a wide variety of props to help spice up a level design. Enemies with varying difficulty that can be placed in a level are varied enough so that there's enough to make diverse kinds of levels with different monsters to face- but more would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI won't go in depth, but where the editor gets fun is the inclusion of logic blocks, logic switches, gates, key doors and all that jazz. Utilizing the game's verticality also makes it more fun- being able to set up platforming areas or places that you need to jump or climb to reach.\n\nABOUT THE CONS\nEven though there may be many cons in that list, I believe that many of them can be solved with future updates to the game, so long as it gets continuous support. Many people are still disappointed by the fact that you cannot cooperate to fight the dragon, though- myself included. Something needs to be done about the Fight the Dragon aspect of the game, but I don't think that's what makes the game special (even though it's the name of the game). The game however, is a little too easy overall and it'd be nice if there was more of a curve that isn't just putting a bigger handicap on.\n\nWE WANT MORE\nI would love for this game to be updated more and more so that level creators can make truly unique adventures between map-to-map- with things like tons of different enemies and dynamic environment objects like drawbridges, moving platforms, slippery blocks, catapults, water currents, rolling boulders and the like. Other things like the inclusion of friendly combat NPCs, vehicles, pets, and even tilesets would be great. I noticed a weapon label for each enemy in the creator, will we see enemies like Ghost Armour sporting a greatsword or giant flail at some point?\n\nThere were more than enough times while I was in the creator where I said things like 'I wish I could do this' and 'I wish I could do that', but there just isn't enough yet to allow it. One of the biggest problems I faced while making maps was the building point limit and the difficulty limit, needing to add more potions or reduce/shuffle enemies around when I felt it was completely unnecessary takes up a lot of my time making a map. Campaigns do remedy this in certain ways though.\n\nJust give us more, FTD crew. I'm not expecting this to happen overnight, but we want more because we want to make even better maps for everyone to play- and I don't see anything wrong with that.\n\nTHE PROBLEM AT HAND\nMuch of the problem remains in the fact that this game is fairly unknown, with none of my friends knowing this game even existed until I told them about it. Considering that this is almost a purely community driven game, this game needs to be supported by many people and this is a problem that may need to be addressed before it's too late.\n\nA WORD FOR THE FTD COMMUNITY\nThe last thing I can really say is that the community itself also needs to step up to the plate when it comes to making levels. There are many levels upon choosing quick-select that are simple hack and slash, very plain easy levels that aren't particularly unique in any given way. Being on a grand quest to fill out the map, I feel that using the quick-select is the best way to get that 'I'm on an adventure' feeling, otherwise I'd use the Gallery a lot more. I don't believe that this is something the developers can fix, but it would be preferrable to find some more of the great blood-sweat-and-tears adventures out there.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nI really think that this game deserves more attention to bring out its true potential, and I want to see this game have a bright future because I think it has tons of potential to be expanded on. Buy this game- buy it on sale if you have to. Support the developers and contribute to the FTD community because there is the potential for something incredible here.","July 30, 2015","true","131.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

FTD is such a game. I will break it all down into three parts: single player, online play ( multi-player), and creative. But first one thing that strikes me from the start: the graphic design of the game is such that it will ( or should) run on low-end computers. The visuals are, for lack of a better term- quirky. Its like a cross between Legos games and LBW with a dash of WoW.\n\n*Single player- In single player you go to an "adventure" screen where you can bring up an incredible assortment of maps to play on. It should be noted ( im guessing here) that over 90% of the availible maps are created BY OTHER PLAYERS. This is both a blessing and a curse: Player-made content is wide and varied. You may get a great and fun map; you may get one that was obviously made by a ADD 12-year old.\n\nIf you enjoy a player-made map, you can choose to "follow" that creator. This is a wonderful feature that highlights other maps made by favorite creators. Very nice feature.\n\n* Multiplayer- I cannot honestly say I have much exp with this. Problem is that most of the games going are "closed" ( ie friends only). I have only been in one MP map and I got there near the end of the run. Overall it was ok.\n\n* Creative- Now THIS is the reason why I think FTD is easily one of the best games in years; The UI that is used to make maps is very user-friendly. I have exp making maps for other games and its usually a bad learning curve. With ACK ( the map editor) I was making a map within 30 min of starting. You can "publish" ( make availble to other players) your creations via a simple-to-understand vetting process. This process ( I assume) is used to keep junk maps from being offered. It works....most of the time.  You may still come across just plain bad maps.\n\nThe bad side ( there has to be one right?)- The selection of enemy ( monsters etc) to place in maps are VERY limited. For a sword & sorcery game not to include enemy human casters? There are no, say, "friendy" men-at-arm NPCs to use. The list goes on. I can hope that all this will be added in future ( and free!) DLC.\n\n\nOverall- Simple but effective combat system, graphics that are cute but not kiddy, an incredible creative tool, and MP options to boot.\n\nI hope the devs of FTD get really REALLY rich, because they actually DESERVE it!\n\n\nRivetscore  9 /10\n\n** UPDATE++ July 21 2015\n\nAll of the above still holds true: I would just issue a warning for all those would-be story tellers out there; Don't bother. Want popular maps? The secret is to cater to the mouth-breathing imbecil players that want instant action / instant reward.\n\nDon't waste your time with characters, dialogue, set pieces...It will get you no recognition. Players today want ACTION.\n\nIt bears saying that these same instant-action players will get bored quick and move on....to be replaced by more of the same.\n\nI have been playing FTD since release and see much promise in the game; but the up / down voting system for maps stinks and stinks hard.\n\nI keep hoping the Devs will somehow wave the perverbial magic wand and set filters in place to furthur weed out what I call "Crap Maps" but it does not seem to be happening.\n\nOverall I stay with my original  Rivscore of 91/ 100\n\nYou have been warned!","December 30, 2014","true","693.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

But this isnt one of them.\n\nFight the dragon is an ARPG/Hack n Slash game where the adventures you go one are all made by the community. From dark forests to castles full of traps to long forgotten crypts this game has got it all. There is never a shortage of new and exciting levels to play. Be vigialnt though there are some out there who would put in exploit maps and unfinshed maps. The developers have stated they are working on a system that will find and block these maps. This game is early access to expect some unfinished or non-existant features. But that doesnt mean dont play it.\n\nPros:\n\n*Maps made by the community means many hours of adventuring fun.\n\n*Plenty of loot to find.\n\n*Local spit-screen 2players / online 2-4 players co-op with lan rumored for a later release.\n\n*Want to make your own maps? Fight the Dragon comes with an in-game editor to create and publish a map of your own!\nThe editor is easy to use and no coding or outside programs needed.\n\n*2 classes with more on the way!\n\n*Weekly and sometimes daily updates that does more than just fix bugs but add more contant.\n\n*Great and helpful community\n\nHere are some do and donts for map creation.\n\n*Dont make exploit maps poeple dont like them and they will get blocked.\n\n*Always add the end game piece to ensure that its possible for a player to actually win.\n\n*Here is tip. Start with making easy maps. Most new players with have Easy maps shown to them before harder ones so making some great looking easy maps is a way to get your name out there as a great adventure maker!\n\n*When you play a map and it is an exploit or a map without a finish report it we want to keep the map selection clean and fun!\n\nI bought this game on a whim and I will never look back. I have to say that so far I'm impressed and cant wait to see more. The developer is constantly in the forums and actively replaying to suggestions, bugs, and feedback to ensure they are making the game for us to be played by us.\n\nI say get the game and enjoy the time you spend playing it but remember the game is in early access so if a feature isnt in yet or you find a bug dont go ranting off in the forums about it post in the bug section and it will be cleared up as soon as they can get to it.\n\nThis is the best dungeoneering game I have come across as of yet and with time I'm sure it will be one of the best.\n\nNow lets hope for character skin mod support :D","April 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The game is worth checking out, but you may get bored with it.\n\nThis game features an extensive level designer which provides the main content of the game. Gameplay is entirely player-driven. However, popular maps dominate the player-created map browser, and new content is very difficult to find with it. It will only show brand new maps which have not been played yet. Once someone plays it, there is not a category for it, and the only way to find that map is to search it by name.\n\nCharacter development and items/loot is very simplistic, and they have responded to inquiry that they do not plan to flesh out character development. They have yet to improve items. The selection of monsters to fight could be improved as well.\n\nFor me, this meant that game-play became very linear and boring, as I always knew what to expect. Leveling never feels like an achievement. The only thing that changes when you level is the strength of monsters and the level of items that drop. The items are the same type with the same models and names, only their level is higher. Sure the game may be titled as a hack-n-slash, but that doesn't mean game-play should suffer at it's expense.\n\nSpecifically, not being able to choose from player abilities to distribute stats into (apart from the attributes, which you can add into) made leveling, and increasing attributes feel pointless. Items don't enhance abilities (the four you do happen to have) or give any creative options with the stats they alter. It's mostly just str, def, dex, and perhaps the rare increased loot and gold moniker. There are some burning and freezing attributes on items, but theres no way to enhance these aspects through skill or attribute points. Four different abilities for each class are pre-determined for you, unlockable at increasing levels. Some may like this lack of character and item depth, others may not, like myself. I wouldn't expect an extremely complex character and item customization, just at least some choices given to players to personalize their character to some degree, in terms of abilities, and items which correspond to those abilities.\n\nAt most, I would say this game was fun the first time I tried it's features out, then it became a mindless grind because new maps don't get enough exposure, and you end up playing the same top maps in the map browser. Yes, on player created maps, but still a pointless grind. In addition to that, the lack of character and item depth only made me lose interest more quickly.","May 31, 2015","true","58.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Sometimes you can't close a menu window and have to close the game by force (I just did it). The AI is incredible dumb, the enemies walks randomly, get stucked on terrain and objects or even just stop attacking.\nThere are very few appearence customization options. The devs offers the possibility to edit and upload skins, but that's not much fun.\nI'm playing an ice mage and a rogue and it's just impossible to beat a level counting on ranged/magic weaponry, you must draw your sword/axe and go melee everytime, full armored.

There is very little to complain about. Fun for short or extended play sessions. Progrssion is fair, and nothing is blocked behind a paywalls. No fun bucks required, just buy it, play it, the sky's the limit. It's everything that I wanted in Quest for Epic Loot, but didnt' get.\n\nFirst off, I feel like this game is like if Zelda, Diablo, and Little Big Planet. And like LBP it has something for everyone. if you like to play top down rpg's; you have an ever expanding selection of adventures. If you like to be creative, the level creatore is robust yet easy to learn. And, within those two categories' it has much to offer for the level of complexity that you desire.\n\nYou could focus on being artistic or you can use it more like RPG maker. Designing complex events, quests, or puzzles. You could simply play a level or two and see the sights or you could could delve heavily into optimizing your stats. Play by yourself, with friends, or strangers.\n\nThe online component is very intuitive. You can group up with friends privately or publicly. I haven't had any serious problems with lag. And, since it's all cooperative I have seen the least ill will playing this than any other online game I've ever experienced.\n\nI like thet there is some steam workshop support for character models. Instead of having to spend real money on fun bucks when I get bored with my appearence, I can just download a new one. It's touches like that that make me feel like I'm not being denied any content so the dev can weasel money out of me.\n\nAlso to the devs' credit. they have a suggestions forum that they actially take into acoount when releasing updates. So if you feel something is lacking, they may actually improve on it itf it's a good idea.\n\nAll in all, 9 out of 10.

While this punishes over reaching, it can be a bit frustrating!\n\nComes quite highly recommended!\n\nEDIT: Done messed up, you can dodge and block.

This is a fun Diablo + Minecraft type of game that you can play with friends or solo.\n\nThe idea of building your own levels normally means a HUGE time sink but this game allows you to spend a small bit of time making simple levels to fully laid out levels with your imagination as your guide. It's simple, fight through levels of enemies getting tickets towards an epic boss battle (A Dragon) where you can get epic gear.\n\nThe Devs are fully invested in this game giving updates often and they aren't always just minor tweaks but full bug fixes/additions etc. I also haven't noticed too many bugs other than a few enemies sticking in walls etc. but it is minor and not game breaking.\n\nRight now you can play two types of characters (knight/Fire mage) with two or more to be added later. The controls are mappable (ie.. WASD/Arrow keys) and the game plays great and is a lot of fun! A must buy for any RPG player! You can only level up to 30 atm but that will change as the game additions flood in. This is one of my favorite games atm.\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!","March 27, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's simple but there's a lot of variety in the gameplay, it all ends up being hack slash loot, but they try to mix it up with puzzles, and mix the original maps with user generated maps. I really enjoyed this title, especially at the price point it is. The loot system is fun, and allows you to customise almost all aspects of armour, which all offer different varying attributes for your character.\n\nIt can be too simple at times, but I think this is meant to be the little big planet of hack slash loot titles. It has nostalgic feelings of gauntlet, and dungeon crawlers. The graphics variety is nice, sound effects are adequate, but its he gameplay and the loot that keeps me coming back for more.\n\nOh and that dragon, what a B*, fun as hell, but difficult too. There's plenty of updates that add more and more items, more loot, more enemies and so on. The fact that it has a very simple interface means that creating custom user generated levels with the tools at hand is not a difficult feat.\n\nAll in all I really really like where this game is headed, and would definitely recommend it amongst the recent crop of Early Access titles","November 15, 2014","true","7.8"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

This way you never know what you are going to get and it can be a surprise in a good or bad way! One of the very fun parts of this game is that as a user you can create your own adventures, so there are some great user created maps out there! Also some less fun, but you can delete those and play the other ones. You also get a notification in case the world map gets an update, and you can play the map again. After completing the map, you can rate it to the user and tell him what you thought about the map. Like a normal adventure game, you run around killing mobs for loot and money. There are different types of loot as in other games, and you can equip your character with with loot designed for his class.

The gold and each item has a value and as you donate more, you increase in level as to how good of an item (or special skill or whatever) that you get in return when you "pray" (in other words, choose to cash in on your generosity).

This review is based on Early Access: Alpha 2.1. The concept of this game is simple, explore an array of user generated dungeons to acquire equipment and improve your character, currently only the Fighter & Fire Lord are available to play.\n\nThe games combat system is simple and well defined, though I am not entirely comfortable with the controllers interface, I found myself continuosly trying to open( X ) an enemy rather than attack them. Perhaps allow for controller remapping, or provide a map that uses the Left/Right Triggers for combat?\n\nEnemy characters look exceptional and are initially enjoyable to slay, however after a few levels I found myself killing the same monsters with little variance in their combat tactics, most monsetrs operate on a run towards player and attack strategy.\n\nThe game provides a swathe of equipment, with some rather enjoyable names, running through a dungeon can easily see your backpack being full of primarily junk items which you don't seem to be able to sell anywhere. In fact you can accumulate money but I'm not sure where you spend it?\n\nDungeons can feel slightly bland with monsters only being used as the main challenge, hopefully as users become more familiar with the map-editor and the editor provides more tools to create unique set-pieces that provide memorable engagements this will be satiated.\n\nOverall I found the game exceptionally enjoyable to play, but as it is Early Access lacking some of the components that could make it a truly great game.

Slashing or blasting your way through adventure after adventure is addicting, whether you're running through a new one or coming back to an old favorite for the thirtieth time because it's solidly made. The rewards for doing what the name of the game asks of you are nice, thought the timers are a bit irritating. The Adventure Creation Kit works just fine, as well. Which it should, because that's where Three Sprockets seems to be putting all their attention.\n\nSome weapons refuse to connect. The greatsword is the perfect example; the first two swings tend to miss. A lot. Even if the swing looks like it should have bisected your target. The axe also tends to catch air if you put it half an inch to the side of where the axe thinks it should be. Using these weapons WILL have you taking unnecessary hits. Projectile hitboxes are also an issue, with staff bolts impacting the guy next to your target, or the auto-target clinging to a mook because it happens to be a foot closer to you than your target.\n\nThen there's the platforming. It's weird, sticky, and slide-y. Relatively flat levels won't have the issue, or at least it won't be that noticeable. But, considering that the game is pretty much all community levels - and I won't be speaking to their quality here, it's not the place - there are going to be platforming challenges, even if the level description doesn't advertise it.\nTip: ANGLE THE CAMERA.\nMake the jump straight forward. If you don't, there's a good chance you'll just 'walk' on the edge for a bit before the game gets bored and bounces you off into the abyss. Simple things like stairs can either be a little flavor added to a level or a fragmented turd unceremoniously pinched off from the ♥♥♥♥ of the Antichrist. You will - WILL, it's a guarantee - see your character fling themselves off into empty air because you turned around on a cliffside and got too close, or be attracted Nathan Drake-style to a climbable ledge precisely when you don't want to be.\n\nIf Three Sprockets fixes the above - come on, guys, combat and movement are only TWO-THIRDS OF THE GAME - then I can fully recommend Fight The Dragon. As it stands now, only get it if you can handle the game not doing what you tell it to.","May 31, 2015","true","113.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It also has an adventure creator so you can make your own adventures and/or campaigns! It really is worth more than the price listed to be honest.

The main goal seems to involve level grinding up to attain better loot to fight the dragon, to get more loot so you can level grind more and eventually beat the dragon.\n\nThis game has been quite a bit of fun to play so far however it becomes pretty repetitive pretty fast. I've put together a bit of list based on what i've seen so far and then catagorized them into a pros and cons sort of list.\n\nPROS\nNice, sleek, cute graphics\nworks great with a controller (in fact i think i'd recommend a controller for this game)\nTons of loot\nA lot of levels to play through (i'm talking about over 9000 levels, though most seem to be beat-able within 5-10 minutes; which is a good or bad thing depending on your point of view)\nsome nice puzzles and level design (depends entirely on the content creator)\ncontent seems to entirely come from the community, which is rather nice\nCONS\nso far death has only come to me through sheer overwhelming numbers or falling off the map\nthe combat system is very repetative, you have your normal attack, strong attack, dodge and about 4 magic spells (3 of which are unlocked through level progression), there is a bit of variety though with 4 classes to choose from but they all have what is mentioned above in terms of combat\nenemies are pretty much all the same and act the same except for a few speciality monsters (they just tend to run after you or if they're ranged they'll shoot at you however they always miss if youre moving around)\nthere's not much to say in terms of combat tactics other than just kiting to stun and then using magic, you also have health and mana potions, but there's no in-depth, immersive combat to speak of.\nlevel progression seems rather slow\noverall combat is lack luster, it's enjoyable at first but because of its rather simple combat mechanics gets old rather quickly.\n\nConclusion\n\nFight the dragon offers a neat little hack n' slash supported entirely by a community, it offers a ton of loot and levels to play through. The game suffers from shallow repetitive combat that brings the overall experience down to knee deep level grinding while hunting for better loot to slay the dragon.\n\noverall i would only recommend this game if it's on sale due to it being rather repetitive in nature because of it's combat mechanics.","December 27, 2014","true","3.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

They just gave it up and we players who paid for the game… you know. But anyway, in this case the game feels extremely the opposite, the creators look extremely friendly and attentive to the community, I always seens SeonR on the forums answering the guys and giving help to them. They do updates every week, not great ones but they’re always improving the game. I also added him and he just accepted and I was just like: lol? Seriously?\nYeah! They are “the guys”, if you still not believing me, go in the forums and check for yourself!\n----------------------------------------Technical points---------------------------------------\nOverview in topics:\n- Physics looks perfect and really well done. (10/10)\n- Graphics. (10/10)\n- Key bindings. (8/10)\n- Fun. (Over 8000+ haha)\n- Overall gameplay. (9.5/10)\n- ACK Maps editor .(9.5/10)*\nThey will need some time to do more props and\noptions to make your own dungeon/adventure/campaign\nand of course do some opmitization in the commands. But there's\nnothing to reclaim about, it works fine and fulfills the purpose letting you\nto create great and epic campaigns/adventures.\n- Music (3/10)\nThis is the only thing i've to reclaim about, there are no much options of music and it turns sickening over the time, but as it was released few days ago and as I've seen, the game creators are VERY, seriously VERY COMPETENT and active in the forums solving troubles, doubts and any other kind of issues. So all you need to do in this case is give them time, that's all they need.","December 22, 2014","true","84.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

A++\n\n\nI don't do reviews, but I feel a bit compelled to do one here because this game really could use more press. This is probably one of the best independent developments I've played, with (as far as I know) an almost entirely novel premise, given that  nearly all the content of the game will be community generated.\n\nIt's already very fun in its current state. The mechanics are simple, very easy to pick up if you've played any recent isometric action RPGs. The controls are reasonably intuitive, and suit controller based play particularly well (although keyboard and mouse is perfectly viable). Combat is reasonably challenging and satisfying, with slightly more dependence on reflexes than other similar games. There are only a few fundamental puzzle mechanics at the moment- switch operation, pressure pads, key hunts and (interestingly) an autojump mechanic that is based on terrain height. That last mechanic, while seemingly restrictive, actually leads to some interesting puzzle design, and I've already seen it used quite well in some of the player made content.\n\nThere's the odd bug or ten still, balance is a bit whacky, and some of the content that does need to be developer created (such as classes and items) is a little sparse at the moment, but this is both a great indie development and a very good quality early access in my opinion.","November 8, 2014","true","3.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDek/recommended/250560/","TekDek","Tek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDek/","360 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe selling point to Fight the Dragon seems to be that it's the Little Big Planet of Hack n' Slash games. Sadly, if anyone really believes that statement, then they clearly don't understand what LBP is.\n\nThe game itself is very bare bones and is very far away from having the complexity of LittleBigPlanet 1, let alone 2. Yes, it's currently in Early Access, but I am not seeing any promises of seeing any real depth being added to the game by the time it reaches 1.0.\n\nThe gameplay is shallow at best. Sure, you have 4 classes and several abilities to boot, with both melee and ranged combat, but it's still just the bare minimum of what can be considered gameplay. After the first 5 levels played you WILL have seen 90% of the replay value this game could possibly offer. Hit enemies. Back off a bit to counter their grouping up on you. Hit them some more. Repeat forever. Activate an AoE skill once in a while not out of necessity but just for the sake of changing things up.\n\nSo that's the gameplay aspect. But what about the user-created-content? Well, it suffers from two things in particular:\n1) The shallow, repetitive gameplay directly affects custom content. Simply put, there's only so little you can do with the creation tools that will make your time worthwhile, and those are mainly cosmetic things like the visual design of your map or the story/dialogue paired with it.\n\n2)There's very few Logic-systems in the game to work with, and this is what separates this game from the likes of LBP. You are handed the tools to make a top-down hack n' slash dungeon and nothing else. You are creating maps for one very specific game. In LBP, you have the ability to create interesting platforming maps, combat, cutscenes and puzzles limitied almost entirely by your own imagination. You can make a map with a working Chess game complete with a functional AI who can Check-Mate you. Fight the Dragon doesn't even remotely come close to having that level of depth.\n\nNow a game isn't bad just because it's not LBP. I simply bring that up because it seems to be somewhat of a slogan for this game, and it's wrong. This game gets a thumbs down because it's shallow. Gameplay becomes boring in a matter of a couple hours and if you're a fan of user-generated-content, you've probably played/used numerous other software that puts this game's Editor to shame already.\n\nFor now, this is being uninstalled for me, but I'll follow the developer to see if they have anything substantial up their sleeves. The only possible way I can recommend this game for now, is if you intend your young child or sibling to play it, as they will likely have the attention span required to have real fun with this game, due to simply not having experienced anything better.","September 28, 2014","false","2.2"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","6"

As it is at the moment, however, I can't recommend it. There are a lot of short mini levels available to play, made by the community as well, and the level editor is definitely fun to play around with - when it saves. The main problem I find is the difficulty. It's ridiculous. You can go along quite nicely beating up this that and the other, then you come across something else and it kills you over and over until you lose the level. The difficulty spike between the "normal" mobs and these is huge. When this issue is addressed, still in early access or not, I could easily recommend this to waste away the hours.","September 29, 2014","false","7.1"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

Turns out it wasn't. Just like promised, Diablo and LBP combined. It has the classic Hack & Slash feeling in it, yet making it fun to play as there's so many player-made maps, and most of them are fun to play.\n\nEvery class has it's own unique skills and abilities. They are quite balanced, except for the Fighter. The game is heavily based on ranged combat (i'm not saying that CQB would suck or anything) mainly because when you have to fight even a little bit bigger groups they do alot of damage to you if you try to melee them. CQB works quite well against single enemies, but ranged weaponry is more effective against groups and bosses.\n\nOverall, i'd say this game is awesome and fun to play :)","April 11, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll explain.\n\nI can't really judge this as a game, as much as I have to judge it as a toolbox. And, as with any game where you hand the keys to the kingdom to the playerbase, only about 1 in 12 actually knows what they're doing. :(\n\nIn Fight the Dragon you're given a battle arena against a red dragon with 1 MILLION health, and told to go questing from map to map to build yourself up and fight him. Any damage the dragon takes is cumulative, so even the 2 points of damage you do to him at lvl1 will stay.\n\nSo, you leap from player-made map to player-made map, fighting monsters and finding loot. As I said, most folks should not be given the tools to make game levels, as they don't know what is appealing, what flows well or even what looks good. I found myself with serious respect for the real industry after playing 50+ maps (there's an achievement for that), and only really liking about 8 of them.\n\nBut back to the dragon. Each time you finish a level you get a dragon ticket/scroll, which gives you three lives to fight the dragon in the special arena. As I said your damage sticks, so you run in and do as much damage as you can before he freaking annihilates you. Most battles last about 30 seconds, even with three lives. So you chip away at him over time as you level up Just remember:\n\n-Fire Resist does NOT work on the Dragon\n-You CANNOT bring your magic rings, arguably the best items in the game.\n-Almost all the dragon's attacks have major push-back, so good luck if you're a melee character\n\n\nThe dragon fight is VERY unfair, and if that is the focus of your time in this game you're going to have a bad time. Instead, I spent my questing hours in search of a good map that felt like a real video game level, and not just something a 9 year-old threw together to mess with people. Not all levels are created equal, and it comes with a thumbs up/sideways/down function, and the ability to leave a comment on the level itself. I blasted a LOT of bad levels, trust me, and praised a few good ones.\n\nFight the Dragon is a cute rpg toolbox, but if you judge by the player-made content, not an especially good game. Get it on sale for a quick distraction, but this is not something to devote to.\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR Version:\n\n-Dragon has 1 Million HP, you chip away at his health over many attempts.\n-Dragon fight does not respect fire resistance, magic rings, and allows you no health/mana items.\n-Dragon can kill you three times in under 40 seconds, burning your Dragon Fight attempt currency.\n-All the levels outside the tutorial are player-made, most of them are really bad.\n-Cute, addictive, but not something you're ever going to finish. Only the INSANE will grind away the hours to ACTUALLY slay the dragon.","February 17","true","45.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The major RPG character archetypes aren't yet introduced as you only have the sword-and-board warrior and a fire mage, with a frost mage currently in development. The dungeon creation is incredibly simple yet powerful, allowing you to create nearly any environment and setup the details such as enemy patrol routes or which combinations of levers open a door.\n\nThere are a couple dungeons created by 3 Sprockets, but they're mostly tutorial levels. The gimmick here is the user-created content. Dungeons created can be published and thrown into the pool of user-generated content, randomly chosen for an adventurer. There's filters you can set to get the newest dungeons or the highest-rated dungeons, and you can even set up a list of favorites.\n\nIf you're afraid you'll "out-level" a dungeon, don't be. Difficulty and rewards scale with your character so you'll always get enjoyment out of your favorite dungeons. Now, you might say "Hey, if everything levels with me then how do I tell I'm really strong?" Cue the dragon.\n\nThe dragon is a premade dungeon (bascially a door and a platform surrounded by lava) for you to head into from your house very early on. The dragon's health is absolutely insane - the chances of defeating him in one go are nearly impossible. It'll likely takes hundreds of attempts across all of your characters. The dragon's health never resets, so eventually you can defeat him, and as you try to your progress is logged. You're ranked against the world and ranked against your previous attempts, so you can see just how far you've come.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone interested in a dungeon-crawler. Diablo, Gauntlet, Torchlight - you name it, this game ranks right up there with them, even in it's alpha state.","March 28, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I didn't think I would like it as much as I do.  I became addicted right away.  With almost all the levels being user created there is a ton of creative adventures to go on.  As more people find out about the game, more adventures will be made and there will be a seemingly limitless amount of adventures to explore.\n\nCreating adventures is quite simple and intuitive.  I made my first level (Rendlehelm Forest) within a few hours and it has some pretty cool features and looks pretty good.  The Steam Workshop items add a lot of options to the character customization, and I expect the options will get even better as more people make more complex pieces.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun.  Old-school hack & slash with light RPG elements mixed in.  It is so simple yet so fun that I can play this with my young son, and my wife enjoys it too!  It's complex enough though, that I could easily play this with my gamer friends for hours and have a blast.\n\nThe dragon is a lot of fun to fight too.  At first it seemed hopeless because the dragon is so powerful and you do so little damage.  However, as you level up and get more powerful you see the health finally start coming off in larger chuncks and you really feel like you are accomplishing something.  It's also really cool that it starts at 1,000,000 hitpoints and the damage done to it persists.  Talk about epic battle!  I'll be fighting this dragon for months.\n\nI highly recommend this game!

The restloot isn't useless at all, you can put that into a lootshrine and transform multiple scrap parts into a much better weapon or an armor.\n\nAnd if you've got what you want or feel like you're pretty experienced now, you can start creating your own maps. You can do a whole campaign with up to 5 Levels or just create a single adventure. You can do alot of cool stuff with this editor and it isn't that hard to use, even if it looks like.

When you attack someone there's a good chance you'll hit them if you're so close to them you're clipping inside, but other than that you can seriously end up missing for stupid reaesons that can result in you dying very quickly.\n\nEven when fighting skeletons in the tutorial, I found several times that I'd take swings at them and watch my blade go through them with no damage done, but they do the same in return and actually manage to connect to me. There's also been times where I'd attack and it'd hit, starting off a combo. But wait! The enemy was nudged back a bit, so I miss the rest of my combo by a hair, letting me take more damage.\n\nThe real struggle is with elevated platforms and ranged enemies. Did you know I honestly thought wraiths couldn't be hurt by basic attacks at first? Cause I'd get within breathing range and swing and they'd fly right through me without it connecting, but only after a few more attempts did I Realize they can in fact be hit. This was mostly because most of the time they were hovering above me just enough to have it not count.\n\nWhich brings me to elevation. A platform that's short enough to the point where you can walk up onto it without a climb should not prevent me from attacking an enemy that my sword is going right through their ankles! And when you are on a map with ranged way above where the player cant reach? You can ♥♥♥♥ right off. Especially with custom maps that like using these types of enemies.\n\nThat said, all the maps in the game are - aside from the provded - custom. This is the main key, and this naturally leads to some really unbalanced situations with custom maps, but dev maps are pretty reasonable for the most part.\n\nSuggestions\n- Make hitboxes a bit more reasonable. You can size it out even half an inch or more and it'd be an improvement\n- Lower health on ranged enemies. It's bad enough they sprint away from you at twice your speed\n- FIX BLOCKING. Seriously, that thing is bipolar. Even at maximum health, it struggles to do jack ♥♥♥♥ half the time. Sometimes it feels like you need to block, and sometimes it feels like that axe needs to go past it into your face.\n","April 18","false","1.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

There is plenty to work with in the map maker to eat up hours of your time and enough variety that you'll want to make every concievable type of map your head can come up with.\n\nI like the simplicity of it but it can get a little awkward at times when camera angles start to get in the way because of construction work and the lack of a multi level building mechanic at this time is a shame. However the map maker is a solid builder and even I found it easy to use.\n\ngameplay is just as simple and enjoyable but camera rotation can get a little annoying when you're in a big brawl and unless you spend a little time observing the game it can be a little difficult to understand the leveling mechanics. Honestly I still havent fully found everything on this yet but thats my own fault for jumping straight into the builder.\n\nso as a rundown.\n\nPRO's: simple, looks good, easy to control, vast possibilities for inventive maps, replayability due to community contributions.\n\nCON's: awkward camera movements, confusing insight on character mechanics (leveling, ability use, potion use).\n\nI've had this game a few days at the writing of this so I have yet to fully see everything it has to offer but this is what I have observed so far.","September 27, 2014","true","45.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is entirely built around player made levels and designed to be played in short bursts, with each level lasting 15 minutes on average. The four available classes are differentiated by each having 4 abilities (in addition to basic attacking), as well as some unique weapon types that are only useable by certain classes.\n\nThe lack of combat depth may turn some people off but it comes down to personal preference. The adventure creator is easy to use and offers a lot of freedom, with more content being added on a regular basis. At the time of this writing, they've even begun adding a logic system to the creator as well. The game is great for picking up and running through some adventures in your down time where as making levels can keep you busy for hours on end.\n\nFTD isn't perfect and has it's issues. The entire game's entertainment value relies on the quality of maps and the variety of tools available to those who make the maps. That being said, the devs are very attentive and really seem to care about making the game better and better. They listen to community feedback and continue to polish and add to the game, pushing out great patches on a quite regular basis. Overall I don't see much to complain about. The game is a fun little gem to spend time in and has the potential for a lot of replayability.

It's a fun idea, the level creator is INCREDIBLY easy to use, and game play is pretty fun.  I like the concept of the Dragon itself!   The only thing holding this title back right now is a lack of content.  Most of the building materials are simple palette swaps of each other, or slightly different brick types.  There are seriously only like 15-20 different enemies in the whole game, and a handful of weapon/armor models.  The core of the game is there.   The devs either need to start cranking out CONTENT.  Monsters, dungeon types, objects, set pieces, etc.   That's when the game will really start to shine.  Or?  Open up the creator to let people create and share their own objects like people who mod The Sims!\n\nAlso, combat.  PLEASE put more work into combat?  Combat is literally hit-for-hit, without any kind of elements, resistances, or any sort of strategy or depth at all.\n\nI recommend this game because it shows promise.  It's definitely not done yet, and in its current state it's playable but pretty disappointing.

They are straightforward on what the game is and what they intend to do. They listen and respond to the community and have implemented things that have been suggested. They just have a generally nice vibe about them that is enjoyable.\nThe game itself is lite RPG: the stats won't blow your mind and the gear slowly scales as you level. There are 4 skills per class and 4 classes also a level cap of 40 at this moment. Online/lan/splitscreen local multiplayer arleady in the game and supports the use of controllers. The Hack and Slash elements are well implemented for an Alpha build and is in a very playable state. There are still some bugs to be ironed out and features to be added in but saying that the game still is a ton of fun.\nThe best feature I would have to say is the ACK (adventure creation kit). I have spent at least 1/2 my time playing this game in ACK making adventures. There are still a lot of features to be added like more monsters and more triggers (atm it is only implemented for weather effects) but you can still make some decent adventures given enough time and effort.\nThis game seems like it's flying under the radar but I highly enjoy the game and highly recomend it.

Some people have really interesting ideas for their maps so this game never gets boring.\n\nIf you expect a storyline in this game, you won't find any because this is not about long-spanning adventures but more about dungeon-runs that do not take that much time. So, if you have a busy life, it's easy to fit in a FtD session inbetween your busy schedule.\n\nThe level editor is also very nice and intuitive. It's really not surprising that the number of maps for this game has exploded.\n\nSo, who should buy this game? You should buy this if you like\n-Hash and Slash games (like Diablo)\n-Looting and equipment management.\n-Building your own maps/dungeons and share them\n-Multiplayer gaming with your friends\n-fighting hordes of monsters with weapons and spells\n-solving puzzles (in some maps)\n\n\n\nThings you might expect but that are not there:\n-Skilltrees. Each class has a fixed set of abilities that unlock at specific levels\n-A storyline. But future updates might allow map creaters to link maps to create more epic adventures\n-Item trading (but you can drop items ingame for your friends)\n-Always a dark atmosphere like in Diablo. Some maps are dark and menacing, but sometimes the overall visual style is a bit too non-threatening. While the graphics are not as spiffy as in Diablo, I think 3sprockets has done a good job with the visuals.\n\nA note for Linux users: There is a thread in the game's forum about systems that are capable of running the game. I'm playing this game just fine with Intel graphics. So check out the thread to see if someone with a similar computer managed to run the game.","July 26, 2014","true","28.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very smooth gameplay, I would say a mix of Zelda and Diablo. Have not tried out the creation kit yet, but licking my chops to get into it.

They are straightforward on what the game is and what they intend to do. They listen and respond to the community and have implemented things that have been suggested. They just have a generally nice vibe about them that is enjoyable.\nThe game itself is lite RPG: the stats won't blow your mind and the gear slowly scales as you level. There are 4 skills per class and 4 classes also a level cap of 40 at this moment. Online/lan/splitscreen local multiplayer arleady in the game and supports the use of controllers. The Hack and Slash elements are well implemented for an Alpha build and is in a very playable state. There are still some bugs to be ironed out and features to be added in but saying that the game still is a ton of fun.\nThe best feature I would have to say is the ACK (adventure creation kit). I have spent at least 1/2 my time playing this game in ACK making adventures. There are still a lot of features to be added like more monsters and more triggers (atm it is only implemented for weather effects) but you can still make some decent adventures given enough time and effort.\nThis game seems like it's flying under the radar but I highly enjoy the game and highly recomend it.

The community is quite active (considering it is early access!).\nPlay it with your friends to maximize the fun and gaming experience.\nBy having the possibilty to create your own adventures and share them with the public you get the feeling of being a small part of the game itself. And of course you can also play your or your friends maps together.\nThere are a few maps, generated by the programmers to help new players but you will most of the time enjoy maps created by other players.\n\nSo if you like bashing through almost random levels and exploring dungeons created by users or generating your own adventures and levels you should give "Fight The Dragon" a try.\n\nIf you expect a story-based rpg where you don't have (or be able) to enjoy your own interpretation of a story or a realistic adventure you should not buy this game.\nThe story, as I said, is created by the user and you will see by the looks of the pictures that for instance the fighting system is not comparable to the one of for example dark souls.","June 20, 2014","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is plenty to work with in the map maker to eat up hours of your time and enough variety that you'll want to make every concievable type of map your head can come up with.\n\nI like the simplicity of it but it can get a little awkward at times when camera angles start to get in the way because of construction work and the lack of a multi level building mechanic at this time is a shame. However the map maker is a solid builder and even I found it easy to use.\n\ngameplay is just as simple and enjoyable but camera rotation can get a little annoying when you're in a big brawl and unless you spend a little time observing the game it can be a little difficult to understand the leveling mechanics. Honestly I still havent fully found everything on this yet but thats my own fault for jumping straight into the builder.\n\nso as a rundown.\n\nPRO's: simple, looks good, easy to control, vast possibilities for inventive maps, replayability due to community contributions.\n\nCON's: awkward camera movements, confusing insight on character mechanics (leveling, ability use, potion use).\n\nI've had this game a few days at the writing of this so I have yet to fully see everything it has to offer but this is what I have observed so far.","September 27, 2014","true","45.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a fun idea, the level creator is INCREDIBLY easy to use, and game play is pretty fun.  I like the concept of the Dragon itself!   The only thing holding this title back right now is a lack of content.  Most of the building materials are simple palette swaps of each other, or slightly different brick types.  There are seriously only like 15-20 different enemies in the whole game, and a handful of weapon/armor models.  The core of the game is there.   The devs either need to start cranking out CONTENT.  Monsters, dungeon types, objects, set pieces, etc.   That's when the game will really start to shine.  Or?  Open up the creator to let people create and share their own objects like people who mod The Sims!\n\nAlso, combat.  PLEASE put more work into combat?  Combat is literally hit-for-hit, without any kind of elements, resistances, or any sort of strategy or depth at all.\n\nI recommend this game because it shows promise.

Choose a class (amongst the four classes), name the character, voila you're ready to start. I like the unique concept of the gold shrine. You can either donate equipments to the loot shrine (essentially selling them) and getting gold in return. As your gold amont increases, the rank of loot increases giving you superior ranked (not necessarily great depending on what you are building your character towards), stat point, health (don't underestimate this, it's an extremely important perk like in any RPG game), bag slot, and so on. Not to mention if you always wanted to create your own custom map for games, this game provides that very feature. I have been having a blast at the start but the gameplay gets pretty dull after for awhile because the game starts heading towards the usual grinding and farming for gold coins to sell and donate respectively to the loot shrine and get equipments and perks from it.\n\nWhat would be nice to see in future updates are new features such as more specialised classes (like monk, ranger/archer/battle mage, etc) more variety of weapon classes (like bows, knuckles/dusters, fighting staff, etc), more unique features like the ones implemented (loot shrine custom maps, and etc), and if possible a skill tree for all characters so that we can choose what skills we would want therefore allowing us to create a style suited to individuals instead of the fixed 4 skills.","January 24, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is centered around custom-content. Things like custom heads, hair, and levels. The customization only goes so deep, though. This leaves custom levels feeling shallow.\n\nThe game has a large identity issue. There are several poorly explained and poorly used mechanics that are only there to make the game feel more like other games. For instance, some weapons require you to have a certain level to equip. This is fine and good, and it fits the gameplay very well. The game complicates this by adding skill-points that you unlock everytime you level up. This would be fine if it gave you more than 1 skill point per level, but instead your left with a restricted and overly complicated leveling system. It ruins the flow when you pick up an awesome weapon, only to find that you don't have high enough Luck or Strength to wield it.\n\nCombat is your traditional "Click-Click-Click-Heal-Click" style of combat. It has the illusion of deepness, giving each class unique heavy attacks. These heavy attacks all boil down to about the same thing. You throw something, and in a second or two it explodes. Not a very original combat system, but it works well.\n\nCustomization is a mixed bag. You can customize the textures of your body, head, and hair. Basic stuff, not very hard to grasp at all. For more advanced people, you can customize the meshes of only the head and hair. This frustrates me a bit, but it doesn't really affect my view on the game.\n\nThe level editor is frustrating as hell. The controls require you to forget everything you know about good level editors, because none of it transfers over. Basic stuff is just omitted for no reason.\n\nOverall, the game is fun. As of writing, I've put in about 4 hours into the game. 3 of which were spent on multiplayer. It's a little boring, but if you get it on sale it isn't bad.","December 27, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is initially somewhat difficult due to a lack of ranged weapon availability. Once you pick one up though things become much easier. It's WASD controls with keys assigned to weapon swap, dodge and block. You have a special meter that allows you to use skills you unlock at 1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th. Each class has specific weapons it can use along with 4 skills. There are generic weapons / armor etc. that all classes can use as well. There are four classes from which to choose with a variety of loot to collect and equip. You earn dragon scrolls by playing new adventures that you can use to 'Fight the Dragon'. This beast starts with 1 million HP and you can use multiple dragon scrolls to whittle down his health. You will die multiple times but are rewarded based on the amount of damage you can do before biting the dust. The dragon's HP is persistent so next time you'll whittle it away even more...The adventure creation kit is fun and easy to use and is the real draw of this - creating, sharing and downloading adventures. There is an excellent feedback system so you can see how many folks have played your adventures, the ratings they provided and any feedback / comments they have to help you improve. Online multiplayer co-op is available as well though I have not tried it.\n\nTL;DR : Enjoyable loot-based ARPG. Easy to use adventure creation kit that you can share with friends to play co-op. Persistent dragon HP mechanic is interesting as you do all you can over the course of your adventures to take it down.","December 30, 2014","true","44.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the $12 standard price I think it's a decent game that you'll enjoy if you like this genre and you have a couple friends to play it with.","April 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is initially somewhat difficult due to a lack of ranged weapon availability. Once you pick one up though things become much easier. It's WASD controls with keys assigned to weapon swap, dodge and block. You have a special meter that allows you to use skills you unlock at 1st, 5th, 10th, and 15th. Each class has specific weapons it can use along with 4 skills. There are generic weapons / armor etc. that all classes can use as well. There are four classes from which to choose with a variety of loot to collect and equip. You earn dragon scrolls by playing new adventures that you can use to 'Fight the Dragon'. This beast starts with 1 million HP and you can use multiple dragon scrolls to whittle down his health. You will die multiple times but are rewarded based on the amount of damage you can do before biting the dust. The dragon's HP is persistent so next time you'll whittle it away even more...The adventure creation kit is fun and easy to use and is the real draw of this - creating, sharing and downloading adventures. There is an excellent feedback system so you can see how many folks have played your adventures, the ratings they provided and any feedback / comments they have to help you improve. Online multiplayer co-op is available as well though I have not tried it.\n\nTL;DR : Enjoyable loot-based ARPG. Easy to use adventure creation kit that you can share with friends to play co-op. Persistent dragon HP mechanic is interesting as you do all you can over the course of your adventures to take it down.","December 30, 2014","true","44.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love the nuanced fighting style with dodges, blocks , and stuns (making fighting more than just pumping out spells or spamming the attack button).

I've just put out an easy called "kill Jill", where Jack was pushed down the hill by Jill after the poisoned water in the well turned her into an evil creature.  And I have a medium one called "Ruin Runner" where you've been sent to rescue a woman from a bunch of criminals, and end up getting caught up in a treasure hunt in an old abandoned ruin.  And right now I'm working on one (don't have a title for it yet just search for creater named Dyztanz) where a town is overrun with evil when a hell gate opens up in a nearby mine.

You have alot of freedom and the combat is pretty deep and challenging.\n\nA little problem though is the lack of challenging content. After reaching max level and beating the dragon I've not been able to find alot of challenge among user created maps.

Completing maps earns you tickets to "Fight The Dragon".\n\nThe maps usually involve a lot of clicking and running, as well as puzzles revolving largely around pressure pads and levers hidden within maze-like environments. Fighting the dragon is simply an arena against a boss.\n\nThis is reasonably fun for a short period of time, but it has little longevity.\n\nThe best part of the game is the creator, where you can design and build your own maps and campaigns. Despite the limiting graphics, there is actually a lot of freedom to build from the ground up, create relatively complex puzzles and interesting environments. Unfortunately, as always with these games, the maps you produce tend to get lost amongst a lot of crap, or go unnoticed beside those few early maps that received "thumbs ups" so show up in most people's searches.\n\nI give this a tentative recommendation.

The game is entirely built around player made levels and designed to be played in short bursts, with each level lasting 15 minutes on average. The four available classes are differentiated by each having 4 abilities (in addition to basic attacking), as well as some unique weapon types that are only useable by certain classes.\n\nThe lack of combat depth may turn some people off but it comes down to personal preference. The adventure creator is easy to use and offers a lot of freedom, with more content being added on a regular basis. At the time of this writing, they've even begun adding a logic system to the creator as well. The game is great for picking up and running through some adventures in your down time where as making levels can keep you busy for hours on end.\n\nFTD isn't perfect and has it's issues. The entire game's entertainment value relies on the quality of maps and the variety of tools available to those who make the maps. That being said, the devs are very attentive and really seem to care about making the game better and better. They listen to community feedback and continue to polish and add to the game, pushing out great patches on a quite regular basis. Overall I don't see much to complain about. The game is a fun little gem to spend time in and has the potential for a lot of replayability.

A few questions later and I bought the game. Now 4 hours into the game I am proud to say that I bought this game. It is fun, unique and "never ending" but I'll get to that later.\nYou create your character from one of the 4 classes. You can customize their skin and even customize it with some cool skins made with the steam workshop. After you do that they drop you into the hub where you will spend a lot of time "praying" to the gift gods and managing your inventory. From here you may go to online mode (multiplayer), go on an adventure or battle the dragon which requires a dragon scroll. Once I beat the developer made levels it started to put me into community made levels which made me nervous but it turns out that the devs don't like garbage levels polluting their game. Which is good. At this point I realised that this game is "never ending" because you can create your own adventures or play other adventures after you played the developer ones.\nThe level creation tool deserves more credit than it gets as you can do a lot with the triggers and events. Sadly I have not tried to play this with multiplayer so I cannot give a review on that.\nPros:\nLots of good unique levels\nLevel editor\nCharacter customization\nNice graphical feel\nCons:\nI can see how some people can find this game repetative.\n\nGames this is similar to:\nSpiral Knights and (barely) Little Big Planet.

Completing maps earns you tickets to "Fight The Dragon".\n\nThe maps usually involve a lot of clicking and running, as well as puzzles revolving largely around pressure pads and levers hidden within maze-like environments. Fighting the dragon is simply an arena against a boss.\n\nThis is reasonably fun for a short period of time, but it has little longevity.\n\nThe best part of the game is the creator, where you can design and build your own maps and campaigns. Despite the limiting graphics, there is actually a lot of freedom to build from the ground up, create relatively complex puzzles and interesting environments. Unfortunately, as always with these games, the maps you produce tend to get lost amongst a lot of crap, or go unnoticed beside those few early maps that received "thumbs ups" so show up in most people's searches.\n\nI give this a tentative recommendation. It is fun but has little longevity.","February 18","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have alot of freedom and the combat is pretty deep and challenging.\n\nA little problem though is the lack of challenging content. After reaching max level and beating the dragon I've not been able to find alot of challenge among user created maps. But I'm trying to do something this by creating my own end game maps, hope other players will follow.\n\nControls with keyboard and mouse is not the best in my opinion, but gamepad works great.\n\nCommunity is small and friendly.\n\nGive it a try!","February 18","true","457.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Online and local co-op, as well as fully customisable characters and a plethora of user-generated content. You'll basically never run out of stuff to do. Playing Fight the Dragon with 4 friends is honestly a treat, and the map creator is fun and extensive.\n\nReally my only gripe with the game is that as of the last time I checked you can't fight the eponymous dragon with friends, as it seems to be a strictly single-player experience.

Most of the time when I die, a litterally fly backwards until I hit a wall. Somtimes I even fall into oblivion. The enemy AI is just as bas as the bugs. There was this one time where an enemy kept on walking into a wall and never stopped even when I was behind him. So I just kept backstabbing him until he died.

It's a game with core mechanics so simple you can understand them within minutes. It's you and some friends wading through a challenging adventure which likely none of you have seen before.\n\nIf I wanted a deep fantasy RPG with strong characters and a thick plot, I'd go and play Dragon Age. What we have here is something very different – a game that you can pick up and play without all of that traditional RPG baggage. Grab a few friends, hit 'random level', and give it a go.

I trader just offered this game, I never heard of it, so I looked at some lets plays and I accepted the trade. I was gonna keep it for profit but I really wanted to play it, so I added it to my library, and I'm glad I did.\n\nGo trough hundreds of user generated levels, get some dragon scrolls and once you think you are ready, then you can fight the dragon, hence the name.\n\nDon't Worry, you don't need to kill the dragon, I don't know if you need to last long enough or do as much damage before you die, but whatever it is. You get good reward that can only be obtained from fighting the dragon. I'm sure you get the best rewards by killing the dragon, but I'm only level 6. That will take HOURS before I can kill it.\n\nThe user generated levels are great. There are 2 categories. Adventure and Campaign. Campaign is just like adventure but with more indepth story and multiple levels.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say right now is the multiplayer.. If you could call it that.  There are barely anyone online (about 0-4, in a good day), and most of the people online are level 60+ and as beginner, that will completely remove the challenge and fun from the game. Luckily, when hosting your game, you can put a minimum and a maximum levels that can join you, but no one would join because there are almost no people online.

The level editor is simple and easy to use, with the ability to build story into them with NPCs and whatnot giving the game ridiculous longevity.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, though. The UI takes a little bit of getting used to, and the combat is pretty lacklustre.

This game is REALLY difficult so dont ever get used to winning. There's also a level editor that's pretty cool, even though it's advanced. I haven't tried out the multiplayer yet so I can't say anything about that except that it sounds awesome. But although amazing, buggy. Very, very buggy. Most of the time when I die, a litterally fly backwards until I hit a wall. Somtimes I even fall into oblivion. The enemy AI is just as bas as the bugs. There was this one time where an enemy kept on walking into a wall and never stopped even when I was behind him. So I just kept backstabbing him until he died.

FUN to play both in SOLO mode and Multiplayer mode.\nThe game looks promising, has a few glitches but I am literally still suprised as many other early access games have many glitches and options ingame are limited.\nThe main idea is go on adventures to gain dragon scrolls, loot and xp to get enough power to defeat THE DRAGON SOLO.\nFight The Dragon is still in early access but still manages to impress me in many ways. Firstly, the game has a variety of skills and classes such as a firelord, fighter. It also has a variety of weapons, armour and special skills that requires you to be in a specific class BUT NOT TO WORRY SINCE YOU CAN CREATE MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER. The leveling up mechanics is impressive and it makes sure that gaining XP isn't easy nor hard. The system it uses to go on adventures(or dungeons) is all based on other player's creation. EVEN YOU CAN MAKE A MAP and have it featured.\nThe cons are the few glitches and the servers are generally mediocre and you cannot host locally YET.\nTHE GAME GETS MANY PATCHES( 0~90 Mb) and everytime there's an update, I get more impressed. More features are still being developed, so expect the game to get more interesting and fun.\n\nIMO, it is worth the money and future looks promising :-)","July 5, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

FUN to play both in SOLO mode and Multiplayer mode.\nThe game looks promising, has a few glitches but I am literally still suprised as many other early access games have many glitches and options ingame are limited.\nThe main idea is go on adventures to gain dragon scrolls, loot and xp to get enough power to defeat THE DRAGON SOLO.\nFight The Dragon is still in early access but still manages to impress me in many ways. Firstly, the game has a variety of skills and classes such as a firelord, fighter. It also has a variety of weapons, armour and special skills that requires you to be in a specific class BUT NOT TO WORRY SINCE YOU CAN CREATE MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER. The leveling up mechanics is impressive and it makes sure that gaining XP isn't easy nor hard. The system it uses to go on adventures(or dungeons) is all based on other player's creation. EVEN YOU CAN MAKE A MAP and have it featured.\nThe cons are the few glitches and the servers are generally mediocre and you cannot host locally YET.\nTHE GAME GETS MANY PATCHES( 0~90 Mb) and everytime there's an update, I get more impressed. More features are still being developed, so expect the game to get more interesting and fun.\n\nIMO, it is worth the money and future looks promising :-)","July 5, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is so intuitive to use that anyone can be super creative with it, regardless of your techcred.\n\nAs for the game, it is a cute ARPG that may satisfy those who have always wanted to try that kind of game withouth delving into (insert your favourite ARPG here). It is pretty basic but fun for 10 min sessions.\n\nBut, really, it is the editor that makes it. It will be interesting to see how much power and flexibilty we get when the game releases, without loosing the amazing accessibility.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I will jump back in and build one of my most memorable Dark Souls moment and get fellow players to suffer through my levels, but in more blocky form.","September 27, 2014","true","2.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Fight the Dragon is made for dungeons that take less than a half hour to complete, and the terrain and dungeon-building tools are very Lego or Minecraft-esque. They're still smoothing out the combat (which takes more cues from Gauntlet than modern ARPGs), adding more tilesets and enemies, and developing more classes. But it's a thoroughly pleasant experience for an Early Access game. The dungeon-building is intuitive and well-developed, even at this stage. Updates and regular and substansial, and the developers respond to player feedback. Highly reccomended, especially if, like me, you enjoyed the park builder in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater or the dungeon builder in Neverwinter more than the actual game.","June 29, 2014","true","26.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

At its heart, it's essentially DnD, as all of the adventures you play are made by the community, which all are unique in that you have freedom over the entire layout, theme, loot locations, and even NPC dialog. Even better, you can tag along with friends and adventure together, everyone getting their own loot drops.\n\nYou can choose from 4 classes at the moment: Warrior, Fire Lord, Ice Wizard and Black Rogue. You obtain experience and levels and loot as you play through random adventures made by your fellow players and friends. The "item vendor" is actually a "Loot Shrine" that you offer unwanted items to, build up points which slowly fall into higher and higher tiers that grant you better and better items when you "pray" to the loot shrine. On top of that, it's also your loot stash (ie. cross-character).\n\nThe ACK (Adventure Construction Kit) is quite easy and effective to work with, already supporting Environment Effects, Time of Day, water/lava/mud, copy/paste (but not undo yet, sadly), with things like music, mutators and map triggers all on the way! The current set of assets isn't overwhelming, but not completely barren either. It also has fledgling "room-over-room" support in the form of some pretty basic bridges, which will hopefully be expanded as time goes on.\n\nIn summary, I'm really liking this game so far. Given the fact that the adventures are entirely community made, there's always something new to do, and more loot to find!","August 1, 2014","true","10.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has a few minor problems here and there, but nothing too major and it is shaping up to be an absolutely fantastic hack and slash RPG.\n\nWould recommend to anyone who is even remotely interested in this genre, as it does SO much right and is so much fun.

On the other hand, common enemies scale significantly creating more challenge with each new adventure. Player created content is good for the most part, the downside being some people shouldn't design levels. With the built in ACK though this games limits are broad. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games. If you don't like games, there is still a big shot you will probably enjoy some of the features of building dungeons. Seriously though, it takes maybe 2 hours of work if you get paid US federal minimum wage.

Some things are just too hot to discuss on social media.\nAnd as much as I love dungeon crawlers and space games, I have to admit they usually don't hold my interest. World of Warcraft was an exception, but after leveling five characters to 80 my heart just wasn't in it any more.\nI like to MAKE things, not just play with things other people made..no matter how cool they are. No dungeon crawling fulfills me like painting does, no space battles are as challenging as writing a good song.\nWith Fight the Dragon that may have changed..\nThis is a game that you make yourself.\nSure, there are hundreds of levels already made, but you have access to the exact same editor the developers use. Build your dungeon brick by brick. Devise devious traps, puzzles, and mazes. Populate your level with enemies ranging from fire beetles to skeleton archers, each with their own behavior and AI.\nMake pools of lava, poison, or mud. Rivers of water and bridges with trapdoors. Gates that open if you find the right key. Pressure plates that trigger walls of fire. NPCs that guide the player along their way.\nThen when you finish making your level, you can publish it. Your level will be played and voted on by other Fight the Dragon players around the world.\nIt's much more fun to make a game than to play a game, and if your kids are into games but you worry that it's not an intellectually stimulating pursuit, you might do well to buy them a copy of Fight the Dragon.\nAnd if you're like me and tend to like the idea of games more than games themselves, buy it for yourself. Spend a few hours in video-game legoland and I'll bet you'll be as excited as I am.\nWe finally have the keys to the castle!","September 30, 2014","true","25.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's a few hillarious bugs in the game that made me laugh my head off, but that's basically the best part. There are some very challenging and fun dungeons, but most of them are easy as heck, even though they shouldn't be. Why? Crossbows. You basically just need a crossbow and some decent juking strats and kiting strats if things get out of hand, because crossbows can stun enemies. They're basically unbalanced. Also, Fighting the Dragon is kinda boring. It has 4 basic moves that you can all dodge easily except for one of them, and 2 op abilities that can half shot you at level 15ish that you can dodge easily. There's also a bug that you can get while fighting the dragon, maybe in dungeons too. If you stand still and just use basic attacks, the dragon will keep attacking you until you get down to 1 hp. Then, for some reason, the game shows the dragon doing damage, but it actually doesn't and you become virtually immortal unless you use a heavy attack, special move, or you do a dodge roll.

There are different monsters and RNG loot, cool! But the game lacks in difficulty, the game is a steamroll after level 5 and gives no challenges, this is a huge issue in my eyes. Also when creating maps you are limited with height options, making mountain maps impossible, and maps are made to be linear, limitations are bad in my opinion, and mob creating is also pretty lame, you cant create cool bosses with high health and damage, and the skills for bosses are lacking because there are none.\n\nIf you want a cool game for 2-5 hours this is it, but for more its impossible.

It's not perfect though. Community made maps are hit or miss. There's a ton of great content out there, but unfortunately you'll need to wade through quite a bit of clunkers to get to them.\n\nAs a single player game, it has a limited life span since each map is pretty much the same monsters/puzzles/traps just in different orders. Once you are able to get multiplayer working for more than 5 minutes, it becomes extremely fun again. I'm not sure if the problem lies with me or the servers, but there were plenty of frustrating moments with either disconnects or just plain not being able to connect at all.

If you hate it then I think this game is not for you. I personally don't like it, but can handle it if the game is good.\nThis seems like a nice concept: Hack-n-Slash game with community content and custom dungeons and LOOTING!!!! So what we look for in this game is how fun it is to LOOT, how fun the classes and their development is and how good the combat feels. Let's see how it fares. In those 3 aspects.\n\nLooting in this game seemed quite decent. I mean you get frequent chests, you get monster drops and "higher-value" chests and also something like a "boss"-drops. The system where you can "donate" junk and gold to shrine to "pray" for random good items for various slots is also a nice gamble and adds to all of the Gearing up aspect of an Hack-n-Slash.\n\nThe combat is where the game falls flat and by a huge margin. By no means is combat any fun. The hit detection is abysmal. I feel this game has worse or more difficult combat than Dark Souls for PC and that game aims to be difficult and challenging.  Half the time you will be missing the enemy because you're not facing them, that's okay... half of the time when you are facing the enemy you still won't hit it, because your cursor is slightly off! Now even with everything angled right the hit-boxes are drunk and sway around the actual model.\n\nThe classes... You have 4 classes ( 2 mages, a warrior and a semi-warrior )... All of whom mostly swing their prefered weapon, at least at the early levels. Now I want you to pick ANY 4 heroes/champions/classes from an MOBA game and imagine having a GRINDING RPG game built around them... you have 4 abilities that hardly ever improve or feel different for all of the gear grinding and loot farming. I said 4? Yes that is if you play with each and seperate one, but mostly you'll be stuck with ONE.\n\nI might have a bit biased oppinion, but that's what this god-awful combat system got me to. I have few reviews and generally prefer to write pleasant and good ones about games I like, but for me to write a negative one, the game seriously must SUCK.\n\nI understand that the game is popular amongst some of you people, but so is Minecraft... and hell if I knew why..\n\n","September 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

What I have found is that I LIKE THIS KIND OF GAME! well this one anyway. The game is simple at face value, run around smashing stuff pick up loot, sell loot, go smash more stuff get better gear THE END.  But theres so much more, an intersting trade sytem that allows you to trade all your useless junk you found for a chance at better gear or stat points. A great dragon with a million health to try killing, and best of all, the real shining star of this game, the level editor, lots of games have level editors but I dont think any have implimented them into the game so seamlessly as this, build a level ( I can barely install windows and I managed to build one) publish it and presto there is quite litterally endless content to play that will keep leveling up from feeling like a grind. Vote levels up or down, favorite and subscribe to you favorite publishers.... great potential here. If a level is too tuff : no problem come back later and try again I LOVE the non linear approach to the "adventures". and the fact that most range from 5 to 20 minutes is nice, digestible chunks !\nAs far as being early access there are a few quirks that could be smoothed out but nothing more than minor annoyances, seems totally playable to me.\nAnyway, this was a total surprise find for me and I recommend this game !","December 7, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game is fun in co-op and has a very neat idea. Some things can be improved upon, but overall I had a fun time playing it. It can get a little repetitive, but it is up to a community to create fun maps for it, although tools provided need a little work and I would LOVE to be able to put more stuff in adventures, right now it is kinda limited.\nMy initial review was negative and posted after I spent almost 3 hours creating my own adventure and focusing on details only to find out I ran out off points without implementing even 1/3rd of what I wanted and never being able to publish it, because the albeit much needed anti-grind system is flawed in thinking I made an impossible challenge of puting too much traps and enemies in my adventure. Which bummed me out, cuz the whole idea of my adventure was about hard and challenging castle inspired by Dark Souls that can't be rushed. Fighting 2 bosses at a time, running under heavy ranged fire, carefully walking around traps. I've put a lot of effort in it, but ultimately couldn't published it and that really bummed me out because of the time spent designing.\n\nIf you're creative type and want some good time with friends in coop in a simple game, this game might be what you want.\nAlthough creating mode is limited, there are still vast variety of adventures that can be created. I really wish you can let your fantasy run free and produce massive and detailed maps with lots of enemies and challenges, so player can sweat a little. But I realise this is not exactly a game about it. It is more simple, more relaxed and easy paced hack'n'slash game with basic controls. It's more of a kids game perhaps.\nWhatever the case, I am canging my recommendation, because I feel like I've been unfair in my initial review.\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nRight now it is really boring, super simple battle system, ui and controls for creating your own adventures are HORRIBLE, I am fighting with controls more than designing, new adventures are hard to find, it's very repetative, you can't customize your map after you've put adventures by a developer without completely erasing all of it (which is so sucky, i would've created it differently if i could). You can't create really large adventure unfortunately and very limited in your resources, and anti-grind system is flawed as hell. Hey, dude, you have too much enemies, okay, I am putting more potion chests and checkpoints -- nope, too many potion chests. WTF? Just let me create what I want, not what you feel impossible to complete. Yeah, I have a room filled with rats, but thats the challenge I want to face.

The aesthetics are rather basic, but the focus is on the adventure and challenges that you’ll face when you go out to level and gear up. The ultimate goal is to go and “Fight the Dragon” (what else?). Whether you’re looking to kill the dragon or just do some damage to him he’s got plenty of health do deal with.\n\nWhen you go out to adventure, you’ll play random levels as you pick which spot you want to go to on the over-world map (or at least that’s the best way I’ve found to describe it). You can replay levels already completed, but you won’t get a Dragon Scroll for completing them. (They allow you to fight the big jerky dragon.) You’ll get levels created by the developer (3 Sprockets) and those created by other players. You do get to vote for which maps you liked after you’ve either beaten them or been defeated by them. So far I’m in the dark of how I want to vote on some of them due to the content in them. I know that certain aspects of them are good, but if I don’t appreciate them, well… ah who am I kidding, thumbs down! After all, if you don’t like it, you don’t like it. (I like the neutral thumb more.)\n\nThe best part of Fight the Dragon for me has to be, hands down, the level editor. I’m enjoying the heck out of the editor and I started by trying to recreate levels from the N64 game Goldeneye. I’ve since stopped doing that since Fight the Dragon doesn’t support multiple levels. Without having ability to create a second floor, my creation of “Not The Facility” has been halted until further progress has been made on the editor. I’m sure that’s something they may add in later. Maybe I’ll be able to make taller maps as well. As of now, you can only effectively make a tall one floor house. As for a beginning setup for crafting your own adventures, it works well enough for making dungeons and outside areas. If you’re willing to work with what you’ve got, there’s plenty of tools at your disposal to make some fun adventures for you and other players. At the very least, I would appreciate the ability to build higher even if I can’t make a second floor.\n\nThere has been a few levels that remind me of what I’m not appreciating with some games lately. There’s been a fad with making games super difficult to bring back the “nostalgia of the olden times”. Some of the levels presented include way to many traps and junk that you’ll almost need prescience to know where to go. Can’t anyone remember when you just had a fun adventure and it wasn’t horribly difficult? I remember some games being difficult, but I don’t think many of those devs went out of their way to get your goat.\n\nOn a flip-side, you have the ability to follow creators of your choice. It makes it a little easier to find an adventure you’ll probably enjoy more. However, I still recommend going on random adventures since that’s probably where the most fun will be, not knowing what you’re getting yourself into. You may even find yourself on my level. I’ll make more. I’m pretty happy with how the “Tunjair Desert” map turned out. Since I like to be satisfied with what I make, I’ll be taking my time and not rush anything.\n\nScore: Support This Title!\n\nWith the level design loosely reminding me of Minecraft, I felt right at home creating levels. Sharing them is super easy too. There are limits to what you can actually design, but with time they may open up some options with height or creating second levels. The levels created by your fellow Steam people can range from (as much as one would expect) bland to fun to “What the …?” The fact that you can favorite designers of your choice makes it easier. It’s rather fun to play through and that stupid dragon is just begging to be stabbed. Fight the Dragon is definitely worth supporting.","September 25, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And here is why:\n\n- it has bugs (option "Suicide" here is for a reason - you can stuck in terrain);\n- it's not polished, there are so many small things which prevents you from loving it;\n- it's not balanced, you can get uber loot from easy map and then bag full of crap after beating extreme;\n- there is no point in difficulty, you MUST choose the easiest, that's 50% exp, while maxed difficuly only 3x times more exp but with 10 times smaller chances to finish it, nobody care if you beat map with 0 lives, but making single failure on unknown map is too easy to spare any available life, simple math: run 3 new maps and get 3x50% exp easily -OR- run just one map, but die first time on unkown trap, die second time due to unexpected trigger spawning monster behind, die third time because of no potions left for last boss fight, which makes it total 0 exp and no loot?\n- UI is terrible, the guy who invent inventory is either idiot or he never himself played this game, no map, terrible idea with running between adventure/multiplayer game/switching hero and most often visited stash/altar;\n- lack of information, there are no clues what which stats gives in order to choose between them, tutorial message are very few (to give you an example, just few minutes ago I discovered the purpose of gold in this game.... after 13+ hours of playing....  not going to spoil, good luck in discovering if you are brave to buy this);\n- loud statement "community driven".. sounds like "we made map editor, we sometime add new graphics, go make us reach";\n- multiplayer is fantastic!, you will enjoy it as much as I did.. once.. to never try it again.\n\nAll-in-all game is a fail with dated graphics, crappy mechanics and poor UI. Not recommended. You want teamplay action with puzzles and hordes of enemies? Then buy Gauntlet and not "Fight teh dragon you will never be able to beat because game is boring".","September 8, 2015","false","15.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

High HP are no help, as the fire damage scales with HP and not with level. On the other hand, lots of stammina is very useful, as dodge rolls seem to be the best tactic against the dragon. As the rogue has good ranged weapons, high speed and only takes half the stammina to dodge, he might be the optimal choice for fighting the dragon"\n-Reedo","January 2","false","5.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Unfortunately, that is not 100% correct.  movement and camera panning work as expected, as well as attacks and special attacks. However, the start button somehow got mapped to the right trigger as opposed to the start button on the game pad.  This is annoying since it is supposed to be the sprint button.\n\n\nOn top of the mapping issue, there is no way to access the the right side of the "donation" menu from your controller whilst in the loot shrine (at least not that i have been able to ascertain).  The only workaround is to switch from game controller to keyboard and mouse.  I feel like im being punished for what should be a pleasureable experience. Afterall, a dungeon crawler is all about reaping the rewards found in the myriad dungeons you visit.\n\nWhile I fully understand the concept of minor oversight, game controls are integral to player enjoyment.  I feel like the option to map button inputs in game would have been a marvelous option.

The gameplay on its own sucks, but the loot system is decent enough.  Of course, even the loot system has its issues.\n\nThe rest of the review:\n\nIt's an Early Access experience, so I wasn't expecting much polish.  There's no content to the story, you just fight the dragon, hence the title.  I was OK with the lack of built-in content, because I thought I could play some user-created content that would actually be interesting.\n\nIf you're buying the game for the level editor, stop.  The level editor sucks.  It isn't intuitive.  It has the beginnings of a logic editor with entity links, but you can't really make anything worth playing.  You can't have interactive dialogue with NPCs.  You can't have multi-floor buildings (well, you can if you're very clever with the bridge objects, but I think that's a glitch).  You can't make endless arena maps.  You can't make maps for Steam Workshop, the maps are built into the game instead, so your Steam profile doesn't get to display your map creations.  (Yes, you can make and share skins but that's not really interesting to me.)  Overall, it is just too limited and offers very little in terms of customization.\n\nIf you're buying this game just to grind loot all day, have fun.  The loot system promotes replaying missions as efficiently as possible, only focusing on opening chests rather than fighting enemies.  You can build and play your own levels and just place all the enemies in a secluded area, away from everything else, so if you're after loot, I don't think you'll have any issues.","December 30, 2014","false","16.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This is the only review I've posted.  This game is like a slower version of spiral knights. The inventory system is simplistic and may appeal to some. I don't like it. I like "bag" systems where I can see everything. This is an item system where you can't see what you've picked up unless you click on your equipped items.  The adventures are slow and simple.

The next thing I know, 6 hours had passed and I still wanted to play more!\n\nTHIS GAME IS FREAKING AWESOME!\n\nFight the Dragon is an action hack-n-slash RPG, but one like no other you've ever played.  Sure, you get stat upgrades, tons of loot, and you fight strange mystical creatures.  FtD, however, has something I've yet to see in any other game - player made adventures!  Thousands of them, too, for hours upon endless hours of replayability!  Add to that the four unique character classes, and you're getting far more than your money's worth from this title.\n\nMy personal rating?  The graphics have a cute charm to them, and while the controls can be a bit slow or clunky at times, they're very manageable.  The gameplay and replayabiolity is where this title truly shines, however.  I can see myself sinking 100's of hours into this one, and maybe even creating a few adventures of my own!\n\n9/10  This game is PURE GOLD and worth every penny (and then some)!  Pick it up - I promise you won't regret it.","June 28, 2015","true","22.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchdx/recommended/250560/","glitchdx","glitchdx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchdx/","175 products in account","I am posting this "review" after investing almost 8 hours of gameplay over two weeks. I don't think that's enough time to call this a propper review, so let's call it a first impressions. If I make it past 16 hours within the next two weeks, I'll review my review and fix anything I may have gotten wrong.\n\nThis is a game that feels like it should be in early access instead of full release. I do hope that it improves, but I cannot reccomend this game in its current state.\n\nBut before I put in a wall of text about how it sucks, first I'll go over what this game does right:\n\n1) Map Editor. Any game with an in-buillt map editor gets brownie points from me, I love creating custom content (even though I suck at it). This editor is clunky and un-intuitive (you can tell it was designed with controllers in mind), but it exists so I'm happy.\n\n2) Community created content. You mean there's constantly new stuff and I don't have to wait on the devs to make it? sweet.\n\n3) It's pretty. The aesthetic is simplistic, but nice. The cartoonish feel works well with high-res textures on low-poly models.\n\n4) It hasn't crashed yet, nor have I experienced any noticable frame-drops (running a AMD FX-4170 / GTX550ti if that helps anyone).\n\nThat's about it. Now to complaining!\n\n1) Controls are extremely clunky. The delay between pressing the attack buttons, performing the animation, and being able to do something else (such as move) is waaaaaaaaay too long and has resulted in many bulshit deahts. I can tell that the issue is a lack of animation cancelling (look at Diablo3, which this game claims to partially inspiried by, it feels great because everything responds immediatly).\n\n2) You can't change attack directions between strikes. This could just be part of 1, but it's aggrivating enough to warrent it's own spot)\n\n3) Hitboxes don't match up with attack animations. Need I say more?\n\n4) The auto-targetting system frequently can't find on-screen targets. Prime example is The Dragon, which makes wands (hitscan projectile weapon) completely useless because it relies entirely on the auto-targetting system to automaticcly hit things then the attack button is pressed. Speaking of auto-targetting, you can't aim things yourself, it just goes in the direction you're facing (unless the auto-target finds something, which as I said is unreliable).\n\n5) This might just be a problem with inexperienced map makers, but several of the levels can be "broken" by getting on top of the outside wall (which I'm certain you're not supposed to be able to do) to find the exit in seconds in a level that should take half an hour.\n\n6) Lack of variety in class builds. So I a basic attack that varies on weapon, a secondary attack that varies whether that weapon is one handed or two handed, and four class abilities that never change (you just unlock them as you progress). Come on. Diablo 2 had 30 class skills PER CLASS (granted several were passives), and it came out in what year? I know comparing an indie dev to blizzard isn't fair, but they brought it upon themselves when the description said it's like diablo meets little big planet. That set some high expectations.\n\n\nI'm still playing it though so I guess it's fun.","December 8, 2014","false","15.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I get more fun out of watching rich white ladies grass grow, than playing this game. Fight the Dragon is a good idea let down by poor production values, sub-par gameplay, and ugly graphics. It tries that whole voxel look, but everybody and their mom look like disformed lego people.\nI get that this is an indie team, but the excution could have been better. Combat is a joke. (like the asking price of $15) it feels weak, slow and unrepesonsive, blocking is pointless, there is very little differences between classes,and there's barely a community, which something a game like this needs to stay fun and intresting. People confuse me by saying that this game is good, but hey people enjoy Postal 2 and Fable, so i guess it's somewhat understandable, in stupid way. dungeons are like potato salad alright to look at, but when you get into it you feel cheated, dissapointed, and upset, I played a player made dungeon and it was leagues above what the devs created, because it was acutally fun, and that's sad. There is nothing that great here, everything has been done better, by better games.

It's still got a few quirks here and there though, and a very VERY punishing level cap at lvl.30. This is most likely a temporary cap, unless he wants people to stop playing the game. Will update once the game gets completely playable, once there's no level cap. Until then, go watch some youtube meanwhile. 7/10, Don't buy yet.\n\nEDIT: To avoid confusion, the game isn't bad. It's just short-lived with the lvl cap. If you like spending hours reading text, playing player-made content and solving puzzles, go ahead. If you're a min-max'er you'll be coming to a halt pretty fast though, as the lvl-cap is so low. Personally, I CAN see myself playing this game a bunch if there was no cap on it. But as the Dev replied it, it will be raised in future updates. I do reccomend the game itself, but not it's current state of replayability. I reached the cap in about 4-5 hrs, for what.. 14€? Again, I will change my review once the cap is raised/removed.","April 16, 2014","false","7.9"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","22"

Feeling like a mix of cheap arcade platformers and a cutesy-minecraft graphics version of Diablo.\nFighting comes down to just slashing away, doing the one or other dodge against bigger enemies or occasionally using a special or heavy attack. Every 'class' comes with slight differences, but I didn't really feel any different when playing as Rogue or Fire Mage.\n\nThe main selling point of the game is it's 'infinite level content' by means of providing a level editor. However, after playing a few hours, I've already seen and beaten + figured out simple patterns of attack to take down all of the ~dozen enemy types the game has to offer. And here is exactly the issue: Providing players a Level Editro does NOT give you instant 'ininite content'. It just gives you infinite variations of the exact same 15 enemies placed on the same 30 tilesets. If the game would have given me the possibility to pick enemy core animations, then add in my own values and special modifiers, that would have been interesting... but like this? Boring and EXTREMELY repetitive.\nNot to mention trivially easy (even when I accidentally entered a high level map with a level 1 mage. Took some more kiting/time, but that's it).\n\nThe concept of the dragon arena is nice. And no doubt, the dragon is a heck of a boss. But that alone does not motivate me to grind through the same enemies hours and hours to come just to beat that boss.\n\n\nOverall, I'm VERY disappointed with the game, even more so because it's not "This is a very early access and lots is to come" but a "It's nearly finished and very playable".\n\nRating: 2/10\nYour money will get you a better hour ratio in ever other game.","September 26, 2014","false","5.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Models and textures are really nice and consistent. Sounds are also good. The GUI, while not particularly intuitive at first, looks great and is very responsive.\n\nThe bad:\n\n* By default the game window was not created properly. I had to edit the configuration file (after stumbling across a forum post) to get it to a window of a reasonable size.\n\n* Gameplay is basic and repetitive.\n\n* My first character wasn't saved, apparently because I didn't exit the game properly. This wouldn't be so bad if the starting levels were not the same every time.\n\nIt's entirely possible I am not the target audience for this game. The gameplay seems more aimed at a young gamer though the interface and controls are not that simple.","December 4, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","5"

I believe this is a very good game and the fact is that the game is good. However, I do not recommend anyone buy this game if they are looking for games similar to what I've been looking for. To elaborate, I am looking for something medieval-like ,  something rpg-like with dungeons and new loot to find,  something challenging and fun at the same time, and most importantly it has to be  multiplayer co-op  for at least 4 people. In the months I've randomly searched when I decide to delve into the steam market I've found many games that seem almost perfect but don't have multiplayer or are too expensive for the time being. I am going to prove to you that there are better games than this that you can get that have these elements and some are even cheaper. Read on and I will explain....\nThis game is fun at first but the problem is the fact that it is based on you and your friends taking on random dungeons created by players. I marvel at this idea; it is brilliant. The issue is the fact that they are in fact players, that causing the obvious problem that not every dungeon is good. I am not exaggerating when I say that some dungeons I and my friends have went on are just garbage. I've spent more than 20 minutes on a dungeon with a friend when it should've taken about 5 minutes to complete. You might be thinking "Oh, that just makes it more challenging" and you'd be right, it took a long time to simply figure out that while on the inside of some castle wall (I know what you're thinking "Oh! Castle wall!!! That's so cool", this was anything but an actual castle.) we had to climb a ladder that was against the inside of the wall which happened to have a small house (not a shack, A HOUSE) which when you go inside seems to have nothing. Then you find out you have to go in a cellar there which we didn't discover existed till after killing everything on the "dungeon" (it was more of an outside area) and the only major difficulty was figuring out what to do. Mind you that this was not meant to be a puzzle, it was just bad mapmaking. You were presented with the area for this house right after you kill the things around you when you spawn. The point being is, if you expect anything as great as in the trailer video, I have not found it or even experienced anything that great. I will admit the game is fun, but what I'm trying to prove to you is that there are  BETTER ALTERNATIVES to this game if you are looking for similar things as me.\n\n\nBetter games for you and a group of friends to try that I've played or intend to play in the future:\nTrove: It's on steam, it's free, it's a 3rd person MMORPG with a bunch of fun classes like swordsman, archer, ice mage, pirate. There isn't PVP it's PVE oriented, and it has a "minecraft-esque" atmosphere. It is a voxel game which I'm normally not into but it's pretty good. Also, despite it being an MMO it does require aiming and you can dodge attacks if you jump and such, it is not lock on and just press a button to kill things like a lot of MMO's. Whenever you and your friends are near each other you all get xp despite whomever kills a creature and you all get your own specific loot drops that only you see, when you open up chests, that are based on your class. So there are no arguments over splitting up loot, you get the same amount of loot and xp with a group as solo-ing. So it's better with friends, you level up faster that way. There also are bosses at the end of dungeons. To sum it up: As my friends and I describe it, it is basically Fight The Dragon But Better.\nSky Saga: Currently in alpha and free. It is not on steam and does require a key that you get when you sign up for an account on their webpage and email you a key. It is an MMORPG and very, very. similar to Minecraft in virtually every way except it's less about the building and more focused on getting quests by talking to npc's at the hub and you go on adventures. You might have to get an item you've never gotten before and bring it back to the hub, or just go take on dungeons and they do have somewhat difficult bosses in dungeons. I was co-oping a dungeon with a friend and they left for some reason and I was stuck with half health and found a boss and basically just ran out of the dungeon cause I couldn't take him. It was this big dude who had a giant lance or something and would swing it at me. To sum it up: I don't know when they will be releasing keys again as of this moment though, but definitely check this out and make an account if you're interested in playing in the future. Also be sure to check your "promotions" tab in gmail if that's what you use, it got sent there for me.\n\nSecrets of Grindea: This game I have not played or own yet. But from what I gather it is multiplayer with up to 4 players and basically a top-down RPG with monsters and boss fights. I don't know what else there is but it appears to have the elements I'm looking for in dugeon style games. It is currently $15 the same price as fight the dragon. So if you don't want to at least try the free games I mentioned and you do want to spend money still. This game is most definitely an option. To sum it up: Same price as Fight The Dragon but probably better.\nIn Conclusion:Look up any and all of these Games and if you are truly looking for the same elements I sought after, you will not be disappointed. And if you are, you will be even more disappointed by buying Fight The Dragon. I release this review to help people like me get the best game possible for them and their friends. Good luck all and have a great day! After all you are on Steam! :)","November 15, 2015","false","6.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","3"

Have players make levels for you to complete, you run through them, get tons of loot, "craft" new loot, rinse and repeat.\n\nWhat actually happens is people put out broken levels, that wont work and then you get stuck on one for 30 mins, and if you dont complete the level, you get nothing from it. All experience, loot, etc you gained, gone. So needless to say this game got old and overly frustrating much faster then I though, and I stopped playing.

So far I have been nothing but frustrated by the gameplay. Don't get me wrong, it isn't all bad and I do enjoy it. I just find the levels so difficult to complete that it takes the fun out of it for me. The drop items are quite fun, but unless you play a higher difficulty they are crap. The enemies are well animated and create a diverse and dynamic game, unless you play at anything over the easiest difficulty then you get swarmed and die, a lot. There is a good online element as you can play senerios that other members have created, which can result in some interesting storylines. However the game is so difficult to complete that I just cried and now have no energy to try again.\n\nPlay it if you enjoy a challenge and can actually overcome it.

I bought the 4-pack for me and my friends for about 8 USD, and found the fighting aspect of it was pretty terrible. I have not tried the building aspect of it and may try to just to see what it is like but the battle mechanics are just too easy. The controls are mediocre and it just feels like you're playing a game for children. I will say there are a few things that I can give for it is the art style of the environment. It looks really nice and the textures for the levels made by people look finished and nice. But the character models seem a bit stolen from Roblox. Lastly, if you have a friend or more playing with you the game will be so increasingly easy that you will not die.","June 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

Very misleading. As you cannot fight the dragon with anyone else.\n\nPros: Loot system, easy combat system, plenty of adventures, there's a dragon you can chip away at for awhile\n\nCons: The too easy combat system, TOO many crappy/unbalanced (especially some of the "easy") adventures, you can't take anyone with you to fight the dragon. Gold has no use at all other than donating (so why even bother having in the game? Not very meaningful gameplay there)\n\n\n\nI really think that if they just had some other use for the gold, and allowed coop for the dragon, and cleaned up the combat system, this would be an easy 90%+/Gold game if everything had some meaning. Otherwise, me and my four year old enjoy running around pointlessly and killing things together...\n\nGood luck on Pacman, hope that you learn from your mistakes on this one.\n","June 21, 2015","false","4.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

To my oppinion it's too focused on player generated content, which is\nnoticable when playing a map. The gameplay is bad to my oppinion.\nIt feels like its made for a controller instead of mouse and keyboard.\nYou can play a dungeon master however and create scenarios for other players to play and rate.\nBeing in early access, it still requires a lot of work. You can't make a campaign yet.\nAnd claiming to give you a sort of DnD experience, it will have to improve to achieve this.\nThey do have a good mapping rule system.\nA user cannot create content for more than 7000 points (at this moment).\nOther than that, there are rules about monsters and reaching the finish.\nThis is further fortified by the fact that the designer has to complete his/her map at least once before publishing!\nHowever this could bite the concept in the ♥♥♥ if big over-arching campaigns will be made possible.\n\nPros:\n- Promising concept\n- Campaign in the future\n- Maps get rated\n- High customizability in maps\n\nCons:\n- Bad gameplay\n- Shallow at this moment\n- unintuitive editor\n\nI do suggest to eventually get it, however at this moment it is a gem in the making.","June 7, 2014","false","5.2"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

The map editing program is extensive and I spent a while making some complicated maps. The game is very basic, you gain levels by playing either creator made maps, your maps or maps of other users and eventually defeat the dragon.\n\nPros:\n\nMap making is easy and fun, and you can accomplish a good amount in a short time.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fluid, although sometimes when you try to hit an enemy with a sword nothing happens. That could just be a miss on the attack, but it isn't indicated.\n\nThe loot system reminds me of Borderlands.\n\nThe dragon is VERY tough to beat. After pouring several hours into leveling up and getting good gear to fight the dragon I've still only been able to knock out a few thousand health from it per battle. It starts out with a million health, but health doesn't regenerate in between battles, so the damage you do to it is permanent. If you get health regenerating equipment and are willing to run around the map for about 48 hours to avoid attacks while you heal, then you could beat the dragon in one sitting, but I do not recommend you try.\n\nCons:\n\nOnce a moderator accuses your map of being an exploit, it seems they never go back to unban it after you edit it. For example, I built a map that was a straight shot from beginning to end with a couple hundred rats and skeletons to fight. It was by no means an easy map. I would usually beat it with just a single life left. Because of Its simplicity it was banned for being a grinding exploit, and now that I edited it to include Minotaurs (which easily knock a player off my map, thereby increasing the difficulty greatly) It's still in review.\n\nAlthough bugs are fixed quickly and little things are added here and there, no real new content has shown up to my knowledge since my purchase of the game a few months ago. The game's replay value sinks quickly after you unlock your final ability and realize the only thing you have left to do is suffer through endless generic hours of gameplay to get a bit stronger to stand up to the dragon better.\n\nYou can't just go and challenge the dragon whenever you want. You need a scroll, and to get it you need to play a new map. If you don't have an internet connection, you will run out of scrolls quickly and won't be able to play the main purpose of the game.\n\n\nOverall, the game is good, and I recommend it if you're willing to do the same thing for a while in order ot beat that pesky dragon, and if you're willing to put up with moderators banning you for exploiting, then not giving you a second chance. Don't mess up in map editing, or you'll end up like me, the evil Bonticune.\n\nThings I'd like to see:\n\nA multiplayer option to fight the dragon with. Maybe a dragon whose health resets after each battle, and some prize system if you do a certain amount of damage.\n\nDifferent equipment when you deal enough damage to the dragon. The time limit rings are good for the few minutes you get them, but the rings that last for even as high as an hour and a half are gone a lot quicker than people would think.\n\nA difficulty higher than extreme. I like heavy combat in my games, and with health regen equipment the game has become too easy.\n\nThe ability to have bosses speak before they attack.\n\nThe field of views for enemies increased (if the player makes it so while editing)","March 9, 2015","true","38.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Don't give your money on a whim, wait and see if the finished product has more potential.\n\nThe combat is extremely dry, sluggish, and requires less skill and more button mashing and potion consuming.\nWorld creation is very constricting, thus turning a game that people should be able to play the way they want to into a game that might has well have been fully created by the devs.\nUI/inventory management needs work.  The minimal look of the UI is awesome, but the functionality of it is lacking.\n\nArt style leaves much to be desired.  I understand this is highly subjective, but it just seems uninspired.","November 8, 2014","false","3.0"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","10","26","0","7"

Although, would be nice if you could save outside of levels (doesn't seem possible).\n* Got better once my character upgraded. Initially it was very tough going. I assume this is tuning that needs to be done as part of the early access.\n\nNegatives\n* Game seems very slow. My computer can run Just Cause 2 and Skyrim at high resolution very smoothly and this game is really laggy at the average settings to the point of giving me a headache.\n* The controls are not very tight at all. There are long delays while attacking, no indication if you are "selecting" the monster as you try to attack which leads to a lot of misses (or being low level I am suppose to miss a lot, hard to tell), and the jump mechanic could use some work.\n* The content is very sparse. They seem to be entirely counting on users creating most of it.\n* The UI is bewildering and the style doesn't match the theme of the game at all. Little things like Esc not exiting out of inventory or back up a level (you have hit tab again like TV menus), somethings can only be done in certain situations or at special locations like checking your inventory. Took me a while to figure out that the box with a number and a flashing plus was stat increases but that you have to click on the individual stas to upgrade them.\n* Thief doesn't start with a crossbow/bow? Seems wierd if they are going for the guantlet feel. Also, the loot drops seem to be giving me weapons for a fighter (swords, axes). I was only able to get a crossbow from the loot shrine.\n* Difficulty ratings are ocassionally wrong, even in the official maps. The Ice pass is definitely not "medium" having beaten several official "extreme" levels.\n* Bugs, i think? Somewhat expected with an early access game, but simple things like having a strength of 1+1 (+1 due to item boost) doesn't let you equip a weapon that requires a strength of 2.\n\nOverall not great based on the cost compared to other games at the same price point. That is somewhat expected with an early access game, but the developers keep talking about how playable it is, so ... I can't really recommend the game at this time. Perhaps as it matures it will get better.","November 2, 2014","false","4.2"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","4"

Turns out the issue was the user and not the programming, sorry. Maybe that information should have been made more public? In my defense, many Linux ports are just broken, it's getting tiresome, luckily devs were on the case or I might have missed this indie gem!]\n\nExperience on Linux:\n\n+ Works.\n+ High developer interaction, even in Steam community. Good!\n+ This IS indeed the way to showcase a new game under development on Linux.\n\nThe game:\nAs expected in early access, a few key features are missing regarding controls, but it seems the devs are keen on making this a good game so we may see lots of polishing up in the near future.\nThe game itself isn't what top end console gamers would consider good looking, but I like the artstyle. It reminds me of Egoboo (obscure title) and has that adventure feeling Neverwinter Nights used to offer. This game also has a top down platformer mechanic, much like some Zelda titles, but combines it with deeper RPG elements that we are all familiar with (XP, levels, character development, items, etc). The music is very good, it sets the tone of the game perfectly.\nAll in all, the game delivers on every point of my expectations. If you like adventure, magic, treasure and dragons, this is your buy. Oh, it also has the number one RPG enemy: rats!\n\nScore:\n3/5 (still early access, with all the features in place I bet this will be a high 4 or even a 5)","March 28, 2014","true","0.5"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","13"

This game is absolutely not worth $15, the graphics are actually worse than runescape back when it was 2d. The limited monsters are repetitive and the entire strategy of the 10 or so levels i played was pull as many monsters as possible and spam abilities, run around until stamina regenerated and then respam abilities.\n\nItems didn't even feel like they were worth picking up and as long as you can run in circles and right click you can beat almost all scenarios. The two available classes shared abilities and it didn't really feel like there was very much thought or diversity put into them.

It does indeed feel like a mashup of Diablo and Little Big Planet.\n\n\nEditor\nThe shining star for me is the ACK, the tools that let you create adventures. While there are plenty of tool here to make a fullout adventure and even campaign, the basics of the tools allow one to create, more or less, a dungeon.\n\nI'm impressed, certainly, by the ease-of-use of the tools.  I'm sure I'm not the only one among us, but very rarely do I read tutorials or hints and tips before using a toolset such as a level editor.  For me, I generally only retreat to tutorials if I can't figure out how to do something that I'm trying to do.  All that to say, I've not needed to look at pretty much any documentation to use these tools, they are that simple to use.  (I am a programmer by trade, though.)\n\nI sort of wish that there were some sort of an option to intentionally "complicate" the editor in order to get a little more mileage in terms of efficiency and final product quality, but I completely understand some of the design decisions that were made.\n\n\nGameplay\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's solid.  It's nothing groundbreaking, but it's nothing to complain about.  If you like ARPGs, then you'll probably like this one.  The only things I've taken note of are the predictable and exploitable AI and a probable class imbalance (There are four classes).\n\nThe loot shrine is a genius idea.  for those that don't have the game, the loot shrine is basically a place where you can "sell" items and donate gold.  The more accrued value you accumulate, the better the item and rewards you get when you finally cash-in.  It gives you a mostly random output, with the player having a small amount of choice in what their reward is.\n\nAnother unique aspect of this game is the dragon.  He's a really tough enemy which, I'm assuming, drops some of the best loot.  You get loot at certain milestones of health you take away from the dragon.  You can only fight the dragon, though, if you have enough tokens (Dragon Scrolls).  Each Dragon Scroll gives you a certain number of attempts to Fight the Dragon.\n\nI've not dabbled too much in fighting the dragon because I'm still fairly new and he stomps me...\n\n\nOther Thoughts\nAs a plus, the developers and community seem quite helpful (see comments in this review) and responsive.  There were a few bugs (and a mistake on my part) that have both recently been addressed and corrected with goodwill and no malice, despite my (then) stated disappointment.  That being said, there are likely more bugs, but as of now I don't know of any that I've come across that haven't been fixed.  You'll likely not find anything gamebreaking, just things that might irk you.\n\nI sincerely hope the developers will work on a sequel and are able to take what they learned from this game to make a spectacular new game, although not in any sort of a hurry as this game still certainly has mileage left.  Sort of like LBP, which is a sited inspiration on the store page.  The first LBP was great, but had some kinks.  LBP2 seemed to work most of the little kinks and bugs out and was an excellent builder in nearly every right.\n\nTL;DR  Great adventure editor, easy to use.  Pretty good gameplay.  Possible occasional bugs.","June 17, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

I picked it up during the Summer Sale because it was less than three bucks. My expectations going in were for an hour-or-two-throwaway, barely finished product.\n\nWhat I got instead has enthralled me so much the past two days. I can play for five minutes or get lost in a two-hour binge. The maps are long enough to feel detailed but short enough to complete in one sitting. Combat can get repetitive but with new and better loot dropping here and there, from enemies and chests, I didn't really care; it's good, plain fun. There are four classes with individual spells and special abilities - a fighter, fire mage, ice mage and rogue - but I've only played as an "Ice Wizard" up to this point without losing any interest or even gaining a desire to try other classes. I'm having too much fun with this one.\n\nThere's also a map/adventure/campaign editor where you can create your own landscapes, buildings, villages, etc. etc. You can also script NPCs to talk to the player when he approaches as well as decorate your worlds with trees, rocks, fountains, bookshelves, beds, chairs... You name it. With a touch of detail here and there, worlds come alive. The editor has some rudimentary logic chains and pressure pads so that you can create some quite interesting and complex puzzles, though I'll admit, I haven't delved into that area quite yet.\n\nBuy this game. You will not regret it. I haven't had this much fun playing a game in who knows how long.","June 20, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am retracting all of that. Hate to do this, I want to like this game.  Truth is, I just do not.\n\nThe game works pretty well, and you can even use the editor with just a gamepad.  The combat is only okay.  There has always been something about it that just feels stiff..\n\nI guess I shouldn't complain, I got my money's worth in play time.  The funnest part is using the editor.  I made one level and published it that took quite awhile, but I didn't want to make another one because there aren't enough assets to make it very different.\n\nSo that's the overall problem.  Each level feels the same because they all draw from the same small pool of assets.  For example the game only has about 20 monsters or so. Quite a while back the devs said they agreed with this and planned to add lots of stuff but they never did.  The workshop could be a solution to this, but it isn;t because you can only skin your own character, that's it.\n\nThey continue to to update the game a little bit here and there, but I think they consider it mostly finished.  It's not all bad I just wish that the time I took to learn making my own edventure could be rewarded with inspiration to use it more and create many more levels.  I feel like I wasted my time with it and hope to save some others from maybe doing the same.\n\nI think the 10-13 age group could maybe like it a lot.  Hard to say, the learning curve is a bit high with the editor.  It never really caught on for my 10 year old either.","January 13, 2015","false","93.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a lot of fun, very intuitive, and simple to use regardless of your personal experience with design. You can make extremely simple adventures or go for something more complicated - whatever suits your fancy.\n\nMy only qualm is with the overall content of the game.

The loot system dynamically scales based on how many, and how often you encounter chests and enemies. Map makers are free to make adventures how they like without affecting your loot drastically. However, the strength of enemies also scales with you no matter where you go, so it kinda takes away from the sense of progression.

It has aspects from 3 games that I deeply cherrished as a little kid, and still do: Gauntlet, Diablo & LittleBigPlanet. I've played COUNTLESS hours of each game in the past, and I plan on spending quite some time on this one.\n\nAside from the personal mumbo-jumbo, this game is a hack 'n' slash RPG with a nostalgic dungeon crawl feel to it. The character customization is pretty neat, especially since there's skins and stuff you can get off of the Steam Workshop. Plus, there's a variety of different armors and weapons you can get, which adds onto the already wide variety of character customizations. The BIGGEST factor of the game that is certainly astounding is the in-game level editor, which lets you make your own levels and publish it for anybody to play. Just as an honorable mention, it also has FULL controller support, as well as splitscreen co-op, so it 100% makes an astounding game to just mess around with when you have a friend over. Not only is it splitscreen co-op, but it's co-op both online worldwide and through LAN!\n\nThough, I gotta include the very few things I don't particularly like about this game. The fact that you can't use lowercase letters SO IT ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE SHOUTING, and how when you're hopping from ledge to ledge and you bump into a wall something, you basically go straight down as soon as you hit it.

The loot system dynamically scales based on how many, and how often you encounter chests and enemies. Map makers are free to make adventures how they like without affecting your loot drastically. However, the strength of enemies also scales with you no matter where you go, so it kinda takes away from the sense of progression. But I can see why they had to do that.\n\nThe graphics look strange, but it's consistent, I'll give it that.\n\nI can see myself killing time on his for quite a while.","November 12, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Been looking for something like this for a long time. It's a hack and slash, but you can also go (ice or fire) mage or rogue (range or daggers). Maps are made by users and are of very good quality usually. There's a rating system, so it should get better over time.\n\nHowever, since the beginning they never fixed the main problems. Controls, poor vision, auto-pickup not working properly and most of all the Crossbow doesn't work properly and it's my favorite weapon.\nIf you start shooting while standing still it has normal rate of fire. Usually. If you shoot while moving it takes a step, takes a shot, takes a step, takes a shot etc. This gives you less DPS. You have to stop attacking, wait a sec, stop walking too and then fire again to get it to work properly.\nThis makes for a very awkward experience which they should have fixed by now.\nSo for this reason I can't recommend it.\n\n(And anóther thing. The Xbox 360 controller is supported, but you can't properly aim anymore. Also you can't strafe. Playing with a controller is like playing Hammerwatch. Run away, turn around with same stick thén you can shoot the monsters that are chasing you. This isn't very hard it's just extremely awkward and slower. And no strafing? Come on!)","December 7, 2014","false","44.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

The levels made by 3 sprockets are pretty fun, but the rest of the community levels are hit or miss.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with the game is the clunkiness of the combat. It feels like the enemies are hard to hit. I often miss when it looks like it should hit, which becomes very frustrating. This issue, combined with the poor placement of checkpoints in many user made maps made the game feel like a chore.","September 29, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked it up during the Summer Sale because it was less than three bucks. My expectations going in were for an hour-or-two-throwaway, barely finished product.\n\nWhat I got instead has enthralled me so much the past two days. I can play for five minutes or get lost in a two-hour binge. The maps are long enough to feel detailed but short enough to complete in one sitting. Combat can get repetitive but with new and better loot dropping here and there, from enemies and chests, I didn't really care; it's good, plain fun. There are four classes with individual spells and special abilities - a fighter, fire mage, ice mage and rogue - but I've only played as an "Ice Wizard" up to this point without losing any interest or even gaining a desire to try other classes. I'm having too much fun with this one.\n\nThere's also a map/adventure/campaign editor where you can create your own landscapes, buildings, villages, etc. etc. You can also script NPCs to talk to the player when he approaches as well as decorate your worlds with trees, rocks, fountains, bookshelves, beds, chairs... You name it. With a touch of detail here and there, worlds come alive. The editor has some rudimentary logic chains and pressure pads so that you can create some quite interesting and complex puzzles, though I'll admit, I haven't delved into that area quite yet.\n\nBuy this game. You will not regret it. I haven't had this much fun playing a game in who knows how long.","June 20, 2015","true","26.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I kept dieing, kept getting loot I couldn't use due to class or level etc. Was driving me nuts. So I farmed a little on the beginner levels then went looking for other *easy* levels to enjoy. I like how the community is the one to create a majority of the content. Keeps it fresh and there are some extrodinary levels to play. Havent really found a *bad* one yet, just some i liked a lot more than others. Even attempted my own creation and while short, was still fun to make and play it.\n\nIf you're struggling at first, give it a little time and it does get better with some gear and levels.","February 1","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
