However this game may benefit from the ability to buy 4 packs so you could buy them and grab some friends. I can't be the only one who has ever wanted to blow up friends by bombarding them with carrots ,but the game as it is now is imposible to play otherwise unless you and a group of friends wsh to play together you will be endlessly waiting to find a match but that doesnt mean this is a bad game. even though it misses some small fetures an is not as wel optimized as some people may hope BUT THIS GAME IS EA dont expect a full game if you expect a well pollished game buy a big budget game not an indie game","August 25, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
