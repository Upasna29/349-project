"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_kat_/recommended/387860/","_kat_","COOL LIKE DEBBIE HARRY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_kat_/","168 products in account","This game is a about a man named Jacob Ernholtz, and his last day alive. Or I suppose his last minute, since the clock is stuck at 3:22 AM the whole time, but It can't be broken because the alarm went off... Anyway this is less of a review and more of an analysis. That being said, there will be -\n\nSPOILERS\nI've spent a decent amount of time combing over this game and trying to piece together the narrative. At first glance it's clear that Jacob is obssessed over a painting of two palm trees. It's not a very special painting in my opinion. However he has gone far enough to have an entire room dedicated to this painting and many variations, perhaps looking for some hidden meaning. But why that specific painting? Well, Jacobs username on the chatting application is "ratherBtravelin" - a bit odd considering he has boarded up his windows and (I'm assuming) he stays inside as much as possible. He's not a complete agoraphobe, judging by his grocery list. I believe this painting has struck a chord with Jacob simply because it's a way he can vicariously be somewhere he wants. Somewhere exotic and sunny. Perhaps with friends and family. I imagine he sees himself as happy there. Unfortunately due to his depression (which is the cause of his isolation in the first place) he develops a consuming obsession over it, instead of actually taking a trip to the bahamas.\n\nAs far as depicting a man suffering with crippling depression, this game does a decent job. Eating the shrimp was a bit sickening, and a great representation of the effects that depression can have on loved ones. Cleaning the microwave was an interesting take on how often times suicidal people continue with their routine till the end. The cause of his depression is unclear, although it's implied his father has died recently. The cause isn't important, anyway.\n\nWhat's important is the man he has locked in a vault. My theory is this man is the kidnapped painter Jason Malone who was in the paper. I think Jacob kidnapped this man and is forcing him to paint more copies of the palm tree painting. If you've played the game you'll know that you can kill the painter or let him go. I've been speculating about a third option that might be hidden in the game and my research has finally been coming together. At first I tried the obvious, like letting him out and then electrocuting, or selecting different options while chatting on the computer, or not turning the alarm off. I let the man out and walked around the house for a few hours but nothing seemed to happen. There's definitely something else going on in this game and I'm going to figure it out.\n\nI took note of all the authors of the books and the suicides at the end of the game and noticed an interesting connection. z.f lincoln, one of the people who apparently killed themself, is also the author of one of the books on the bookshelf leading to the vault. Titled "Six slugs for Mario", I eventually found out this was the title of a short film the developer was working on when he went to FSU! This explains the palm trees and is proof that I'm on the right track. I've been sending twitter messages to Jesse (the developer of this game) about my theories but he stopped responding and I'm pretty sure he's blocked me. More evidence I'm getting close to the truth. I think Tim Allen must be involved somehow due to the newspaper article.\n\nIf anyone has any information, connections, or theories about this please let me know.","August 19, 2015","true","52.8"," 582 of 612 people (95%) found this review helpful 215 people found this review funny","95","582","612","215","48"

Hamilton, Mistral's Kiss\n\nIn less than twenty minutes, The Static Speaks My Name, delivers a gut-wrenching tale that delves directly into the sensitive subject matter of depression in a beautiful, yet twisted way.\n\nDepicting the story of a thirty-one year old man by the name of, Jacob Emholtz, The Static Speaks My Name showcases the warped perspective of an obsessive man who, in his quest to solve the the non intelligible meaning that lies within a painting of two trees, loses sight of his own morality, slipping slowly and slowly into an introverted state.\n\nWhat our protagonist fails to realize, however, is that his dissection of the painting is not spawned on the basis of curiosity, as much as a self-reflection pertaining to his constant descent into an unrelenting spire of depression.  In search for justification to his sorrows, Jacob distorts his true objective of discovering self-worth, into a direct, but unavailing task that consumes him entirely.\n\nOnce gripped with depression, introspection only leads to greater despair.\n\nThe game-play and graphical style is very, very simplistic, but the game still manages to be very atmospheric.  I do wish a bit more... emphasis was put on the paintings (many players will simply miss the whole basis behind the game as it fails to push the player even slightly in the correct direction).  This was a major flaw in the development of the story that may push away players.  That said, I very much enjoyed the game.\n\n\nThough I am not fully satisfied with the above phrasing and grammar as I feared to spoil the game entirely (and night-shift is an absolute killer, haha), I simply must implore those who have not yet played this game to invest the ten minutes of your time.  It is most certainly worth it.  The message may not cut as deeply to some than others, but the story is unique enough that I believe most will most certainly enjoy the tale.\n\nAs a side-note, though the developer provides a “trigger-warning” for those stricken with emotional grief, I would still absolutely recommend this game.  Though sorrow has gripped me plenty times throughout the years, I personally have found that contemplating/observing unique perspectives on somewhat... taboo subjects allows for me to reconcile with the issues that cloud my mind.\n\nThe Static Speaks My Name is a short title, but it conveys a powerful message.\n\n\nEdit: It would be phenomenal if a more, full experience (multiple stories) could be added.  If a game was developed with multiple stories, I would most certainly purchase it at a reasonable price.\n\n\nEdit Two: The keys on the wall next to the televisions are there for a reason.  Search around a bit and you might find some interesting things.  The game rewards exploration, even when in such a small space.","August 10, 2015","true","1.9"," 291 of 332 people (88%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","88","291","332","20","11"

This review does contain spoilers so read at your own risk. Actual review at the bottom.\n\nThe whole point of walking through the 'menial tasks' is to show you what it's like to be severely depressed. This guy has someone locked up in a cage (who he kills) and then plans to hang himself. And yet he walks around doing these inane tasks like cleaning the microwave, talking to cam girls and...eating live shrimp like it aint no thang. The whole point is the feeling of detachment this guy has from life. He's going to kill himself and yet he still finds the time to clean the ♥♥♥♥ing microwave! Anyone who has been depressed at some point in their life, no matter how deeply, can relate to that feeling of apathy. As for the painting - what's wrong with coming to your own conclusions? Surely there's an element of fun in trying to figure out what the hell this guy has been doing with his life obsessing over a painting? Some stories don't need an explanation, it's more enjoyable leaving us lot to argue about the backstory!\n\nThis is a weird but enjoyable (sort of) little story/game that does a good job of conveying the feeling of detachment that depressed people often feel. You can sense it just by playing it. It's only 10 minutes long, if that, so for the grand total of zero pounds and zero pence, you might as well give it a go.","August 11, 2015","true","0.3"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","64","75","4","1"

For a free game that's alright as I didn't expect a massive game.\n\nWhen I started I didn't know about it so I went it in an open mind and came out thinking that it was a great experience.\nTo start the game is very simple. You are put inside a house, you walk around and do the things you are tasked with doing. Like chatting online and eating breakfast.\n\nThe game is really simple and incredibly short too. As I said before it took me 6 minutes to complete the entire thing.\n\nSince it's free and anyone can check it out, go straight ahead and play it. It's a great indie title and it's free so you can't go wrong.\n\nSince there's not much to talk about I'll just leave it at that. You can install it and beat it in no time.

All that we can gather is that the main character is depressed, obsesses over a painting because he thinks it can explain his issues, and then kills himself. The trailer for the game is more interesting than the game itself.\n\nOn top of this, making a choice didn't change the outcome. I played this about 6 times just poking and prodding at random things in the environment hoping that I missed something or the 4 characters at the end would have their own stories and rooms to go through if I did things differently, but then the thing just ends.\n\nThe way this could have been fixed was having an overarching story or event that connected the characters at the end together with the main character and alluded to their reasoning and motive other than "Man finds painting, obsesses over painting, kidnaps artist who painted said painting"\n\nIt just seems like Unity is too easy to use; Nobody has to put a huge amount of effort into making something with the engine or even bother making it actually good.

There honestly is little to nothing to say about this game, as it is very short, and I'll have to add a spoiler alert to add content to this review. I'd recommend this game, it only takes about 10 minutes to play. However, be warned, this game does contain some rather dark and depressing topics.\n\nThe story is of a man so obsessed with a painting, a palm tree on a small desert island, most likely in the middle of an ocean. You play as the man's last night alive. The game itself is very short, and quite unusual, with simplistic tasks such as 'Using the bathroom' and 'Cleaning the microwave', then 'Deciding what to do with the man in the cage'.\n\nI'll have to add a spoiler alert to these next parargraphs, as I'll tell the story, as some players didn't seem to understand it. You play as a rather odd man who's obsessed with a painting. Your tasks at the beginning require you to use the bathroom and get breakfast. However, there is nothing to eat, so the man resorts to eating 2 of his pet shrimps. The only room that you are not required to use is filled with the same painting all over the walls. Your character seems to have studied and cracked down on everything this simplistic palm tree painting has to offer; it'd also seem likely that your character has made some crazy conspiricies and observations.\n\nOne of your last taks is to decide what to do with the man in your cage. Before this, you have no understanding of this man in a cage. You're forced to pick up your keys (hung up next to your coat on a rack) and use them to open a bookcase that reveals a safe, in which a man, most likely the artist of your obsessed painting, is locked in a cage. You unlock the cage and then 'put yourself to rest', in which you open a door in your room which previously would've said 'not yet..' when you tried to interact with it. In this room is a noose, you commit suicide and wake up in a dark space filled with static clouds, all of which show names, ages and way of suicide when you get close to them.

It does a pretty good job of capturing the experience of emptiness and monotany that accompanies the lead-up to a suicide attempt in a way that was incredibly haunting. I also appreciated how it managed to pace the revelation of the player character's obsession with the painting so well, despite the game's incredibly short length.\n\nMy one main issue with the game though, is that this is all more or less ruined by the inclusion of the "man in the cage". Exploring themes like suicidal impulses and obsession through the medium of first-person gameplay has a lot of potential, but connecting it to some cartoonish concept of a "psycho killer" trope really dampens the aspects which make this game otherwise shine.\n\nThe ending seems to indicate that there is a chance this may be expanded upon one day, with the ability to experience many different suicidal scenarios, and if it does, I just really hope the creator relies more on the pathos of taking on the role of a suicidal person, rather than trying to make these people out to be wickedly deranged caricatures.","February 19","true","0.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I see too many thumbs down for games like this just because "there's no gameplay" - Well, what on earth did you expect for an interactive story? Still, with that in mind, I'll base my review off of the story elements primarily.\n\nAnd, goodness, what a story this is! The game itself is played in the perspective of what I can only assume is a fairly sick man who is obsessing over a single painting, to the point where he spirals out of control. The objectives start out simple, as if directing a very normal person, but then they similarly spiral into chaos, which I think just shows how elusive such a madness could be (or similarly how people that we condone as insane have ordinary needs and functions too). The transitions of creepy event after creepy event - not at all supernatural, but I think what makes them uncomfortable to witness is the fact that they could happen in real life - grows exponentially, heightening to an upsetting yet also morally confusing ending, which will definitely have me thinking for a bit of time.\n\nThe other indications to persuade someone to play stand very clear: this game is free and it only lasts ten to fifteen minutes. Definitely take a look around the environment that your character lives in, soak in the possibilities, and have a good think about this game, because there's surely a lot to think about!","August 16, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/recommended/387860/","ghiz876","Gumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghiz876/","33 products in account","Tackles depression and suicide by making you play as a heinous criminal recluse who strips and locks up people. I feel this would sooner increase stigma towards mental illness than help people sympathise. Could you honestly say more about the protagonist than he's a weirdo who you wouldn't want to be around? Advertises itself as prioritising character, yet all I learned about this character is that he's creepy.\n\nPut yourself in the shoes of a mentally ill person by... going to the toilet in an unhygenic manner, eating your pet shrimp, talking to a sex bot and cleaning a microwave. This is not pleasant to play, nor is it interesting. For that matter, nor is much of it really a clear representation of what a depressed person would be doing. Just gross or mundane tasks.\n\nA hook ending with presumed branching paths or multiple stages is implied but seemingly tries to troll the player with abrupt credits. That said, few people would expect an expansive experience from a game like this. Besides, I'm frankly  not terribly keen to see much more of how the creator of this game portays suicide.","January 4","false","0.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I am only giving it a recommendation for the simple fact that it can be so much better, but I don't exactly know if the devs are going to expand on this or not.\n\nSome things you should know before playing this game: it's awful. It doesn't make sense, it is creepy, and it is extremely dark. I liked a lot of things about it though. The ending approached suicide in a way that wasn't there for pure shock value , and the music really set the mood for the game. That's where my problems come in. The "memes" and jokes were terrible. They don't fit in a game like this at all. Not only that, but the   man in the cage  part makes absolutely 0 sense and takes away so much from the game. It turns it from a serious and dark game to a really weird and uncomfortable game.\n\nI am sure there is some deeper meaning to it all, but it is really too short to fully flesh out anyways.\n\nThe ending seems to imply that there are more "stories" to go through, but they either haven't been added in yet or I am missing something. If they could make some simple changes to the game how it is now and add in those other stories, I would readily recommend this game. It is unlike anything else I have ever played and it is completely free.","May 4","true","0.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","3"

I'm open for offers btw.)\n\nIf I would say that “the static speaks my name” is ♥♥♥♥/fantastic, it would be as much a review as tssmn is actually a game. Yes, it would intrigue you by the title and then jump right to the point, but then would find itself shallow and without an ability to perform something meaningful. And more importantly it won’t waste too much of your precious time and would offer some point of view.\n\nIf free game takes you 15 minutes to beat it (only because of mine desperate attempts to find any hidden way or/and meaning), how could you criticize it?! So tssmn cares about your wallet and time (which is money, so its care is twice beneficial), but game can’t offer anything except that and “shocking” thematic.  And this is disappointing, because it got tightness in the air, game like that desperately needs, but catharsis of the story is too weak to sympathize, it just lead you to inevitable. Do you really want to kill yourself only because you found the rope and someone told you so?  Do you really want to play the game only because it’s free and short? Well, maybe you do, how could I know.\n\nIt might be easily the end of my review, but the journalistic rule says to avoid rhetorical questions in the end of any article, so let’s talk about theme of the game, we got no choice, because other aspects of it are not worth a space on the paper (screen? nevermind), as I mentioned before. So tssmn explores dark side of human consciousness as well as “Depression Quest” which made a lot of noise some time ago, but it was nothing to do with its theme or quality. DQ reminds some physiological test, while tssmn is more like a manual; it isn’t asking any whys. Sadly both games failed to deliver gameplay-wise mumbling something about importance of its ideas. You really need to get your thoughts straight before public debate on such topics, because loud statement couldn’t substitute story, game mechanics and gameplay itself.  We all know that those things exist, although sometimes afraid to talk about them, would you mind to make actual game about it? Oh my, rhetorical question again. So it was inevitable as well.","November 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

Haters gonna hate serious reviews, apparently)\n\n\n............Umm.......what can I say about this?   I'm...very neutral on this one.  I knew what I was getting myself into when I downloaded this title, but rather than getting something grand like the description and trailer suggested, I found the end result to be quite disappointing.\n\n\nYou play as a mentally unstable individual who has an unnatural obsession with a painting.  He lives with his mother in a run-down apartment.  A very depressing and...slightly creepy setting.   He finds that he has no food in the house and chooses to eat some his pet shrimp instead.   He has 3 AIM friends, all offline (and "chats" with a sex spambot) at 3:22 AM.  He even has a man (presumably the artist of the painting he obsesses over) in a hidden room, who he feeds his own pet shrimp to and later ends.   In the end...he offs himself.\n\n\nI understand some people can find symbolic meaning in all of this.  From what I've seen, you just play as a depressed and mentally unstable individual who succumbs to his obsession.  Like looking at art, there's no point in always looking for meaning in an art when all there is in face value.  If you look into something that has no further meaning than what is shown at face value, then you'll drive yourself mad like the protagonist.   As Albert Einstein once said: "The definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again while expecting different results".  If the only results are at face value, don't dig any further.  (The portrait is just a picture.  Does it have meaning?  Does it have no meaning?  To me?  It's just a picture.)\n\n\nPros:\nDecent attempt at 3D usage.\nNo bugs.\n\nCons:\nBland.\nToo "Artsy" (This is one of THOSE games that tries to make a statement while feeling lazy about its own message).\nUsage of the human model...feels very lazy.\nThe label of "Horror" is mis-leading as it's very tame.\n\n\n\nSo....overall.   Do I recommend it?  Can't say I can or can't.  It feels like an unfinished product.  It's free on Steam and lacks achievements (kinda' don't want achievements for something like this).   I may suffer from depression, but at least I'm nowhere near as weird as the protagonist, so that makes me feel better about myself.\n\nIf I had to choose, though, I can't say it's worth recommending, but whether you pick it up or not is up to you.  It's a small "game" that takes about as long to finish as "The Plan" (5-10 minutes).   It leans more heavilly towards "bad" than "good" though.\n\nAlso?  I don't think the static can speak my name.  85% of people have a difficult time pronouncing it just by looking at it.\n\n1/10","August 16, 2015","false","0.6"," 39 of 73 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","39","73","0","11"

You get up and go about how every other person would, go to the bathroom, get breakfast, and so on. But within literally a minute or two, you are already curious about a few things you've noticed.\n\nWhy are there palm tree paintings everywhere? Why do I own shrimp? Why is there a book titled "Uganda and You: How A Genocide Might Affect Your Weekend"?\n\nUltimately this "game experience" makes you play out the average life of an abnormal person. He does things like you, clean the microwave, he sees if any of his friends are online. Seems normal, right? But then why does he have his windows boarded up? Why is there a note about how to arrange his books to look "casual" (something I'll admit I've done countless times)?\n\nThen you get objectives that get stranger, and the more and more you notice it changing, the darker it gets. And the more you realise how mentally unstable this man must be.\n\nThe game plays with dark themes of suicide and is something that leaves you thinking.\n\nIt's 10 minutes to play, it's far easier for you to play it then it is for me to discuss it without spoilers. It made me smile at times, it made me feel confused, and it left me feeling sympathetic. There isn't much more you could ask for from a 10 minute game "experience".\n\nI'm giving it Prawns out of 10.","August 11, 2015","true","0.3"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

And what a life it is.  At first things seem normal enough.  You wake up in your one bedroom dwelling in which you spend the entire, very short, game . Simple objectives given on the screen.  Go to the bathrooom.  Eat breakfast.  Normal stuff.  And then... some not so normal stuff.\n\nThe enviroment that seems so normal when you first start playing contains hints of how very sad and lonely this life you find yourself in really is.   The empty fridge, the state of the doors and windows,  the fact that apparently you consider a chat sex bot to be one of your best friends, the note you've written to your mom... It becomes clear that you are inhabiting someone whose life has gone very, very wrong.  And then... things get much worse.\n\nThere are no jump scares in this game.  No monsters hunt you.  No gunfire, magic spells, or ghosts.  And yet, it manages to be genuinely creepy and disturbing.  Give this one a pass if a graphic portrayal of depression, mental illness, murder, and suicide might be a trigger for your own burdens.  For everyone else,  I think it's worth checking how successful a very non-standard game can be so successful at what it clearly sets out to do.\n\nNo number rating because how the heck do you even start to quantify something like that in a game like this?","August 10, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is about obsessive behavior, and what caused it and stemmed from it. It's a short game, and even when you stop to inspect it piece by piece, it won't take you very long. If you're like me, and feel relatable to behaviors of the character, you'll do your best to linger and try to derive insight from it to use for yourself.\n\nIf you have the time to sit and ponder for two or less hours, you'll probably enjoy this game.

There's a lot of similiar art form like that, in which you've got to understand the one who made it, but this game just left me confused and without enough interest to understand it. In normal words, it just does poor job on what it tries to do, and also induce a slight pseudo-intellectual aftertaste. Though i liked the style (i'm really into eerie atmosphere), i can't say it's a good game, even while it being free. Games like that, which are called "artistic", should make you feel something, but i felt nothing. Maybe because i didn't even knew the character, so i couldn't feel anything for him. Maybe it's because i didn't knew his motives, or maybe because i couldn't see the message of the whole thing? Nevertheless, as i said, it didn't provided me with enough interest. And if the game just wanted you to think whatever you want to think of it, then that's just the cheapest form of expressing art (imo). It has something really good hidden within though.","August 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 33 of 63 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","33","63","4","8"

I've got to stay ahead of this thing. The powers that be just beneath the surface of the makings of reality as we know it have sent me a signal. I burned a bowl to chill out and watch mumblecore Keanu Reeves psycho-noir thriller A Scanner Darkly, you know, like you do to test your cognitive fortitude against a super trippy movie that’s obviously trying to make someone who’s surely on drugs in the room freak the ♥♥♥♥ out, feel the hot red eye of something staring in from the outer dark. Somehow I ended up I sitting down afterward to cut the buzz with a video game, but I was intercepted by a free title called the static speaks my name. I had to tune in.\n\nThe thing says that it’s a ten minute game. And you’ll see that my play time is some 2 hours. That is because I experienced, while entrenched in this whackadoo walking simulator fattened up for an epistemological feeding frenzy, what they call on the X-Files “lost time.” First off, my high self kept hitting the Escape key to try to pause the game, which makes you have to start the whole thing over. Moreover, my girlfriend, who herself has seen her friends die at the hands of drug culture in Southern California, was understandably feeling pretty bad about the somber end to a movie featuring Robert Downey Jr. circa 2006 (e.g., A Scanner Darkly, stay with me here), and was all the more enraged that I would freely admit (albeit in a facetious manner) to being okay to continue using marijuana, which is a narcotic that bears, if we're really generous and kind of bad at abstract thought, a passing resemblance to the fictional drug at the center of A Scanner Darkly, which is itself likened to “death growing from the earth.” She stormed to the bedroom and stormed back as I ponderously poked around in the imaginary apartment of a guy living a life that he’s on the verge of departing from that very same minute (this is the part where I review the game, here). She announced that she at some point had flushed all the weed down a toilet, soon thereafter taking the stance that I obviously cared more about the drug than I could ever care for her, given that I didn’t try to stop her from storming away.\n\nI doubted that was the case. I was just high. We made up in no time after our little screaming fit, in which I accused her of trying to script her own life, which is kind of hard and unfair thing to do around someone who’s not exactly, could we say, stomping around in the same cognitive mudpuddles as you.\n\nAs I said, we made up. She admitted that she hadn’t drowned the rest of the weed. That was a nice twist. I sat back down and took another large taste from my glasspiece, and went about settling the affairs in this video game I’d supposedly randomly found. Was its interactive experience, which can best be likened to privately performing a Hitchcockian stage play you conceived while you thought you were reduced to your most threadbare cognitive functions in a chemically-induced daydream where you discovered an ancient wisdom that to the outside observer appeared as nothing more than an impressionistic understanding of human psychology plays out in juicy, primary colors, influenced by the past hour’s experience? You bet. A Scanner Darkly? That too. But I think it was also influenced by a piece of performance art I found on Youtube a few hours prior, in which someone wearing a polyester suit designed to make their head the shape of a human’s ♥♥♥ flailed around on a stage, whooping and coughing up something that we are supposed to think is metaphorically feces.\n\nI have tricked my brainstem into thinking I’ve seen the edge of a world that often looks very flat in the two-dimensional lives we are able to accept as comfortable, and how we are all only the vicitims of a series of accidents, that we are each the casualty of something, and that the world does not follow the scripts we intend for it. Nor does love, nor discovery, whatever else you can think of. But yet we beat on, don’t we, beating off into the burning horizon. Interactive media can change your way of life, my man.\n\nSo, just use your life to make art as best you can. That’s it. You can’t make everyone, and possibly anyone, happy, but you can damn well design a video game that can at least imagine what it would be like to change the first line of Moby-♥♥♥♥ from “Call me Ishmael” to “Hey, gang, this is George Bailey in a technicolor dream coat, and I’m here to do a little rewiring of your emotional centers with a game about the end of a life that embarked somewhere it never felt it ever belonged.”\n\n10/10 let’s all write reviews that make the dev block our accounts","January 18","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you have people behind your bookshelf in a cage hooked up to a breaker so you can electrecute them to death? Then this is the game for you!\n\nIn this game you play as a person who's name escapes me at the moment, and it starts off as a sort of exploration game. You start off in a black "room" and all you see in front of you is a fuzzy misty thing. As you approach the thing it your screen gets black and you "wake up". "Today will be a better day" is all you see as your character wakes up. As you progress in the "game", you do random tasks around the house youre in. It starts getting abit unsettling once you realized that the windows are nailed shut and that there's a man in a cage somewhere. Anywho, after a bit of more exploration (and just keeping an eye out for shiz) you start to notice that the man in the cage is actually someone you kidnapped. After a while you also start to notice that said man is  rather depressed and is planning on taking his life.\n\nIn the end you "let your body rest", and... hear the dreadful sounds of a man gagging and gasping for air.\nAnd later dying\n\nPros:\n... i dunno man\n\nCons:\nbrb gonna kms\n\nThe Verdict: 7/10\nSuicide is a very touchy subject for me so this game got to me in such a way that I just...

It is indeed a very short game, and I found it interesting in a weird way. Some parts were kind of funny. I hated the shrimp eating part, that was terrible. I never discovered certain elements other users pointed out.\n\nIt doesn't have much replayability in my mind, but anyway. I'd say don't play this if you're really suicidal, but even then, not much in this game made me feel remotely that way. I wasn't even sad by it (except the shrimp). My friends watched me stream it and were laughing at parts. Anyway, it was a decent short free game but I feel like some read too deeply into it. I'm pretty sure I won't play it again since as far as I know, the ending is always the same. I wish there was more to it. The fact there isn't is probably what kept me so apathetic to it.\n\nI'd recommend this if you want a short psychological discovery game that has some very dark elements.","November 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each day I wake up and the itching starts inside, it itches so badly and is the reason I sleep for 48 hours at a time. I've boarded the windows to be sure they cant get to it, my precious research. This painting is the only thing that makes the itching stop, but it is starting to work less and less. I feel my legs start to get really hot, so i walk around my house a lot to make it go away. My shrimp like me too much to let me go, they tell me "don't do it" and I fall asleep. I open my eyes, "Today will be a better day". I feel my bladder getting pressured, I have to pee; no time for hand washing, no need either. The itching in my skull is starting again, I need to eat. There's still no food in the fridge, 2 more of my shrimp should do it, they are honored to be my sacrifice. I go online to chat with my friend again, because the itching has paused; I have 5 minutes. She rambles on about how she feels and i keep explaining to her the horrible things I have commited, she won't listen. I haven't finished the note to my mom still, I should get to it before the time comes, but that will have to wait, Jeffery is getting scared again. I shuffle over to the electrical box, it's got so many volts straight for him, I give it all to him, Jeffery can finally be happy. I go to my closet and open it up, my heart starts to itch, and it starts to burn again, it's time. I step onto the chair and my brain starts melting, my heart is freezing up; my whole life has led to this moment and I'm scared. I fall and I choke the black fades in and it hurts me. My whole life has led to this moment, my destiny, and im cold and scared, but I must remember that tomorrow, no.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amnaumen/recommended/387860/","amnaumen","Chodie Foster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amnaumen/","364 products in account","Recently there has been a lot of talk about what gaming can do to transcend it's boundaries. A key aspect that games have that other mediums such as movies and book is that we are controlling a character. Now it may be down a set line of events like this little gem is but that added feeling of controlling a character is a valuable tool in getting into the characters head. In this case the head of the character is depressed, I won't go into events that happened but having dealt with depression before and knowing what it feels like this game emulated those feelings to near perfection. To the point where I understood a bit more about what I was going through with the advantage of looking back from the outside at a happier point in my life. I fully suggest this game to everyone, especially those that deal with or know people that deal with depression.","January 4","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is indeed a very short game, and I found it interesting in a weird way. Some parts were kind of funny. I hated the shrimp eating part, that was terrible. I never discovered certain elements other users pointed out.\n\nIt doesn't have much replayability in my mind, but anyway. I'd say don't play this if you're really suicidal, but even then, not much in this game made me feel remotely that way. I wasn't even sad by it (except the shrimp). My friends watched me stream it and were laughing at parts. Anyway, it was a decent short free game but I feel like some read too deeply into it. I'm pretty sure I won't play it again since as far as I know, the ending is always the same. I wish there was more to it. The fact there isn't is probably what kept me so apathetic to it.\n\nI'd recommend this if you want a short psychological discovery game that has some very dark elements.","November 8, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was also done offline, hence why I have few hours posted according to Steam.\nthe static speaks my name is a highly simplistic title that presents a night in the life of Jacob, a thirty-one year old male whose fate is outlined before the player takes control of the individual. This title is very short in duration, but required a few playthroughs by myself to investigate the area more intricately. The game does well to retain an eerie feel while also not sacrificing sadistic messages throughout; the final objective is inevitable and known from the beginning. I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys short duration exploration-themed titles, and urge players to investigate the area thoroughly before completing said final objective.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

This was also done offline, hence why I have few hours posted according to Steam.\nthe static speaks my name is a highly simplistic title that presents a night in the life of Jacob, a thirty-one year old male whose fate is outlined before the player takes control of the individual. This title is very short in duration, but required a few playthroughs by myself to investigate the area more intricately. The game does well to retain an eerie feel while also not sacrificing sadistic messages throughout; the final objective is inevitable and known from the beginning. I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys short duration exploration-themed titles, and urge players to investigate the area thoroughly before completing said final objective.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

But having played it, I found it only works well on a surface level, in which talking about it is a million times more interesting than actually playing it.\n\nIt doesn't attempt to delve into any of the subject matters it claims it showcases. Mental illness is something that has a great deal of personal meaning to me as well, so the game really just felt like a slap in the face. It doesn't elaborate on anything, and doesn't give you any tools to elaborate on it by yourself either. For such a short game, I would imagine there'd be a very great opportunity for choice and aforementioned interactivity, but it's squandered entirely.\n\nOverall, it's psuedo-intellectual dribble. It feels like it was made in two days by a college student who had some sort of epiphany, and thought he was making "art".","February 5","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

BAM! the game ended. That's it! LOL!!!! Not worth it!\n\nNow, some people will say this game is a metaphor to life. When you least expect it ends, leaving more questions than answers and a melancholic feeling. If that was intentional, great. But in my oppinion it's ok for a game to CONTAIN a metaphor, but not BE a 5-minute metaphor with subpar graphics and gameplay.

I was so hyped up for this- i found out this was coming out 4 days before it did, and it looked just fantastic. What a dissapointing game. I played it twice, just to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. Yes, I do believe there are a few pretty decent and eye-opening realizations/messages, but overall, there was no GOOD message. Nothing was explained either, which is also dissapointing. A pile of TVs, THE picture everywhere, that door thats boarded up. I dont care if this game takes 10 minutes, is free, and isnt even 100 mb. Dont even bother with this game. If you want a good game that has the same click-and-move gameplay, try "Only If" (also free).

Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the "game" took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information I could. 10 minutes is not enough time to even brush the surface of one these mental illnesses, let alone all of them present. The most prominent one is obsession, in fact almost all of the game revolves around it. Yet all that the obsession lead to was the setup of the "game", it had nothing to do with even the ending of the "game". It really makes the whole experience seem like wasted potential. To top it off, the "ending" of the game facades as a continued look into these mental illnesses, but it's all a tease and simply ends in a slap to the face.\n\nI also ran into some technical issues which aren't really that big of a deal for a 10 minute "game", but they should be made known regardless. Firstly, the game stutters. Bad. I'm not talking about low FPS, I'm talking about the type of stutter you would see in a game such as Oblivion. I'm used to playing on a 144hz 120+FPS monitor and setup, so when something looks sluggish or stutters, it's abundantly noticeable and distracting to me. Some people may not even notice it, but if you're prone to being annoyed by the kind of thing, be aware that as of writing this it is present in the game. Secondly, and the worst offense in my opinion (albeit one that might happen to a very small group of people) is that the game has no option in the menu to set mouse sensitivity, and the default one is absurdly high. Even on the lowest dpi setting my mouse supports (400) moving the mouse just 1 inch resulted in performing a 360. Needless to say it got annoying quickly.\n\nI'm sure some people will find it to be an interesting experience (and many people do), but I didn't enjoy this "game" very much at all.","August 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

Half the story relies on shock factor. I was not shocked nor emotionally moved in any way by this. Maybe I'm desensitized, or maybe it was too simple to warrant a reaction out of me. As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things. In theory it is a cool idea. But the "game" took me 10 minutes to complete, and that is with reading and taking in every little bit of information I could. 10 minutes is not enough time to even brush the surface of one these mental illnesses, let alone all of them present. The most prominent one is obsession, in fact almost all of the game revolves around it. Yet all that the obsession lead to was the setup of the "game", it had nothing to do with even the ending of the "game". It really makes the whole experience seem like wasted potential. To top it off, the "ending" of the game facades as a continued look into these mental illnesses, but it's all a tease and simply ends in a slap to the face.\n\nI also ran into some technical issues which aren't really that big of a deal for a 10 minute "game", but they should be made known regardless. Firstly, the game stutters. Bad. I'm not talking about low FPS, I'm talking about the type of stutter you would see in a game such as Oblivion. I'm used to playing on a 144hz 120+FPS monitor and setup, so when something looks sluggish or stutters, it's abundantly noticeable and distracting to me. Some people may not even notice it, but if you're prone to being annoyed by the kind of thing, be aware that as of writing this it is present in the game. Secondly, and the worst offense in my opinion (albeit one that might happen to a very small group of people) is that the game has no option in the menu to set mouse sensitivity, and the default one is absurdly high. Even on the lowest dpi setting my mouse supports (400) moving the mouse just 1 inch resulted in performing a 360. Needless to say it got annoying quickly.\n\nI'm sure some people will find it to be an interesting experience (and many people do), but I didn't enjoy this "game" very much at all.","August 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

You control this person around the house, waking up, going to the bathroom, eating breakfast... really routinely stuff. However, the atmosphere is built to reflect the obsessive and depressive nature of your character, with idling TVs lying around, boarded up doors, darkness and even a noose by the laundry room. The developer really managed to make the ambient as dark and heavy as possible, and that goes along very well with what one can interpret on the plot. However, the game fails to earn my enthusiastic recommendation because it really feels like it barely scratched the surface of what could be done. The issue isn't even that it is short, but it is less interactive than it could be ideally, imo, and less profound. So, yes, it's a game focusing on an important theme and whatnot, but as it is I can't happily recommend it to everyone because of the feeling of lack I got after finishing it.","March 29","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm someone who played this game for, what, 6-7 minutes, did the objectives. The 'man in the cage' reminded me of a literary composition by an old writer who wrote a story about a tiger who was captured by a man, and in the end, was actually symbolism for men in society. THAT literary composition was deep. THIS, though, was not 'deep'. I understand that this game has potential on the level of heading to the 'orbs' or gas things in space, multiple suicides, but this needs more interactive content.

It's essentially a walking simulator that ends in a terrible way, and the player is left to wonder if there's anything they could have done diffferently. Unfortunately there isn't, except to exit the game before the character commits suicide. The game consists of the player waking in his room, sullenly walking around noticing especially odd furnishings around the house, eating a live shrimp from a tank, making a decision on whether to release an imprisoned man, and then hanging yourself. There's no dialogue involving the thought process that brought the character here, nor is there any type of suggestion as to how the character has come to this point. The game is laden with ambiguity, which is fine if there's a message behind it, but there's nothing for the player to ponder when they complete the game. It just ends, and that's that.\n\nI'm left to wonder if the developer set out to create a horror game, lost interest, and then slapped the suicide ending on just to complete the project.\n\nThis falls into a similar camp as 'Actual Sunlight' which I also don't recommend as it also is a game without a message. If I were to attempt to extract anything from either of the games it would that 'depression is terrible'. Obviously this is something that we can learn and understand from what we glean from those we've known who've suffered from it, or perpaps even ourselves (those who've experienced it themselves). I've yet to see a game deal with depression, its complicated nature, danger, and desperation with any kind of dignity or lesson to those on the outside of it. This game is an attempted artful representation of something that is already hard to understand and exricate yourself from, and does nothing for people who are already suffering from depression or the people who would want to play the game in order to understand depression further.\n\nNo recommendation whatsoever, there's nothing of value here.","March 24","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game will take less than 20 minutes to finish. You would think with those two very simple facts, this game would be a no-brainer to recommend, particularly since it promises a dept of emotion. At the length the game currently is, it simply does no such thing. It is far from optimized, pressing escape exits the game, walking is clunky which is problematic as walking and pressing E are all you do in the whole 15 minute experience. There is so much potential here, but absolutely none of it is worth investing any time into. You'll finish thinking you missed something important, but you didn't. That is just all there is.

You also leave alot of questions unanswered for example, who's are we playing as? Who was the guy in the cage? Why does the house have so many static tvs in his room?

I’m an artist at heart, judge me how you want to but that’s just how I’ve always been. In a world filled to an overflowing level with humans it’s easy to feel like your life doesn't matter. But regardless of whatever religious beliefs you have life is beautiful and I believe every person’s life has value. When I played this game I was sure it would be a horror game in fact most of it was spent waiting for the jumpscare.\nas I learned more about this guy I have to say I did kind of like him as odd as he was, I guess the part we're supposed to use to get some kind of meaning about this is the obsession with the painting and how he kidnaps the guy who made it, but I really have no idea what this is about, maybe there’s some kind of hidden meaning or I might get it at some later point in my life but right now all this game does is make you thirst for some artistic meaning in the whole thing yet it never quenches it.\nThis game is just... pretentious and random, this is even coming from someone who is artistic as ♥♥♥♥ but there’s really no method to the madness behind this game. You could say this game is about insanity if you want but that seems more like an excuse rather than a justification.

The atmosphere sucks you in and chokes you; no pun intended, the strange acts that the game has you perform really show that your control over the character is only an illusion allowing for some brilliant insight into the protagonist's mind as they fall into madness.

I’m an artist at heart, judge me how you want to but that’s just how I’ve always been. In a world filled to an overflowing level with humans it’s easy to feel like your life doesn't matter. But regardless of whatever religious beliefs you have life is beautiful and I believe every person’s life has value. When I played this game I was sure it would be a horror game in fact most of it was spent waiting for the jumpscare.\nas I learned more about this guy I have to say I did kind of like him as odd as he was, I guess the part we're supposed to use to get some kind of meaning about this is the obsession with the painting and how he kidnaps the guy who made it, but I really have no idea what this is about, maybe there’s some kind of hidden meaning or I might get it at some later point in my life but right now all this game does is make you thirst for some artistic meaning in the whole thing yet it never quenches it.\nThis game is just... pretentious and random, this is even coming from someone who is artistic as ♥♥♥♥ but there’s really no method to the madness behind this game. You could say this game is about insanity if you want but that seems more like an excuse rather than a justification. The game honestly just feels like a waste of time.\n","September 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It seems some people play it and have one take on it and other have a slightly different take. I really got the idea of the whole thing pretty early on, so I wasn't so easily awe-struck by it like someone people were. I honestly don't know, maybe those other people are just easily manipulated or just not as intuitive. A very intuitive person will be like OH YEAH, I already get it.\n\nA person who isn't as intuitive (not that that is bad) will probably get more out of the game, and then talk a bunch about it trying to figure out it's meaning. THAT'S OK, I think that's a good thing if they explore the concepts and everything further. The game deals with a serious subject, so it's not a bad thing to talk about the subject. The labeling this game a "horror" game, IN A WAY, given the subject matter and elements, I would defend this tag for the game. The game is extremely straight forward though.\n\nIf I had a very easy to use (for me, would have to be like copy/paste) game 3D engine and knew how to script titles/events, I could make something like this in my sleep. heheheh. But that's okay, I'm not saying this to bash the developers, rather, I commend them for keeping it simple, to the point, focusing much on the atmosphere. That's actually a sign of success.\nSome games might go into all sorts of detail and complex story-telling and all this and that, and some games are just very simple, but extremely, waaay more, effective than those complicated games.\n\nSo kudos for the developer, especially, that they get people talking about the game.\nThe biggest negative is that it's just very short. Like too short. Again, like 5-15 minutes.\nAlso, the Unity engine is portrayed very poorly here (we're talking very simple graphics but it's still sluggish, but that's just how the Unity engine always seems to be).\n\n\nI'd be interested to see what else the developer comes up with.\n\nOh, last couple of things:\n1) there are no jump scares, so don't worry about that. It's a very atmospheric game.\n\n2) People complained of issues with game having black-borders on the side, like in 4:3 mode but you can't change to wide-screen, so it cuts off the sides of the game and you can miss important stuff. Solution for me, was to up the resolution to something like 1600-something x 1000-something. That worked for me.","August 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I’m an artist at heart, judge me how you want to but that’s just how I’ve always been. In a world filled to an overflowing level with humans it’s easy to feel like your life doesn't matter. But regardless of whatever religious beliefs you have life is beautiful and I believe every person’s life has value. When I played this game I was sure it would be a horror game in fact most of it was spent waiting for the jumpscare.\nas I learned more about this guy I have to say I did kind of like him as odd as he was, I guess the part we're supposed to use to get some kind of meaning about this is the obsession with the painting and how he kidnaps the guy who made it, but I really have no idea what this is about, maybe there’s some kind of hidden meaning or I might get it at some later point in my life but right now all this game does is make you thirst for some artistic meaning in the whole thing yet it never quenches it.\nThis game is just... pretentious and random, this is even coming from someone who is artistic as ♥♥♥♥ but there’s really no method to the madness behind this game. You could say this game is about insanity if you want but that seems more like an excuse rather than a justification. The game honestly just feels like a waste of time.\n","September 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Is this even a game?\n\nTrigger Warning: If suicide/depression is a sensitive topic to you then you should not read this review and neither play this game. You have been warned.\n\nReview of the static speaks my name\nThe static speaks my name tells the story of a 31 year old man ending his own life. Normally, I would call that a spoiler but the static speaks my name is only 10 minutes long, at best. With very few images the game draws a disturbing picture of depression and loss.\n\nControls and graphics are the bare minimum needed to allow player interaction and storytelling. Considering the low graphical standard, the game is riddled with details, mostly in text form. From book titltes to the page of a manual the game has a lot of interesting clues to discover. Interesting in the frame of the game, as there are no big secrets you don't already know from beginning.\n\nAlso, this quote: "a women is like a teabag, you can't tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water". I concur.\n\n\nBut is it any good? Since it is not a game in the classical sense, let's just say it is an experience. A 10 minutes long, 64MB big experience.

It seems some people play it and have one take on it and other have a slightly different take. I really got the idea of the whole thing pretty early on, so I wasn't so easily awe-struck by it like someone people were. I honestly don't know, maybe those other people are just easily manipulated or just not as intuitive. A very intuitive person will be like OH YEAH, I already get it.\n\nA person who isn't as intuitive (not that that is bad) will probably get more out of the game, and then talk a bunch about it trying to figure out it's meaning. THAT'S OK, I think that's a good thing if they explore the concepts and everything further. The game deals with a serious subject, so it's not a bad thing to talk about the subject. The labeling this game a "horror" game, IN A WAY, given the subject matter and elements, I would defend this tag for the game. The game is extremely straight forward though.\n\nIf I had a very easy to use (for me, would have to be like copy/paste) game 3D engine and knew how to script titles/events, I could make something like this in my sleep. heheheh. But that's okay, I'm not saying this to bash the developers, rather, I commend them for keeping it simple, to the point, focusing much on the atmosphere. That's actually a sign of success.\nSome games might go into all sorts of detail and complex story-telling and all this and that, and some games are just very simple, but extremely, waaay more, effective than those complicated games.\n\nSo kudos for the developer, especially, that they get people talking about the game.\nThe biggest negative is that it's just very short. Like too short. Again, like 5-15 minutes.\nAlso, the Unity engine is portrayed very poorly here (we're talking very simple graphics but it's still sluggish, but that's just how the Unity engine always seems to be).\n\n\nI'd be interested to see what else the developer comes up with.\n\nOh, last couple of things:\n1) there are no jump scares, so don't worry about that. It's a very atmospheric game.\n\n2) People complained of issues with game having black-borders on the side, like in 4:3 mode but you can't change to wide-screen, so it cuts off the sides of the game and you can miss important stuff. Solution for me, was to up the resolution to something like 1600-something x 1000-something. That worked for me.","August 20, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's really just too short to be of any real lasting impact and all the ideas and concepts about serious depression, misery, loneliness and paranoia just don't develop because of the games shortness.\nIf this was a student project or a first step in some interactive experimentation then in this context it's really good and should encourage the people involved to do more and bigger projects, but otherwise it's only a good 10-30 minute mind funk trip and not really worth the time.","March 1","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For those looking to try it, it's a very short and disturbing experience.\n\nI think there's a lot of ways you could interpret the games content, but analyzing it makes me feel a little bit like the character in the game, trying to apply meaning to something that may or may not be meaningful. Perhaps what got to me the most was how much I related to the character who seems to be experiencing a substantial amount of pain and paranoia.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nI found the ending a bit disappointing, but maybe that says something about me as a person. At first I wandered all around the apartment after being given the last objective, looking for something else to do. Personally I feel that the game would have more impact if the player were able to repeat the few given objectives almost endlessly with only one real option for "progression". To me that would further cement the feeling of having only one way out in the players mind.\n\nAs is though, being forced to hang myself I found both disturbing and oddly cathartic, to the point where I found myself strangely eager to proceed into the other lives (I had the woman who jumps from her condo to be my next potential experience) and really disappointed to see credits rolling. Please don't take this as me seeing the game encouraging the idea of suicide, however. I see it more as demystifying it. Often I take out aggression, sadness, and other negative emotions by playing games that allow the player to do something you aren't able to really would never want to do in real life, so I think that having a game that allows you to flush out your own depression through the eyes of someone else could actually be kind of theraputic.","December 10, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The fact that it's free also prevents me from complaining about it, and that's cool. For the most part I subscribe to the "you can complain if you paid for it" school of thought. It's not bad at all, and I would play more from this developer, granted that whatever new content is either free or containing an appropriate amount of content for its presumed cost.\n\nWhat this game isn't however, is a profound, revolutionary take on mental illness.\nI have no idea why people are hyping this "game" up so hard. I see tons of comments stating "you don't get it, it's about depression".\n\nAs much as I miss being fourteen, I have to lay it out straight here: I do get it. You can read into the game as much as you'd like. Ten minutes of gameplay focused around a particular topic can set off a cascade of emotions and thoughts, that have very little to do with the game itself. Do you get a golden pass for making a game about a specific topic, whose execution has a good semblance to its real life incarnation? Not in my book.\n\nI do like the premise though, but it is really a bit too short for my taste, to be able to leave a mentionable impression. Again, this being free, no flak should be given to the developer here. It's cool that people are making free games that do not revolve around a paywall/pay to win model, even if (or perhaps "especially because"?) the game in question do not really fall into a camp where this kind of payment model would be expected anyway. However, its charming quirks aside, it's just too short to leave a lasting impression in my mind. It's basically like a trailer of a movie that might be good.\n\nSome people love written short-stories. Some people find them pretentious little turdnuggets of forced symbolism, or a form of art that is particularly insidious (or blessed) with relying more on the blanks that you fill in, than the actual work itself.\n\nI'm somewhere in between.\n\nCheck it out though, ♥♥♥♥'s free.","August 16, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If I had to choose a word to describe what I experinced it would be "indie" and I don't mean that in a good way. I mean that in a "this ♥♥♥♥ doesn't make any sense to anyone but the creator so why should I bother thinking about it" kind of way. It looks like there was a story here at one point. It must have vacated to another game. There are clues as to what is going on throughout the house though notes left out or newspaper clippings here and there for the player to read. Which still isn't enough to really get what is happening here and why you should care.\n\nThere are people claiming to have been surprised by the ending but I don't know how you could be because the description of the damn game gives the ending away. After all they even gave a TRIGGER WARNING so that the tumblr users amongst us don't cry themselves to sleep tonight. There is also a clue or two about how this is going to end when you explore the few rooms you can in the house. \\n\nA major issue I see with a lot of indie products is that their developers seem to believe telling less story is good. This is only partially true. If you are going to tell less of the story, then you need to SHOW the story. When you specifically claim that this game is more about story than it is gameplay, you are admitting that your game lives and dies on it's story. So you better make sure it is a damn good story. So I can only wonder what happened here. Did the devs just get tired on working on this pet project? I can't imagine they actually looked it over and thought to themselves "Yeah, man! This is exactly what I want my name to be tied to!". This wasn't worth my time nor is it worth yours.\n\nAlso the dude sits down when he pees.

It's also free, so there should be no concerns about value.\n\nThis small, atmospheric mystery focuses on the final moments of a man suffering from schizophrenia (despite what other reviewers have said about depression). The small apartment in which you are confined is littered with evidence of the character's obsessive search for hidden meaning in the mundane - just as the title says.\n\nComparisons to Gone Home are certainly valid. Both titles focus on atmosphere and mystery. Both feature a voiceless protagonist wandering a (seemingly) empty home. But where Gone Home tells a story, The Static Speaks My Name simply presents a premise, and ends as quickly and strangely as it began.\n\nThere are no options in the game, no way to invert the mouse or adjust video settings. The music is appropriately unsettling. The Unity art assets are bland and outdated. There is some creative spark underlying it all, but if you are just in it for an interesting experience, your ten minutes are probably better spent elsewhere.","August 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Calling it an, "artistic piece," is incredibly generous. Looking at the creator's Twitter you can tell the guy had some issues he clearly needed (during the production of this thing) help with. I don't see a message here. It's a game that was never completed and doesn't look as though it's going to ever be completed based on watching people (from what we can assume with what we have) kill themselves. Why?\n\nWhat sort of sadism is that coming from? I really struggle with these indie "games" trying to deal with mature themes when the people attempting to deal with them are not mature in dealing with them, like this one. I don't understand what this "game" is meant to portray. It looks like an obsession from the mind of a disturbed man revolving around suicide - either watching other people doing the deed or fantasizing about ways to do the deed himself. Especially as one who has undergone treatment and therapy for serious depression; I get the sense this game is either trying to sympathize with us or attempting to disturb for the sake of disturbing others by caricaturing serious tones it clearly isn't willing to address from any angle.\n\nI can't recommend this to anyone. Free or not, it isn't worth the time. The only sense this game can be described as unforgettable is the sense of being terribly confusing. I struggled to find meaning in it's attempt to potray what appeared to be a psycosis, and unlike games that are meant to be surreal and tell interesting stories - you don't get the sense of any completion when you suffer through watching our character's demise because it lacks meaning. Sufferage without meaning demeans the very essense of dealing with depressive, psychotic, and suicidal tones.","May 5","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game is quick, not even ten minutes so play it before you read.\n\nThis game feels like a bit of a let down. People had been playing it up as some sort of profound or especially disturbing videogame. What I got something that had the potential to be interesting and unsettling, only for it to sort of just end with a meh. It didn't come off as particularly depressing either. While the character might have been depressed, it didn't really touch very deeply on the subject matter. Hell, I felt more upset over the pet shrimp than the artist or hanging. Both the shrimp, and the IM's were the only things that really touched on genuine loneliness, and the shrimp were ruined by the idea that he just goes "Oh well, no more left overs. TO THE EMERGENCY FOOD SUPPLY!"\n\nWasted potential on a subject that tends to be shyed away from in videogames in general. Can't say that I would really recommend it.

But I wanted to highlight some of my reactions below:\n\n*SPOILERS BELOW*\n-In my first play, I elected 'electrocute the man in the cage', not having any idea what was going on and assuming that the man in the cage was metaphorical. I discovered the hidden room, and the (admittedly still metaphorical) man a minute later. Ensue my cursing like a sailor to realize that I'd killed him when I could have set him free\n-The way the game manipulates choice is well thought-out. When I first saw the noose, and the option came on-screen to hang myself, I found myself saying, "No, this isn't it. There has to be another objective...there has to be another way." I found myself cursing again as I started to realize there wasn't.\n\nIf such a simple, low-budget project can create such memorable moments as this, just imagine what we could accomplish if we explore these avenues.","November 9, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
