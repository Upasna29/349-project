I'll start talking about this fantastic old game....which not every mind can evidently sustain.\n\nThis is a labirinth game. it is designed to make you lose your way, confuse and upset you. As every labirinth ever constructed (and deserving the name) every corridor appears the same with few changings (mostly traps).\nThis is the goal of the game....NOT LETTING YOU OUT! so why should it help you?\nNo, you're going to try and navigate this infinite dedalus, dodging traps and collecting utilities along the way, until you can find the solution for the riddles behind every door you'll find (or die trying, which is funny in itself! never laughed as much with any other game over).\nNaturally is an old game, and pixels dominates everything....wait, what are you saying? 2014 was the year of pixel art? how STRANGE. (graphics = useless) at least for this game type, go take a look (and play) "Papers, please" for instance: pixel art at it's best, a new game, fun and challenging. Only difference with Litil Divil, that is NEW, this is OLD.\nObviously is and old labirinth game, so if you're looking for action, explosions, people screaming and nudes, turn around and don't come back. please.\n\nAll the reviews complaining about the controller support, about how this game is too difficult or "too old to be fun (wut?)"\nEven about how there's NOTHING to help you along the way.\nAnd i almost died laughing. Let me explain why:\n\nSeriously, this game is OLD. Ever since the OS (every OS) evolved, thus leaving this (as another hundreds of games) behind, i've wanted to play it again. Now some gentleman decided to use DOSBox to convey it on steam. Well, i say CHEERS, thankyou!\n\nNow, the reasons behind my perplexity:\n\n1) MONEY - Awww poor you, 10€ for a challenging retrogame is too much! better spend 2€ on candy crush, yeah? ......or 50something on COD for that matter right? shoot shoot shoot.\n\n2) HELP - Seriously? where did the real gamers go? OMG no weak glowing spot to shoot/click/aim/look at, we're DOOMED! finish this game you explosions addicted braindeads, i dare you.\n\n3) CONTROLLER - and so you played on amiga, fine! last time i checked the controller doesn't make the game....so use your damned keyboard, spoiled brats!\n\n\nThis game is funny, relaxing and challenging....at least until you undersand it. but you need to try, that's all.\n\nPeace.\n","November 9, 2014","true","1.0"," 213 of 255 people (84%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","84","213","255","39","16"

I've played games from 1962 to modern games, but sadly, I couldn't really enjoy this title. Overall, I felt, the controls were very clunky, it doesn't give you any kind of information at all, except for the intro video (Not even what the controls are).

Although the animations/framerate may be considered less than ideal by modern standards, I find that it has aged reasonably well. It's a nice little old-school blend of various puzzle/action/platform minigames tied together by increasingly complicated trap-filled labyrinth levels. The game has a lot of humor and charm, while being reasonably difficult (whether it's for the right reasons or not is debatable.

The game was clearly emulated from an older time so I’m sure the full color manual that was sold with the original game really filled in the blanks, but as a standalone title it feels like all there are are blanks.\n\nIt took me almost 2 minutes to figure out how to get the game to begin once I was at the start screen. I still am not entirely sure which key actually did it. Once dropped into the game I quickly figured out the arrow keys move.. easy enough. I walked 3 steps forward to be assaulted by a troll. Okay back up and figure out how to attack. I proceeded to press every key on the keyboard to no avail. Another 4 or 5 minutes later I realize that you actually have to press right, while against an enemy and then press the ‘X’ key. I don’t think it could have been more unintuitive. Regardless I pressed onwards to be dropped into a old school type dungeon crawler, a revelation that had me rather excited. After figuring out how to enter rooms (forward and ‘Z’ clearly, because thats the obvious go-to for object interaction) I poked my head into a few and each time was presented with a wild scene with no clear objective and no idea how to interact with the world to even be able to begin some trial and error.\n\nDeep down I believe that Litil Divil may be a fun little game, but it’s torn down by the fact that digital delivery platforms don’t account for the original way to introduce players to a game world: manuals. Good Old Games does an awesome job of this by providing PDF downloads of said manuals. If Steam wants to keep pushing out ports of old DOS era titles (which it absolutely should) there needs to be a system in place for users to have clear and easy access to the media that was expected to be provided along with the game itself.","March 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

This was a fav of mine back in the Amiga days so why release a classic in less than its original state?  I can let the graphics not being updated but the controller support...  well...  It sucks.  I think I saw mention from another reviewer on this issue.  Sure I could use the keyboard but I want to use my controller just like I did when I played it all those years ago.  The problem is I am running a Windows 7 system and whoever released this did so by using the floppy disc PC version released after the Amiga version and use DOSBOX emulator to try and pull this off with minimal effort on their part.  I feel like the Amiga CD32 version had some issues but I played it pretty far using a controller.  I then bought the PC version a few years later.  Then this is released on Steam and by now everything must be working if not improved because decades have passed.  Not.   Would have loved to say thumbs up and worth the memory.  Nice try.   I just think its clear that the fans would be the first do come and check it out and...  Well...

I literally had to give all the money I had to get through, and more! Then, when I got through, the final task was to give up the three really random items I picked up (a flashlight, an anvil, and a big gem) to get past 3 statues which I assume might have killed me if I didn't have them with me.\n\nI experienced an incredible wave of relief getting past it all.\nThen Level 2 began....\n\nThis wasn't the worst part of my gameplay. The absolute worst was navigating through the wordless interface of the Menu screen. What I thought was the icon for saving (it had the diskette icon on it, everyone knows that means save, right?!) was actually the Load icon. I ended up back in the first dungeon right after the toll. And for some reason all my items were gone, which meant I needed to go back through the entire dungeon to find them again. I spent an hour today on this, and I would say that I've spent an hour too long on this.\n\nAnd yet, I would recommend this game, if only to keep the review score within the status quo, so that any poor, hapless soul who doesn't read the reviews might buy this merely because the scores were okay. Because I would like to think that one day in the future, when I look back at this game, I can say that some poor, hapless soul suffered as much as I did. And that will put me at ease.","March 1, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not that there is a whole lot to get, but mostly in this day and age Developers need to give each one of their titles the respect they deserve... when asking ten whole dollars up front.\n\nLitil Divil, has been neglected, and it shows in the response that the community has had on Steam toward this game. It's beyond rough,  it is sad.\n\nPros  Nice classic animations and sounds\nModerately stable build of DOSBox, Alt+Tabbing out of game works properly\nMultiple gameplay elements all strewn together that function properly, even if they lack explanation\nCons  The introduction movie was not included in the game\nThere is a lack of menus in game unless you wish to Save (Which resets current progress and gold in the area, and only keeps your map data) or Exit.\nHigher resolution options are absent, unlike other Gremlin Games released for DOS which have added resolution options\nThe game manual that can be accessed through the Library tab in Steam is short, skimpy, and lacks detailed information about major aspects of the game (Such as the shop, object descriptions, and hints)\n\nAt a $10 price point you are asking a lot for a game that runs through a DOS Emulator, not that DOSBox is a terrible emulator, but it just goes to show how much they are asking for a product that hasn't been touched or altered one bit since its initial release. Gremlin Interactive was a group of very talented individuals who understood how to cram so much personality into a game it was astounding, but so see KISS/Funbox Ltd. simply throw this ancient game onto Steam and ask full price without updating it or giving any support is unacceptable.\n\nIts a shame, really. I am a big fan of Realms of the Haunting (Another game by Gremlin), even though it was the community who released updated controls to make it fully playable on all systems. This game, is asking WAY TOO MUCH for WAY TOO LITTLE .\n\nI wont trash on the bad gameplay because its obvious through other reviews how dated it is, but my real complaints mainly deal with the asking price compared to product worth.\n\n0/10  IF the asking price for this was around 99cents, I can understand a bit of justification of the price. I recieved this game for free online, as most people did. I would have NEVER paid anything over 99 cents for this game. Period.","October 15, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
