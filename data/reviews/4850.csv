Been playing this for over 10 years with a friend and we're still impressed by it.\n\n-The game has an excellent balance between different unit types.\n-The nations are varied enough to keep it enjoyable for a long time.

Battles of 1000+ vs 1000+ (and way way bigger) are possible if you so desire, easy system to make your soldiers in to "squads" so managing those 1000+ soldiers is not very hard\n\nActually has LARGE maps. Compared to, for example, AoE III, their "large" map is small compared to cossacks very large.\n\nI have not played the campaign very much but from what I have, it seems pretty solid and challenging.\n\nHas map editor that's pretty easy to use!\n\n\nAlso one cool thing I must add is how every single unit you have, be thousands or more keep their own record for their kills. You can see every single soldiers amount of kills separately, pretty cool. You can also see cannons and towers amount of kills.","June 21, 2015","true","38.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisawarcrime/recommended/4850/","thisisawarcrime","Mr.WarCrimes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisawarcrime/","85 products in account","Here's my review for Cossacks, I'll go for the negatives first which are few.\n- I've recently got into the game just a while back, I can understand why it eventually became overshadowed by other RTS strategies like Age of Empire (AoE). It is not exactly a classic that can meet to todays options.\n- There is a huge learning curve, the tutorials are extremely hard to understand working on a story line based script that throws you essentially into a game with some start up bonuses (note I did the one trying to understand military movements and got wrecked in the tutorial in minutes).\n- Controls are more rugged than modern strategies understandably and this can be a deterrent if you're not willing to put the time into play it.\n- Unlike franchises like Civilization and other games with Strategic Alliance emphasis there is no Diplomacy, its either 2v2s, 3v3s 4v4s or FFA. Don't expect the AI to give out on you if you make a blunder or get annihilated by them (don't expect if from strangers on Multi-player) they will continue to destroy you until you lose or rage *note, I did the first couple of games, which I normally don't do*.\n- Understandably, Multiplayer is no where near as large as other strategy games, I haven't played multi enough to judge is characteristics of its gamers' virtues.\n\nNow the positives of the game which to me outweigh its slight love obstacles.\n- Simplistic design does not mean you have to over analysis, there is one goal, kill everyone else.\n- Game runs on a simple quasi-rock/paper/scissors game mixed with a tacticians prowess and unit leadership.\n- With friends you can build massive empires and role-play the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game, only with friends and Multiplayer.\n- Remarkable graphics (for its time) that can arguably stand up to this day.\n- Replaybility and saving in the midst of battles are nice, as well as restarting a game with the same map or different starting armies.\n- You can choose between historic powers of the 1600s and 1700s, like France, Britian, Turkey, Bavaria, Prussia, Saxony, Russia, Netherlands, Venice, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Poland and others!\n-Up to 8 players in a match with great challenging AI, even at Easy.\n- Its a cheap affordable game which should work on any computer *note I'm running this on a Windows 8, not Win 8.1 with 4th Gen i3 and 4 GB of RAM*\n-Its a game that if you are familiar with the Total War Series should remind you of an arcadey version of Empire Total War, *note without turn base, diplomacy or agents, and the fact that this game is more 2d than Empire*.\n\nI would say this is a must buy if you have the patience, heart and  tolerance to get be humbled by the good AI system or a Human player, its cheap and fun. Also I haven't tried any of the 'DLC' or Expansion Packs as they were known back then. I hope this helps you make your decision ultimately, I wish you best of luck on the battlefield if you get the game.","March 21, 2014","true","12.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It has all the usual features that RTS games of that time tended to have.. and more!\n\nHere are some features that make this game especially awesome and which many contemporaries lack (e.g. AoE, Warcraft, C&C):\n\n- automatic infinite production loops of units (so you don't click yourself to death trying to constantly refill the ranks of your troops)\n- armies CAN get huge (easily over 1,000+ per player) and WILL get huge (due to the ease of producing lots of units)\n- more realism: your swordfighters won't be able to hit a building with melee weapons magically setting it on fire and eventually destroying it, instead, most buildings can be captured, and buildings can be destroyed only using artillery or certain specific unit types (standard settings)\n- very flexible game speed (single player only): you can play it really slow to follow every single move your units make, useful when building up a base, or insanely fast to the point where you'll have trouble keeping up with understanding whats going on during a battle","December 1, 2015","true","17.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This is the best in the Cossacks series and the only one you need. Each nation is matched as they would be in the 1600 to 1700s. So late is better to go with a strong nation from that time. So not the middle eastern countries, but they are very stronge in the early part of the game. It is Napolionic fighting and is very addictive. This is very recommened to anyone who like RTS's.

You control squads of 196 men (At least I do).  That is a lot for a game like age of the empires.  A comparable game series would be Stronghold.  I checked, and the global unit cap is none.  WOW.  So yeah, feel free to use your math to figure out how many is too many and crashes the computer.\n\nI also must mention the imperium mod here.  I adds the 19th century, and balances a few things.  Of note is that there is diplomacy, and other things.\n\nAlso, the upgrade system is pretty extensive.  You will NEVER research everything.

Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.\nPour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar.

Can be really fun with a bunch of friends and some mods installed.","October 5, 2013","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The AI can't deal with peace time though.\n\nI would only recommend this game for single player, as multiplayer can be a pain in the butt.

It was the late 90's. Gaming hadn't quite devloped into the modern behemoth that it is today and adventuresome games were as common as dragons in Skyrim - not everywhere, but you knew for certain they did exist.\n\nCossacks is a base-building, tech-researching RTS that has a world of charm despite being rough around the edges. Set bewteen the 16th and 18th centuries in Europe, Cossacks: European Wars and Cossacks: Back to War (the standalone expansion) cover roughly twenty nations from Poland to Portugal, from Algeria to Ukraine - and just about everything inbetween.\n\nBattles are fought with ranged and melee infantry and cavalry, as well as land-based artillery and naval units. The number of units the game can display on screen at any one time is in the thousands, as I recall. Enough so that an army can look like a literal blood-stain seeping across the map.\n\nResources aren't just for purchasing units, but are also required for upkeep. What this means is: run out of coal and you run out of gunpowder. Run out of gold and your units can mutiny. Run out of gold after you've built a ship-of-the-line and you'll have a mutinous unit on the order of a Renaissance "Death Star" gone rogue.\n\nWhile this might sound like it requires a great deal of micromanagement, it's actually fairly easy to keep track of - just monitor your resource counters at the top of the screen. If one starts to drop, start some research or throw some more peasants at it. If your food drops below zero, your units will begin to starve.\n\nSome other great concepts found in the Cossacks series: Peacetime in multiplayer. Essentially, you can agree to a set amount of Peacetime - a period where you cannot make aggressive moves. Well, you can, but your units will die when they cross the peacetime borders. This allows for the construction of intricate defenses and massed strategic-level armies.\n\nAnother favorite feature of mine and often copied by other games is the right-click-drag to change facing. I can't swear that Cossacks is the first series to use this feature, but it definitely was the first one that I'd played.\n\nThe game's default speed is incredibly fast on modern computers, but it can be slowed down to suit your needs - or sped up if you feel you've really just had way too much caffeine today.\n\nAll in all a stellar example of base-building RTS. Limited scope and limited marketing kept the game from the rightful place it deserves among the genre, but the game is far more than worth it.\n\nDownsides? Don't expect much in the way of tutorial. You'll also need to really read through the Academy (the main research structure) as well as the Blacksmith and other structures to find all the tech and research upgrades. If you don't mind all of that, you'll find a true diamond in the rough.","September 24, 2014","true","36.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chinese start out with more peasants and have a better economy regulation, while Ukraine excels at firearms and cavalry, but lacks any cold steel infantry. So playing a different nation every time will give you a totally different feel. Sound effects are top notch in this game, ranging from atmospheric distant and close cannon fire, to nature sounds, to soldiers dying on a battlefield. There are a ton of factors that make this game superb so I won't bother mentioning them all. One last and important aspect that I will mention is the ability to literally control THOUSANDS of units at once. Imagine Age of Empires roids.

Worked first time though the second time I tried to play it I had to set the game mode in Windows as per the help instructions on Steam. Been perfect since then.\n\nIt's just as good as ever. Just had a massive war with over 40,000 casualties. Horrific scenes, but that's the game of Cossacks. I was playing a random map against AI on hard and they still did some silly things and missed obvious opportunities (like the enemy ships did not attack my buildings) so the AI is not perfect but the game play is still fun and challenging and does not look too dates, apart from perhaps the menu screens.","April 19","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
