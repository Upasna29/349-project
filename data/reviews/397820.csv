This game is only lacking in-game content that can be fixed with DLCs! Game and toning system works perfectly fine, you can have lots of competitive fun with your friend by just plugging in another mic. Overpriced? No, $22.49 for a finished product, with 35 songs and a few different modes, and from what I can tell it is bug free. It is a basic concept, you sing you get points.","January 24","true","0.7"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/397820/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","It’s never easy to bounce back after you’ve screwed up. I’ve been there. Screwed up as badly as some people can ever screw up and get a second opportunity. Voxler Games screwed up last year with the first Steam release of Let’s Sing. For a long time the game was sitting with a negative user review status. It’s only been in the past few months that some kind souls have raised it to mixed but it still has less than a 50% positive-negative review percentage. So somewhat bravely they returned with the 2016 edition of their music game that remains popular on consoles. It appears that the developer put a lot of effort into listening to their player base over the past twelve months because the new release is a vastly superior product than the original. That’s a great thing for fans of music on a platform that is dying out for quality games in the genre.\n\nThe first thing that I did when I loaded up Let’s Sing 2016 wasn’t actually sing any of the songs. No, I wanted to ensure that the jukebox mode worked properly and I really wanted the easiest achievement in the game out of the way early. That achievement is of course the ‘insert a token’ achievement. All you need to do is to listen to ten songs in a row while in jukebox mode. Between an occasional click between working it was a nice change. That leads me to the first issue that I have with the game but it’s an understandable one. Last year’s version of Let’s Sing did not have any downloadable content – good grief if the devs catch up on that one they might make as many songs available as Rocksmith – and it appears that may be the case once again this year. So what is the issue you may ask? It’s that the game is perhaps too centered on pop songs. You’re not going to find anything too alternative in the track list (you can see the entire track list below in the Steam Description). This immediately narrows the audience for the game as much as it attempts to broaden it. It’s clear that Voxler Games have gone for the whole not appealing to everyone so appeal to the popular group as much as possible strategy.\n\nAlthough I’ve been in a couple of bands and groups before – only very small groups that never went anywhere – I’m not a good singer at all. I’m much better than I was when I was younger and my partner seems to think that when I know a song and it’s in my alley that I can sing I really find it embarrassing to share my voice. It’d be a train wreck and I’d look like Gary Brolsma only there’d be a hideous sound instead of lip syncing. I think the game picks up on that as I’m not very good and show no signs of improvement. When it comes to elimination songs I quickly lose out. However, I do believe that the voice recognition software works as it should. I’ve seen people reporting that it’s broken for them so it may depend greatly on the quality of your microphone as well as your ability to hit the right notes. I believe that this is important as you need to look past the price of the game if you’re going to play it and at the price of a good quality microphone if you don’t have one. Both my Logitech webcam and my headset, I currently use a Kingston HyperX Cloud II, work consistently well.\n\nVoxler Games can be proud of the effort they’ve made since last release. It’s a worthy purchase this year – if you have or can get a quality microphone – but I’m really excited to see next year’s edition. If the studio can make a similar improvement next year’s edition has the potential to be one of the best singing (not necessarily music as a general genre) games ever made.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","February 3","true","5.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Good acually! Im quite impressed with the voice recognition software. You dont expect a guy with a base voice to sing "Let it go" and "Lorde - Pure Heroine" the last one I even managed to pull of in some crazy russian dialect. (im not russian) :)\n\nMicrophones: Its important to have a mic that takes in alot of your voice. Ive tested this with some different settings and microphones. A real studio mic plugged into the pc was the worst because the pc didnt couldnt probably give it enugh power to function properly. Best of is a mic made for pc use as they dont requier so much power to run. Also a mic that has some kind of padding on it or is strong enugh to be used as a real mic, because otherwise you will be hearing your every breath like darth vader. :)\n\nLiked this game 100 times more then the playstations singstar because that just is crappy when it comes to guys trying to sing it.

While there are issues, most of them are fairly easy to overlook as it plays so well when you get into it. PC players must also consider there peripherals too as while the game is perfectly playable on a cheap mic, you will have a better experience with something a little more high quality, though this would be the case with any game of this style. But if you like karaoke style games, this is a good one and one that will no doubt be seeing a lot more play in this house.","February 3","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I so wanted this to be good. People shoot down singing games all the time for various reasons but I'm assuming the main one is they hate fun. But I am a fun guy. So I like them.\n\nI do not like this.\n\nThe song selection is fine, a little poppy but it's to be expected. That's what's OK about this game. Now onto the negatives. (tl;dr at bottom)\n\n- Inconsistant and sporadic mic support. It really is a lottery which mic will work even adequately with this game. £120 Logitec G35 mic? Awful. Cheap webcam mic? Not great but better. But perhaps this is an issue with expensive headsets and noise-cancelling so I'll excuse it. The mics that seem to work best (though not to an acceptable level) are Singstar USB mics. Which brings me to my next 2 issues;\n\n- The devs don't know their own game. On the support thread they said Singstar mics aren't compatible with this game. To which numerous people have replied that Singstar mics are fine. Like I said, they're the lesser of many evils. Not too much of an issue but doesn't instill me with confidence.\n\n- The game doesn't handle low octaves well. Ok so you've got your mics up and running and you're ready to start. Oh one more thing. Are you male with a normal male singing register? Oh you are? GG, find another game. The beauty of Singstar is you can change octave and the game rolls with it no bother. SIng in a lower octave than the singer on the track, sing in a higher one, it's not an issue. With Let's Sing, with the same mics it is a different story. Despite singing at the same volume as when you sing higher notes, be forced into a pitch too low and the game just won't pick it up. Perhaps this means I'm not the game's target audience, I don't know. But considering the game's music is mostly comprised of female vocalists and male tenors like Sam Smith and James Blunt I guess I'm ♥♥♥♥ out of luck anyway. Now for the most bizzarre problem;\n\n- The music videos appear UPSIDE-DOWN. That's right. Not even the whole screen. It can't be an issue my end as the interface appears the correct way up through the song. The lyrics, the bars to hit, all fine. But every single music video has been flipped upside-down. I know I'm not the only one with this issue as I have seen others post their screenshots on the Community Hub.\n\n- Price. I really hate it when people moan about game prices. You choose to pay it or you don't, that's your call as the consumer. What I'M referring to when I say price is it's priced at £18.99 without the introductory discount. If you're going to charge serious game prices, make sure you're serious about your game. This is just a broken mess.\n\nSo in conclusion.....\n\ntl;dr: Devs have released a buggy game that they don't know anything about. Avoid, especially if you're male. If not avoid it anyway, it's not good at all.","January 27","false","0.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","8","15","3","2"

I was unable to find a configuration that made it accurately score performance.\n\nThe first configuration I tried was to use Logitech wired USB microphone that I had used for Rock Band and put the sound output through my LED TV in game mode.  This produced seemingly sort of ok results, but I decided to test the setup.  I chose some songs with decent range in pitch and just made a constant tone into the microphone.  It scored me pretty well and showed my pitch going up, down, and all over the place.  The variation was despite me just producing a monotone sound.  When I tried singing along, the feedback is often very delayed such that it is hard to use the feedback.  The feedback for singing along and for just producing a completely monotone sound were hard to even distinguish visually.  I'm not a great singer, but I'm not nearly as bad as a monotone sound.\n\nThe second configuration I tried was to use a wireless headset.  I used a Logitech G930 headset which is a wireless headset which is designed to keep latency down.  My theory was maybe the scoring would be better if I removed the sound from the TV getting to the microphone.  The scoring was much, much better in this configuration.  I could see the effect of changing my pitch on the scoring, although it was still very delayed.  The feedback was very hard to do anything with though.  All I could really get out of it was on pitch, off pitch, or so far off it didn't recognize it as an attempt.  It at least didn't score a monotone sound highly.  The feedback was still very delayed a lot of the time.  The feedback seemed to be several words behind a fair amount of the time.  I found the feedback to be almost, but not quite useless.  This was a small improvement over the first configuration.  Another killer problem in this mode is that there is basically no feedback from the microphone to the speakers.  It is really hard to sing when you can't hear yourself (at least for me).  I also tried a variation of this where I had 1 ear pad off on the headset so I could hear myself.  This was the best configuration for me as I could hear the music in 1 ear and hear myself in the other.  It is sad that the game reduced me to this level to try to save it.  Even with this, the feedback wasn't good enough to make me ever want to play the game again.  I feel like I get better feedback just by listening to myself as I sing along to things.\n\nBeyond failing at its primary function of providing feedback on your singing, the game has a bunch of other limitations.  I don't consider these other limitations to be game killers, but they do make the game feel like an alpha release.  The only imnput to the game is keyboard and it only uses 7 keys (4 arrows, enter, space, escape).  This is a very clunky interface for a PC.  It does map extremely well to a steam controller however, so once I set up the input mapping and used the controller it was pretty good.  There are very few options or controls inside the game.  You can switch which microphone you are using in the game, but sound output is controlled by Windows.  I also didn't see any volume controls inside the game.  At one point I had my headset USB dongle plugged in with the headset off and the USB mic plugged in.  This made the game switch to the duet display even though the headset was turned off and I was playing in what would normally be the single player mode.  It didn't seem to let me select how many players I wanted just assuming that number of players = number of mics.  The controls in the game are basically limited to select song, quit, and select from a few different game modes which are pretty similar.","May 13","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
