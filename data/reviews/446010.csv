First of all, I it seems that the game isn't really a game so much as an exploration of new concept in city builders. Also as of this writing it is version 0.8, so it's not really finished. So with that in mind, I hope that I can write a fair and honest review here.\n\nAs a concept, the game is very, very interesting. It allows you customize every building in the city. Most city builders have buildings that are made by the art team and have a single function. One problem with that approach is repetition. CitiesCorp avoids that allowing the player to decide how a building looks, what size and shape it is, and what functions it serves. Yep, Functions. You can have mixed use buildings. CitiesCorp is very buggy still, but I think it succeds in it's primary purpose of exploring a new concept for the genre.\n\nIs it better than Cities Skylines? No. Not even close. It does one thing well and pretty much is missing everything else that city builders have, but it is important to remember that the developer has said that was intentional. The purpose of this game is to highlight a single new concept and not to reinvent the wheel.\n\nDo I recommend this game? If you love city builders and city simulators and can tolerate the bugginess, then yes. In time CitiesCorp could bring new ideas into the genre and as fans of the genre we should support projects like this.\n\nIf you are new to the genre or want a polished city builder, I would go wait.\n","April 30","true","8.3"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","44","47","0","0"
