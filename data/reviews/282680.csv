I really have enjoyed the game so far. It is a good and easy to play turn based strategy tactical game, wargame style, where positioning your troops and choosing the attack order is important. This game can be described as a colorful ancient china version of Panzer General (more or less). It has a good tactic points system  that rewards you with points for playing tactically (attacking from higher ground, flanking enemy units, being in guard position when attacked...). These points can be used to activate different special abilities your units have and to refresh your damaged troops. The graphics are nice with some great details, like the arrows that show the planned movement of your troops, that look like painted with an ink brush. Nice music, too.\nI miss some ingame information about the effects of the different types of terrain, and it would be nice if the units gained experience during battles besides the tactics points.\nLooks promising.\n\nEDIT: A hotseat two player mode has been added to the game. There are three maps (small, medium and large) and each player can spend deployment points to buy troops before  battle.","October 8, 2014","true","5.1"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","40","41","0","0"

In my opinion they have a good basis, but there's not enough content to keep you interested for more than 2 or 3 hours.\n\nWhat we have at the moment is a pretty easy game with few tactical elements, you choose your units at the start of a mission, you move them on hexagons and try to get rid of the enemy, and this is pretty much it. The missions are independent one of the other and they all offer the same things to do, no RPG elements, no persistent units, and the placement is not really important vs the AI, or is, most of the time, pretty obvious, warriors first line, archers back line. You have to manage a 'tactical' gauge (do good actions) in order to use the special power of your units, but you'll probably only use the self heal most of the time. This reminds me a little the combats in AoW 3, but simplified and easier. The game is visually good and there's a nice background. The choices they'll take in the next weeks will be determinant for the future of the game.\n\nAt the moment, the game is boring after a few hours because it's too easy and not really engaging, even repetitive, but they really have something with the potential to become a good game. They also release regular updates. And for these reasons, the game deserves to be followed if you are into tactical games.","November 4, 2014","true","8.5"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

Something that doesn't happen very often for me sadly.\n+Polished for an Pre-release game.\n+Great battle mechanics\n+Intuitive: At least for an avid Civ5 gamer\n+Nice UI: Part of the reason it felt very polished\n+Feedback/bug report on main-menu and built into the game.\n\nPre-release mentions:\n-Transition between turns felt a bit sluggish. This I'm sure will be remedied eventually and it doesn't really cause any grief other than my screen occasionally jumping to a random place on the map (due to border-scrolling and the lag caused by turn-transitions). No big deal though just something to be mentioned.\n-Short (I think). The campaign only showed 3 missions, I have not yet completed the third mission so I'm not sure if they're just hidden or aren't added yet. Again though, this is not a big deal as it is pre-release. I actually would prefer 3 polished levels instead of 10 buggy ones.\n\nCons:\nNone that I can think of aside from the pre-release mentions above which should be fixed and aren't really cons.","October 17, 2014","true","3.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/282680/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWarring States is basically turnbased tactical combat on a hex map, among forces of ancient China. Basically units can move, attack, special attack, or regenerate, depending on special points gathered, and the idea is for you to defeat all enemy units with just the units that you have (try not to lose too many). There are flanking bonuses as well as bonuses for having your flanks covered. There are terrain bonuses for attacking downhill. There are broken units (units that suffered too many casualties)\n\nIn a way, this is a little reminiscent of Civ5's combat, but with far fewer variety. The special ability points can also be spent on a special attack, which does extra damage.\n\nThe story are of significance only to people who know Chinese history, and we're talking about the Romance of Three Kingdoms and thereabouts. And they are not important.\n\nThe emphasis is on tactics, i.e. how to move optimally to force the enemy to engage on your terms, that you can surround it and flank it, pound it from afar with archers, and so on, while preventing the enemy to do the same to you.\n\nThe scenarios can be challenging, and the main emphasis is multiplayer, which can be brutal. the SP are more of a tutorial.\n\nAll in all, it's not a terribly good game, but it's fresh take on an area that's not widely explored out of China. Worth a try at least.","February 28, 2015","true","0.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","4"

Firstly, I like the Chinese warring theme (I am more of a three kingdoms strategist myself playing ROTK and Dynasty tactics) but this is a refreshing breath of air. The combat is interesting and intuitive and provides a decent diversity of units. One thing that isn't really a criticism but more of a doubt is the strength of archers. Whilst not strong in damage they seem to drop one morale per shot on any unit they fire on. This is both realistic and sensical however this may turn out to be OP (once again this is more of a worry rather than a complaint). I seem to only have encountered one glitch where I sent my horsemen back through the gate in the second mission (when I was defending) and they flipped out for a few seconds before the game returned to normal.
