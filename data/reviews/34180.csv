But not worth paying for ultimately. Its grfx are good. BUt its gameplay is so limited. It's missing events (like biathalon) and theres no career mode, just chasing fastest times. Its multiplayer is limited.\n\nThat said it has a great soundtrack for a game like this.","May 2, 2012","false","0.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"
