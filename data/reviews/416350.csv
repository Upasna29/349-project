You don't even have to press any buttons to start rolling backwards in pre season. There is an option to configure controls but it was not detecting my gamepad. Seems like a mobile port.","November 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","4"

The biggest complaint is the actual racing; if you fall behind the pack there is no chance of catching back up. This really sucks since there are interesting maps, power-ups different racing modes.\n\nThe game really got me excited with the power-ups; it reminded me of our beloved Mario Kart. The problem is if you aren't in a pack of racers you will never get to really utilize these power-ups since the map is so curvy and the other racers will already be half a lap in front of you. No controller support and barely enough keyboard customization.\n\nWorth $0.20-0.30; just so you can make a profit with the cards.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?
