First thing developers should learn from this game is to break the rules, and to create new ones.\n\nThis game is a mix of current standard open-world game, shooter and fighting game (as in, Mortal Kombat/Virtua Fighter style), with a real interesting story, in a very well-thought world full of characters with real depth.\n\nAlso, David Bowie, the Legend, has an active role in this story. No need to mention the music alone is worth the price. No wonder he accepted to play in this game, it's kind of like his music was: daring, imaginative and rules-breaking.\n\nOnly thing I really dislike about this game is the save system. Without this I'd give the game a 11/10, so I'll have to go for a mere 10/10 instead.","January 11","true","46.3"," 95 of 100 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","95","100","7","0"

At the start of the game you meet Kay'l who tells you that you are not actually playing a video game and you are transferring your soul into your computer and traveling to an actual place called omikron which is being taken over by demons. Your job is to save your soul and omikron from the demons. This game is a combination of Adventure/FPS/RPG/puzzle/fighting game. This game has a brilliant soundtrack(with help from David Bowie), brilliant atmosphere and a great story. I think this game is one of the best ever made, but maybe that's because I played it at such a young age. I have heard people say that this is the best game ever made. I have also heard people say it is one of the worst so I think i just depends on what you like in a game.

I dunno. The graphics have that 90`s Quake/UT Engine charm, likewise the music. Gameplaywise it divides into an Adventure/Open World part sprinkled with FPS and Tekken-like (or whatever) fighting style sections.\n\nThe open world part is interesting, you get to run around varied locales altho its really pretty linear, no sidequests to speak of (you can get keys to houses and theres semihidden fights around the maps, both give stuff but thats about it).\n\nThe FPS parts are ok, feel abit floaty but eh. Now as for the fighting stuff : Doesnt feel responsive and theres dropped frames or sync errors or whatever you would call that where you get hit but you dont see the opponent actually doing the animation hitting you. Other times you do a move and just "bump" off the other dude without anybody getting hit because hes in the middle of a move himself. Played my share of brawlers/fighting games and im somewhat positive it wasnt on my end but that this gameplay element is just technically crude or put blunty, ♥♥♥.\n\nIts not that long but maybe thats a good thing because it starts really strong with a kinda Bladerunner setting and somewhat easy but varied and fun puzzles whereas towards the end it drags itself along with samey puzzles all centered around translating symbols or interpreting symbols.\n\nId recommend it for the oddball experience it provides, not so much the gameplay.\n\nAnd now i wanna play Anachronox or Outcast for some reason...","September 30, 2013","true","13.8"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","1"

Chciałem umieścić w komentarzach ale jest limit 1000 znaków)\n\nOmikron: The Nomad Soul is the first game of the Quantic Dream studio. It might as well be considered three games in one. For the major part of the gameplay it remains a TPP adventure game relying on the usual stuff:  talking with NPCs and using items. Occasionally it switches to FPP shooter or hand to hand 1 on 1 brawler kind of similar to early instalments of the Tekken or Virtua Fighter series. It is worth mentioning that all of these are made pretty solid and none of them feels like it was forced into the gameplay without a reason (well, maybe with the exception of swimming, but it occurs 2 or 3 times in the entire game, which is acceptable).\n\nAn interesting mechanic incorporated into the gameplay is the switching of the protagonist’s bodies. While it is not possible to reincarnate into any NPC, there certainly is a significant number of possible bodies the ‘Nomad Soul’ can possess. Some of these are plot induced – when your actual shell is killed, you will take over the first person that touches the dead body – yes, dying does not necessarily mean  seeing a game over screen.  Later on you acquire a spell that allows reincarnation whenever you find an interesting host – for instance to gain access to a particular area. Or just for fun.\n\nI find it a bit disappointing that, while all of these NPCs have their statistics (eg. Strength, speed, HP, MP) and some information on their background, likes and dislikes, when you decide to reincarnate, your previous host simply disappears. At no point it is mentioned that what you actually do is stealing the bodies of living people. I believe that this theme is not sufficiently explored or developed during the game.\n\nSurprisingly enough, the graphics of this game are not all that bad (considering the fact it was published in 1999). Of course, models and  textures are simple and the viewing distance is obscured by the mist,  but all of the game’s districts have their own style and color palette that catches the eye. Furthermore, the way the districts look contributes greatly to the  game’s cyberpunk atmosphere. On the other hand, it is noticeable that there are very few models of NPC characters on the street (2 – 3 per district) and vehicles (1 model of a hovercraft-car and 1 bike –  that’s all!). If you decide to play, I strongly suggest overriding the game’s settings in your graphic card’s panel and forcing every possible filtering on – it greatly improves the game’s appearance: especially the character’s faces during the conversations.\n\nQuite obviously, music is where the game excels (David Bowie!) . It needs to be said that not only the tracks featuring David Bowie are awesome (look around the city – you may find a concert going on. ) but the entirety of the soundtrack is an impressive work.\n\nIn my mini-reviews I usually do not discuss the game’s story line, and this case should not be an exception. But let me tell you that: at some points of the storyline some of the NPCs will openly say that Omikron is a computer game ( while others will tell you that it is not :D) and it is the integral part of the plot.  It is quite worth playing the game just to discover this particular story gambit.\n\nTo conclude: I cannot say whether Omikron is a good game or not. It is certainly an ambitious one.  It is noticeable that lot of work has been put into Quantic Dream’s first child. Still, one can’t help but notice that the later part of the game is significantly weaker, just as if authors ran out of ideas in the end. It doesn’t help that the puzzles in the final chapter of the game are EXTREMELY annoying ( For example – AND THERE WILL BE SPOILERS as I am describing two most annoying riddles in the game – at one point you are required to run around one of the districts, without the use of cabs, looking for four symbols – this task takes more or less half an hour, while solving the riddle when you know the symbols – no more than a minute. Ten minutes later you need to find a gem  - in the chamber where you can get it, there are approximately 20 chests with 20 similar gems – of course the game gives you hints as to which one you should choose but these are quite vague and you are not told in any way whether you picked the right one – and the place where you use the said gem is one hour ahead into gameplay. So yes, if you chose poorly you will be running right back. Or RAGEquit. Anyways, SPOILERS OUT).\n\nIf you are still planning to finish this game, it should take around 15 hours. It took me some more time since I decided to lose all the battles and check out the outcomes. My recommendation in this case is: buy this game (discounted!)  to check out where the authors of Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls started. Play to discover that one major plot twist.  After that, there is not much Omikron has to offer. Be warned: I finished this one solely because I loved it OH SO MUCH back then in primary school.","April 18, 2014","true","21.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

It is quite a trippy game.  The atmosphere of the Omikron world is something of uglyness and beauty at the same time.  The graphics are dated, but even when this game first came out the graphics looked a bit dated anyway.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing though.  The way the camera angles flow and just the general movement and weird textures and sounds in the game really kind of blend together to make Omikron stand out as a very unique looking game.  So instead of thinking "God these graphics suck!", I end up thinking "What a crazy artistic look this game has!".\n\nOmikron is also a very unique playing game as well.  It has a relatively large set of city maps to explore somewhat sandbox style.  The story itself plays out pretty linear from what I can tell, but there are alot of different areas to explore and site see.  There are plenty of interactions to be had with random people on the streets and whatnot just for the hell of it.  Some of these people you may end up becomming if you die complete with that person's attributes (which can be either a good or a bad thing depending on who you come back as, however you can "level up" your character somewhat anyway).  If you don't like who you come back to life as, you can find another person to be too.  You can hail a cab to get around or just run around instead.  There are a few things to do around the cities like watching an Omikron David Bowei do an underground show at a club (again, just for the hell of it).  Another thing you can do around the city is go fight in a tournament semi-Tekken style (although don't expect to enjoy it nearly as much as Tekken).   And if going from playing an almost GTA3 style feel of an adventure game to Tekken style tournament fighting wasn't enough, Omikron also has you fight some of the main combat situations in the game as a first person shooter (although a very crappy and hard to control fps).  Luckily, there aren't too many fps situations to worry about from what I've played.  Most of the game is adventure story driven playing instead of being a ton of combat situations.  The adventure story parts of the game are what I like about Omikron by far the most anyway.\n\nWould I recomment this game?  Yes I would.  This game has it's faults no doubt, but if you can get past the awkward controls, bad camera angles, limited numbers of saves system, the hard to read fonts in the game, and all the other little quirks about the game, then you might find yourself liking this game at the same time.  So yeah Omikron definately tried to experiment with a new flavor of gameplay (some elements favorable, some elements  not so favorable), but overall I like their ideas they put into the different aspects of the game.  Catch it on sale for like $2.50 on Steam like I did.","November 27, 2015","true","2.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Archaic controls and desperately aging graphics aside Omikron takes place in a futuristic cyber punk world drawing heavy inspiration from 80s sci fi movies that really draws the player in both figuratively and literally. You play yourself using your computer to enter the world of Omikron taking over the bodies of a wide cast of characters to solve the mystery of just what exactly is happening to this mysterious world of Omikron.\n\nThe gameplay is broken into 3 segments. There is the overworld adventure mode where you take part in an investigation which is where the story mainly unfolds and progresses.\nCombat is then split up into Fighting and Shooting. The shooting segments are your standard FPS style controls (though you will what to adjust the controls as the default is the arrow keys and not WASD) and the fighting segments play pretty much exactly like the Tekken games.\n\nAll in all Omikron is a fantastic immersive game and while it does suffer from sever early 3D game syndrome such as tank controls wonky interaction mechanics and so on, it is still on of the most innovative and ambitious games I've played to date.\n\nWould highly reccomend\n8/10","October 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

In the current development atmosphere where games must be marketed to reach the most absolute mindless of the massess to get the greatest return, this game hails from a time when developers were trying all sorts of things to break the mold. Keep in mind that this was released 2 years prior to the legendary open world RPG Morrowind, yet managed to accomplish having an engaging open world built off fairly interesting and new concept. All of the dialog is voiced, and the world is huge- to a point where it really starts to be a detriment, a mistake Morrowind did not learn from either.\n\nOmikron is not without it's flaws. It is simultaneously an open world RPG, a fighter, a shooter, and maybe something else thrown in there as well.  It does all of these things fairly mediocrely, but combined, it holds up fairly well- particularly for it's age. The story was very dark and very interesting when I had played it in 9th grade. Looking back and revisiting it, it is still very interesting, although is not immune to some cliches that I may not have picked up when I was younger.\n\nDefinitely pick the game up on sale just to experience a different time in game development, a developer who took chances with mechanics and genres, had a terrific new IP, and also managed to get robot David Bowie in their game.","June 30, 2014","true","1.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

There's no question that the purity of vision afforded by the influence of the incomprable David Bowie is a driving force in the emotional tangibility of this world.\n\nBowie provides several songs which serve as set pieces for the digital stage, and also cameos as a guiding character with the peculiarity and vision we expect from the creative visionary.

It's really a shame, because on top of it having both Quantic Dream and David Bowie attached to it, it has some pretty interesting ideas, like being an open-world adventure game that combines multiple combat genres and a neat resurrection mechanic where during certain parts of the game your death will result in your soul (described in the game as being your own, real-world soul, transferred into the game as a trap) moving into a different character with new stats.\n\nUnfortunately, the game was just too ahead of its time, and as such almost every aspect of the game is flawed in some way. The standard adventure mode plays out like an extremely clunky version of Quantic Dream's later games (like Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain), but the cities are terribly designed and the signs are written in a font that I can only assume was designed to be incomprehensible until you stare at it for several minutes, and as such the only way to reliably travel is by taxi, which essentially defeats the purpose of a open world, let alone the issues I had later on where addresses I had read wouldn't show up as destinations at all. The FPS segments are arguably the only part of the game that works the way you'd expect, but they still feel sluggish and the controls aren't that great. The fighting game portions are the real nightmare, since those are usually the parts where you can be truly "killed"; they play out as if the developers got completely trash-face wasted and then played tekken until they passed out and used that as their inspirational focus, and while there does seem to be some form of a combo system in the game, it doesn't tell you how to use it, and the controls are slow enough that I probably couldn't manage them anyways, so every fight is really just a test to see how quickly you can successfully do a downward leg sweep to known the enemy off their feet and then keep doing it over and over in a stunlock until they die.\n\nI would love to finish this game, because even though he barely seems to appear in the game outside of concerts I would love to listen to more of David Bowie's acting, and the story seems legitimately interesting, but the game is just practically unplayable, and even though I make it a little bit further each time I pick it back up I doubt I'll ever manage to finish it without giving up. This is the sort of game that I would love to see remade by Quantic Dream now that they have the tech, but I doubt they ever will. Ultimately, if you want to remember David Bowie, you're better off rewatching Labyrinth instead of playing this game.","January 12","false","10.0"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","25","45","2","2"

This was Quantic Dream's first game and I must say its not a bad game. The story sounds interesting, the graphics remind me of early Deus Ex games, the music is by the incredible David Bowie, who also stars in this game, the game is fully voice acted, and I must say, for an old game, the voice acting is pretty good\n\nWhat put me off is the game's gameplay and controls. Although the PC port (this game was developed for the Dreamcast) is good, the controls are annoying. You move with the arrow keys, space to jump, Q to fight and Tab to access your inventory, very annoying controls. The game mostly involves you moving from one location to another and investigating an area. Sometimes the game has fighting sequences which look like they're taken from the old fighting games and sometimes there are shooting sequences, which put me off greatly. The game looks interesting however the gameplay does put me off. The game also has limited saves which will put off some people, including me...\n\nOmikron - The Nomad Soul looks interesting but with its gameplay issues and other things, the game did put me off just after an hour of playtime, some people might like but some others might not.

The story has a fairly silly premise, but is executed fairly well, and is fully voice-acted. David Bowie's cameos are fantastic, but the concerts will drag if you're not into his stuff. Even when he's not involved, the music is still fairly well composed. The controls haven't aged poorly, and the only complaint is that it's built for a gamepad, however, the controls are rebindable, so that's not a big deal. The shooting segments are somewhat awkward, but it may just be personal experience, since I haven't played the game for over 10 years. Puzzles are sometimes cryptic, but the solution generally presents itself in some format, as long as the player's been diligent about picking up EVERYTHING. The lip-sync gets pretty laughable, but it's impressive for a game this old, considering it animates the entire face.\n\nThe open world is interesting to explore, though it can get a bit tedious since there isn't much to do outside the main story. Variation between the multiple characters is great, and players can always find someone who is fully capable, or at the very least, looks like a badass.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who loves classic adventure games or David Bowie.","March 30, 2014","true","58.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Shrug, kinda.  At the time it came out, it was undoubtedly unique.  Now this feels dated.  The puzzles are annoying.  The story isn't that great.  It's not nearly as open a world as you'd like.  But hey.\n\nDavid Bowie.  Man.  It's David. Bowie.\n\nAs Neo.\n\nAnd occasionally singing to you.\n\nDAVID BOWIE.\n\nJust play it.  You won't regret it.\n\nMAJOR SPOILER:\n\nThe last boss is a HUGE pain.  If you didn't bring a ton of healing with you, just ignore what you read on hint sites.  There's only one way to beat the big baddie.\n\nLure him to the big...stalactite?  Tree?  thing to the right of where he is.  Go around it so you're on the side that is just a tiny area to pass through.  Guess what: he can't walk through this.  He will start to turn around, like a weirdo.  Shoot him in that little blue oval between his shoulder blades.  This will take various tries, he can wriggle out of this, but whatever.  This is FAR easier/actually possible, as compared to the circel/strafe crap everyone else feeds you.  Largely because his jump attack is apparently triggered mostly by being stunned, and this doesn't require stunning.  Also, he's in a glitch trying to, I dunno, turn around to leave? and so he never jumps.  So you can just shoot away.  It's great.  Unless you love annoying boss battles, just do this.","February 25","true","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The steam version seems to be better configured to run on modern systems than the Gog version (have tried both - gog was unplayable).\n\nThe gameplay blends FPS and third person adventure mechanics to investigate a mystery in a cyberpunk setting (the switching back and forth gameplay was pretty innovative for the era - 1999).  In addition the ability to switch your character (the you that you're playing as) between various characters (of different genders and races) in the setting provides an intersting way to explore those identities within the culture.  But you still play as you regardless of the shell you're... inhabiting?\n\nAlso... New Angels of Promise (by David Bowie) is the theme song and it's awesome.","June 15, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a very ambitious game with its bold use of a very early version of motion capture technology, a big open world fleshed out with content (big for 1999, understandably nothing special compared to today's open world games), and last but not least an original soundtrack by David Bowie, who also graces us with his voice acting talent.\n\nAfter being asked to send your soul into a police officer's body in a parallel universe, you replace him in the futuristic city of Omikron, and try to figure out what's going on in this distant, alien world. Then it doesn't take long to figure out that nothing in Omikron is what it seems.\n\nUnfortunately Quantic Dream bit off more than they could chew. The shooting minigame is tedious, the driving minigame adds nothing to the game, and the pacing is completely ruined in the last few hours. Apparently they ran out of time and budget near the end of development, and wrapped it up quickly.\n\nStill, go ahead and give it a try if you don't mind imperfect, ambitious games which motivate the player to explore the world and discover little stuff.","June 16, 2015","true","36.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now i have it on steam :)\n\nMy System Specs: Windows 7 64bit Ultimate edition SP1, Intel q6600 2.4ghz Quad core, 4gb ddr2 memory, PNY GTX 550 TI 1GB GDDR5 Memory. Game works flawless at 1600x900 / 35-60FPS. I don't run the game at 1920x1080 becasue i record alot and for some odd reason only on steam the frame rate drops down to 12 when recording. Actually to point out, the game runs better non steam version. Drops down to 35 in the big city but still runs good and fast. :)\n\nPros+\nDavid Bowie\nDavid Bowie Music\nDavid Bowie is in this game\nBeautiful visuals for a old game\nOpen world\nMassive open world exploring\nBeautiful Music -------> Wait until you hear the music at " jahangir park ". I cried a few times listening to that. I kept going back to that area just to listen to that music. There's also other music in the game which i won't mention that is out of this world, but i won't tell you :)  Credit goes out to Xavier Despas\n.................................................\n\nPros+ Continue\nCharacter voices\nCharacters in general\nStirp Clubs\nPlaces to visit\nCollecting items\nFighting Is fun once you get use to the controls\nEpic cut scenes\nInteresting looking creatures\nCombat is very fun using the gun\n..........................................\n\nCons-\nControls could be a bit better, but using the game pad helps.\nMagic rings crap . If you have rings to save, save them an use them wisely.\nPuzzles later for the first time can take you a long time to figure out, at least i remember that being that way on the dreamcast. But its not hard puzzles, and its only a few.\n.......................................\n\n9.5 Ratings.

So after Bowie's death, with Square Enix putting it out for free as a tribute, I decided to pick it up and see what it was all about. It really hasn't aged well. The controls are a NIGHTMARE to set up how you want them, the interface is pretty bad, and the graphics  and voice acting just show how far things have come in the last couple of decades. Music's not all that great either, considering who did it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/243000/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","My feelings towards Omikron are very mixed. It is certainly one of the most unique games I've played... but it's a bit too unique for my liking. What I mean is, the game has a lot of variety- but not a lot of variety in it's actual gameplay. There are sections where you walk around and talk to people, sections where you swim, sections where you shoot enemies, and sections where you fight Mortal Kombat style. But there isn't much variation to this at all, and each gameplay has some hick in it; something that makes it really clunky to play around with.\n\nThe graphics are fine in Omikron. I have no problem with them. But my problem is the animation. Faces make strange expressions and people over-emote by gesturing wildly. It's almost comical to watch at times. As far as stories go, Omikron's is the most involving I've played. It goes to great lengths to make sure that you know that you are NOT playing a game, but interacting with a very real world with very real consequences... but that had no effect on me, as I would often correct my mistakes by booting my old save up and trying again. And the design of the world and flow of the story is way too vague for me. A lot of the game almost requires you to look up a game guide, as the answers to a lot of the puzzles are borderline impossible. And sometimes just trying to find out what EXACTLY you have to do next in order to progress the story can be a massive pain, as you don't telepathically know what the game is requiring you to do.\n\nAs far as the world and lore of Omikron goes, it's fine, but it has the same problem that Dragon Age: Origins only suffered slightly from- reading. A good lore can be told with subtlties between characters and showing in the dispaly of the world itself. I'd rather see mages practice magic than go to a library and study and make my own damn Beshe'm. (And I PERSONALLY want to know the people who knew how to make a flipping Besehe'm with no guide because none of the stuff I did to make it made any sense at all!)\n\nI personally don't like Omikron for it's faults. If it wanted it's consequences to matter, well I'd applaud Quantic Dream for doing a much better job of getting that across in Heavy Rain years later. But as Quantic's first production, Omikron suffers from some massive problems as a game, but it still has charm to it. There is freedom in the open world of Omikron, characters can be fun to interact with, and there is a certain draw I had to the game before I got really tired of playing it really fast- since the missions for The Awakened can get repetitive very quickly.\n\nIf you want a gaming experience like none you've played before, Omikron is certainly one to fill that desire. But as far as great games go, I'm pretty sure Omikron won't stand the test of time to become a legend.","September 24, 2015","false","8.7"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","12","27","0","0"

You must be ready to take a lot of abuse if you plan to play this game. Seriously, this is not an easy game to like.\n\nControls are awful. First of all Nomad Soul doesn’t support analog joysticks so xbox360 controller is out of the question. Keybindings affect menus so after changing them to WASD you have to use menus with WASD and there is no mouse support. Most of the time you move around in a city, talking to people and searching for places. In these section you can’t strafe or use mouse look. Usable objects are not highlighted and sometimes hidden in places that you can't see them. You find them by accident. Textures are so muddy that it’s really easy to miss doors, since everything looks so flat. You can only save at set save points which are really far apart. Fighting is not well made and while the first person shooter element works, it's really really clunky.\n\nOn my machine the game runs perfectly well exept when there is a lot of non-polygonal (sprite) objects on screen. For example the inventory screen is made mostly of sprites and runs at horrific frame rate that makes it really difficult to use.\n\nI’m not trying to bring the game down. Just saying that a 1990’s pc player mindset is needed to enjoy. Just to see the cutscenes i'll recommend a let's play. If I can keep going, I’ll post a proper review later.","January 16","false","1.3"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","7","18","2","0"

It just looks silly. The melee system is shoddy. Half of the time my guy won't punch or kick when I press the button. Also my enemy blocks non-stop while I can't deflect one hit. Dialogue options are treated like you only receive a set number of options, so while I want to ask every question to learn as much as possible, I'm only allowed a few. However the dialogue progesses on set routes, so somehow my character knows answer to questions I didn't ask!

I got it on Steam because of David Bowie's death and Square Enix giving it for free, which is a very nice move from their part.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't recommend this game.\n\nAs usually, David Cage's hubris promises a lot and delivers nothing.\nThe writing is clunky, the overall appearance is ugly, the world feels empty and the controls are awful : they change all the time, from relative to the camera to absolute, from keyboard and mouse to controller. Don't get fooled by those who say that WASD wasn't a standard at that time. It was. The only other games from that period that used tank controls were Grim Fandango and FFVII (PC port) and at least, they sticked to them. Omikron wants to be everything and achieves nothing.\n\nIf you're here because of David Bowie, you're better off watching excerpts on Youtube. And frankly, these are not very interesting songs.\nIf you want to play a game from the same year, from other hubris driven french speaking developers, play Outcast and just compare. Being a game from 1999 is not an excuse.","January 18","false","0.5"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

It's basically (very basically) an open-world RPG, but the progression is linear and there's not much point in exploring. The main part of the game is going from point A to point B. If any combat is involved, it's either a first-person shoot-em-up or a beat-em-up, both again very basic.\n\nThe game is best known for having David Bowie, which is only really of benefit to Bowie fans. He's in that elite of Phil Collins, Rod Stewart et al where if you don't like all their stuff then their non-single songs are gonna bore the pants off you (personally I'm a Phil Collins guy).\n\nIt might've been worth playing in 1999, but now, unless you're a Bowie megafan, there's probably another RPG in your backlog or being given away 'free' on Xbox or PS Plus that you'd enjoy far more.","January 29","false","9.2"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"

Unfortunately, it seems i don't have the patience any more for this era of game. The default controls are woeful, though you can WASD-ify them to make it slightly less awkward (no mouselook, though). I was still semi-interested in the world right up until the first battle. The FPS mode is very slippery and difficult to enjoy, but the fighting game mode is the real fun-killer, and this is coming from someone who played the hell out of the first three Mortal Kombat games as a kid. Perhaps it would be easier with a gamepad, but it's almost impossible to get your guy to do what you want with a mouse and keyboard. Given the savegames are all checkpoint-style and you have to go back 5+ minutes to replay the fight it's just not worth my time. The story seems like it could have been okay, but with controls like these it simply doesn't stand up to the countless modern games you could be spending your time and money on.","March 2, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","0"

Let's go to, graphics..\n1: Very old graphics, and people are just geometric "blobs"\nControls..\n2: Despite the graphics being ♥♥♥♥♥♥, I can't even play the game because the controls are "that" bad.\n3: If you try and set controls, the controls won't make any sense from the beginning so setting it is impossible.\nCost..\n4: I got this game free, from a code online (Thank god)\n5: A $9.00 game like this is clearly making $0.00\nAdvice\n6: Don't buy it lol.\n7: And seriously don't play it, it's just a waste of time, I couldn't even pass the first part of the game without getting irritated.\n\nOh and 8 (Never forget 8 :D) I've never seen such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game in my entire life :c","January 19","false","0.2"," 1 of 18 people (6%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","6","1","18","3","0"

I mean, yes, the game is awesome, but this is a really old game, you can probably have an error starting the game with your 2GB VRAM PC.\nI was like 2 hours looking for a solution to "Your video card does not have enough memory to play The Nomad Soul" and when I solved now I'm having trouble with the controllers.\nIs like they take an old game with cobwebs from the garbage and say "yeah, lets resell this...thing"\nI've played the Dreamcast version and it was AWESOME, but this one, is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","December 20, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 27 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","4","27","0","0"

Maybe it gets better if you push past the incredibly bland initial scenery and total lack of instruction or direction - but there are just too many good modern and retro games out there to waste on this one.","June 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 37 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","4","37","0","0"

We just don't get this level of original creativity and attention to details in this game. Graphics are typical 1999 but it also takes you back to the cyperpunkesque atmosphere. The city really does feel immersive and sets a nice mood. I can't wait to put more time into this.\n\nOn the negative side the controls are weird and the fixed camera can be quite annoying at times, however it does give a nice feel for the environment.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you can look past the weird camera and controls but I'm sure there's a mod for that.\n\n","June 4","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
