If you were not born in the 90s, or know what a 3.5inch floppy disk is.  Don't rate this review down.  I've seen a few 12 year old not get old games.  Don't be one of those.  I clocked this game back then, and I'm on my way to doing so again in 2015.\n\nThis game was and still is pretty sweet for a 2d platformer.   You have multiple gameplay elements to work with.  Its not just fight to get the key and open the door.  Sometimes you have to choose which key/door combination to unlock.  You may screw up requiring a reset of the level!  Add in the floppy disk/laser grid.  Dynamite to open the exit, satelite disk to find and destroy, and sometimes the invisible platforms to change the level layouts!  This gives a feeling of progress more than having to walk through a level again.\n\nOh and then there are the varied enemies you will fight.  The game only allowing you to fire one shot at a time slows things down some, but means this isn't about button bashing. Its more of a chess game about when to put yourself into harms way and attack.  Keep in mind you have a bonus if you survive the level with no damage.  There are quite a few enemies that have various strengths and weaknesses.  You can't just shoot and win.  Some you have to attack only at certain times, and in certain places.  Others will blow up and send shrapnel out towards you.  The blue ninja guy is one of my favourites.\n\nDon't also forget the challenge of spelling S.P.Y.  It seems so simple but sometimes avoiding the letters you aren't ready to get can be fun/frustrating.\n\nThe graphics are nice and colourful, the sound is old school.\n\nThe only really bad thing is when you finish the levels and realise you are getting closer to the end.\n\n10/10 would spell S.P.Y. again","December 7, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

Apogee, now 3D Realms, released a series of side scrolling platformers. This and Crystal Caves. This game when I was a lad of 10 would play  this with my brother. We would take turns on each of the bases and destroy evil. This game is a platform puzzle, not mind boggling difficult puzzles, just stuff like collecting items in a certain order. I am running this on Windows 10 without problem, and my brother also purchased the game, and he is running it on Windows 8.1. Buy this game. This is all I can say.","August 22, 2015","true","5.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

Don't let my play count fool you, I played this on end when I was young. Brings back the memories of taking apart and building computers when I was just learning to ride a bike.\n\nControls are still soft and the enemies dumb, just the way I liked them. Great game to dip in and out of when you want to remember a simpler time.\n\nWorks great on Windows 10.","October 22, 2015","true","1.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

However, Secret Agent is more than a simple piece of nostalgy. It is good old-fashioned 2D shooter platformer inspired by the first Duke Nukem Games.\n\nThe background story is about agent who is sent to prevent Dr. No Body's heinous plans and during trip this agent we play as visits several different areas filled with enemies and traps. While the maps in the game are understandably small the way how the devs have lenghtened lifetime is delighting - each maps holds plenty of keys and floppy diks<3 that needs to be obtained and player usually need to come back already visited places to open the door, which key was found in the end of the map.\n\nThe one important feature in 2D platformers are smooth and easy controls and Secret Agent has these included. Every jump and slightest movement happens in time and when stepping into one of the game's various traps the fault often lies somewhere else than in the game.\n\nWorks on my win 8.1 as well as it worked on win 95 long, long time ago.","November 1, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

When I was kid, I had the shareware version (back when shareware was still a thing), which included only the first chapter, and I had a lot of fun with it. Having the chance to finally complete it was great.\n\nAs far as story goes, like most games from its era, it doesn't have a lot. You play as a secret agent (hence the name) tasked to infiltrate a series of island controlled by an evil organization in order to recover the blueprints to a superweapon.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, each chapter (there's three of them) consists of a large island filled with enemy bases you need to take down before gaining access to the island's fortress. Each level (or base) requires you to find an explosive to blow open the exit, although you might also have to find keys to unlock doors, or floppy disks to deactivate laser fields that may be in your way. There's also several enemies and different hazards on each level. As I mentioned above, it can be quite challenging, as some of the levels include sections that are basically trial and error, and you may end trapping yourself with no other option but to restart the level, which can be a bit frustrating. Even then, losing your three lives only forces you to restart the level, and all of them can be completed in a few minutes. Another good thing is that you can play the levels in any order you like, so if you find one too challenging, you can always go back to the island map and try another one, in case you're missing ammo, for example.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game. Whether you lived through the 90s (or earlier), and have some nostalgia for the games of your childhood, or if you never experienced that era, and want to see some of the early days of gaming, you should give this game a shot.","March 2","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to find various items and destroy satellite dishes to finish the levels. It took me a while to play through all the 3 episodes and I had lots of fun with the game. Some of the enemies are a bit boring though. Never played this game back in the days, so there is no nostalgia clouding my mind.

I found it hard and fun almost 25years ago and it still is. Lots of levels and it can be hard even with the simple gameplay (green key open green door; don`t jump on spikes; pick up items).\n\nEnemies are kind of dumb and it`s weird when you shot them they go from spy to various medieval armor guys tho. Minus the nostalgia, it`s still fun to play. I would love a mordern version of this game, but I doubt it will come out.","April 18","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
