It used to be good with a nice balance of certain weapons and such. But now?...\n\n1. There is literally toxic clans everywhere, their quite a few I won't name but are obviously quite toxic that literally I have seen just decide to hack when they start losing. I seen passing through walls, shooting through walls, teleporting, auto kills, and ofcourse aimbots everywhere. Then when you call them out on them they just start hacking some more. The community is horrible.\n\n2. Well from what you saw above there is a ridiculous amount of hacking that goes on in this game especially the more you play the easier it is to see. I have seen subtle hacks to full blown hacks where you just die if you look at your enemy. And Ubisoft does absolutely nothing about it.\n\n3. The GUNS which is an important part of any shooting game...They are unbalanced like hell. Lets take for example the new pay to win AA-12. A AUTOMATIC shotgun that shoots right after each shot with 20 rounds of ammon. It can one shot you at close range and at a distance it covers a ridiculous amount of the area when shot and have high damage no matter how far you are. Then they tell you this is fair? Not even close, this gun is ridiculous and stupid.\n\n4. What can I say? its PAY TO WIN! Literally if you don't pay, to get a good gun it will take forever as the prices of guns or armor you have to play for weeks to save up for just one thing or...You can pay 20 dollars and geta  gun that can just kill anybody  as long as you point it in the general direction of your enemy. So yeah, pay to win.\n\nThere are a few things  that are bad but those would be the main things as I don't recommend this game at all. Not in its current state. Maybe a year or two ago? Yeah I would but not now.\n\nNOTE: I have already gotten quite the few people calling me a noob for this comment even do I been playing this game longer than they have. But what can you do when you tell people the truth.","November 4, 2015","false","551.0"," 413 of 444 people (93%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","93","413","444","25","21"

In CBT it was amazing. In early Open Beta, the game was amazing. Since then, Ubisoft has done everything in its power to run this game into the ♥♥♥♥ing ground.\n\nThey will say in their patch notes that they have "heard the community" and will make changes to game that essentially make it that much more on par of potato like mechanics that vets like myself just cringe. At first the Veteran community of Ghost Recon Phantoms adapted to the changes. However, they continued to become more and more asinine that game just isn't as enjoyable as it once was.\n\nLets get to the point where the game is just a ♥♥♥♥ing huge cash dump now. See, the ♥♥♥♥tards over at ubi's marketing apparently have a hard time understand the meaning of MICROtransactions. No no, what they do is come out with "new" weapons and sell them in bundles or solo for close to what a new game would cost. Is the game Pay 2 Win? Some might say so. A lot of the veterans of the game will tell you it's not because they have the skill set to overcome the new kids who cash dump when they first get into the game. So I'll leave that up to the new kid who decides to join after reading this. The community did ask for custom matches instead of the standard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you deal with on the regular in matchmaking. But yeah, Ubi decided to throw a price tag on that too. Nothing they come out with is ever cost free.\n\nIt's too bad this game has been run into the ground. It was a game that stood out against many others. Ubi killed it plain and simple.","May 30, 2015","false","943.2"," 271 of 305 people (89%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","89","271","305","21","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badnewsbryan/recommended/243870/","badnewsbryan","Bryan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badnewsbryan/","278 products in account","I don't normally post reviews, because I believe people should form their own opinions on games and have them largely uninfluenced by third parties. However, after reading the reviews for this game, I had to download it and try it for myself. I like to have a good laugh now and again at "Pay to Win" games and how horrible they are, and then enjoy watching them die once the community becomes aware of the atrociousness of the model. However, these reviews are largely made by players who are, quite simply, bad at the game. That, or they have a poor understanding of the model of progression in the game.\n\nAllow me to break it down for you in the simplest way possible. Almost every piece of equipment in the game belongs to a particular "tier," and then some (read: the guns) have upgrades/attachments you can also equip. ALL items that give an upperhand in the field of battle can be purchased with IN-GAME CURRENCY (that's the stuff you don't need daddy's credit card to buy), with the option to buy them immediately (not have to grind out the in-game currency) with real money. This is THE SAME MODEL as plenty of successful F2P games. Anybody ever hear of League of Legends? No? Just one of the most popular video games in the world right now? They run off of the same model. You want something? Play until you can afford it. You want it now? Pay for it. You want to look like a special little snowflake (read: you want your waifu to have more cleavage), then pay for it.\n\nFurthermore, the difference between a "Tier I" gun and a "Tier VII" gun is laughable. You can pick up the Tier I Sniper Rifle (meaning the sniper rifle you start with and have free access to) and kill anybody in one shot to the face. You can do the same with a Tier VII Sniper Rifle, but it might have a higher rate of fire or less recoil or something. Welcome to video games, kids. Trust me, you'd be whining a lot more if there was only a small selection of guns. This process allows for you to progress and feel like you've achieved something for the time (or money, if that's more your style) you've put into the game without breaking the game and making it unfair. Upon exiting the Beginner's Matchmaking, I continued to come top of the scoreboard with the "Best Assault," "Best Recon," and "Best Specialist," medals about 80% of the time. I did not spend a penny. I do, however, have experience with Tactical Third Person Shooters. I have played almost every Tom Clancy game to date, and I have spent more time in Rainbow Six Las Vegas (& Las Vegas 2) than I'd like to admit. I trump other players because I have more experience, I am a better player, and I do not play the game like it is Call of Duty.\n\ntl;dr anybody whining about this game is bad and playing it like it's CoD, it's actually a great game and worth each and every one of the zero pennies it will cost you to try it.","January 21, 2014","true","15.2"," 2,299 of 3,006 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","299","3","0","108"

Up until level 5, you can play with other people who haven't spent any money on the game.  After level 5, beginners-only is locked out.\n\nYou have 3 classes to choose from - Assault rifle, LMG/shotgun, and sniper/SMG.  While you can change weapons pertaining to your class in-game (IE if you are a sniper, you can change sniper rifles during a match), you can ONLY change classes while not in a match.\n\nIf you do not spend any real money on this game, you will be able to afford one gun after a few hours, and another gun after several days, and that's about it.  Two guns.  So make sure you pick the right ones!\n\nThis game really encourages team work.  EVERYONE uses mics, and even the ones that don't are furiously typing in the chat.  Team mates will wait until everyone has met at a certain point before advancing ahead.  They will identify enemy positions, let you know of alternate routes (there are a lot), suppress fire for you while you run ahead.  I have never seen such epic teamwork in a free-to-play game.  Even the young kids are working together!\n\nA lot of people are saying that once you leave beginners-only mode, the game hits a huge pay-wall and becomes impossible for anyone who didn't spend money.  I did not find that to be true.  I haven't spend a dime on this game, I'm only using the basic guns, and I still find matches to be a blast.  The fact is, even if the other guys spent $30 on guns with high damage, low recoil, and extra armor, I can still kill them in one shot with a headshot, or sneak around behind their team and kill 3 of their guys with my basic LMG.  Sure, when I was playing beginners-only, I was getting in the top 3 of the scoreboard every match, and now im near the middle, but it's still fun.\n\nSo if you spend a lot of money on armor, it might mean that it takes 6 shots to kill you instead of 4 or 5.  Or if you spend it all on a nice gun, it might mean you can kill a guy in 3-4 shots instead of 5 or 6.  Or it might mean you can recover from sprinting faster, or your gun has slightly less recoil.  In the big scheme of things, spending $30 on this game will net you an extra one or two kills.  It's a slight edge, but it's not enough to ruin the game for us freeloaders.\n\nI suggest anyone who has had a hard time after reaching level 5 to try again, it's really not that bad.","January 27, 2014","true","13.9"," 553 of 740 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","553","740","0","8"

I know a lot of you are like "PAY TO WIN BRO." or "UBISHIT".\n\nThis game is one of the few games I do respect UBISOFT for. I'm not talking about their in-game purchases or weapon bundles. I'm legit talking about the game play.\n\nPros:\n-Unique cover system\n-Fun when you are doing well\n-Great for teamwork and strategy hatching\n-Movement system is awesome\n-You can still WIN against people who paid for bundles.\n-It is not 100% P2W\n-Devices for each class is fun and interesting.\n-All in all, only fun if you are winning.\n\nCons:\n-Paid bundles are pretty OP. Depends of course.\n-Lag helps noobs win so careful when going against someone who is lagging. They are usually teleporting or they can kill you before they even peek out. Hardly happens though. Unless you are against Europeans.\n-REQUIRES A MIC FOR TEAMWORK. It is not actually required but it is essential to your teammates when it comes to getting flanked from behind and such.\n-There are a lot of things that can make the game unfair. You can add armor slots that can make you into a tanky mofo.\n-There are guns that seem to be more like snipers besides being rifles. Which is realistic in a way.\n-Downside for now is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ matchmaking. The higher tier your gear is, the easier you meet other generals/colonels and such. Guys with a highest gear and lots of exp. They just run around with a shotgun or just blast through. Not fun.\n-Ubisoft hasn't released a new map for MONTHES. Only tweaked maps and released bundles of weapons that are already released....Just more dmg.....\n-They even released a new mode which REQUIRES YOU TO PAY FOR IT EVERY TIME YOU PLAY A MATCH (A.K.A. TOKENS).\n\nIn all honesty, game is fun only if you do well. :)","March 4, 2015","true","609.1"," 211 of 267 people (79%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","79","211","267","37","14"

All of which have their own guns and abilities.\n- On classes there are abilities, these abilities are very well made and can help you your team.\n- Lots of different maps.\n-Very nice Cover system, you will gain accuracy and things whenever you use cover.\n- 3rd Person View.\n\n\n\nCons:- Pay To Win, this game will always be asking you if you want to buy currency or guns.\n- Unbalanced, people that have invested Real Money into the game will always have better weapons than you.\n- No Match-Making System, this game has no Match-Making System after you finish your beginner games. You will always be matched with people that are better than you and people that have Premium guns.\n- Very hard to get game Currency, weapons and things take about $30,000 to buy and per game you will get $500-$1000.\n- No way to stop Spawn Camping, once your pinned inside of your spawn you are screwed.\n- No Different Game Modes.\n\n\n\nConclusion:This game is very unbalanced and needs much more work, it is also to much of a Pay To Win game by the fact that the Premium weapons are very overpowered and can be used in any match. The matchmaking system needs some work as it will match you with anything of all skill levels and no matter what type of gun you have you will always be matched with people that have the Starter Guns and Premium Guns that are much more overpowered than all other guns in the game. The Graphics in this game suit it very well and are nicely made. This game also runs very smoothly and has a very nice cover system.\n\n\n\nOverall Rating: 3/10","April 11, 2015","false","62.0"," 78 of 94 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","78","94","6","0"

This is difficult for me to answer.  It's punishing to play for free, you can purchase top tier guns, armour, and equipment, and the player community is small, forcing you to face these "pay2play" demons.\n\n-BUT-\n\nThey can bleed, and they CAN be killed.  It requires a mic to communicate effectively.  It requires patience when facing a stacked team of opponents.  It may even require a small investment if you want to close the gap on the "top players."\n\nThat said, this game is very fun.  The over-the-shoulder and cover systems in this game put this above any Battlefield or CoD FPS any day.  The electronic warfare systems in this game are incredible and can tilt the balance of power.  Remember, solid teamwork and effective communication can defeat the best armour and equipement.\n\nThe potential is here for this game to be one of the best tactical team games of our (my) [old] age.\n\nEdit:  I gave it close to 50 hours of gameplay.  You need to spend at least $100 to compete in this game.  I don't have that kind of money right now.\nI'm all for "free2play" games making money, but the successful ones charge for aesthetics.\nBeing able to skip the grind and be released into the general gaming population feels wrong.\nAlso, the game's been out for over two years and still in beta?\n\nNo thanks.","February 9, 2014","false","139.9"," 464 of 689 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","464","689","0","26"

For example, there is a player with the ign rain.  Rain has multiple accounts, and was suspended for a week for scripting.  A WEEK?  A ♥♥♥♥ING WEEK?  Well, he came back and was still able to continue playing.  His skill level dropped considerably considering he could not script anymore, which shows you that he really was not that good in the first place.  Also, I know for a fact that that rain has multiple accounts, considering he tried joining one of my former clans with his alternate account.  That sounds cool and all, but there are some players who had multiple accounts, that would help the community get better.  I am not going to mention their name, but if he got a perma ban Rain deserves a perma ban, just like 95% of the veterans who still continue to play this broken game.  Another reason this game has gone to ♥♥♥♥, is the issue with red ping players.  Sooo many players from different countries, hell different continents come and play on the North American servers.  Players from South America, Europe, India, and Asia come to the servers and utilize the server lag to gain a competitive advantage on the Players from North America.  Some players that i know use this free hack is Captain Charisma, Raku, and Drake.  And the red pinging clans that I have seen are g&f, spz, most of tnp and 08s.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ComputerFox/recommended/243870/","ComputerFox","Lucky Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ComputerFox/","1090 products in account","This game....no.\n\nSo, this game has some kinda interesting core mechanics that seem to focused on slower paced gameplay, working with your squads and using cover. Yes, it is a cover based multiplayer shooter, which seems kinda interesting.\n\n\nBuuuuuuuuut...and thats quite a big one. There is a ton of things wrong with the game.\n\nMonetization model! Pay ten US dollars in order to....access things such as your profile or the shop. Meaning you have to put in some money in order to buy ANYTHING. You do get level up rewards but I dont feel like this really contributes much as your extremely limited in what you have access to by default. This is also combined with the fact that, grenades. Grenades and the sort are limited use items, consumables. Which also require the ten dollar investment in order to buy more.\n\nNew player experience. Effectively, it just tells you roughly about the game and the classes and FORCIBLY(You can cancel it, though.) puts you into matchmaking. Which is mostly dead, ive waited for about an hour getting into the game. Eventually I did get a invite to a private match which is where my experience will come from. Said match had some lower level people, including me. Anyone who was new effectively got slaughtered.\nTo put it like this, assuming it does the full amount of damage, your starter automatic gun deals 30 damage per hit with people who have 100 health by default. This means a four shot kill assuming you are not fighting anyone with heavier armor.\nSaid people do infact, have armor. They also are capable of bringing around things such as a directional heat generator of sorts as a suppressor or a sort of, seemingly bulletproof shield. You do not have any of these. Only until you hit level two do you gain access to...cloak and scan. Classwise, your limited to only one class until you hit a certain level, which I believe is 6 and 12 for soldier and support respectively.\nNow, remember when I said that your starter gun is a four shot kill? It is an smg. Not terribly great at range and the sort. Enemies can tote around weapons that can kill you in two shots accurately at range, another occurance happened where there was someone with an automatic shotgun that could take me out in a single shot at close ranges or kill me in about 2-3 at range.\n\nGraphically, the game doesnt look that bad. It has this sort of sci-fi tinge to some of its enviroments. I cant really claim to have any issues here and there isnt terribly much to say about that.\n\n\nOverall though. I do want to say, the game is more or less dead except for a small subset of a high experience players which causes issues for any new players as attempting to join in, your going to have to fight enemies who are just better at the game than you, has better gear that you cannot ever access without monetary investment and a population that is simply nearly nonexistant.\nIs it worth downloading and playing this? I would say absolutely not.\n\n\n\n\n\nalso lil sidenote, I seemed to have issues with people shooting me through cover a few times here and there, but was not sure what the real origin of or the sort. Could be due to latency between either player, poor network handling by the games servers or simply exploits/third party software, but I cannot claim to know its exact reason.","January 2","false","1.9"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","57","65","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electroball09/recommended/243870/","electroball09","Electrospeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electroball09/","186 products in account","I want to start this off by saying I've played this game for well over two years, before it was launched, and when it used to be called Ghost Recon Online.  I have a TON of gear accumulated, I have a TON of experience, and I know the game pretty thouroughly.\n\nThe recent patch (1.2.4) added in several cool features, all but one of which were requested by the community.  The features are somewhat important, but not as important as the seeming turnaround of the developers listening to the community and coding their requests.  Previously, there was (and still is) almost zero communication between the devs and the players, outside of the Community Managers/Game Masters/ATHENA Council (a team of community volunteers whose purpose is to relay community opinions and provide feedback on changes, and which I was a part of for about 9 months), but almost every change until now was not made due to community request, but rather to developer vision.  The changes were mostly made to make the game more accessible, as before, the game had a very, very high skill curve.  It still does have a high skill curve, but is now much easier to get into.\n\nIs this game Pay-2-Win?  I don't like the term, but for what it is, yes, it is Pay-2-Win, however, some people seem to think that the terms Pay-2-Win and Free-2-Play are mutually exclusive, and they're not.  This game is as free as it gets.  You can get gear in somewhat reasonable amounts of time without paying.  The game gives you like 150,000 AC (in-game currency) while you level up each class to level 10.  There's a queue made SOLELY for beginners.  If it's difficult to get into the game, and you find yourself crying "P2W!!!" before you've put even 10 hours into it, this game is just not for you.\n\nThe gunplay can still be amazing, with a good team, you can get incredible amounts of coordination going in order to push onto the point and recapture it at the last second.  The mechanics are solid, the cover system is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.  It is literally the best cover system I have EVER seen.  It's snappy and responsive, not dull and clunky like most games.  And the best part is, if you get to know the game well enough, players that are entrenched in cover become easier and easier to take out.  If you get to know the game even better, you can stay entrenched in cover, and beat back entire waves of enemies.\n\nGun balance is okay-ish.  The guns are balanced against similar tiers, and not against higher tiers.  This would not be a problem, except that power creep is starting to show itself now that the new Tier 9 (which is Tier 11 in the grand scheme of things) has come out, and matchmaking can be horrendous at times, but for the most part, guns have one specific advantage, and are easily defeated when they're out of their comfort zone.  And SMG will 99% of the time take down an LMG in CQC, but it will go the other way at 70+ meters.\n\nLike I stated in the paragraph above, matchmaking can be terrible, putting much higher skilled/geared players in matches with lower skilled/geared players.  I am a General 5 (highest rank) and I will sometimes get put with Captains and Majors (lowest two ranks in main matchmaking).  These matches are fun for nobody, including me, and I generally just sit back and try to provide support while using lower tier guns.  However, in this new patch (1.2.4), they've added Private Matches, WHICH IS PHENOMENAL.  We just had a community driven private match event last night, and it was the most fun I've had playing this game in a year.  Getting with a whole bunch of your buddies and playing this game is just absolutely awesome.  This is one of the community requested features that has been wanted for the longest time, and it's finally here, and it pays off.\n\nI think the best part about this game is that no content is money-only.  By content, I mean no game-modes, no maps, no devices, no weapons, and almost no armors.  There's no "exclusive map-pack DLC" or anything like that.  They are starting to put in more and more cosmetic options that are money only, and fewer things that have an impact in game.  In the new patch (1.2.4) they finally added an armor camo system, to go along with the weapon camo system.  Yes, these are cash-only, but actually, there are monthly events which reward a small amount of in-game cash.  Yes, it would take two months of completing each of the three objectives, but you don't have to wait to get a camo to spend it.  You can spend it on grenades, or XP/AC boosts (which I would recommend).\n\nAll in all, you will love this game, if the game is for you.","October 11, 2014","true","763.9"," 136 of 193 people (70%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","70","136","193","13","6"

So if you don't spend money and play this game regularly, you are probably going to get bored with lower tiered setups. That being said, I think most weapons can compete with all others in their class. This means that just because you don't pay out of pocket you aren't at a disadvantage, which is good.

Let's get the typical questions out of the way first.\n\nIs it Pay-to-Win™?\nYes - While Ghost Recon Online had this problem, Ghost Recon Phantoms does an even worse job at trying to mantain fairness. With gear available for purchase via cash, a subscription model on top of that, for the people who would prefer to fight unfairly, which grants early access to new powerful gear at 'discounts', and power-based consuambles such as grenades and 'special ammo', the game is riddled with ways for anyone to put cash in for an advantage.  While most things you can work toward in one form or another, this still should have no place in a competitive shooter.\n\nDoes it perform well?\nYes - Ghost Recon Online had some performance problems, but thankfully Ghost Recon Phantoms does a better job at loading and in-game performance.\n\nThe game itself looks "okay". As I mentioned before, the predecessor looked okay, but Ghost Recon Phantoms suffers from having far too much clutter since the maps weren't originally designed for a deluge of holographic objects presented in the game world. It also seems like there's a significant blur filter across the entire screen. As if FXAA had gone horribly wrong. Sadly, I couldn't try to dial it out since the game's UI doesn't present video options outside of presets as far as I could tell.\n\nControl wise the game does really well once you get used to it. The cover system is an interesting adaptation for the snap-to cover systems Ubisoft has done before and the display for statistic improvements such as reduction to recoil, stability and other stats popping up based on what stance you entered into cover for really shows just how important it all is in the long run. Thankfully cover is not an end-all-be-all bullet shield. An arm, a hand, or foot can still kick out, exposing you to incoming fire which means you have to pay attention to your surroundings beyond just "I'm behind a wall and safe."\n\nWeapons sound fairly strong and unique. I enjoy the variety of sounds and the "bite" that some have. The audio changes as you take damage are nice, but does seem to need a bit of tweaking as it isn't all that impressive either. UI elements and callouts (such as notice when you start regenerating health as a result of staying out of combat for a significant [20+ seconds] amount of time are easily drowned out by everything else.\n\nThe game itself can be fun, but it tries to trade on being a competitive shooter. For a competitive shooter to be something you can truly recommend it must be fun, fair and team-oriented. While it can be fun and team-oriented, fairness due to the monetization in this game means that it remains in the significant Pay-to-Win bucket that others like All Points Bulletin: Reloaded and Combat Arms belong in.","April 17, 2014","false","5.7"," 51 of 72 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","51","72","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdoots/recommended/243870/","sdoots","Sdoots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sdoots/","354 products in account","I originally wrote this review without really giving the game a fair chance to prove itself to me. As a previous Ghost Recon Online player, the astounding lack of anything actually new on display when I gave Phantoms a quick look was enough to turn me off. For lack of better judgement, I decided to give the title another chance.\n\nMy first instincts were, for the most part, correct.\n\nPhantoms is, to its credit, capable of being an enjoyable experience. Nearly every shooter available today has some variation of a Domination game type, and Phantoms is no exception. Hell, that's all you'll be getting. Realism is in that weird "future soldier" realm they took the series towards with the last few full entries into this franchise, meaning that while you'll be dropping dudes in a few shots (and vice versa), things get a bit weird at the same time. Each of the three classes has some tools at their disposal that either feel like they could be actual future tech, or otherwise might as well be power-ups laying around the maps. I can handle some optical camoflauge, that's a known thing, but bullet-reflection auras are a bit much.\n\nSo why play Phantoms instead of any other shooter? Well, its filling a niche that not many games are right now. It's methodical without being slow as hell. Anyone who played the SOCOM series on PS2 will feel right at home here, and of course, Ghost Recon fans would probably have an easy time adjusting to the new toys.\n\nThe dealbreaker for me is that Ubisoft has no idea how to run a free to play game without making it pay to win. With the in game credits you earn, you need to make sure that in between games, you keep your armor in good condition, have a reasonable stock of grenades, and once you've got those off your checklist, you can consider upgrading your gear. That said, to put new sights, barrels, stocks, and so forth on your gun costs a pretty steep amount of that in game currency you just dumped to remain efficient in combat, so it's a never ending uphill struggle of resource management. You can, of course, spend real money on any of these items, if you want to encourage this kind of garbage.\n\nAs you gain proficiency (experience) with weapons, you'll reach higher tiers. Higher tiers mean a somewhat increased chance to cause a critical hit, among other bonuses like access to better weapons and gear. I don't think I even need to touch on the ridiculousness of critical hits in a competitive shooter, so let's get to the really dumb part of this, which is that in order for a player to actually reap the benefits of the tier they've climbed to, they need to buy an item of that tier-level in the store. So there's another time or money sink for you to worry about.\n\nThe community doesn't quite understand how to work as a team, and you'll often see more snipers (Recon, technically, but I think I've seen like three people use them as such) than Assault or Support on either team, which is great when the primary goal of the game requires you to push forward into enemy territory more often than not.\n\nFinally, the game is guilty of using a launcher. You'll open it and instead of the game starting, a launcher opens. So any updates are handled by that rather than Steam. The launcher also does something I've never had any other do, which is that it'll stay "active" once I quit the game. I'll show up as playing GRP until I go into my processes and close "Launcher" and another one with something else in the name, I can't recall it at the moment. This issue has resulted in my playtime being about 40 minutes more than it should be, and while that's not a huge deal, it's still something that bugs the hell out of me.\n\nGRP is enjoyable enough that I'll probably play a game or two once every week or so, but the constant treadmill prevents me from having any interest in making it a "go to" game, and is more than enough to prevent me from recommending it to others.","April 21, 2014","false","4.1"," 76 of 115 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","76","115","0","0"

I want to go back and play this game and had loads of fun with it. BUT, and this is a big stinky butt, this game is hampered by the worst F2P model possible.\n\nThey start you off with plenty of easy levels for quick in game credits and then hit the brakes hard. You have to unlock each weapon for each class sequentially and common items such as sidearms, sights, attachtments, and armor don't carry over between classes.  The tier 11 LMG is a straight upgrade in all stats to the previous tiers and they are releasing new tiers every so often. Upgraded armor is just flat better thant the previous tiers and can then be made even better by armor inserts which, by the way, are bound to the armor once used and also have their own tiers as well as pay varients that give more stat points or multiple stats per insert. Then we get into the weapons that you can no longer get and could only get by paying real money or more credits than it would have been humanly possible to earn if you like eating and sleeping such as the WAR p90 which just has a flat increase to armor penetration that the standard p90 doesn't.\n\nThen there are the crits, every weapon has a minimum and maximum crit chance that goes up while in cover and down when moving, standard spread for sniper rifles was 1-10%. This can be further increased by using the weapon for a long time or by having a special varient such as the WAR mentioned earlier. A well loved and paid for rifle could get up to 15-40% chance to just do 3X damage because RNG.\n\nSo, now you as a free player are fighting people whose weapons do more damage, fire faster, are more stable, have more range, have a chance to one shot you, and who have more health, more armor, move faster, more crit resistance, whose abilities last longer, recharge faster, are more potent, and to top it all off look more stylin than you with their fancy skins. Then they have the nerve to release crates.\n\nDespite all this, without spending a cent and using tier 4 or less weapons, I clawed my way up to one star general with 5 star being the max rank. There is an amazing game here that rewards tactical play and coordination but you simply reach a point where you cannot stand a chance and that's sad. The journey to 1 star was a lot of fun but became a chore near the end because I entered every fight with objectively inferior stats on all fronts. I finally gave up when I dumped a bizon mag into a recon's back and then he turned around to one shot me in the leg with the brand new money only tier 13 JGL varient sniper.\n\nTL:DR The game is fun, there is a wonderful game under the F2P muck, don't invest too much time because the P2W model is blatent and omnipresent.

It's a pretty easy game to hack. annimation could use a bit more detail and I'd also prefer some sort of planning period prior to the match rather than a warm up.

You can buy all the guns with in game currency but it takes a hell of a long time. The top tier guns ARE better. In stats and everything. eventually you will get them if you love the game.\n\nHaving said that, even the noobiest of noobs with top tier guns will still be bad at this game. This game is largely skill based. It is a true team game, no running and gunning here at the medium to top levels. All the abilities feel usefull and extremely powerful. Upgraded abilities only give a very slight advantage that is not noticable to all except the player using it. The abilities can really turn the tide of a game and they don't feel like gimmicks at all. They work to balance the playing field. The top tier guns are completely powerless in the face of the powerful abilities which you will have access to at the first levels. You get them for free when you rank your character to level 3.\n\nI myself have reached to top ranks with a tier III weapon moded of course to be better. All the guns can be moded to suit your playstyle and needs. If you want to play a skill based game that requires teamwork and communication (mics are EXTREMELY recommended, almost mandatory for top tier play), then pick this game up. You will not be disappointed at all. However if you are a run and gun COD fan, go back to that. This game is not for you unless you have the money to drop on top tier weapons. Even then you will only get so far in this game without honing your skill.","October 11, 2014","true","333.8"," 86 of 135 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","86","135","3","4"

The reason why, it doesn't matter if you are good, bad, FTP, or buy every mod going. I am not heavily into the FPS games but this game in particular is fun anyways. I like just having fun no matter what match I am in. There are players in the game that are quite serious, they do not mesh well with my playing style, FPS concepts, or ideas. I have read the reviews and think most players take this way too serious if they are not in the top percentiles. I feel personal pride if I have not killed myself or my own team players the entire match. The sound, graphics and engine for movement in the game is quite close to true simulations used in military maneuvers. However, it is fun to not use this tactic and Leeroy Jenkins your way into a building and have guns blazing. It is a game, and at the end of the day if you get frustrated because you get shot.... well in FPS that is the nature of the game, and everyone has their time and place; some more then others, again, and again, and again. I cannot help but giggle when I play so badly against a player that takes me out in some gruesome way and hear the squeaky crackling voice of a young exuberent youth telling me to take that or eat it loser or die you piece of trash. It is all good fun, I do not get bent around the axel over it, no use in getting mad, just try to not make it as easy to get killed as the last time.

This game has NOT disappointed me. As a free-to-play game, it's not exactly breaking the bank to try it out either. The gameplay is 3rd person for the most part, but when you aim down the sights of your weapon it quickly zooms you into first person. This transition is quick, smooth and very well done, and the cover-taking system and firing from cover is fluid and fast paced as well. The shooting mechanics or physics feels much more polished than a lot of other games out there. Objective-based game modes mean certain defeat if you camp in one spot for too long, or try to be a lone wolf without coordinating with your teammates. Getting to utilize some cool, perhaps-not-so-futuristic weapons technologies are the icing on the cake (optical cloaking, shoulder-mounted microwave radiation devices to literally cook your enemies, riot shields, EMP's, etc.) An emphasis on teamwork, tactics, and timing, this game is well worth a try!\n\nMy favorite of the many useful tips displayed on the loading screen "If it's too quiet, you're probably being flanked."","January 17, 2014","true","42.4"," 50 of 76 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","50","76","0","1"

The game has balanced classes, nice graphics, great cover and shooting mechanics, and, its free!\n\nDon't shun this game because it's free to play and has microtrasactions, I spent 40 hours playing it and hardly felt the need to spend real money. As far as i know any weapons avalailable in the store can be purchased with both real money and in game money. Don't worry about somebody buying a gun with real money that's way more powerful than yours, I have the starting rifle equipped to my sniper class but I spent some in game money on attachments, and my gun performs better than one worth twice as much. Oh yes, and if your worried about having to grind to afford weapons without spending real money just stop worrying! The game is quite generous with in game credit.\n\nHere are my overall ratings on each core aspect of the game\n\nShooting mechanics: 9.5\10\n\nCover mechanics: 9.5\10\n\noverall balance: 8.5\10\n\nGraphics: 7.5\10\n\nOverall score 8.9\10\n\n\nSorry for any grammar\spelling errors.","April 14, 2014","true","86.6"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","1"

I just started playing and this game is really fun. What makes this game so good is good stable graphics and just amazing gameplay. There really is no story if you were expecting that.\n\nThis game starts you off with three classes one for stealth one for commando and one that’s a mix. They really shove this down you and want you to really like this mechanic. The game is a hard point domination style that consists of three rounds.\n\nYou get put into a squad (that you can choose). You are your squad work together within a big team and really work on team work. You can always stay connected with you squad because they are lit up in green. Your can stay connect with your teammates because they have a blue light around them.\nThey game more or less uses a stealth mechanic that works about 85% of the time. If you have a good team/squad you can easily sneak up on the enemy and take them out.\n\nThe game also has a really fun slide mechanic that always you to use cover. It is really fun having slide races with your friends until you get shot in the face.\n\nThere is also a detection mechanic that lets you see the enemy if they stay in the same spot for too long so it eliminates camping.\n\nThere are still some bad things though. When you go to iron sight mode the game changes from third to first person. It’s not a giant deal unless you are using the pistol. You can’t even see your own hands. It can be really annoying sometimes.\n\nAlso the game kind of is pay to win. If your guy has the most tricked out gun that he spent $2-$10 on you are screwed. That ♥♥♥♥is me off when you have pay to eon games. Besides that this game is really fun with your friends and can be a good challenge and a good change of game type.","April 10, 2014","true","3.3"," 49 of 76 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","49","76","0","0"

First of all don’t let my steam hours fool you because I probably have the most hours in this game than anyone else. I have participated in closed beta since the beginning of GRO which feels like decades ago and of course open beta too. This game very addictive, almost as addictive as chocolate or beer  and is very different from your other fav. Shooter games. It requires a lot of teamwork, precision aiming, 200% awareness, coordinated device usage, and lots of communication. Most people will tell you it’s a camping game but don’t be fooled by that because he who camps the most is likely to lose no matter what he has in his arsenal. There are multiple play styles to fit your needs, if you are a run and gun player then just customize your weapons (modmaster) with low ready time and get the feel for it. If you are a cover system player there are a lot of weapons for each class that will fit your needs. A lot of guys will say P2W, which was the hottest topic in the beta phases and the dev teams have worked really hard to make sure everyone (cash payers’ vs free players) can progress in this game decently. Now the economy is not at its best but trust me it has got a lot better in the past couple of months, weapons have been balanced so that even the lowest weapons can do decent damage so just because some kid is running around with a painted p90 doesn’t mean his the king, in GRP it’s 80% skills, 10% gear, and 10% spray and pray .  Now if you want to be competitive in this game and stay competitive you have to spend money or an insane amount of hour to grind for your gear, my advice is pay the 9.99 for AAA membership and get the 100% which last for 30days and gets you an insane amount of Athena Credits (in game currency). The AAA membership also gives you the chance to acquire some gear and weapon at a discount price with cash or Athena credits.\n\nThat was the pros about GRP now of course GRP isn’t even remotely close to  being the perfect game out there like any other game it has its bugs. Usually the hot topic is Match Making in all shooter games but I can’t give a negative review on that yet because in beta we had a small player pool and it sucked but now they implemented a new system of MM and it’s not going to start to take effect until the new players start leveling up and acquiring gear so I will wait on that. The other issues are, on all the maps there are cover glitches which will give advantage to one side and make you rage sometimes, there is also lag that will give you 1 or 2 grey hairs during your GRP experience, which is still the hottest topic with the dev team. My favorite bug of all is the genetically modified plants, which will blow your mind when you sniper rifle does 20 headshot damage. These are the major issues that will make you rage a lot as time goes on but GRP has a unique way of bringing out peoples rage trust me I’ve seen it all.\n\nOverall very good shooter game that is different from most shooter games out there, it’s very fun to play with friends and hear them when the game brings out their hidden inner rage and of course there is also that moment of satisfaction when you drop someone like a fly. The GM staff are fun and friendly to help you with all your problems just don’t be shy to contact them, the CMs are cool too usually they will help you out with a SOON(GRP joke) response and make sure if you have questions about the game or want to get better to visit the forums or go to peoples stream. If you want to see some youtube videos of clan matches or montage videos just visit youtube.com/ClanPhx and I stream at twitch.tv/bournelegacy too.\n","April 12, 2014","true","390.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosstrimboli/recommended/243870/","rosstrimboli","Trimaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosstrimboli/","568 products in account","As someone that spent ample time when this, while it was Ghost Recon Online Beta, I wanted to like this game; it was everything I was looking for in a multiplayer shooter; it was tactical, relied on teamwork more than your fire-power, and it emphasised skill and strategy.\n\nAesthetically, the game looks great, it is a well-polished game overall and perhaps one the most polished free-to-play titles since Team Fortress 2. Animations are top-notch with near expected triple A quality visuals. Weaponry is well modelled; gun-play is satisfying and the upgrade options almost limitless.\n\nMaps are linear, the reason why this is good is that a well-designed linear map creates a front for a team to win one; a “war-zone” where the team must work together and push as one, so fights are organised and aren’t death-pits such as what most generic multi-player FPS games offer.\n\nThe game starts you off in a ‘beginner’ bracket; everyone from the ranks of 1 to 7 is playing together, working out the mechanics, while each on their own is improving their skills. Those first few hours might be some of the best multi-player experiences one would ever have, and probably one of the best free-to-play experiences.\n\nBut then, when your class gets to rank 8, you graduate into the ‘veteran’ bracket. There is no in-between and no turning back; you’re dancing with the level 30+ big-boys now who can annihilate you on their own. In with that, you’re also competing with the unskilled pay-to-winners, the equipment they can buy will make them nearly invulnerable to just about anything and the guns… well, they can get ludicrously and horrendously overpowered and the snatching at your wallet becomes apparent.\n\nMatch making does not distinguish between paying and non-paying players, they say that matchmaking takes equipment and level into account, but because of how few people are playing, this doesn’t make the slightest difference. You will fight whoever is available. So because of vets who may have actually earned their equipment and the pay-to-winners that have bought everything without any development of their skills, the game dissolves from what was one of the classiest and advanced tactical cover shooters you’ve ever played to a Third Person Shooter version of CoD, with impervious tanks of immature pre-teens that have all found a way of maintaining a sexual relationship with your mother. It’s truly disappointing, as this game first appeared to appeal to the real fans, but then became a game that appealed to the standard shooter demographic.\n\nDon’t be fooled by this game claiming to be free-to-play. The play-to-win nature of this game is blatantly obvious and just flat out egregious. People may claim that you are free-to-play without paying, but this is an extremely disingenuous assertion. Not paying puts you at severe disadvantage where other players will steam roll you, and once you reach a certain level, most players would have paid. Ultimately, you will have two choices if you play this game; either, stop playing because you are out-competed, or start shelling out your cash, and I mean tons of it. Everything in this game is extremely high-priced.","December 17, 2015","false","52.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","1"

The cover system and the necessity of playing as a team gives the edge to skilled, experienced players over those who just have the best weapons. So, not really pay-to-win, but, all else being equal, better weapons DO give you an edge. I have had a lot of crashes with the game, which is very annoying, but the game is addictive enough that I keep coming back. The developers seem to be trying to improve both gameplay and the business model. As long as they do that, I'll keep playing.","November 19, 2014","true","659.7"," 41 of 64 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","41","64","4","0"

Earning times vs. purchase for in-game equipment were within a feasible realm, and nothing felt so powerful that strong team ethic could not counteract.\n"Ghost Recon Phantoms" is the evolution of a promising title, into perhaps the most galling example I have ever seen.  "Ghost Recon Farmville" would have been much more apt.\nWith guns approaching $50 (yes, for a single piece of equipment) and providing well over 100% performance increase, you'd be forgiven for wanting to pour all of your (EXTREMELY meager) point earnings into armor.  As it happens, purchased armor runs almost as expensive, with over 60% higher protective qualities for those who drop cash.\nSure you can earn these things without money, if you have (without exaggeration) hundreds or thousands of hours of legitimate gameplay.\nOr, wait... No, not without paying for XP and point increases.  Without those, you'll need to be playing well beyond the time that the servers will inevitably close.\n\nI cannot stress enough the absolute lack of integrity shown by the developers of this game, and the absolute and total destruction of what might have once been an enjoyable experience.  This game would nauseate Tom Clancy.  Not only does it not deserve the name, it doesn't deserve space on the hard drives of even the most desperate fans of modern tactical shooters.","April 18, 2014","false","2.6"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

I personally like this game much more than CoD. Let me explain. First of all: The gameplay. Not as many maps as CoD, but I prefer it that way.There are three classes: Recon, Assault, and Support. They all have different stats, roles, and abilities. A lot more depth than CoD. Also, unlike CoD, there is a cover mechanism implemented into the game, making more realistic and fun than running around shooting people randomly. The game is 3rd person except when aiming,\nwhich I personally think is better. Before I end this review, I would like to mention that even though I hated on CoD while writing this, CoD is a great game that deserves more respect than I gave it.

It's not an overstatement.\n\nTom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms, previously Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Online, is a tactical third-person-shooter with an excellent formula to ensure that the experience was truly tactical. Players are divided into teams of 8, contesting the ownership of control points that determines the victory of the match. Using covers, players can advance into a safe position, or even set up a defensive position. Players are also given devices that can turn the tide of the battle; a heat-emitting device that suppresses enemies, a device that projects a spherical field that deflects bullets, a cloak, and a few more of these amazing 'toys'. All these devices, however, must be used in coordination - failure to strategize moments to attack will only cause the waste of such precious devices, but can also push the team back. Communication is key - Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms upholds it, and the in-game voice-communication system supports it.\n\nThe best things about Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms can be summarized in a few points. The first one is its cover mechanics. No game has been able to reproduce the responsiveness of the cover mechanic that Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms employ. Control feels great that it was difficult to make mistakes. Another way this game shines above the rest is that Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms makes teamwork very crucial. It was actually very difficult to go through each match solo. This kind of teamwork is something that many games had tried to produce, but failed.\n\nHowever, no particular game has no flaw. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms has 2 problems within its gameplay. First - matchmaking is SOMETIMES flawed. Sometimes teams aren't distributed equally, leaving one team obnoxiously stronger than the other. Second - it was made pretty blatant that 'a Tier VII gun is better than a Tier I gun'. This means that players who just stepped into the battlefield may face a squad of veterans with their overpowered guns. Everyone can get these weapons, but they must commit to the game or pay money to get them quickly. This, however, is a day-one observation, and as the game grows, changes might be implemented.\n\nTom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms is amazing. If you ignore all the bad things, there is no other experience that is better than Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms.\n\nTrust me when I said it beats the living daylights out of other tactical shooters.\n\n\ntl;dr?\n\n+Great cover mechanics.\n+Huge emphasis on teamwork - and it's rewarding.\n\n-Sometimes flawed matchmaking (note that this is a day-one observation and user experience may vary).\n-Blatant unbalance in equipments. Solvable through dedication or paying money.\n\nP.S. This game is free. Give it a try before you drop it.","April 11, 2014","true","308.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/recommended/243870/","gadzooks","Gadzooks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gadzooks/","707 products in account","This is an strange game. Part of me wants to say dont play it, and another part of me want to say absolutely play it. Its fun, frustrating, in depth, enjoyable, and angering all at the same time. Let me explain.\n\nThe core game is fun. The mechanics work well, and are simple enough to jump right in with. The graphics, while not spectacular, are good enough to not complain about (although more video options would be nice). Its a very team oriented game, that heavily relies on communication, and using your classes abilities in sync with the rest of your team, to allow you to make successful pushes forward in each map.  I enjoy this aspect of the game more than other similar shooters out there, including CS, CoD, and Battlefield.\n\nMatch Making system. I have to mention this near the top, so as to make sure people to miss it. Match making in this game has no real element of balance, player skill, ranking, or anything outside of "8 people for team 1, 8 people for team 2" mixed into its programmed logic. 3 hours into the game, im ranking 287,000 or something, and I get thrown into a match with a 4 man clan that consisted of the #3 player, the #11 player, and the other 2 were somewhere in the top 100 still.\n\nYou WILL end up in a lot of games with players a LOT higher ranked than you. When this happens, it will be painfully obvious how unbalanced the game is. Not just based on skill (which is a HUGE thing in this game), but also from a pay 2 win perspective. High ranked people WILL have better armor, better mods (you may not even HAVE mods), and higher tier weapons than you. They WILL kill you with fewer bullets that it takes you to kill them, because of this.\n\nClass advancement. This is one of the games strengths and weaknesses. The number of ways you can advance your class via weapons, armor, gear, proficiencies, mods, etc is just immense. This adds a longevity to the game by giving you something to always strive for, and new things to try to master. How is this a weakness you might ask? One simple reason. The payment model this game uses is AWFUL. I had to double check and make sure this game wasnt made by EA (more than once).  After you get the first amount of quick injected game credits, the rate at which you earn in game currency is SOOOO slow that it would take simply forever to earn much of anything in this game. For example, you seem to earn around 300-500 credits per game. Games can easily go on for 30 minutes per game. Many in game items cost THOUSANDS of credits. Even as much as 140k. To buy said item, you would need to play over 400 games for that ONE item.\n\nTo make matters worse, the game constantly wants you to spend your credits on other things, aside from weapons you might like to use. Such as simple things, like standard grenades. No, you dont get grenades as part of your standard arsenal. Even though grenades DO give players a pretty big advantage over players without them. Not having grenades IS a disadvantage. Can you live with it? Sure, but its still a handicap that you are playing with by not having them. You also need to pay for things like armor repairs (your armor doesnt last forever), any weapon mods you might want (things like different scopes, silencers, stocks, laser sights, etc), devices for your class (the thing that gives each class their unique abilities) and mods for all of those items as well.\n\nSimply put, every additional item you spend your credits on, means its THAT much longer for you to save up to buy that ONE weapon you might want to play with. So that 400+ games to earn that new rifle, now might become 500 or 600 games you have to play, if you are spending your credits on other things to remove any disadvantage you might have while playing. Some might call this Pay 2 Win, and in a sense, it is. Except, you dont have to pay real money for these things. You pay in game currency. The end results is that the game has this HUGE list of things you can expand your character with, but its at a rate that is sooo slow that it practically drives you crazy. A well modeled payment plan inspires the player to spend real money to avoid "time" needed to earn stuff for free while still making the "time" element still feasibly sensible. This games "time" is soo awful, that it makes you angry at the game, rather than making you want to spend money on the game.\n\nThe games only saving grace when it comes to the payment model, is the Infinity Pack. For basically 20 bucks, you are essentially "buying" the game, like you would with Battlefield or CoD. 20 bucks is a reasonable price for any game, and for that amount, they give you pretty much everything in the game, minus the unique items (like the assassin creed armor and weapon skins).\n\nSo in the end, why am i recommending this game? Well, match making and the slight pay 2 win element aside, its fun. Especially if you dont mind dropping a 1 time fee of 20 bucks (may not last forever). Also, the more new players that play, the better the match making will be for those of us who arent in the top 100, or even the top 500. The game needs more people willing to stick it out beyond the first 2 hours of play, so that the game matches are better balanced. It IS a good tactical, team based shooter. One that, imo, requires more skill than the arcade fest of past military games that are out there. Well balanced matches are some of the most fun ive had in a long time, and in order for that to happen more, this game needs more players.","January 5, 2015","true","74.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

You get one of the best multiplayer games around, looking & playing(solid controls)and once you figure out which class you want to specialize in you just play to unlock & buy what you need with in game currency then use about $20-$40 to even out the playing field once you hit the higher teens. Its fair considering how much games cost off the shelf. If you want to upgrade more than one class then you might end up spending a little more than a normal game but I just consider how much the dlc would cost that they will be delivering for free. I truely hope people understand that the devs need to make money some how & this one is fair and then give it a chance so it doesnt die out.\n\nUpdated 4/4/16: The gameplay & purchase options haven't changed too much from first 6 months. Unfortunately they don't seem to be able to keep up with the amount of cheating going on anymore. I played 5 matches & maybe it was just an off day but in every single match almost every player on the opposite team & my own was either using health cheats or infinite specials w/ cloak being the favoured among the little punks. I made sure to space out my playthrous enough to catch more than one group which, if you know Phantoms lobby wait times you know this was along ♥♥♥ time! It's too bad because this was a fun & fair f2p. It may have been light on locations but what it had was solid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NawtyDawg/recommended/243870/","NawtyDawg","DreamOn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NawtyDawg/","49 products in account","The Ghost Recon franchise started all the way back with Ghost Recon (NOTHING). It was made in 2002 (i think), and focuse on long drawn out missions with intense stealthy fights and very enjoyable gameplay. The firefights were addicting, the sneaking around trying to do the objectives was addicting - it was all very addicting. Even the split screen on the OG XBOX was amazing. I spent countless hours with my sneaking down a dark corridor only to have my brother jump out of a corner, blow me to bits and scare the crap out of me. That was by far the best Ghost Recon yet. Ghost Recon 2 came along. Ghost Recon 2 Summit Strike and Ghost Recon 2 First Contact. Those were also bloody amazing. It expanded on the weapons system, had enormous maps in which you had to plan your moves carefully, and were afraid that someone was gonna come jumping out of the woods. The split screen was yet again amazing. I remember playing with my brother against to of my cousins. The enemy was hiding under a bridge right next to a small hut surrounded by a  farm. My brother and I split up. He went through the woods and I snuck through the cornfield on my belly. Pretty soon we jumped out of nowhere, flanked em and destroyed them. We all laughed - hard. Next came Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter. This is where it went awry in a way. It was still loads of fun but it left behind the stealth feel to Ghost Recon and proceded with urban close up combat. The campaign was still a blast as it was difficult but it didn't feel like the Ghost Recon I knew. The split screen was even better, offering you awesome intense 2v2 battles that would stick in your memory forever. Next came along Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2. I don't know much about this game except that It was much like GRAW 1. I never played GRAW 2. Next came Ghost Recon Future Soldier. This one was okay. It went back to the stealth roots of Ghost Recon during the campaign and was enjoable but didn't carry the same feel as the older ones. It was still a great game, but the multiplayer was on the sketchy side. There was a Ghost Recon for the wii but that failed. The additions to Ghost Recon 1, Jungle Storm and Island Thunder were both fun too. Now, then came along Ghost Recon: Phantoms. The thing Im here to review. Here is where everything Ghost Recon was about, was dropped. The stealth aspect is completely gone, the ony gamemodes there are is conquest and domination eg. CAPTURE THIS CAPTURE THAT. DEFEND THIS DEFEND THAT. It simply dropped the feel of the entire Ghost Recon series. Good job Ubisoft! Kudos to you. The cover system is okay, and there are a variety of weapons that you can upgrade. It was fun for the first 20 hours when everyone had the same weapons and everything was fair. If you wanted better guns, you earned them by doing well. Then after level 5, everything went ludicrous and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You have people wielding lvl 9 guns when ur lvl 2 and armor that lets you not even tickle them. They paid easily 50 - 100 $ on all this stuff and so there's nothing I can do to get new weapons except stand up and die (which does nothing). So, the decisions is yours. Im tired of it, but if you have a friend it can be bearable. Cheers!","October 31, 2014","false","83.5"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

This game is not kind to new commers nor players who don't pay.\n\nReasons\n1. If you don't pay the 9,99 a month for the increase EXP/Eagle ( Money) Gain, it will take you forever, and I mean forever to get 16000 for a gun.\n2. Store bought weapons do AR,SMG,SPR,LMG all in one class, Clearly shows this game doesn't not know how to balance nor do they want too.\n3. It's Ubisoft, Please don't complain about it being P2W because it is. No matter how you look at it, it is. You can be level 1 and buy a 15 dollar gun to dominate the gun. You don't even need to be really good with it either.\n4. If you still get into the game, be ready for very bad balancing in the matchmaking. Level 400s against level 7s ( Yeah, like battlefield but worst)\n5. Poor Community\n\nThis is just a bonus, Everyone who defends this game that it isn't P2W. Don't believe them, I paid 30 bucks so far in guns and dominate games. True I've been playing a while but these guns are so easy to use. I sometimes don't even use them for the fact their OP, rather wait til someone shows up with WAR ( OP store Bought but offer In game currency to buy at 100000s range....so no it's impossible for you to earn normally)\n\n\nSo to summarize, Don't download this game unless your ready to pay money. Community is small and terrible so don't expect any kind treatmeant.\nBut if you happen to actually wanna play it, Good luck.","April 18, 2014","false","515.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/recommended/243870/","codamadius","Frillin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/codamadius/","139 products in account","I'm going to start by saying that anyone who addresses this game as "another pay to win" game clearly either just aren't tactical enough or good enough. Yes, it's true that you can buy weapons and armor. But weapons and armor mean absolutely nothing if your teammates won't work together. This is the best tactical FPS I've ever played because it runs and FEELS like one. In fact, I question all the other 'tactical FPS' shooters after playing this one. Because most that carry that title still really feel like a run n gun shooter. In this game, teamwork truly counts. You could have a team of all elite players and another team with all level ones and the newbies could easily win. And of course vise versa.\n\nThe good: TCGRP is a very well polished game. It lets you keep track of where your teammates are on the battlefield by highlighting them and creating a sort of "dot to dot" link between you and them when close by. The game uses the third person cover system that we all know and love from games like Splinter Cell and Uncharted. When you enter cover it even tells you the bonuses for doing so and of course it makes it feel like an actual guerilla warfare battle and it's a great way to ambush your opponents. And something you'll all love to hear: PAY TO WIN DOESN'T APPLY TO THIS GAME. I've played matches with a team with all pay to win guns and armor....and lost terribly to lower levels simply because our team refused to work well together. So go ahead and waste money; but it never guarantees your victory. In fact, it barely guarantees an advantage at all.\n\nThe bad: Lag. Every game has it and it's unavoidable. Is it the game itself? No. It is other players and has (to my knowledge with all my experience thus far) nothing to do with the servers or game at all. I've never lagged before. But I have been killed through walls after peeking out due to huge differences in connection. Could it be hacking? Of course. But I've heard no rumors or complaints about it other than the usual whiny player who rages because he isn't doing good and thinks himself a pro player.\n\nOne of the big differences to this game compared to almost all other shooters is that it's hard to avoid grenades. It's annoying of course; but realistic. Armor really weighs you down whether it's light or heavy so it should be. If the developers see this: add a somersault system. Not a lightning fast one but a realistic one like you've done with everything else. It'll add to the already really good experience. And see if you can come up with some unique gameplay modes! I highly recommend downloading and being a part of this awesome experience.","May 1, 2014","true","27.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The experience is enhanced when playing with a team you know or a clan.\n\nYou earn in game currency called AC and you can buy GC with real money.  The game is targeted to the audience who are willing to pay some money  to compete with the best. So it is a little on the pay to win side, but newerr players are given free armour and weapons in the first levels. They earn  10x the AC at the first 10 levels so it easy to get a high tier weapon or armour by grinding in the first stages. Plus steam aways give free unique weapons on special holidays or events so keep your eyes peeled.\n\nI recommend the game, give it some time to adjust your self to the play style. If you can predict what your enemies are planning on doing then the level in tiers wont matter.  Good gaming and good hunting.","November 5, 2014","true","256.6"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

The gameplay is actually quite engaging. It's just like online rendition of Gears of War (With 3 choice of classes with different tactics). The stealth and cover aspect of the game is well made, and it offers a different perspective than CS:GO style of play. However the loadouts are frustrating. As a starter we got packed by few (two main weapon and one secondary for each class) lousy guns, which is sucks, rather than a fair selection weapon. To progress, we can grind our way to get in-game currency thru matches, or just cash-in some money to get an early purple-colored (yes, epic tier weapon..it's color coded like diablo) gun that will own people easily. And yes, if you have some cash to spare you can buy a high tier armor that will protect you like a hardened Metapod.\n\nThey even have "upgrade" menu for each weapon. Imagine Crysis games. We can change the scope, stock, barrel etc. Of course, with a charge of in-game currency or cash.\n\nIMO they need to get rid of the Pay 2 Win feature. Let people have the selection of weapon like CS:GO, let them grind in-game currency for the upgrade, and if this game really need a cash since it's a F2P game, let it be on weapon/armor skins.","April 18, 2014","false","3.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

What i like about this game is really the tactical aspect of it, In this game you really need your teammates to survive because you can't cover all the possible enemy advancement and you need your teammates to cover that for you, and they need you to cover their back as well. The gameplay mechanic is tactical but you just do the tactical part without the game force you to do that. Like when your teamates is behind the enemy line and you have a scanner to scan the enemy position, you just know that you need to use that to support your teammates so they didn't get killed from behind. And the game reward you with point everytime you help your teammates. Or when one of your teammates is using shield bubble to deflect bullet from him and all his teammates, you just know that you have to go with him and support his back so you both can advance to the enemy position without getting killed. Doing all of that is very fun and satisfying, knowing that you helped your teammates advance just because you use scanner to scan the enemy position is very satisfying.\nBut, what i kinda didn't like about this game is the fact that this game is really pay to win. There's couple of very powerful weapon like the P90 Gold that you need to pay real money to get that. But, even though it is pay to win, i'm glad to pay a couple of dollars just to experience this game. Because it is that good.\nI recommend this to all people that think CS GO competitive is too serious or COD is too arcade like.\n","July 7, 2014","true","56.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","2"

After only playing a handful of beginner matchmaking matches I found myself coordinating over the mic with other players, calling out targets and enemy movement because of the importance of doing so. This is not a run and gun game, thinking tactically is what helps wins games here.\n\nThe game has objective based scoring. You cannot even see the kills and deaths of other players, something that an objective based teamplay game really benefits from because it changes the mindset of the players to get the objective and not try to simply rack up kills.\n\nFor a free to play game, it's definitely worth a look. I'd give it a score of 8/10 for a free to play game. The game loses points for the atrocious menu music.

Being that it is free to play, i didnt expect much more than a poorly designed game in which skill was replaced by your wallet.  After a few days now of playing i can see that was very much not the case.\n\nIn this game, i could spend money and buy everything and it would probably only make the difference of surviving one or two more shots, and maybe killing in 1-2 less shots.  While this does give a small advantage, you can still be the top player in a game  full of paying players without having paid a dime(ive been there).  Let alone with a little grinding you can purchase most everything in the game.\n\nThe game requires a little thought, and a lot of team work to be successful.  Every class has a choice of picking 1 of 2 abilities, and using those abilities at the right moment, as well as your team responding to when you use them, can quite often be the difference in a match.  Positioning is crucial, and sometimes knowing an enemies path and picking the right moment to position somewhere randomly in that path can score you 3-4 easy kills and turn the tide of a game.  This is where skill and intelligence beats out the small advantage money gives you, as i rack up a good deal of my kills off flanking and pushing up to take cover in an enemies path that they probably dont expect me to be.\n\nFor the CoD fans, there are moments where you can just rush around a corner and go off....sometimes it works, however against a smart team it more than likely wont.  For fans of games that require skill, and team work....this game is perfect.  There are even clan matches and rankings which i havent gotten in to yet, so i wont review those.\n\nAll in all i give this game a 9/10 for my interest in shooters.  The only point im taking off is the lack of diversity in game types, although i dont get bored because of that, it would be nice to have different game modes besides capturing points, such as just team deathmatch on smaller maps, or the good ole "plant/defuse bomb" mode.\n\nTLDR:  Give it a try, not pay2win, takes some skill and thought and is pretty addicting.","April 20, 2014","true","74.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

The controls are easy to get used to, the graphics are great, it's well balanced, it's really fun, and it generally plays well. But most of all, it's free. You have nothing to lose and there's no reason not to at least give it a try.","April 13, 2014","true","67.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The damage system is fun and gives off an RPG feel a la Borderlands. The cover system is currently buggy and sometimes unintuitive. The modding of weapons is fun to use if a little sparse of choice. The class system is restrictive but brings some interesting elements with unique activatables and auras. Currently, the matchmaking takes you into a beginning queue until you have a class at Lvl 8 after which you are matched with everyone else. While in a match you cannot switch classes, sticking you with a choice of two primary weapon types and a secondary handgun, depeneding on your class.\n\nThe main problems I had with the game were with the progression system and the in-game market.\n\nYou use in-game currency to buy weapons, armor, mods, grenades, special ammo (Magnum Ammo +20% Dmg), and cosmetics. The weapons used in game are seperated into tiers 1-7. These weapons, from what I've seen, scale linearly and have to be unlocked in order. The tier 7 weapons and equipment are outright better than any previous tier, and even have an in-game metric to show it. You can either use the in-game earned currency to buy these, or buy a seperate currency to purchase them with. From what I've experienced, you are not matched seperately based on the tier of your equipment, and as such can be match against someone using a much higher tier of equipment than you. The disparity in power is great enough that it's obvious when someone has better gear.\n\nYou may get to the same gear, eventually, but paying with money is much faster and easier. But until you do, it's simple, you're stuff sucks, their stuff doesn't.","April 18, 2014","false","5.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I haven't played a Ghost Recon game since Advanced Warfighter 2 on console, and I must say, this is a nice change of pace. Fire fights are intence and fun, and your team actually communicates with mics instead of calling each other ♥♥♥♥ like in CoD. This has to do with the fact it's a very team based game so nobody can just run around randomly, coordination and tactics are what you must use to win the fight. I also love the fact that this is in third person, unlike Warfighter 2 where multiplayer was in first and single player was the only mode in 3rd. Even though it's free to play, I don't feel like this is a pay to win game at all, weapons are very reasonably priced with in-game currency and besides, weapons make a difference but you can do well with the default guns given to you. I recommend this game to anyone who loves a good fire fight, power struggle, and team based shooter tactics. So pick it up and play, have yourself a blast! Why not?

Me, a Support and an Assault have just cleared out all the enemies from Capture Point Charlie. I’ve taken some shots on the way, leaving my hitpoints in the red. I hug cover while my teammates guard both sides, communicating enemy positions through VOIP and asking for support. The point is 90 percent capped… that’s when things go south.\n\nAn enemy sniper takes out the Assault, who managed to identify the enemy’s position right before he is shot. Anticipating the enemy’s rush to retake the objective, my support pops his Active Protection System, a “Bubble” that deflects all incoming fire. He then opens up with his light machine gun, taking down two of the flankers. The bubble shields him from bullets, but not the grenade that clunks right behind him. Soon, I’m the last one left on the point. Amidst the confusion and gunfire, the enemies fail to notice the transparent, human-like figure near them. As my Cloak energy runs out, I relay the last known position of the sniper to my newly respawned teammates before squeezing the trigger on my PP-19 submachine gun. One, two, three bursts take out three of my assailants before my screen flashes red. I die, but the enemy team is thinned out, and my team recaptures the point, swinging the balance to our favor.\n\nTense moments like these are the norm in Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Phantoms, a free-to-play tactical action game from Ubisoft Singapore. What originally started off as Ghost Recon Online, it has been in development and beta since August 15, 2012. The game has undergone numerous updates since then, and has been released completely on Steam, April 10, 2014.\n\n\nThe game features three unique classes, with two interchangeable abilities and two types of weapons for each class, allowing for many different playstyles. Weapons and armor can be further customized with an assortment of attachments, and players are able to effectively turn submachine guns into medium-ranged carbines, or sniper rifles into assault weapons.You can play as a countersniper, using optical camouflage to outsmart enemy marksmen, or a bullrushing assault that prefers to use shotguns and a ballistic shield. The choice is yours.  Classes can only be chosen at the beginning, although active and passive special abilities can be swapped between each respawn. All weapons are highly lethal, and players die in a heartbeat from concentrated fire, making cover, positioning and teamwork more important than twitch reflexes. This is made more important by the fact that most maps have a linear nature to them, and it becomes difficult to assault an entrenched enemy position without proper use of skills or coordination with other classes.\n\n\nHowever, don’t be fooled: Despite the simple linearity of the maps, there is a lot of depth to them. The maps resemble those from Counterstrike or even League of Legends, with multiple lanes to attack or defend from, different avenues of approach, and tons of cover. All maps are objective-based and most have multiple objectives, allowing both teams to simultaneously attack and defend a single point at a time. Due to the game’s cover system (a system similar to that of Rainbow Six: Vegas, Ghost Recon: Future Soldier and Splinter Cell: Blacklist), which allows players to have a small field of view from cover and shoot people that run around carelessly, it becomes necessary to know when to suppress and flank. It also takes a while for your Ghost or Phantom to aim down his weapon after sprinting. In this game, slow is smooth and smooth is fast. All this comes together in higher level matches, where it is literally a game of inches. Each team slowly pushes, suppresses and flanks, outsmarting and outmaneuvering the enemy team.\n\n\nWhat makes the game so fun is its metagame, or how all these variables affect the balance and overall gameplay. Teamwork is everything in this game. It isn’t uncommon in higher level public matches for players to develop a gameplan at the lobby. For example: A Recon sends out a sonar pulse and detects enemies, before two Supports go in with a Bubble and use the EMP, effectively disabling nearby enemy skills. Two Assaults then suppress enemies with microwaves, preventing them from attacking, while a cloaked Recon flanks and wipes out what’s left of the enemy team. Winning teams call out enemy locations and guard each others flanks. There’s even a thin line showing if the teammate guarding your exposed side is still alive. The coordination required to win is akin to the huge teamfights found in MOBAs like League of Legends, and a balanced, well synchronized team can overcome great odds.\n\n\nThe game has received some criticism for its Class Progression system, where players are required to unlock each tier of weapon and armor or device before unlocking the next tier. This can be done through in-game currency or real cash. Weapon tiers are diagonal in the game, and while higher tier weapons may not perform better than a lower-tier one in a specific area, they are usually better in more areas than the lower tier weapon. However, players can augment and upgrade their lower tier weapon to match these higher tier ones, and at the end of the day, good positioning and four bullets kills an enemy better compared to three bullets from a higher tier weapon and a badly positioned player.\n\nWhile I do agree that it can be a grind to amass the in-game currency, a study in the game’s forum (http://groforums.ubi.com/showthread.php?31651-Economy-Inspection-and-Presentation-for-GRP) has shown that a player can either grind 30-40 hours into the game to get what is considered one of the best weapons right now, or pay $10 for it – a player can also purchase a lower tier weapon and fully customize it for that price. For a game that is free-to-play, I personally believe paying $10 is enough for the quality you’re receiving and that the pay system only provides flexibility for players who don’t have the time to invest in the game, and want to unlock more options or specialize in their weapons.\n\n\nThis tactical action game sets itself above the rest by providing its players with something different from most FPS and third-person shooters in the market through its emphasis on communication, tactics and teamwork.  Slow and tactical at times, and fast and frenetic at others, the best matches will have you communicating with your team, supporting them in their pushes, flanking with them, getting wiped out with them and even befriending them after the match ends. It has a lot of similarities with some of the best e-sports titles like League of Legends and DotA. If steered in the right direction by developers, I’d expect to see this game get huge in the competitive scene. Check it out if you haven’t already. It’s damn good and it’s free.","April 28, 2014","true","068.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","1"

It has added a few things from the beta (GRO). Most of these I haven't seen yet, but I can still say this is definitely worth your time.\n\nThe gameplay of GRP is awesome. It has a solid cover system that keeps this game from being too generic. The overall gameplay takes place in third-person, but switches to first-person when you aim which can greatly improve your accuracy. There are three different classes: Assault, Recon (my favorite), and Specialist. The Assault class is pretty much your normal soldier, Recon is more of a stealth class, and Specialist which I honestly don't know a whole lot about since I haven't really played as it. Each class has two special abilities such as the ability to turn invisible or scan the area to detect enemies, however these can only be eqipped one at a time. You can also buy gadgets like gunshot detectors. There are several weapons to use, from pistols to shotguns to sniper rifles to machine guns. They are all customizable so you can make your own unique weapon. The maps are pretty good size and offer lots of cool areas for battles.\n\nThe graphics for this game look great. Visually, Phantoms looks quite different from Online, making indoor areas darker and the default costume for your character is a dark color which is also different from GRO.\n\nAlthough it is definitely not neccessary to buy things with real money in this game as it gives you a fairly good amount of in-game money, there is one thing I don't like about GRP: the fact that your character can only be customized if you pay real money. There isn't much character customization, just being able to switch uniforms, but I wouldn't mind if there were maybe three or four different uniforms to choose from without putting real money into this game. But if you don't want to spend money on character customization you'll be stuck with the default uniform.\n\nGhost Recon Phantoms (and Ghost Recon Online) is possibly the mot fun online game I've ever played. A good cover system and fun gameplay make this game unforgettable. If you like third-person shooters, cover shooters, or just want to have some fun online I highly reccomend Ghost Recon Phantoms. 9/10","April 11, 2014","true","8.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

So many people complaining about pay-to-win etc. etc. but its truly a matter of tactical decision making, team work and strategy. The weapons can be farmed and the differences between bottom and top tier weapons are hardly anything to get upset over. This game is the tactical shooter version of World of Tanks, and matchmaking is really good. If you're a bit out-gunned by people who dump tons of money on the game you still be combat effective (again, because paying doesnt mean auto-win).  Scout, COMMUNICATE, and use support items to assist your team. This is NOT Call of Duty so if you're ok with a slower pace and more team oriented game then this is recommended for you.","April 11, 2014","true","94.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It has added a few things from the beta (GRO). Most of these I haven't seen yet, but I can still say this is definitely worth your time.\n\nThe gameplay of GRP is awesome. It has a solid cover system that keeps this game from being too generic. The overall gameplay takes place in third-person, but switches to first-person when you aim which can greatly improve your accuracy. There are three different classes: Assault, Recon (my favorite), and Specialist. The Assault class is pretty much your normal soldier, Recon is more of a stealth class, and Specialist which I honestly don't know a whole lot about since I haven't really played as it. Each class has two special abilities such as the ability to turn invisible or scan the area to detect enemies, however these can only be eqipped one at a time. You can also buy gadgets like gunshot detectors. There are several weapons to use, from pistols to shotguns to sniper rifles to machine guns. They are all customizable so you can make your own unique weapon. The maps are pretty good size and offer lots of cool areas for battles.\n\nThe graphics for this game look great. Visually, Phantoms looks quite different from Online, making indoor areas darker and the default costume for your character is a dark color which is also different from GRO.\n\nAlthough it is definitely not neccessary to buy things with real money in this game as it gives you a fairly good amount of in-game money, there is one thing I don't like about GRP: the fact that your character can only be customized if you pay real money. There isn't much character customization, just being able to switch uniforms, but I wouldn't mind if there were maybe three or four different uniforms to choose from without putting real money into this game. But if you don't want to spend money on character customization you'll be stuck with the default uniform.\n\nGhost Recon Phantoms (and Ghost Recon Online) is possibly the mot fun online game I've ever played. A good cover system and fun gameplay make this game unforgettable. If you like third-person shooters, cover shooters, or just want to have some fun online I highly reccomend Ghost Recon Phantoms. 9/10","April 11, 2014","true","8.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The cover system is fluid and satisfying, although a bit sticky at times, and using the near-future gadgets and devices available is thrilling and empowering. My only complaints so far is that you can easily get equipment and weapons out of your skill class by paying money. This makes for an annoying situation in which you join a game with your fellow newbies, everyone equipped with standard startup gear except for one player, who has dumped so much money into the game that his armor is twice anyone else's and his health regenerates almost instantly. These player can be taken down with the right amount of teamwork and some good flanking, and they are fortunately far and few in between, but they bring down the game as a whole. Fortunately, the rest of the game is good enough to mostly excuse this.","April 14, 2014","true","9.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

However after lvl 5, you enter that division were everyone is and you are outgunned majorly, from a teams perspective the game is still playable because on your team there will be people who have purchased weapons as well, but you personally will die, alot.

There's no doubt about that. They make you buy ♥♥♥♥ing grenades.../grenades/. The perks of giving them your wallet is that you can get double XP and some more points to buy more, better guns as well as attachments. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recom Phantoms really shows what a Pay to Win game is all about.\n\nBesides that, the game is HEAVILY unbalanced in many different areas. Team balancing is a total joke, gun balancing makes me wonder if the devs have ever shot a gun in their life, and the whole game is a big buggy mess. Sometimes I'll get put on a team filled with a bunch of low ranked players while the other team is stacked with a bunch of people who spent a bunch of money on the game to reck everyone. It happens in reverse too. Gun balancing is terrible. Somehow an LMG is all the sudden a GREAT gun for ♥♥♥♥ing close quaters combat, who gives a ♥♥♥♥ about SMG's. Spawn camping is a massive issue, you'll frequently find yourself stabbing pencils in your eyes as snipers hold down the spawn with no way of being able to get out. Bugs are also very common. People are able to shoot through thick, concrete walls with nothing but a SMG. There are also instances where I could unload a whole mag into another persons face and they don't die whatsoever, or even get damaged(They weren't using abilities or anything...).\n\nThis game is utter ♥♥♥♥ and it gave me ebola cancer.","October 30, 2014","false","4.7"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

It has its slight flaws and bugs, but for a free to play game (albeit slightly suffering from microtransactions) it's definitely worth checking out, or at least worth the two hour download and ~4gb hard drive space.\n\nIn regards to the microtransactions, you also have the option to unlock all of the add-ons in the game through points acquired via gameplay. Therefore, no real money has to actually be spent and people with credit cards are not at a real advantage (hooray!). It is, however, faster to unlock things with real money... but isn't that the case with all mt based games?\n\nStarting out in multiplayer is pretty easy. Some games, such as titles in the Battlefield franchise, are quite daunting to start out with as you are paired against multitudes of experienced players with all of the most advanced loadouts. Here you get put through bootcamp, where you're able to develop your skills, become accustomed to the maps and get a feel for the game without having to face any unfair match ups. Also, helpful unlocks come pretty quickly and the starter loadouts are pretty alright to begin with. So if you're a noob to shooters, never fear.\n\nTL;DR Noob friendly, easy to get into, microtransactions don't negatively affect the game, and generally as fun as a Tom Clancy third person shooter can get.","April 20, 2014","true","5.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegamer367/recommended/243870/","thegamer367","caesar salad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegamer367/","105 products in account","To kick this review off, I'll start by saying that this game is actually pretty good.\n\nNot great, but it's good. I'll go over why I say this later.\n\nThe gameplay and cover systems are very solid and I never really felt like I wasn't in control of my character during the heat of battle. Gunfire can be very deadly, so sticking to the safety of cover is an absolute must if you want to stay alive. Not all cover is safe though, and every entry point will need to be covered to prevent the enemy from pushing through and flanking your defenses. Map design is somewhat lackluster on particular maps, but most will offer interesting and different scenarios of engagement that are balanced for both sides. Tactics and strategies are a must if your team plans on winning, and coordination and timing amongst team members helps accomplish this. Gadgets, such as the ADS drone or the APS (AKA bubble shield), can be very big game changers when it comes to pushing objectives, which causes the opposite team to change up their tactics to counter these devices, either by coordinating the team or using their own tech. Another great feature I really liked was the use of "beginner playlists", so that you could get a hold of the game's mechanics gradually and be able to compete with players of your own skill level. Overall, the base/default weaponry and gadgets are all decently balanced with each other and, along with the cover system, provide a solid and fun game experience for the tactical player.\n\nNow to move onto what's bad about this game.\n\nThis flawed gem is what most could call a "pay to win" game, and most would be right in saying so. Before actually purchasing weapons, you are allowed to try them out in the Firing Range. Most, if not almost ALL the weapons I tried from the store were far better that the default weapons you're given at the start of the game, with only minor disadvantages in VERY SPECIFIC scenarios. I've had times where I'll be up against a guy with a store bought weapon and will be ultimately killed almost instantly, even though I had cover to protect me and overall had a better a chance to kill him before he killed me. Of course there are times when it's nearly impossible for me to win, but when a guy comes completely out of his own cover and kills you instantaneously, you know something's wrong. These "pay to play" weapons are generally overpowered and unfair compared to the defaults, and can really detract from the overall fun and competitiveness of this game. I should also mention too that when you purchase weapons in this game, you keep them forever. That might seem like a good thing, but this is the ONLY OPTION, meaning that players that aren't willing to fork over the money needed will not be able to use these guns until they've saved up enough in-game credits to buy it. Credits you earn are dependent on how well you play in matches, and even the most experienced players will have a hard time earning enough to buy these guns.\n\nAnother large issue I noticed was the overuse of grenades in this game, so much to the point that my game had actually crashed one time, just from the massive amount of explosion effects going on all at once. The only types so far are frags and HE (high explosive), and they are purchasable "consumables" items, meaning that not every player will always have them unless they purchase them from the store. During a match, only 2 can be used per respawn out of the whole stock you might have in your inventory. From a playability standpoint, grenades are an EXTREMELY crucial part to being aggresive in this game. They're very helpful when pushing up flanking chokepoints, as not only could it drive enemies out of cover or just kill them right there, but it also disorients enemies aiming down their sights, which can provide you a window to be able to push up without them hitting you with a single bullet. This can be very useful against enemy snipers guarding an area.\n\nThe main issue with grenades is just how easy it can be to spam them like crazy and drive back a whole team without shooting your gun once. They CAN NOT be thrown back towards your foes, so your only option is to either run away from them, or suck it up and take it like man, getting damaged in the process. Having what seems like a clusterbomb fall on top of nearly all the cover on your side of the map can be a real pain, and it halts you and your whole team from being able to push up and be aggresive when taking an objective. I can understand that grenades can be useful for a team when they're getting pushed back, or when a bubble sheild assault on an objective happens, but I shouldn't have to worry about whether or not I'll get bombarded by what seems likes millions of them. In short, grenades are a great idea gameplay wise, but fall short due to their easy overuse and power they possess.\n\nSo do I recommend this game?\n\nTo the players that are willing to spend time to get good at this game, then yes I do. While P2W guns are obviously game-breaking, they shouldn't be considered "god weapons", and experienced players that know what they're doing can stand a decent chance against them. While they can be extremely annoying, grenade spams can still be avoided in most cases, as long as you're paying attention. Strategies and team coordination can sometimes make these issues almost non-existant, as long as everyone is working together as a team by making callouts or providing cover fire at the right moments. As for the more casual group of gamers, feel free to skip over this. Unless you want to spend time training yourself, this game will not be very enjoyable for you. This can be a very serious game at times, and most games I've joined have had at least a few people providing callouts and issuing commands for the team to follow.\n\nIf you enjoy third-person shooters that involve tactics and strategies to achieve victory, feel free to check this one out. You just might like it.","April 20, 2014","true","26.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Its a FTP but if you want to get anywhere you kind of have to buy in.  It sucks playing the game for free and getting own by people with their elite guns and mods.  Every 2 or so matches to need to buy nades or something which sucks because it cost more than what you win.  I think pwning a match youshouldn't go broke replacing your nades.  Try it out you might just get hooked.","November 18, 2014","true","728.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Nonetheless, GRO is very fun and has unique gameplay with a class-based system.\n\nP.S. Sometimes they give free DLC so i'll give them kudos for that.\n\nEDIT: Once you reach level 5 with any class, you stop being placed with rookies so make sure you try out all 3 up to level 4 before going on, as you will be placed with people with alot more equipement/skills. Don't forget this is a tactical shooter (let alone a Ghost Recon game) so you will need to use cover and distance to your advantage.","January 14, 2014","true","8.3"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

Gameplay is solid and responsive. The addition of "Ready Time" is somewhat welcomed, when it works that is. Allows for more tactical gameplay and slightly less run and gun.\nAlthough many say its a Pay to Win game, new players aren’t severely punished. With practice and a team that communicates, the advantage of buying up is diminished. Grinding for better weapons doesn’t take as long as other games. Would've liked the option to customize my character. If I remember correctly, they did allow this in the Beta, but it seems they took it away.\nFor a free game, its pretty good.","April 15, 2014","true","39.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Now all of my friends had begginer weapons keep in mind, going up against people who bought thier guns. We had some strategies from other games we have played, and we HAULED ---. We ended the match every time by capturing all the points.\n\nOne strategy: The line up: All assaults bring up ballistic shield, charge forward and push back the enemy. Once the shield wears off, fall back and have the heavy move forward in key points, with assault following close behind. While all this is happening, recons with snipers on the way back. We took the bridge map around 4 minutes with that strategy.\n\nBest game. 9.5/10\n\n-.5 for the shotgun noobs","April 11, 2014","true","41.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The three classes are solid, especially working in tandem.  The maps could use more diversity, and so too could the guns--but the game is mere footsteps out of beta and therefore has some ways to go.\n\nMy gripe is with the players.  The community of people I've gamed with have been helpful and even chatty on the mics (which is somewhat unusual in these games because most gamers are not that social)--unfortunately, the developers needs money and they get yours by having you pay to win.  That's right, buy all the guns and armor you want, kids--grab that credit card like tomorrow never comes because it'll totally help you beat my ♥♥♥ every day.  I don't care if it helps the developers--I'd rather you ran a script and needed to kill me via a third-party program than simply forked over more cash for the gold killswhoever.  And when it's a whole team of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you get the unluck of being slotted against because--and here's another ♥♥♥♥ing problem--the matchmaking doesn't take into account your equipment.  It hardly takes into account your qualifications/medals and therefore your levels in your classes.  You're going to get pitted against people a lot worse than you, and people who are NOT better than you, they are richer than you.\n\nIf you manage to enjoy it despite, good luck and good gaming.

However, you can waste anybody with the right upgraded tier 1/2 weapon.  The assault class tier 1 rifle with a bidpod, extended clip and long barrel is def going to get the job done.  I use the tier 2 recon smg w/ upgrades and I can kill anything fast.  High skill ceiling game which is why you are going to see all the ♥♥♥♥♥ing here.  Don't worry about upgrading or repairing armor till late game after you have your weapons dialed in.

I thought it was gonna be just like warface (which was runed by microtransactions). But i played it for hours and was instantly hooked. the game is very tatical, so youll be communicating with your team to take objectives. And just like TF2 is objective based. There are mico transactions but they never got in the way. the first couple of minutes you will alrady have fifty-thousand AC (the in game currency). However you need lots of time to play it. Matches are 25-30 minutes long, and exiting out of them before they end has a HUGE penalty. And for most of the time you get new people who run out of spawn, pass up all the objectives and get shot in the face. Anyway next topic; this game riequires lots of teamwork.

The classes are recon, assault and support. Each class gives its own class device and support device. These devices help you and your squad if used properly. In GRO you will also notice cover is really important as well as knowing your surroundings. The game has great graphics, and surprisingly good BGM in the menus and the logging screen. Since it is an online game it lacks a story/ campaign. The controls are good, and easy to get use to if you are not use to common controls. The game also does not have cinematic which seems quite normal with online games. The gameplay is intense and gives a great rush of enjoyment and adrenaline.\nWhen actually fighting you will notice it is quite hard to do all this and that’s what makes it fun. It makes you think and be on your toes, giving you that adrenaline rush that you surge for in a shooter. In this game you’ll notice even making one mistake can kill you, for example popping out of cover to look for an enemy can easily get you killed by a Recon Sniper. This makes it feel that much more like a real fire fight, having this do or die action leaves a feeling to strive for more, and get revenge. This game also adds a great feature of sliding and having the gun being able to go around corners while in cover. This is because the gun and the camera are not together like most shooters. They are semi-separate.\n\nThe things I really liked were the Semi-separated camera and gun, and the cover system. I also really enjoy that each class has its own level making it have more gameplay overall. The things I disliked about the game is after you achieve level 5 in the class you have been playing you are no longer a beginner, and you have to face higher level characters. I also really liked how all the main things for the game like guns, attachments and devices are all sold in virtual currency earned in-game and virtual currency paid by real money. This makes it so you don’t have to pay loads of money to deck out a gun. I dislike this because since this game’s profits are made off of premium membership and in-game store, the higher levels have access to better weapons and it can seem like pay-to-win, but it is not.\nGhost Recon Online overall is a great Third-Person Shooter (TPS) and a great free online game. It has its pros and cons, like being a shooter it can be quite repetitive, but is great for playing with friends. I would even go as far as this being just as fun as some paid shooter games. In my opinion this game is scored 8/10 on gameplay, 6/10 on graphics, and a 6/10 for overall performance on an average pc.\n\nNOTE: This game can be quite heavy on internet and pc wise. I do not recommend playing this game on slow internet or an old pc.\nGameplay Video Coming SOON!\nScreen Shots coming soon!\n\n","February 14, 2014","true","37.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The standard issue weapons are fine, and the weapons that you can unlock after just a few rounds can dominate.\nYou have no reason not to pick this up if you like shooting games and you have a PC.","April 13, 2014","true","54.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The three classes are solid, especially working in tandem.  The maps could use more diversity, and so too could the guns--but the game is mere footsteps out of beta and therefore has some ways to go.\n\nMy gripe is with the players.  The community of people I've gamed with have been helpful and even chatty on the mics (which is somewhat unusual in these games because most gamers are not that social)--unfortunately, the developers needs money and they get yours by having you pay to win.  That's right, buy all the guns and armor you want, kids--grab that credit card like tomorrow never comes because it'll totally help you beat my ♥♥♥ every day.  I don't care if it helps the developers--I'd rather you ran a script and needed to kill me via a third-party program than simply forked over more cash for the gold killswhoever.  And when it's a whole team of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you get the unluck of being slotted against because--and here's another ♥♥♥♥ing problem--the matchmaking doesn't take into account your equipment.  It hardly takes into account your qualifications/medals and therefore your levels in your classes.  You're going to get pitted against people a lot worse than you, and people who are NOT better than you, they are richer than you.\n\nIf you manage to enjoy it despite, good luck and good gaming.

A lot of players complaining about the pay to win aspect of it though. After you pass lvl 8 with any one of the three classes, you have to play with all the big boys. That means you are thrown against high lvl players from time to time who had the time to grind out their gear or players who simply bought it with real money. The developers are currently working on better matchmaking system that will match players of equal lvl, and equal gear. So there is work being done and the game just recently came out unto steam. Only one complain i have is the damn standard character models that you start out with. Black clothing with light brown body armor on top just looks unappealing and the helmets are just tasteless.

I like the strategic elements of combat, and how balanced and different the three classes are.  A sniper for instance, will never win in a heads up close range fight. A support class will never beat a sniper at long range. Knowing what your class is capable of, the strengths and weaknesses of your load out; are essential to success in this game. More so than any shooter I have ever played. As a fan of the Soccom series, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a similar experience.\nOn the flip side, Pay to win elements are all TOO obvious. The 'free' currency that is earned through combat isnt anywhere near the worth of paid currency. Honestly I would much rather astetics be the only thing one can earn through actually forking out money. But that is not the case. 20 dollars gets you the best equipment your class can offer. 20 Hours doesnt get the free player the same benefits at all. Meaning the players earn less than '1 dollar' an ingame hour. And some of the equipment is exclusive to p2p players. That being said, I fear that this game will turn into Planet Side 2. But until it does, I give it a 4.4 of 5.","April 15, 2014","true","23.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I thought it was gonna be just like warface (which was runed by microtransactions). But i played it for hours and was instantly hooked. the game is very tatical, so youll be communicating with your team to take objectives. And just like TF2 is objective based. There are mico transactions but they never got in the way. the first couple of minutes you will alrady have fifty-thousand AC (the in game currency). However you need lots of time to play it. Matches are 25-30 minutes long, and exiting out of them before they end has a HUGE penalty. And for most of the time you get new people who run out of spawn, pass up all the objectives and get shot in the face. Anyway next topic; this game riequires lots of teamwork.

It was so easy to setup menu is really appealing and easy to use. When I went into the game the graphics were ok (Maxed 1080p) but not bad. The gun play is awesome I love playing support Distracting the enemy keeping them under pressure while my team mates sneak around, The mini map is pretty damn cool. The whole environment really makes it feel like a Futuristic game. I honestly had a great time playing this and I plan to play it more, Sure you have to work to earn your stuff (Unless you pay) But its a small price to pay for such a fun team based game. Give it a shot, It costs nothing. You have got nothing to loose.\n\nSummary:\nGraphics are nothing to boast about, They arn't bad tho.\nGameplay is entertaining, And Controls are easy to learn.\nCommunity seem nice, And are willing to be organised.\nThere is a large selection of items to unlock. You've just got to.. you know.. PLay the game and not complain about the pay to get items part..\n\nI hope this was helpful :)","May 5, 2014","true","11.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's tactical shooting, unlike other typical shooting games. You can communicate with your teammate by ALT.\n\nUsing teamwork and need to trust your other teammates while they defense the flank or flanking. Quickscope player mostly don't work in this game so basically even if you good at aiming, you may still cannot win the game.\n\nThis game need teamwork a lot, 1 or 2 good players cannot help the whole team win.\n\nIf you are wondering about P2W in this game. I believe the game is still fair for new player because of the match making. If their team have P2W players then basically your team may also have someone with good weapons as P2W and same level. For new player to fight against P2W, I suggest you to use the cover and shoot them while they are running or sneak behind them, works many times. At least this is how you help your team in some ways.\n\nYou also can focus on capturing point and using devices to help your team.

It's fun and easy to get into, and unlike other free to play games it doesn't shackle you to some terrible starting gear. However, matches last considerably long, and leaving (or even losing connection) in the middle of a match will forfeit all xp and cash earned, which is really annoying since I have lost connection a few times and I shouldn't be penalized for that bull****. Still, it's a lot of fun and feels different than a typical free game.

Its a little bland with the different modes of play and could still use some improvements with gameplay, matchamaking, and the occasional little glitch. If you wanst to have the best experience playing youll need a better computer than the minimun. 2.8 dual core processor running on the lowest settign and at 14-21 FPS. Now granted it seems bad that thats the quality you get but I've been playing for 2 years at that and its defintily doable and fun at at. The business model they speak of is pretty horrible because everyone after playing puts about $30-$60+ into the game to get the latest edition of a new weapon pack and you have to grind through those palyers who jumped the gun. Its still a fun experience and you can still play quite well. A large number of the older players still use the basic starting weapons and own, so why cant you? Back to the business model, they will release or rerelease a new bundle and after a couple of months they will go and nerf the stats on the newest bundle you have in order to release another newer bundle. they dont care hwo much you have played and how much you spent. This is Ubisoft making money along with needing to repair armor after every match and pushing you to buy buy buy and giving you close to nothing after a match. Youll need to put time into this game but thats what makes it a game you dont get bored of at all. Youll want to put some 5+ hour days every now and them of pure shooting to get big jumps in coin to buy the guns.\nOverall I would definitley recommend this game to everyone! it has a couple of bugs here and there with the company but you cant beat a F2P like this","November 19, 2014","true","285.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commanche6/recommended/243870/","commanche6","Comanche6","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commanche6/","32 products in account","Ghost Recon Online or GR:O, Ubisoft's first free 2 play shooter/MMO offering, has a steep learning curve, but if you can climb that curve, you'll be hooked like a junky. Billed as a "shooter", this is actually a 3rd-person, cover-based, tactical game which takes teamwork, communication, patience and skill to master (imagine that!). You will start the game in a newbie garden in which you can level, unmolested by veterans, until level 5. Then, you will be unceremoniously and rather hashly dropped into the "real thing", and be matched against new players and veterans alike, some of whom have been playing the closed and open betas for over a year and then you will have your ♥♥♥ handed to you. Matchmaking is currently a hit-and-miss thing due to low volumes of beta testers and early access players, but as the number of players increases, the quality of matchmaking will as well.\n\nEach match features a differing team objective, such as Conquest or Holdout. And this really is a team objective, you won't be able to take or hold points on the map without teamwork and communication so plug in that headset mic. You will also discover that the highest ranked players in every match will typically also do the most work to take and hold objectives: much of the scoring is based is based on captures, assists and attacks or defenses, which are all related to map objectives. You can top the scoreboards in a match without scoring the most kills.\n\nThere are 3 classes: Assault, Recon and Specialist and you can level each independently. Assaults have the best armour, carry assault rifles and shotguns and can make use of a riot shield device called Blitz and an area suppression device called Heat. Assault players are typically aggressive and are on the point or beyond it, trying to take the next one. Recon players have relatively poor armour but can carry sniper rifles or submachineguns and have a Predator-style cloak called Cloak (appropriately) or a radar-type device called Oracle. Recon players are typically sneaky and are sniping to kill/pin down the enemy or sneaking around behind enemy lines and being a nuisance. In both cases, good Recon players continually highlight where the enemy is and what they are doing. The Specialist class features middle of the road armour with light machineguns or shotguns. Their devices are the Aegis, an electromagnetic shield which deflects bullets, or Blackout, an electromagnetic pulse which stuns the enemy and disables all enemy devices. The "anchor" class, you will find these guys holding lanes, flanking or providing flank protection and generally putting bullet holes into everything.\n\nEach match will earn you Requisition Points or RP. You can also earn Ghost Coins or GC for monthly events or you can buy them for "real" currency. Either RP or GC can be used to buy guns and gear, which works on a tiered system, similar to World of Tanks: you have to purchase and level the Tier 1 item to get a Tier 2 item. However, Limited Edition (LE) gear of any Tier can be purchased for RP or GC, even though you don't have the previous Tier(s). Despite common misconception, the difference between equipment of differing Tiers is slight. For instance, a Tier 7 assault rifle will kill another player in fractions of a second faster than a Tier 5 rifle, which makes flanking and getting the drop on your opponents all the more important than standing face-to-face and blazing away. These also require skill and timing to use. Sniping is hard. Automatic weapons have recoil and aiming characteristics which means that Call of Duty run and gun, spray and pray tactics will get you killed more often than not. You will find players grabbing cover and holding a point, much to the chagrin of COD veterans, who will most likely accuse them of camping: but in this game, it's not.\n\nThe Steam version is an early access beta client delivered by Steam for Canadian users only (don't know why, cause we're nicer?) and is fully interoperable with the non-Steam open beta client, available from their website for your territory. The full Steam release is set for summer. If you're buying GC, the non-Steam client uses a differing payment processor than the Steam version, that's the only difference for now: you're still playing with the full community.\n\nSo if you're looking for the finest in tactical online gameplay, this is your choice. In the words of a Red Orchestra designer: "Call of Duty has almost ruined a generation of shooter players". Don't be one of them.","January 15, 2014","true","276.3"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","2"

Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture.

Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","January 13, 2015","true","30.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","68","13","19","20","0"

I've probably gotten about 60$ worth of weaponry without spending any real money. It just takes effort to actually gain enough money. And in all honesty, for my Recon character, I already got up to the M-200 without buying anything. I'm trying for the Nemesis now, but I'd strongly reccomend this game. It's tactical, gives you adrenaline rushes, and the community (While small) is quite commited for the most part. Plus the boot camp gives you easy starts before you have to deal with anyone who has top tier weaponry/armor.\nOne tip is to build each class respectively so that you can run into games and if a team is unbalanced (Say 6 recon, 2 support) you can swap to an assault and cover the gap. You don't have to buy weaponry for each class either. I'm still using the default Assault and Support weapons whilst using much higher grade weaponry for my Recon character. The point is, just be familiar with all the classes so if the team needs it, you can cover the bridge. ALSO USE A MIC, even the push-to-talk system works perfectly fine.

Its a great game, matchmaking is alittle slow, but pretty good at choosing equal level people. They even take your gear into consideration so its NOT a pay to win game, which is amazing. The feeling when you're surrounded by 10 enemies, and you are all alone, and taking cover and slowly killing them one by one and scanning (if you are playing as Recon) for more is just epic as well :) (Happened to me twice, im such a boss)\n\n\nI rate it a 100/10, yes, 100 out of 10.

I'd recommend playing it, i mean come on it's free what more is there to ask yourself.\n\nAs for all of the comments i've read about it being pay 2 win, thats completely false and those who say so are one of two possible people: 1, you're ♥♥♥♥ and need a scape goat excuse 2, you don't understand the game mechanics nor have you played long enough\n\nOnce you reach level 8 you get put in with the general pool of players, this includes all levels of all classes, i've versed some that are afew days into playing with nothing but the basics which you get for free that have proved to be a challenge to overcome, I have met players with hundreds of dollars worth of unique items and kits who i have walked over since i started playing.\n\nI'm currently on the top of all of my matches earning MVP of my class, team, most headshot medal and longest killstreak medal, there has been 6 matches where I have failed to be the top player of my team, as I have played fps games for around 8 years, I consider myself an experienced player with better than good skill, and I don't care if you think i'm up myself, when you gain 80% of your class achievements in 3 days of play you deserve to boast a little.\n\nThe only downside is the amount of forgein players there are that speak other than english, it makes it hard to communicate strategies and enemy sightings.\n\nI love this game, and if you give it a chance i'm sure you will too.\n\n","August 16, 2014","true","96.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Since then i have seen this game become more and more pay to win with evey major update. The big problem with this game is it takes 100 hours to earn 20,000 RP, which btw is enough to buy a lv two asssault riflle. Another big probelm witrh this game is when the game has an event ie: the splinter cell blacklist release, the game sells these gun packs which are $24. The guns in the packs are so OP. A lv one player can buy these OP guns and go agenist other lv ones with lv one guns.\n\nThe one good thing about this game is that its really fun, i have a least 800 hours into it. Ghost Recon Online is different from all the other shot em' up game. You actually need to use team work to win and cap points (unlike call of duty). Unless you want to spend hour after hour trying to get one item while somebody can just buy it then and you don't care about the pay to win then i was recommend this game.\n\n9/10","February 1, 2014","true","16.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game has seemed to have taken Blacklist, taken most first-person shooters, and mixed it together. Yes, there are certain bugs, but those can be fixed as this is an early access game. It has a really nice cover system, and even if you hate cover shooters, this is acutally fun. Since it is a free-to-play, you may think there is microtransactions up the wazzoo. But there isn't, only a few here and there. There is a store, to buy weapons, but you can gain the currency by simply playing the game. Now, to the gameplay. You choose one of three classes, assault, recon, or support. This cannot be changed during the matches, or in the main menu, so choose wisely. You can play differnt gamemodes, and I cannot name them all, but expect it to be like a cod game. The graphics are decent, and as far a free-to-play goes, its pretty nice. With all of this, it's a good game, and being free to play, you should download this right away and start playing.","January 31, 2014","true","4.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This ones different, but i am still liking it. Previous iterations of Ghost Recon saw me running around in huge open maps, needlessly blowing off the helmets of poor suckers that strayed in range of my weapon sights. Cover system over GRAW 1 and 2 multiplayer is drastically improved, but the trade off is that maps are now much more linear and a lot smaller to reflect a focus on tactics and not just who gets to the top of the hill first with guns a blazing. Hallways, lobbys and streets are the usual fare that ive noticed. Occationally you might find a back alley that doubles around and provides a nifty overlook to the poor saps that are engaged on the front lines against your team, providing you a shot at their unprotected backs. Gone is the Nowhere type maps that have you shooting targets a couple hundred yards away across open terrain. Combat is much tighter. It doesnt feel like death can come up behind you at any moment like it often does  in other games given the linear layout forcing you and your squad to team up together to advance thru choke points, but dont discount the possibility of getting shot in the ♥♥♥. A few suprises are in store for you depending on the map and the process of learning the maps can be as simple as "how the hell did he get behind me?".\nAlso: Be prepared for an uphill battle when facing off against players in the upper tiers. If they've spent $$ on this game, they will do more damage, take less in return, heal faster, and look cooler than you. Deal with it. Superior tactics will win out. Ive been there. I believe even being of higher level unlocks much better weapons so the 3 classes may loadout with some pretty vicious weaponry compared to your starting popgun. I have not come across groups so pay2win they cant be defeated with good teamwork though.\nI will call this game pay2solo. If you sink enough money in to it, you will be very tough one on one against most anyone and will likely have a shot even against superior players with your cool gear and Assassins Creed hood. Again though, superior tactics will beat fools with 20 dollars worth of digital transactions. Teamwork is ESSENTIAL in this.\nAll in all id give this game a 85/100. I want bigger maps. More open areas. If your sick of run and gun multiplayer games centering around kill streaks and airstrikes and how much lead you can pump thru walls ( yes COD... im looking at you) then look no further.\n","August 2, 2014","true","99.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Anything you pay for that helps your character kill the enemy or stay alive can be bought with earned in-game credits. Paying with real cash is a way to speed through the game to better things faster, but everyone has an equal chance to win. I don't pay, and I am constantly in the top 1-4 on the team.\n\nThis game is simply amazing. It is extremely user friendly, telling you how to play ingame without even watching the tutorial (which is what I did). Also, until you get to level 8 your play with BEGINNERS ONLY, which is really nice because everyone has a fair chance and there is no seal clubbing, etc.!\nFor the actual game play...\n\nYou choose from 3 classes: Assault, Recon, and Support.\nThey are all fitted to EXACTLY what the name of the class is. Assault is really good for: forward attack dishing out damage and pushing back. Recon is good for: Sniping and Flanking, you have either use a sniper rifle or an SMG. They also have the ability to cloak (go invisible) for short periods of time or scan for targets in a given area and relay the info to nearby team mates. Depends on your playstyle really. Support is not your typical "run and gun down everything" player, rather a player who actually has to SUPPORT his team. He is nearly useless pushing a flank alone, but can hold a flank alone against overwhelming odds.\n\nThey are all equally fun and nice, and all 3 can fit many different types of playstyles, from down-and-dirty to mid-range engagements to long-range sniping and suppression.\n\nThe game implements the use use of cover (walls, pillars, tables, etc.) better than ANY other game. It is Battlefield... Taken to next level of intensity, teamwork, and thoughtfulness.\n\nAlso, something almost every shooter fails to do, is that it implements ingame communications by mic-to-ear by force. You don't get trolls, but even the kids who are real young are trying to help out tactically. I went 18-2 in a game with my sniper because a high-pitched voiced kid was relaying the positions of heavy resistance through the mic to me so I could take out their supports and snipers. Everyone contributes positively, I have yet, with 39 hours on record, to find a person trolling the mic.\n\nI am currently bugging all my friends to play, cause it is truly awesome.","April 20, 2014","true","163.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

You can get spotted from spawn and may take a shot to the knee cap to kill you. No weapon balancing done, no class balancing done before each round to ensure one team doesn't have 95% snipers. Somehow you can also shoot through a solid wall when you can't with the highest powered gun available. If you lose a point, once you spawn, it may take you a few minutes to get to the point, but even before then, the other team may have a few snipers cloaked and at your spawn ready to knee cap you. TL:DR, don't waste your time with this game yet. Its heavily unbalanced. Wasted potential.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/k8faust/recommended/243870/","k8faust","k8Faust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/k8faust/","143 products in account","The game, at its core, is fun. My experience with everything else has been frustrating though.\n\nHere are the issues I've run in to during my 3-day attempt to enjoy this game:\n\n- Different portions of the game's website can't remember that I'm logged in, ask me to log back in, and then tell me I have the wrong password. This includes the support section.\n- On one account, I've changed my password twice. My password change was successful for an hour, and then that password no longer functioned. I've since reset it and changed it again, and it has not accepted this fact. Support has not replied. In fact, it seems that there is no record whatsoever of my inquiry. All in all, my experience with the Uplay and Ubisoft pages have begged the question if anything functions on those sites.\n- On my more advanced account (from a very early beta test), I have reached "that" point, wherein finding a match becomes nigh impossible. I instead get to watch Matchmaking search for a game to no avail.\n- On my new account, Matchmaking is never quick. I don't understand how it works, but it seems to try and find enough players to fill both sides before putting every one in a lobby. However, upon arriving in the lobby, teams will still be unbalanced (2:1 ratio, even).\n- I have a Maximus VI Hero motherboard; in order to play, I had to reset my bios to optimized defaults because the game's engine does not like the idea of there not being a set CPU Frequency or some such, and so--upon starting the game--would error "Engine Assertion Failed", "Processor Frequency Not Set". Not exactly something I wanted to do, but I wanted to get back in to the game.\n- After defaulting my bios settings and successfully launching the game, it would BSOD. I had to go back in and manually define voltages and frequencies, among other things I can't be bothered to remember anymore. I found no successful solutions through Google, and the game's support pages are... lacking.\n- Seeing as how the storefront has change since my days in the beta, I was unsure how or when I would be allowed to purchase a higher grade weapon. I had no intention of purchasing the one available from the get-go, as it offered very little advantage over the one I have by default. Upon reaching Rank 7, it occured to me that I may be required to purchase that weapon in order to purchase the next one. I have not tested this, but if true, is absolutely crap because the rate at which currency is earned is not nearly enough to justify it.\n- After a certain point, I was being prompted to purchase items with cash after the end of a match. This drove home how extremely geared towards monetization the lobby UI has become since beta. It is frustrating to have to X out of this window so often.\n- Adding weapon modifcations is easy, but clicking the little radial to switch from cash to in-game money is frustrating because I have to click in exactly the right spot. Why is this? I can only imagine it is the way it is because they want their users to accidentally purchase something using real money.\n\nAt this point, this game has wasted enough of my time and I am just done. Three days in, and I am done. It is not worth the frustration, especially at this point in its life. The game really has not changed much since beta, and that was two years ago, back when this game was still Ghost Recon Online.\n\nTwo years ago, I would have recommended this game. Today, it is caked in monetization and has not seen many improvements whatsoever. So, as it stands, I would not recommend this game to anyone, ESPECIALLY if you have newer hardware.","May 2, 2014","false","6.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

However, with real world cash, you can skip those tier system. This could have not been the case since those guns can also be bought by game world currency. However, the problem is that, even though they tried to fix this issue using "gun grades" etc, there is not enough players yet to completely make that system work. Ergo, some newbie players overpowers other newbies using upper class weapons causing OP gun issues.)\n\nOverall verdict : Yes you should play this game.

This is both true AND false. You can in fact put in hour hour after hour grinding the game out and tiering up one by one, but you can also throw some dough in and get everything in one shot. Its entirely up to you which you decide. But the game focuses more on tactical aspects and teamwork rather than a "run and gun, or get carried" kind of game. If you dont practice, and work hard, and put in time... chances are you arent going to get a name for yourself. So remember... train hard, and work as a team.

There has been quite a stir about the game being 'pay2win', and it's something you'll notice once you leave the beginner bracket matches.

P2w is really nothing. If you use your head right, you can still play without complaining about p2w.

A way to fix it is by simply not exiting the launcher for the game, this way you can quit the game and come back later without having to restart your whole computer.\n\nThe controls are fluent and the fact that it is free is just awesome, if I were the developers I’d price the game at around $10-$15, you’d make a lot of money, the game is of very good quality.\n\nSome things I’d like with the game:\n\nMore maps, more classes, single player mode (with bots and/or a story version).","April 24, 2014","true","24.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The matchmaking system is good, and you can team up with buddies to do your own special pwning.\n\nNot many people use in-game voice chat, but when I play with friends, skype erupts with formal commands, compass bearings being called where an enemy has been spotted, yelling "THERE'S A GUY ATTACKING FROM BEHIND", and also bragging when you get the most points, or when you get MVP on the winning squad and Best Recon.\n\nCustomization is pretty insane, and you can unlock everything you need through the in-game currency (new weapons, new sights, barrel attachments, magazine types, etc), but you will have to pay if you want to customize your appearence or the appearence of your weapon.\n\nIf you like tactical shooters, running from cover to cover, feeling your heart beat when you are pinned by a sniper that you just can't get away from, or the joy of showing up behind the entire enemy squad and shooting each and every one of them in the back and dancing on their corpses, this game... it's a must-have.","April 24, 2014","true","21.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Hell, I thought they stopped MAKING these types of games a long time ago: A FUN SHOOTER.\n\nBut here I am at 3 and a half in the morning, forcing myself to go to bed because my aim has deteriorated. I want to play more, but the body is weak.\n\nThis is not COD. This is not Battlefield. The team that communicates best wins. This is a fast-paced tactical shooter. You need tactics to survive, let alone win. The cover system is servicable; it takes a bit to get used to, but you are rewarded for using cover with better aim and damage mitigation. That's important to note, because if you hate run and gunners as much as I do this is a beautiful thing. Gone are the risky behaviors getting rewarded. If you don't use cover and just run around, you're gonna get spanked, even at lower levels.\n\nThat said the game becomes a constest of which can hold and gain ground the best. And that's why you have to communicate. Voice comms are built in, ALT key by default. I didn't have to set up anything.\n\nThe F2P model is well done here. You can buy ALL WEAPONS with in game currency, the cash is saved for getting your unlocks early or buying cosmetics. There are XP boosts and such, but really this is a game of skill. You can drop cash on the best sniper rifle if you want to, but your'e gonna look real dumb dropping it on the ground repeatedly as new players oneshot you with the default sniper.\n\nThis is a solid game. I don't usually praise Clancy's work, especially the video game titles. But this game has that 'it' factor that leaves you wondering how in the hell you're going to survive the coming day with 2 hours of sleep.\n\nIt's a GOOD, Free squad tactics shooter with a very solid engine, well thought out HUD, and the fast pace you've come to love from modern shooters. I was meh about it when I saw the video, but the short learning curve and action drew me in.","April 13, 2014","true","58.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A way to fix it is by simply not exiting the launcher for the game, this way you can quit the game and come back later without having to restart your whole computer.\n\nThe controls are fluent and the fact that it is free is just awesome, if I were the developers I’d price the game at around $10-$15, you’d make a lot of money, the game is of very good quality.\n\nSome things I’d like with the game:\n\nMore maps, more classes, single player mode (with bots and/or a story version).","April 24, 2014","true","24.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Flanking, supression, distractions, all come into play. The matchmaking system is good, and you can team up with buddies to do your own special pwning.\n\nNot many people use in-game voice chat, but when I play with friends, skype erupts with formal commands, compass bearings being called where an enemy has been spotted, yelling "THERE'S A GUY ATTACKING FROM BEHIND", and also bragging when you get the most points, or when you get MVP on the winning squad and Best Recon.\n\nCustomization is pretty insane, and you can unlock everything you need through the in-game currency (new weapons, new sights, barrel attachments, magazine types, etc), but you will have to pay if you want to customize your appearence or the appearence of your weapon.\n\nIf you like tactical shooters, running from cover to cover, feeling your heart beat when you are pinned by a sniper that you just can't get away from, or the joy of showing up behind the entire enemy squad and shooting each and every one of them in the back and dancing on their corpses, this game... it's a must-have.","April 24, 2014","true","21.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Support, uses technology to assist in their warfare uses a light machinegun and shotgun. Recon, this class is definitely used for steath, they use stealth to take out enemies or gather intel such as enemy positions, they use sniper rifles and sub machineguns.

This is definitely a game to be played by a gang of friends looking for a teamwork-required computer game to play. I have been playing this game for around two years now, before it was called Ghost Recon Phantoms. Back in Ghost Recon Online, the only thing to worry about was the P90 SD WAR, which can still shred you to pieces now.\n\nNow I have shifted to NA servers and I just started playing on Steam just for the sake of the free DLCs that you can get for using Steam.\n\nPay2Win??? Yes, that is correct. Well, somewhat. You can pay all you want for this game, thinking you would be dominating everyone in the first week of your gameplay. And I would say, GO SUCK YOURSELF. Why? This game also requires and METRIC BUTT TON of skill to play it. The liitle decisions that you make can devastate your own team or the enemy. Since I just shifted to NA, I had to start all over and rebuild everything. And with all that skill in me, GI guns can still crush as hard as anything.\n\nThe devices, squad supports and cover system is why this game requires so much teamwork. When I started back then, I was fascinated by the cover system. I invited my friends to come play with me and we had a damn good time.\n\nNow, my account "SupportCI" Support Class has Tier V Triton Armour with 3 T1 Health inserts and 2 T1 Regen inserts, a Tier 3 Blackout with Effect and Duration Upgrades, and a T1 Energy Regen. I'm only using the GI guns and I just love it when some idiot with a Tier 9 weapon in beginners only fails to kill me, getting himself killed and trolled on chat.\n\nThough sometimes in All Players, you can get pushed around a little, so bear with it. After a few months, you'll have some good trick up your sleeve to "IN YOUR FACE!!!" an opponent with top equipment.\n\nI enjoy this game very much, and I recommend it to any small group of friends looking to play a good shooter game.","December 4, 2014","true","230.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

First of all, let's get something out of the way. It is not a Pay to Win type of game, seriously it is getting ridicoulous how people call this a Pay To Win game, that is simply not true. A lot of the gear I have which I have not payed a cent at all in this game (I am considering to do so to support them) and yet, I have no problems taking down those pay2win players. All the gear I own that are free is more then enough to take them down. What really matters is team work in this game. the controls are fluent and easy to learn as well the cover system works very well.\n\nNow, as one of the original beta testers in the game, one problem still persist and I have warned them about this multiple times over and over again, they REALLY need to work on optimizing the game. Seriously, my proccessor is above the minimum requirement version that you need to run the game and the audio lags incredibly bad. If this were to be fixed sooner, then it should be a hell of a lot more tolerable.\n\nWhile the PvP is great and all, this game needs a PvE sessions where the story could be fleshed out more, maybe have the enemy's gear be equal to yours to be a challenge? That is a start for them to get something going. While the story is there, it is barely fleshed out. Sometimes I wonder what am I fighting for in the game.\n\nTo sum it all up: If you like a tactical shooter with a challenge, this should be something for you to try, however, that is IF you have the computer to handle it.","April 15, 2014","true","21.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Hell, I thought they stopped MAKING these types of games a long time ago: A FUN SHOOTER.\n\nBut here I am at 3 and a half in the morning, forcing myself to go to bed because my aim has deteriorated. I want to play more, but the body is weak.\n\nThis is not COD. This is not Battlefield. The team that communicates best wins. This is a fast-paced tactical shooter. You need tactics to survive, let alone win. The cover system is servicable; it takes a bit to get used to, but you are rewarded for using cover with better aim and damage mitigation. That's important to note, because if you hate run and gunners as much as I do this is a beautiful thing. Gone are the risky behaviors getting rewarded. If you don't use cover and just run around, you're gonna get spanked, even at lower levels.\n\nThat said the game becomes a constest of which can hold and gain ground the best. And that's why you have to communicate. Voice comms are built in, ALT key by default. I didn't have to set up anything.\n\nThe F2P model is well done here. You can buy ALL WEAPONS with in game currency, the cash is saved for getting your unlocks early or buying cosmetics. There are XP boosts and such, but really this is a game of skill. You can drop cash on the best sniper rifle if you want to, but your'e gonna look real dumb dropping it on the ground repeatedly as new players oneshot you with the default sniper.\n\nThis is a solid game. I don't usually praise Clancy's work, especially the video game titles. But this game has that 'it' factor that leaves you wondering how in the hell you're going to survive the coming day with 2 hours of sleep.\n\nIt's a GOOD, Free squad tactics shooter with a very solid engine, well thought out HUD, and the fast pace you've come to love from modern shooters. I was meh about it when I saw the video, but the short learning curve and action drew me in.","April 13, 2014","true","58.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game shows that free 2 plays do not need stupid micr transactions as this game is balanced and you are just as powerful as to someone who pays money for their equipment. This game requires teamwork and strategy and thats the shining point of this game. Even kids you would find annoying are playing this game trying their best to turn the tables and not play the game like CoD.

Flanking, supression, distractions, all come into play. The matchmaking system is good, and you can team up with buddies to do your own special pwning.\n\nNot many people use in-game voice chat, but when I play with friends, skype erupts with formal commands, compass bearings being called where an enemy has been spotted, yelling "THERE'S A GUY ATTACKING FROM BEHIND", and also bragging when you get the most points, or when you get MVP on the winning squad and Best Recon.\n\nCustomization is pretty insane, and you can unlock everything you need through the in-game currency (new weapons, new sights, barrel attachments, magazine types, etc), but you will have to pay if you want to customize your appearence or the appearence of your weapon.\n\nIf you like tactical shooters, running from cover to cover, feeling your heart beat when you are pinned by a sniper that you just can't get away from, or the joy of showing up behind the entire enemy squad and shooting each and every one of them in the back and dancing on their corpses, this game... it's a must-have.","April 24, 2014","true","21.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a high intense, very tactical, third person shooter. If you look deeper theres not much left. The graphics are passable. They gameplay is rewarding, fun, and both hardcore and relaxed. Its reliability on team gameplay is well presented and yes, necessary. I have noticed no bugs in my short time with it. Only bad thing about it is very easy to level up in the bigginner section but after that the difficulty ramps up very high, very fast. But its not bad, its fun, its addicting, and its well made.

This being said, if you are new to Ghost Recon or its been a while since you last played, Phantoms is a third person, cover based, tactical shooter.  Running and gunning is an ill advised tactic, while not techincally impossible it will usually end with you dead before you can even pull the trigger.  While the game is free to play, there is an option to pay for gear with real money.  Now while it is not necessary to spend a single cent on the game for the main gear and weapons you will need, all items that change your looks will usually cost you some money, but like I said it is very optional and very pricey.\n\nHere's a quick run down of the pros and cons:\nPros:\nFirmilar game play\nLots of gun customization and selection\nGreat maps and game types\nLeveling system is well laidout for all three classes\nCover system is almost perfect\nIn game voice coms\n\nCons:\nExpensive market\nMinor glitches\nOnly 2 game types\n\nThis the future of Ghost Recon for now and it seems to be holding its own against its predicessors. If you are a Tom Clancy fan at all this game is a must.","August 5, 2014","true","61.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Ghost Recon has the most interesting perception of the whole 'futuristic' scene from what ive seen. nothing like this CoD: Advanced Warfare crap.\n\nOne thing not many online shooters do that i was very pleased to see in this game, was how new players are pitted against other new players for a period of time, until they have the experience and the gear to go out into the full community, with some new maps as well.\n\nMy favorite part has to be the weapon customization. this is perfect for those that like a certain role, but want to play at different distances than intended. For example, i enjoy the mid-range assault class, but have my gun modified for a designated marksman role, so i can keep my distance like a sniper, but have a faster fire rate and heavier armor than one.\n\nThis game has one of the biggest tactical teamwork aspects that ive seen. not only is it a huge part, it is done well. Your team must communicate so everyone knows what dangers lie ahead, where and where not to go. Each classes special abilities can work in harmony to take down the enemy. The recon class can scan for enemies or go invisible, to infiltrate and report back so the assault classes can rush forward, and with the support class providing suppressing fire to ensure a successful operation.\n\nThe only problem i see is that it is too hard to get money, and if you blow it all as a beginner, you wont be able to afford better weapons by the time you level up and have to play with the pros. You cant get money because you cant win, you cant win because you cant kill, and you cant kill because you cant get money. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH MONEY\n\nEither way, this is by far one of the most enjoyable games i've played. 9/10","July 19, 2014","true","59.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
