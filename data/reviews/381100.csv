This version seems to be a direct port of the game from the smartphone app. I'm putting my review as recommended based on my previous experience, however, as I play this version I will update the review accordingly.\n\nFirst off, I really love this game. I like the characters, and each route feels interesting, as well as the setting this takes place in. Finding out the reasons or motivations for characters to why they're in Kikuya is an interesting mystery, though I admit some scenarios are just frustrating. Certainly not for everybody, as things can get very intimate (there's, um, R18+ stuff described), but it's something that I think is enjoyable to some. It's probably D3Publisher's best otome game, or at least, it's most popular if it's getting a Steam release. That said, this version has a lot of flaws.\n\nBeing that this is a direct port, all the routes of all the guys available in the smartphone version so far are here. I played the entirety of the prologue, and for the most part there were few changes in the text, if at all. What I noticed is that they took out character animations, and they improved the GUI for players in the main game. However, it still retains a very "smartphone" feel, and inputs often feel sluggish. Furthermore, the way they ported it gives you no options to change your resolution. You're given a measly "Screen change" to go to fullscreen mode, but if you do that the ENTIRE GAME becomes blurry and pixelated. Save slots are limited, something I hated about the original as well, but route exploration is not that difficult.\n\nThe font is strange and there seem to be white artifacts floating around in it. They also didn't clean it up as much as I would have hoped for, so many lines will seem very awkward. If I recall correctly, Hayabusa's routes have much cleaner and better translated dialogue.\n\nThey used the opening from the PS Vita version, though, which makes me wonder why they didn't just port that version and included Hayabusa. The PS Vita versions (Otoko Yukaku) is superior to the smartphone version and this version combined. That version has improved art (fixing awkward character portraits), more backgrounds, more music, an extra character (Keiji Ito) and voice acting from famous Japanese seiyuus. Furthermore, it has extra endings and new scenarios and CGs. To top it off, the main routes of the main five guys (Takao, Tokiwa, Kagura, Kagerou, and Iroha) play relatively the same with a few differences. They really should have just ported Otoko Yukaku for Steam, because this version is inferior to the PS Vita one.\n\nI was also just told the event CGs from the Vita version are in this one. I'll have to see them in the routes.\n\nI'm hoping things get cleaned up, though! If it did, I will gladly keep that recommendation for otome players.","October 14, 2015","true","0.7"," 122 of 133 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","122","133","4","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klawzie/recommended/381100/","klawzie","Bakeneko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klawzie/","112 products in account","TL;DR:  If you can ignore terrible typos and homophones and the storyline/setting appeals to you, I recommend it. If you have concerns about the content, please scroll down to the "Content" section of my review.\n\n---\n\nOverall Impression: If you've read mobile otome games before, I'd say it's "about what you'd expect", though I enjoyed this one better than any of the other mobile otome games I've played before. (Granted - I haven't played any mobile otome game past about a dozen chapters. I get too annoyed with the way the story is doled out and would rather pay for all of it at once.) I find their editing rather appallingly bad and I wish they'd put more effort into correcting at least that much, but I don't regret the money I spent (I purchased the game when it was 40% off, or about 15 dollars USD).\n\nContent: Please keep in mind if you didn't already get the impression from the age confirmation that there is "H"/adult writing. The CGs themselves are PG-13-ish level at the most racy, but the writing can be quite... direct. Some of it is nicely steamy, some of it verges a little on the vulgar side (most likely due to the editing/translation). If you prefer "sweet" romance, this is really not right for you, even though the heroine is herself quite "sweet".\n\nAs another warning - if forced seduction/assault is something that upsets you, this is also a title you'll want to avoid. It happens in multiple routes, though I will "spoiler" that the worst I can remember it getting is groping and partial nudity. To put it in context, I think a lot of it is the man in question misunderstanding the situation and some of it is pure desperation. Please consider your own comfort levels.\n\nTranslation: Overall, the translation was decent. I understood most of what was being said and I think I picked up most of the subtext. (Certainly, I understood the subtext far better than the heroine...) There were a few areas where I wasn't certain what was going on, but that is probably because of...\n\nEditing: The editing on this is appalling. Extremely shoddy work. It's very embarrassing. Typos everywhere, terrible formatting of the text, mixed up homophones, and text errors like a hyphen being a square or character names turning into squares. They even mix up names from time to time! I have a lot of experience reading and communicating with people who know English as a second language, so I was able to understand, but for other people, it might be more difficult to get past.\n\nArt: Mixed bag. Some of it is very lovely. Some of it is clearly rushed. Overall, I did like it, but there aren't a ton of CGs or poses/sprites for each gentleman, so if art is the main reason you're getting the game, you'll probably be disappointed.\n\nCharacter Design: Good. Each character is pretty distinctive and their character sprites clearly show their personalities using costuming and body language.\n\nStory: Please understand that this game was originally a mobile game. Mobile otome games typically have very linear plots, generally broken down into tiny chapters, and generally do not have bad endings. They also typically give you a short, rushed, contrived way to meet all of the available bachelors and throw you headlong into picking out one without really knowing much about them.\n\nIn short, I'm not a huge fan of the way it opens. The story tries to have it's cake and eat it too - they want to stress how virginal and pure the heroine is, but also stress that it's perfectly normal for a woman her age to visit the red light district. You're not given a choice to demure - you have to pick out a courtesan on your first meeting. It's really rather a strange thing for me to gripe about since I knew I was buying a game that focused on male courtesans, I just felt a lot of the heroine's pressure and embarrassment and it made me feel uncomfortable because of the heroine's "purity" (which they stress extremely heavily throughout the game).\n\nThe routes and their related hero are all nicely melodramatic (there's really not much subtle about any of the stories since anything that starts out being subtle is hammered home hard). I enjoyed all of the heroes, though they were painted so broadly, it did end up feeling a little unsatisfying for me. They were never as I expected, even after meeting them in other routes and I did enjoy that. But most of them fell in love so quickly, most of the tension came from external forces, rather than internal.\n\nThe Heroine: Your typical "pure-hearted idiot" + "forever virgin". Neither are particularly tropes I like, and when paired together, it makes me slightly uncomfortable. I understand why the men were drawn to her, considering because of their profession, they rarely met anyone like her, but I wish she and the player weren't treated like idiot children. It's particularly annoying when you're presented with options that either make you tone-deaf or leave you open to being called stupid. For all my complaints, though, the Heroine did have something of a personality and didn't provoke me to want to shake her until her head rattled, so that's an improvement over most mobile otome heroines!\n\nIn closing... I know I've ranted quite a bit, but most of it is minor concerns. I'm just expressing my own openly in case anything I've said is a deal breaker for someone else! Most of the offenses were things I either have a high tolerance for (melodrama), took in stride considering the context (the forced seductions), or am willing to ignore just to have another amusing otome game translated into English (the embarrassing editing). I hope the review helped you!","October 18, 2015","true","19.9"," 67 of 70 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","67","70","3","0"

Your choices only affect that character's ending, as the higher likability %, the better chances you hav at getting the true ending)\nThe typesetting of the English translation was so badly done, I had to switch to Japanese halfway through because the words kept getting cut off and it made it hard to read\nThe translations are just so awkward for some parts\nIf you're the type to notice, this game isn't in 1080p, but I can't tell the difference\nOverall, this game is well made, but the price is a setback and if you get ticked off about typesetting and awkward translations, then I would suggest you either play the game in Japanese/Chinese or not buy it at all. It really depends on what you do and don't like, but since this game's prologue is free and available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, I would suggest you check it out first before shelling out the money to buy this game. The price is a setback, so buy it on sale, which is what I did. The PS Vita version apparently comes with one extra route and full voice acting, so I think that would be a better investment than buying it on Steam. Despite all the negative things I said in this review, I still would recommend this game for its content, artwork/CGs and overall storyline and replayability. 7/10","December 26, 2015","true","18.8"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","29","29","0","0"

The art seemed pretty, the story looked interesting and it looked like it would be a good game in general. The first thing I noticed when I opened the game, was how BAD the menus looked, and it being a port from the mobile version and all, it was understandable.\n\nSo the story goes like this. The protagonist (you) live on an island that FOR SOME REASON don't have enough men, and because of that, all the "ikemens" have to be courtesans (And I don't still quite understand why???). So the protagonist ends up helping a young couple run away and in exchange they gave her a lot of money (Because this makes totally sense, Am I right? :>) and what she do next?! SHE'S GOING TO GET THE D! So yeah, she goes to Kikuya and met a bunch of hot guys that you can choose to date!\n\nTalking about the routes now, not all of them were bad, I really liked Kagura's route and he made me feel like it was worth getting this game because he was precious and I love him ♥ and Tokiwa's route was good too (of course, this is my opinion).\n\nBut all the others routes had some kinda of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that make the game feel so draggy and boring to me sometimes, especially Iroha (and he has that second season that was even worse...). You choose the route and the protagonist just feel in love with the guy almost immediately, there's no development at all and because of that I didn't find the romantic scenes that good, because ALL OF SUDDEN they were all "chummy chummy" with each other, and if it wasn't bad enough, sometimes the guys would get so push that they would almost ♥♥♥♥ her.\n\nAnd then there's the translation and grammar errors. I could let it slide, but for a $29.99 USD game, this is kinda unnaceptable. Sometimes the names would be in Japanese, lot of grammar errors and some translations that didn't make sense! If you wanna see a example: here[puu.sh]\n\nNot only that, the game isn't even voiced and the there's like, only three~four musics to create ambience and they would switch so suddenly, that I felt like I was listening to Happy and then it justs cuts off and start playing Careless Whisper.\n\nThe only redeeming points of this game are: The art (even though some CGs would look really bad, imo)and a lot of content (you get 13 chapter for each guy (except Iroha Second Season) two endings, an epilogue to each ending and some extras stuff like Valentine's Day).\n\nSo yeah, if you REALLY want this game and there's is no way you can get a Vita port, wait for a promo, because the price isn't worth it.","April 9","false","35.4"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","25","32","2","0"

I really did. I wanted it to be good, because as a fan of dating sim and otome games, I am painfully aware of the fact there is not a lot of varity in those kinds of games available outside of Japan. It's mostly indies or ported games so the attitude towards these games is mostly, "Take what you can get and be grateful."\n\nThis game though, I'm not impressed with. I played for two straight hours and I just feel dirty because of it. To be fair though, the music and art design are very impressive. It looks and sounds very well done and I'd give it top marks on that alone if it weren't for my beef with it.\n\nThe writing and the characters are awful. I mean, completely awful. The lowdown is this. There's a redlight district on an island you're tasked with making a delivery to and on the way you help a couple trying to escape because men on this island are effectively slaves. Uh... okay, and I'm going to try to be romanced by one? Way to make me feel creeped out right off the bat. Anyway, you help them escape so he can get married and in return you come into some money and fancy clothing. You're actually there to make a delivery and so when you go to the place in question, you immediately meet (most of) your romance options.\n\nThese guys are creeps, like almost every single one of them. Playing this I got grabbed, felt up, talked down to and forced to drink alcohol AGAINST MY WILL MIND YOU! I was compared to a piece of meat, and the owner, the OWNER himself told me I needed to be pretty and more receptive in order to "earn a man's seed". Seriously, what in the world?\n\nNow, I'm not going to pretend I'm some expert on courtesans or this time period. While I've studied a little I'm sure there are plenty of people who know way more than me, but I know there is a difference between hooker and courtesans. You go to the nice places to be entertained, romanced and bedded. You go see a hooker to sleep with and be on your way in twenty minutes and probably treated poorly because they couldn't care less about entertaining you.\n\nThat's how I felt here. I felt like I'd stepped into a place where no one knew the first thing about how to treat a lady. More than that, of course the female character has to be this shy little waif who will just take this appalling treatment. The, "Uh... ah... I... um..." responces to everything happening to here was so cliche, along with the, "Even though I'm shy and uncomfortable with this, he's too alluring for me to fight against it." Why did this have to be done? Why can't I just play a girl who WANTS to go to this place instead of being forced to stay by the owner? Why can't I pick a guy and make it rain for him? Why does this essentially have to be a story about a girl romanced against her will by a guy who is, again, a slave? Why when I do get a choice on how to act, (By the way I basically told the owner I didn't want to hear his vulgar bs about seed recieving. Seriously, what?) only to get laughed at and dismissed? Guys? Uh... I'm a customer here, both in and out of this game world. Is a little respect for the customer that much to ask for?\n\nSo in the end you play a girl who despite saying multiple times she doesn't want to be there and wants to leave, is forced to stay and pick one of the men there that insulted and grabbed at her without even knowing so much as her name, and she is too weak willed not to do anything but go along with it. Pick someone wrong and you get yelled at by the other workers there and made fun of, pick someone else and basically the exact same thing happens, and it all goes down hill from there. It all has this forced feeling to it, and honestly that's not what I want. I didn't get forced to buy this game. I bought it, sat down and played it because I wanted to.\n\nYet here's the intro. "Your heart, body and womanhood are all on the line. You will never be able to escape. Not from the seductive wiles of the courtesans. No, let's be more accurate: From the pure love of the courtesans." No... no I think the first statement was correct. It's wiles and it's not even seductive wiles at that. This whole thing of there being no men on the island feels cheap, as if this is the only reason the men can get away with acting like such jerks. "Oh... well, women can't get the D anywhere else so they put up with these guys." "What about the men on the mainland who can get married and be happy with you and give you children and a family life? Clearly the rich women could afford it at least." "SHUSH! PLAY THE GAME, SCUM! DON'T YOU DARE BRING LOGIC IN HERE!" Except, yeah. Let's bring in logic because the second I stop to think all these things, the game isn't fun. It's lame, and more than that, it's insultive.\n\n"You will never be able to escape." Yeah, game. I can escape. I can get away from your  jerk men and I can get away from your bs writing. It's called turning the game off and playing something else. Didn't think of that one, did you?\n\nI know I'm in the minority here. I bought this game because it had such great reviews, but if you're one of the fans like me who actually wants the story to be somewhat decent, don't bother. This game will insult you, treat you awful and keep pounding home that garbage of you can't get away. Doesn't bother you, play it. It does bother you? Walk away and save your money.","May 4","false","2.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","21","27","4","2"

Even though the premise is the same, all character have routes that feel different and show the situation from a slighly different angle. Everyone has very different, as i call it, Drama Plot, and sometimes it can be really, really surprising. A couple of routes totally went the way i didn't expect and that was really cool. My favourite is Iroha, i think, but i honestly liked them all a lot.\nBut man. The art. It's so stunning and wonderful, a huge part of my gameplay was staring at cgs or sprites in pure awe. As a fellow artist, i felt that artworks in this game were totally my art goals. I'd recommend the game for that alone, and yet it has a very well done story with it. Amazing!\nMusic isn't really outstanding, although there's one track (which i fondly call Takao's Theme, since it plays for the first time when he shows up) that i love wholeheartedly. What's good it's that common music doesn't get annoying even after playing all the routes.\nI liked how gentle and not very vulgar nsfw scenes were. As for someone who doesn't really enjoy nsfw things, it was a huge relief, since i was afraid i'd just have to skip some scenes while sighing annoyed.\nWhat might be not everyone's cup of tea is that the game is ultimately sweet, happy, and cute. It tries really hard to show some drama and action, but the sugar and love overwhelm everything. It is not essentialy a bad thing, and is perfectly enjoyable, just be aware that it's that kind of game where love always wins and is the most important. After money.\nAs for downsides, it's kinda sad not everything from the vita port of the game was brought to steam. I also felt sad that there's no equal amount of side stories per character. It kinda feels like something is lacking, but i have no idea whether original japanese game has more stories. If it does, i hope they will be implemented eventually.\nAs the game is now, i don't think i can recommend it for the full price. But when it's discounted, go for it. I spent some quality time playing this game.\n\nOh yeah, and heroine's mother is the best character in the game.

The vita version is not available in English, but is the only version with voices.\n\n+ Art is very nice. I quite like the painterly, soft colors with sketchy lineart. Sometimes the MC has eyes, sometimes she's drawn in an angle that purposefully hides them.\n+ There are 2 endings for each guy, super happy ending and happy ending. Both endings are HAPPY in the full sense of the word, which I'm A-OK with. I've been playing a lot of games with bad/unfulfilling endings so these felt refreshing to me.\n+ There is bonus content. You can unlock a few short stories as well as short epilogues.\n+/- Romance is the main focus of the plot (forbidden love). Lightly to moderately smutty, ranging from descriptions of kissing and touching to metaphorical descriptions of sex. Brief scenes of softcore porn is the most accurate way to describe it.\n+/- Quite a few grammar errors here and there on each route. This did not bother me much as I play a lot of mobile otome games where the translation is almost always poorly done.\n+/- The story explores the world it set up, but does not focus on the truly dark themes it presents. Forbidden romance is the main theme of D3 Publishers's/Dogenzaka Lab's otome game titles. I enjoyed reading the stories for the most part.\n- The MC is super naive and reckless. I should be tolerant of this, since these traits are so common for otome protagonists, but it doesn't stop it from being infuriating at times.\n- BGM is monotonous, I found myself muting it after 2 playthroughs.\n- Unvoiced. There is a voiced Vita version that also has a 7th guy, not to mention the mobile version has sprite animations that were removed from this port as well.\n- Chapters end abruptly, which makes them feel short. The only exception is Iroha's sequel, which has less chapters, but are lengthy and are divided appropriately. The extra stories are also short.\n- The choices don't really seem to matter, as you can easily achieve the super happy ending with less than 50% likeability (except Hayabusa and Iroha's sequel route).\n\nI would recommend this because the steam version has all of the story content available for a reasonable price (versus the mobile version). I prefer stories that have a lot of romance (I'm pretty tolerant with sleazy, cheesy romances), so this game definitely fills that spot for me.\n\nThe steam version has gone on sale (about twice now) for about $10 which is a must buy price if you ask me. I bought the game on release which was $18 and I felt it was worth the value.","May 16","true","61.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I miss the animations on the phone a little as they were removed but it doesn't lose much. The art work is beautiful, the stories are really good so far.\nOn reflection each story on the android version is £2-3. There's 6 characters witha main story, a sequal and a date all in that price range each. Iroha has a 2nd season and there's a bunch of side stories as well. Whether you buy this game at £14 on offer or £23 at full price you are getting a bargain as the android price would come to above £40 easily. I think more visual novels should do this.\nThere are a fare few spelling errors but considerably less than if you read "Metro" news articles so that's something.\nAgain, beautiful art.\n\nEdit- 14 hours into this game now and that's just the 4 characters main routes plus fast forwarding through to get the other ending.

I have a little over eight hours in and there's still much more for me to enjoy.\n\nWhen your mother asks you to run an errand for her, you end up in the Yoshiwara pleasure district, where the men of the island you live on offer their bodies to women in exchange for money. At one of the more famous brothels, they mistake you for the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and invite you to pick out one of their courtesans for the night. And purely by accident, you happen to have a lot of money on you; enough to buy a dreamy night of pleasure...\n\nDepending on who you pick for the night, the story diverges from there as you explore your romance with this beautiful courtesan. There are six guys to choose from, all with different and distinct personalities, and playing their route will give you background information on them. They all have dreams they wish to achieve, despite their situation, and maybe you can help them with that...\n\nThe Good+ Lots and lots of content! Sequel stories, date scenes, etc\n+ Many romance options to choose from, not all with stereotype personalities\n+ Intimate, steamy scenes; definitely 18+ (though the art is not explicit)\n+ All characters get a bit of depth\n+ Gorgeous artwork\n+ Almost impossible to get a bad ending with the man of your choice\n\nThe Bad- Horrendous editing for the English version, including but not limited to: homophones, bad translations, messed-up character names, weird punctuation, typos, etc.\n- Only two or maybe three background songs\n- Rushed art here and there\n- A weird focus on the main protagonist being a pure & innocent virgin\n- The protagonist in general is very passive and weepy\n- Some creepy sexual behaviour, but not in all routes\n- If you put the game on full-screen, it becomes terribly pixelated\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this game if you're into visual novel/otome/romance games but ONLY if you wouldn't be bothered by the terrible editing. For me, that's the worst part of the game. Unlike many of the other reviewers here, I never played other versions of this game but the PC version, so I was not bothered by the lack of animation in the character art, for example.\n\nAt its core, this game is a romantic & steamy adventure. All the romance options get some manner of depth when you play through their route, and not all of them turn out to be the stereotypical man you had expected them to be. Of course, I fell head over heels for the stoic intellectual, Kagura, though the manager of the store (Iroha) also has one heck of a story.\n\nJust... maybe don't buy this game at full price. Content-wise, it might be worth it, but in terms of editing for the English version and lack of animated character art & voice acting, it's not. Oh well. I did end up buying it at full price myself anyway because I was on a ridiculous romance game rampage.","January 26","true","12.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's not high art by any means (and there could have been an interesting setting there that is glossed over and generally unexplored), and the translation isn't great, but the art is pretty. The routes are all very self-contained, and there's no way not to get a guy you're chasing once you're on one; no sudden bad endings or game overs. The guys are also fairly interchangeable, and most of the focus on each route is on the protagonist's personal growth, rather than on them.\n\nSo, if you like visual novels, you could do way worse than this, just wait until it's on sale.","December 28, 2015","true","11.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's what drew me to this game in the first place. I think it's very nice and I like the style.  I have no complaints about the art itself, but it's more about me pointing out inconsistencies: (1) Regarding the CG's, sometimes the heroine's eyes would show, and in others they don't. I know that it's a thing in visual novels, but usually games would have already decided with showing the main character's eyes most of the time or not in CG's. (2) The clothes of the person the heroine is talking to would change from time to time, but the dialogue makes no note of him changing clothes. Aside from that, the art seems soft, much like the heroine's personality.\n\nRegarding the story, some routes were more interesting than others. Some routes showed more character development and relationship progression than others. It was a bit unrealistic to fall in love after a couple of days, but I did enjoy the stories for what they were. Personally, my favorite route was when I pursued a certain manager. It's nice that the game included a second story for him. On the other hand, the heroine's childhood friend does not appear in other routes, does not have any substories, and is not mentioned in any other route. I happen to like the childhood friend trope, so I was a bit disappointed with that. There were also some spelling errors (homophones) and awkward use of some words throughout the game. Like the use of "comfit" in the game... I think it was referring to konpeito? Not a big deal, but the dialogue was a bit confusing at times.\n\nAnyway, by the time I finished all the stories and the routes, I still wanted to read more. I don't regret the purchase, despite the things I pointed out. I fully enjoyed it and I liked all the characters.","October 23, 2015","true","18.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story/subject matter is fairly mature but without moving into eroge(18+).  The stories were more compelling than I expected and fairly diverse.

On a certain man's route they teased other courtesans, the men of Kikuya, I had no idea who they were and I was really confused to see them so I looked it up and sure enough there's another game on Steam.\n\nKikuya came out before Ohgiya and so I fell for their little trap and was instantly interested in Kikuya, until I seen the $30 price tag. I knew from playing Ohgiya that I wasn't going to pay $30 for this game, I will pay $30 for a VN that is well fleshed out, has proper grammar, and more than 6 CG's per character. That being said, I vowed to buy Kikuya when it came on sale, and sure enough it certainly did.\n\n$10 is what I paid for this game and I'm quite happy that I only spent $10 on it. Some of the names in the game ocassionally are wrote in Japanese, in the prologue there's a few errors that I noticed right away. I find that the story relies on coincidence instead of actually figuring out a way around things. I knew from the prologue that it was going to be like because she just happens to be handed a bunch of money and valuable things, thus leading her into the pleasure district of Yoshiwara.\n\nI like the men, obviously. They all seem playful and a lot more expressive then the men of Ohgiya. I played through Tokiwa's route because I'm a sucker for blonds and I wasn't dissapointed but I found myself raising an eyebrow once or twice whenever things would just magically happen. "How nice for her." I would find myself thinking.\n\nThe artwork is gorgeous, that's one of the main reasons for buying the series. I adore their art and I want more of it, if they release another Men of Yoshiwara I will buy it if the price is right.\n\nDon't pay $30 for this game, it's not worth $30 in my opinion.

MAN ♥♥♥♥♥S EVERYWHERE.\n\nWelcome to Kikuya.\n\nI bought it on sale, and I enjoyed it for what it was. I am bloody glad I didn't pay full price. Aside from the horrible, immersion destroying typos and the lack of voice actors - which I am sure would have improved the game significantly - there was also a terrible texture error with the bonus character Hayabusa.\n\nWhen Hayabusa was facing slightly to the right, the "leopard print" texture on his kimono was all pixelated. I can understand the typos to some extend, but as a visual novel, the visuals really must be top notch. Once I noticed that, I couldn't enjoy that character's story anymore. I understand that many people probably didn't even notice, however, I am a very visual person and I sure as hell noticed.\n\nOn the other hand, the main character (girl) was quite cute - although a bit too much of a crybaby for my tastes. And there were some stories I really enjoyed - Kagura's in particular was my favorite and the only one I felt was genuine. Iroha was also a great story towards the end, but the beginning was too pervy and forceful - which isn't for everyone. The rest were pretty mediocre and I don't understand why she fell in love with them all so much, nor how they fell in love with her. Is the innocent face of a dumb virgin that attractive to courtesans? Oh well, maybe if she has money, right?\n\nOverall I had fun, and there are literally hours worth of reading and stories here. Some are better than others and some you will like more or less, due to personal tastes. The original artwork for the main game is also stunning, but Hyabusa's and Iroha's (Second Season) are significantly lower in quality and imagination than the original boy's illustrations.\n\nIf you like otome games, give it a go - just not at full price.","March 2","true","15.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Sure, she's an otoge MC, but the stereotypical elements of her personality are plot-related and she can actually be assertive. I fond the soundtrack quite pretty, although I suspect there are only 3 songs remixed. It's a port from mobile, so it's no deal breaker.\nThe chapter format and UI and the narrative itself were clearly made with smartphones in mind. The narrative can't be super deep, but I found it engaging and the characters were diverse enough to make me enjoy each route. Sequels, Date Scenarios and Sub Scenarios are included as well with a handful of CGs from the Vita version. I'm a bit bummed that there are no voices nor the E-mote animations, but I can live without.

This game was a happy accident, and is now one of my favorite otome games ever. If you enjoy visual novels and are willing to read something more mature then this game will definitely be the better buy than the mobile version.\n\nThe short version:\n\nPros\n-Great storylines per route. They all tend to interact with each other well without being too repetitive.\n-Great characters. I honestly don't dislike any of the cast. Yet they're each unique.\n-Music is great. I wish I just had the soundtrack.\n-Artwork is beautiful (even if some expressions can get a tad wonky)\n-In terms of content, you actually get a lot in this package. Keep in mind on mobile platforms each route costs roughly $3.00, plus different price tags for most of the other bonus content.\n-Fun and cheesy writing (also a con XD )\n-The backdrop of the story is actually really friggin' dark when you think about it.\n-Promotes a proactive heroine. The men are trapped in Kikuya and can't see you. If you want the man, YOU have to chase after them.\n-Doesn't shame sexuality and actually promotes it.\n-Little details from character designs, to the rules of how service in Kikuya takes place, are decently accurate mirrors of Oiran life back during the Edo period (with some creative liberties, of course).\n\nCons\n-No voiceovers, which is a CRYING SHAME. This game was originally made for the PSP or PS Vita which sported voice acting from a top-notch cast, including the giant known as Kosuke Toriumi. Those who also have a basic knowledge of Japanese will miss out on furthur understanding since we have to rely only on the translated text.\n-Despite this being a port of the mobile version, we don't get the sprite animations the movile versions have. So basically we got cheated in terms of ports.\n-Cheesy writing in some of the scenes. Also some relatively odd choices in editing.\n-Choices don't really change the actual story. You might get a different reaction but the plot doesn't really diverge.\n-PSVita version has another character that we don't: Keiji.\n-Price, despite the content you get with it, isn't very competitive. I bought this on sale for $19.99 or something like that, and I felt that price was much more fair. You can buy the infamous Hakuouki and Sweet Fuse for much cheaper than this and both games offer easily twice the content. Unless you have extra money hanging around I'd wait for a sale.\n\nThe More Detailed version\n\nThe Men of Yoshiwara immediately caught my attention because of the unique premise. During the Edo period of Japan (the period of isolation before the Meiji restoration), there were segregated pleasure quarters in designated "Flower Towns" where prostitution was legalized with very strict rules. Yoshiwara was one of those towns. Here Oiran (NOT Geisha. There are differences), or courtesans as the game calls them entertain clients with similar skill sets to Geisha but also sell their bodies for a night of pleasure and companionship. Basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a heart of gold story.\n\nUsually in stories revolving around the Floating World the women are the center piece, but this game turns the idea on its head by putting men in the role of the Oiran. In this game's case it also comes with a bit of a tragic story: men are apparently very rarely born. As such, all men born on your island are automatically sold to the pleasure district in order to help women have babies. Yeah...these guys are basically breeding tools. Hence my point about a dark backdrop.\n\nThis also shows us male characters in a more vulnerable light. Usually in otome games men are much more...powerful. More overwhelming. After all they're the stars so they should stand out. But here they're Oiran, and it's illegal for them to freely chase the heroine. So we get to see males still exhibit their masculinity but also be vulnerable. Some of their stories are actually pretty heartbreaking. You still get the scenes where they take the lead and teach the heroine about "love" and dominate, but for the most part this vulnerability of them being trapped and exploring typically "feminine" tropes is a side to these characters we don't see often. And it's a very enjoyable change of pace!\n\nThat being said every game has its hang ups. Certain portions of the game do read like a cheesy (badly written) romance novel. Which can make this HYSTERICAL to play with friends reading aloud. However sometimes it does drive you out of the immersion (those who played Iroha's route will know what I mean: "His whitefish fingers." ...what? Or even "I accepted his wedge." Wedge? Really? ). On top of this the player's choices really don't change how the story plays out much. You only gain points towards one of two possible outcomes.I'm actually a little bumed there's no bad ending possibility because in this scenario there's PLENTY abound that could have happened.\n\nThat said, the story's unique and the characters are just downright adorable. Iroha and Kagerou won me over, but my heart ached for each guy. The Heroine is also surprisingly progressive! She's usually the one who makes the first step in initiating actions in the storyline. It's one of the few games that made me want to play through every possible outcome.\n\nHuge thank you to the developers for localizing the game in English! And thank you for giving us a complete package on Steam. I HATE the nickel and dime method mobile otome games enforce. Definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun otome game to get lost in.

The characters seem to be fairly interesting and the setting of the game fits in with the characters and where they are in the game. This game is definatly not everyones cup of tea, some parts of the game are somewhat.... intimate with 18+ stuff that isn't really said at all in the game so just be aware of that. This game is also a port from phones, with a few changes in the text, but they took the animtations out of the characters for some reason I am unsure about though.\n\nGame PlayThis game is a novel, romance game. I believe that it was orignally made for phones, and therefore this game is a port, although having a look at the phone version, it seemed that they took out the animations for the characters for some bizarre reason. The game itself is fun if you are the sor tof person who likes to play there romance, novelist games for hours on end. For me personally I got bored of the game after doing the first route which took me about 2 hours to do. It seems that each character has it's own route, with a regular and true ending to them both. Upon doing some research on this game, there is a character that comes with two routes which increases the replay value of the game slightly. There are also a fair amount of achievements implimented into the game, and a few trading cards to be idled for as well. However, there are a few problems that I have with this game. I am going to assume that this game was orginally made for Japanese, that takes me to my next point about the translation of the game. Of course, you can't always translate things 100% correctly, (even if you do use Google translator) but there are some typos here and there while I was playing the game. Also some of the words where getting cut off at the end so it made it rather difficult to read.\nScore (Out of 10): 5 - This game seems to have a lot of gameplay, if you are into this kind of genre then you will get the maximum game play out of it.\n\nGraphics/Art StyleDespite some of the negativity overwhelming the positive on the Game Play section of this review, the art style for this game kind of makes up for it. It seems that the developers really worked hard to get this really nice art style to fit with the type of game they where creating. The small details like the lighting and shading of the game makes it really look vibrant and nice. The shine in the characters hair really does look rather nice. Although sometimes the characters positioning did look a little weird, with their hands at awkward angles that didn't really look natural or comfortable to be in that position.\nScore (Out of 10): 9 - the art style looks really nice, really sets the atmosphere for this game. However there are a few weird hand postures that are at awkward angles.\n\nSound & MusicI myself kind of liked the music for the small proportion that I was playing the game for. However, the music track was rather short and it was continously looping itself. I found myself getting rather annoyed at the same soundtrack over and over again so I turned off the music itself. If they could maybe add some more music to the game, or make the music last longer then I might've played more of the game itself.\nScore (Out of 10): 7 - the music fitted the atmosphere, but it got rather repetitive and boring. Possibly add more music to the game or make the music last longer.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","March 10","true","4.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

If you have ever played any mobile otome games, you know what you are in for.  You choose your guy right from the start, there are distinct chapters and side stories, and the story is VERY ADDICTIVE!  Unlike mobile offerings, however, you pay one price to own the game and have everything right from the start.  No distracting microtransactions, in-app purchases, energy, etc.  The game is perfect to play in very small bursts, but if I had more time I could definitely see myself enjoying just going through a whole route all at once!  I am always eager to find out what happens next.\n\nThe short prologue followed by a screen where you "choose your guy" reeks of a mobile game money-making setup, but surprisingly, it actually works in this game's favor.  (No spoilers, this is all "first few minutes" info here)  Basically, your protag walks into a brothel, briefly meets each guy, and is asked to pick which one she wants to spend the evening with.  This setup seems contrived for most games, but actually makes sense for the situation at hand (given my not-first-hand experience with host clubs and like that I've gained from Japanese popular culture)!  Also, the protag has the stereotypical "I'm such a pure, innocent, naive virgin" vibe which is another otome game trope, but even that makes sense for this game.  In the first few minutes we find out that since men are almost never born on her island, she has hardly even seen any other young men in her life.  No wonder she has never learned about the "birds and the bees"...she has never had any reason or motivation to!\n\nMy major gripes with this game would be some grammar, spelling, language errors, which you have probably seen before if you have played mobile otome games, or even any of mangagamer's very early releases, etc.  It didn't bother me that much but it is worth noting.  Also, the default screen resolution looks fine, but is too small on my 32-inch TV that I game on, so I turned on fullscreen and the graphics took a noticeable nosedive, worse than nearly every other visual novel I have played.  Despite this, the guys are still very attractive so I don't let that hinder my enjoyment of the game either...but still worth noting.","October 23, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As someone mentioned in their review the game goes beyond kissing;) But at least the pictures shown are not inapropiate but very beautiful. I'm pretty sure if some pictures were inapropriate those pictures would of gotten censored on steam anyways.\n\nIn my opinion my favorite route I played was Iroha's route. Second pick is tough so I cant say LOL.\n\nHonestly there where only a few things that bugged me.\n\n1-I really wish Hayabusa was included in the game more. For some reason you only see him in his route and he has the least pictures to unlock:( If Hayabusa had more content I would of rated him my second favorite route to play.\n\n2-I found out from reading that The Men Of Yoshiwara has a PSVita version. This is important because this is not the Vita version. The Vita version has voice acting and an extra charcter to play. So for this reason I would only buy this on a sale and not the $29.99. I bought this on the $17.99. Games like these cost a bit as you have to pay to play this one. At least for $17.99 it's so much worth this version that steam has put out at least. But if they brought the Vita version I would of gladly pay the $29.99. Let's be honest voice acting escpecially in a VN makes the VN a hundred times better.\n\nSo all in all if you like VN, not bothered by typos, despite the fact that there is a Vita version and not bothered by this fact I would get The Men Of Yoshiwara. I would buy only on discount though.\n\nI almost didn't get the game due to the fact that I read that there was a Vita version but still glad I took a chance and got this nice VN.\n\nSo to leave off have a fun time playing The Men Of Yoshiwara;)","December 14, 2015","true","43.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This PC version (and the Vita version) was based off the original otome game on IOS and Android which like many mobile otome games, were designed for playing during the trips to school/work on public transport - so it was made to be brief. Despite this, I still enjoyed playing the routes, they were a lighthearted from other heartbreaking/heartwrenching otome games I have played and it was interesting seeing the different motivations and reasons for being in Kikuya from the different courtesans.\n\nArt usually plays a large amount in persuading me to purchase an otome game and this game has really pretty art in the character sprites (though it is a shame that they have removed the emofuri animations found in the original version of the game), CGS (especially Hanabusa's ones--being the newest) and trading cards. But to be honest, what else can you expect from a big otome game company.\n\nThere were a handful of times I have smiled/chuckled whilst playing the game especially during banter between the courtesans but they can't hold anything against some of the 'iffy' translations in the game.....e.g referring to a male's p**is as a 'wedge' xD\n\nUnfortunately i'm currently grinding through Hayabusa's route - 'unfortunate' mostly due to personal preferences against the childhood friend route in otome games^^; However, overall I quite enjoy this game though I do wish that there was a 'skip read' option just to make replaying routes to get the alternate ending easier (though to be honest, it would only affect the last chapter) and an 'Autoplay' option like most otome games but once more, these are mostly due to personal preference.\n\nI hope they'll introduce more characters (such as Kenji Ito currently not on this version) as well as sequels. The former probably having little chance of happening with the upcoming release of The Men of the Yoshiwara: Ohgiya (fingers crossed it'll be released on Steam! ^-^)","January 3","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get it on sale !\nIt's shorter than I expected and I guess this game is great if you just have nothing to do and want to kill time staring at beautiful 2d courtesans and maybe ended up marrying them.","May 2","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the song of it.\nAlso the character is so pretty drawn. That I have a favorites among the boys.\nAnd I was happy to see some of the other guys  in the other game *The men from Ohgiya.* make a apperiance in the game. It made me happy even if it was a small event.\nIt is a simple and understanding game. The story might come as weird for some. But if you think in a different perspective. It's a game for girls that aims to make the girl gamer fall in love with a well drawn handsome fantasy guy. She can pick who ever she want to meet. So the story goes kinda well with the whole concept of it.\nI like the game. To bad the game didn't got any voice actor it would be nice to hear how certain character you like would sound like.","May 7","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the overall "adult" theme of the romances, and that it doesn't just end with a hug,kiss, holding hands or just becoming a couple like in other otome games, it feels more like an actual adult relationship which is refreshing and realistic.  The artwork is beautiful to look at, and I love the CG's in the game because they all have a cohesive and soft art style that's personally aesthetically pleasing to look at. The MC doesn't lack personality, and I find her inner dialogue entertaining. The romances are all very steamy and romantic, I like the slow burn of feelings for each other in each route, and getting to know about them so they arent just pretty faces.\nSome cons are that I really wish it was voiced like in the vita version, and some grammatical errors were fixed (they arent so bad that you cant understand) but I'm enjoying the game even with these things. The music can get really repetitive at times because it loops so often, but I ended up just putting on my own music after a certain point.\nOverall, I really recommend it to anyone who is interested in buying a new otome game! I bought it while it was on sale, and it was well worth the money. Iroha is my favorite haha","May 24","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
