"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quadronips/recommended/263200/","quadronips","Lewers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quadronips/","413 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've seen the game about on the web for a while and decided to buy it purely because of my love for games such as Starbound and Terraria.\n\nI was not disappointed.\n\nSoL doesn't feel nearly as expansive as Starbound (Which i will try to avoid comparing it to, though the two are very similiar so this will be hard) however what it lacks in explorable planets and the like it seems to make up for in crafting content and the amount fo materials you can collect.\n\nOne handy little tool that you have when starting SoL is the HTWLT or Hight-tech-wrist-laser-thingy (I'm almost 100% certain this isn't what it's actualy called), which functions as all the basic tools you need to start out: pickaxe/axe, flashlight, map, object grabber and a lovely home for the AI companion that accompanies the player and provides a few tips. One thing worth mentioning is that your character won't actively pick up any objects you mine or get from a kill, this has to be done manually, an action that is default bound to the middle mouse button. In my opinion this is a good thing, as it means that your inventory doesn't have to get clogged up by dirt blocks being hoovered up by your player's legs. Unless you want it to. Weirdo.\n\nWhilst I haven't amassed a huge number of hours on SoL (yet), it feels far more realistic in some of the systems that it has, for example your inventory. In games like Terraria or Starbound, you have a grid based inventory where every item is stored in a 'slot', in SoL however you simply have a backpack in which everything you pick up is thrown, which leaves in up to you to jig it about and make it organised.\n\nThe combat also feels vastly different and improved from similiar games, as the player is able to attack in a full 360 degree circle and left clicking will perform a slash attack whilst right clicking will perform a thrusting attack. You will also find that different melee weapons have different effective ranges and that they all feel weighty and satisfying to use. The bow (I haven't tried any other ranged weapons yet) also feels just as satisfying, almost as satisfying as watching a sheep run in fear as the first arrow hits their backside.\n\nThe crafting is pretty similiar to any other game, with one key difference: you can actually take things apart and use their pieces in other recipes. I can't really say much about the building side of the game as i've spent a vast majority of my time hunting chickens and cooking their flesh, though i still have no idea how to eat it (you do HAVE to eat in this game, in case you were wondering).\n\nAlso, BACON.\n\nIf there's one thing i'd have to pick on it would be the level of guidance for new players, some actions such as eating and destroying background blocks aren't covered in the few tips your AI companion gives you and I have yet to figure out how to do either of these things. Having said that, this is the first time the game has been playable by the public, so i'm sure the Devs will be adding more tutorials as the game progresses :)\n\nOverall SoL is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of similiar games as it feels familiar enough to not be daunting, yet it has quite a few nifty features that help it feel fresh and new. Please don't be put off by the people that say this is a Starbound clone or anything similiar, SoL has its own legs and it stands on them perfectly well.\n\nGreat job Devs, keep up the good work :D\n\nEDIT: I figured out how to eat, you right click on the food and a stomach icon fills up, though the stomach icon was hidden behind the inventory screen so I had to drag that out the way. Still, BACON.\n\nEDIT: You can't destroy natural spawning background blocks at all, but you can place your own over them :) Oh and the HTWLT is actually called the 'Meg Tool'.","January 27, 2014","true","13.3"," 237 of 253 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","237","253","0","5"

I mean, at $8.00'ish dollars it's not a tough sell, really. I have to say that Signs of Life has impressed me greatly so far. I definitely LOVE the very colorful, beautifully crafted world, and already I can't get enough of this game.\n\nI loved discovering that I could bash stuff with a torch. I laughed when I found out that I could 'suck' an item towards me, and watch the item launch somewhere when I let off the 'suck' button too soon. I found that if I sucked up the Impaler Spikes and let the button off to quickly, it would actually impale me. Tell me that small pleasures are the sign of a small mind, but either way, sign me up. :) I love that the Pickaxe has a more realistic approach to swinging in a true arc than any other 2D miner, and using the right button gives you the ability to do the little tappy-tappy semi-swings that let you work in smaller areas. I am discovering silly little things all the time, and it's great!\n\nI own and play Starbound, Edge of Space, Terraria and Craft the World. As I've noticed, a lot of people are comparing this game to Starbound, so I'll work from that common perspective. So far me (and my kids) have put 142 hours into Starbound. But it's missing something. Perhaps there is just SO much randomness to everything in Starbound that it's difficult to identify with anything in it. My kids grew bored quickly with it, and I was trying to figure out why. It may have to do with dated graphics, which seem very washed out, but that's the art style they are going for and it doesn't bother me a whole lot, especially after growing up on ASCII games. The only thing I can speculate at, is that there is so much to do in Starbound, but not much reason to do anything. Hunting for food is a chore, and killing the 4-5 monster types on a planet gives me high marks on the yawn scale. And 'treasure chests' often go ignored because I know it's just gonna contain another Tier 1 weapon, or a copy of Tech I've already received 5 other times.\n\nNow with the few hours I've had with Signs of Life, everything is fascinating. I want to discover as many new things as possible to see what I can build. AGIS (Aegis?) has a low and wicked sense of humor for an AI, and the creatures of the world feel life-like. Chickens lay eggs (and even have the animation to prove it!). The bugs( insects) are so happy being in the game that they do flips. What more of an endorsement do you need?! The monsters begin to differ as you dig deeper into the world, and they get tougher too. Every time I stumble upon a new life-form, I think, "What little surprises do you have for me to discover, my pretty?" The only thing that truly rings false to me so far, is finding sheep and goats living down deep inside the supremely dark and oxygen deficient caves and caverns. Perhaps that is a bug that may be fixed later.\n\nAnyway, to sum up this extremely long post, Signs of Life has some serious promise, and for the few hours I've played it, it has been very enjoyable, fun, funny and I can't wait to put some more time into this game, to see what other simple pleasures I can discover in this beautifully rendered game.\n\nKeep up the great work!","February 1, 2014","true","54.0"," 81 of 83 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","81","83","0","1"

The player explores the world and mines resources to craft new items.  Items range from armor and weapons to tools that aid in the crafting of new objects.  The exploration is great.  It's as fun and exciting as it can be in a 2d world.  The crafting is rewarding and the new equipment looks awesome as you equip it.  The gathering of blocks needs to be more stream line though and the fighting/motion is awkward.    If that gets fixed it will be a really fun game.  It's a decent value at less than $8.","January 27, 2014","true","6.5"," 90 of 107 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","90","107","0","0"

That says alot about the interest the developer has to his player-base.  Thanks for that.  In terms of the game itself, it doesn't seem like much when you first see the online video and feels a little "strange" when first playing.  However, the game is carefully crafted and well designed.  What takes the most time is the controls.  But hit ESC and select "Keybinds" to see them all.  Also, the environment is wonderful.  I love the way each sprite is rendered.  It has a simple system for these sprites and focuses on the main goals of the game.  I love the amount of content.  Literally everything has a purpose.  The building mechanics are simple enough and well designed to give you exactly the immersion needed and nothing more.  Also, I LOVE that the games make no *elaborate* claims.  The game is exactly what the description promise.  Additionally, nothing ever feels monotone and the game lays out a well defined goal.  And, this game has no MODDING capabilities yet (still a work in progress).  This I LOVE!!  Because it means the developer actually built (is building) this game, not relying on his users to create new functionality or add new content.","June 26, 2015","true","10.9"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","52","53","2","1"

( I was really wrong.) You should totally check this game out, Reason why below:\n\nQuick And Dirty:\nThe game is a must play, it is superbly refreshing both visually and game play-wise to anything in the  survival miner adventure game arena.\n\nFull Disclosure:\nLike other games of the genre, your object is mostly to survive your harsh new world.  You mine ores craft armors and tools to your delight, and build yourself a home or fortress. That's about where the similarities end.\n\nThe game has a Flash-like graphics look to it. Do not let this deter you at first sight, it's gorgeous. From the fire effects, to the smashing of eggs on enemies, to the felling of trees and leaves falling about you, the beauty and dare I say simplicity of it will draw you in. Did I mention you can light sheep on fire?\n\nI'm still not too big on the controls, a tad of a learning curve to them, mostly muscle memory though, so once you got it, you're good. But the actual movement of the player and and other mobs is really awesome and fluid. Like the ability to crouch, and still and attack and function normally allows you to build these small winding passages that your character fits through, but not for the deadly aliens looking for a meal.\n\nOh you have this like AI-Guide like thing, that's farily whimsical. I would like to see/hear more from him. Kind of like your best friend, who's sole purpose is there to troll you, and revel in your misfortunes.\n\nThe death mechanic(On death all items and equipment is dropped) is a little harsh in my opinion, and I would love to see hopefully an option for maybe like a casual and normal difficulty, and Normal being the game's default mechanic. That being said is does not take away from the fun, it further extends the dire situation your character has found themself in, and ensures a thrill to your mining runs, as there is no warp to surface or death port option, and forces players to more carefully evaluate mining situations with safety in mind, to ensuring a Spitter (Alien critter that spits some kind of corrosive acid at you, not good with children) can just drop in on you and wreck your party. Hell and if one does, time to test out them emergency protocols, otherwise known as Kill it, Kill it with Fire!\n\nSo the game is definitely worth the pennies, if surviving on hostile planets is your thing, but another thing to mention as it's a sore spot for me with a lot of these Early Access Games. This was released end of January, like 27th or 28th, since that time there have already been 10 updates pushed to address everyone's concerns and feedback, and they are very active here on the Forums for developers.  Hell, typically the Nerd Rage rants go completely unanswered and just lost to the interwebs, yet within hours of my nasty review, I was contacted and nicely mind you to address my experience. Like I wasn't told to go complain about Early Access nonsense elsewhere, It was justa simple hey, you seem to be having trouble, let us know we'll get it fixed if it wasn't already updated.","February 1, 2014","true","26.8"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","59","66","0","11"

Most games in said genre tend to visually resemble eachother, or play identically (i.e. make a crafting table, then furnace, etc...).\nSoL manages to differentiate itself from the lot, mostly thanks to it's (although minor) storyline and lore.\nSure, it has pickaxes, mining, 2D voxel worlds and the likes, but it offers much more than the run-of-the-mill sandbox game.\n\nHaving played for a good couple of hours now, I've made it to the point where I've acquired the Level 2 Access Card, and have explored the 4 structures that I've found (I'm certain there are more that I've yet to discover), and am starting to get a nice collection of gadgets, and technologically advanced items.\n\nHowever, at multiple points during my current playthrough, I started getting afraid that I might have gone through all of the content, due to the fact that I had no new recipes that seemed interesting, nor could find anything of interest that I had access to either. Though, I will admit that when I 'did' discover new recipes and the likes, I couldn't help but pull a massive smile, knowing that my playthrough wouldn't be done anytime soon.\n\nIn it's current state, the game has huge amounts of content (most of which I haven't even discovered yet), and quite a bit of potential. I'm hoping that the content shown on the trailer will be soon added -if not already-, as I'd love to find larger bases, ruins, and more content to explore.\n\nSoL is by far one of my favourite games in the sandbox genre, and could easily compete with, or even surpass games like Edge of Space, Starbound or Terraria, if enough work is put into it in the coming months of it's development.","July 11, 2014","true","11.9"," 52 of 59 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","52","59","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Antonio-ITO/recommended/263200/","Antonio-ITO","Ant (Spearhead)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Antonio-ITO/","104 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSummary: A solid engaging, and thoroughly enjoyable experience; definitely a purchase for anyone who enjoys games of Terraria’s kind. The complaints I have with this game are not too noticeably and will hopefully be fixed as it heads closer to completion.\n\nLong Review: At first glance it looks like another Terraria clone, which I’ve played but never hit off with. Signs of Life is similar in the aspect of Terraria, but possess a more serious theme with a heavy emphasis on exploration. The game is tough in the beginning due to the lack of a tutorial and new users might be deterred like I was at first. The only source of information was AGIS the AI which squats in your wrist device, and he is about as helpful as he is insensitive. Alright, I’m being a little harsh. He’s my only companion and I depend on him to discover crafting recipes. For that I can overlook his jabs and would-be-delight at my coming misfortunes. However I must put a negative on his dialogue. Some parts feel too much like no writing effort was made and instead was just words slapped together to convey the basic intention of his attitude. Tsk, tsk, shame on you developers.\n\nThe graphics are pleasing; bright and vibrant. I enjoyed the design of the characters and environment. It has more realism than you would expect from this type of game; none of Terraria’s pixelated approach. A plus in my books.\n\nThe crafting system made my brain twirl a bit in the beginning and AGIS being the help he is, only kept piling more recipes for my brain to work out, into my already flooded list. Though once you learn how the gears tick and get the basic tools up and running, it is bloody damn enjoyabe!\n\nThe soundtrack I hardly noticed. So far the songs I’ve heard when I pay attention to it, fit the whole atmosphere quite well; Peaceful and lulling, perhaps too much so as it tends to flow in one ear and out the other. I actually heard more of Terraria’s music than I did here. The lack of combat oriented soundtracks for when you engage monsters makes me give this edge of the game a slight negative.\n\nThe monsters are interesting and for the most part, well imagined and thought out. Some are the only source for certain crafting ingredients thereby forcing you into the dark reaches of the earth to hunt them down. I have my issues with their current behavior in combat. They can be a threat, especially in the early stages where you’re just learning to stand on your feet, but once you get decent gear, it is disappointing. They are also encountered sparsely, this makes it easier for new poorly equipped players, but subtracts the danger feel as you explore. However they do spawn in more numbers as you go deeper, but not enough to make you feel satisfied. The lack of types, numbers, and ease of which you can eliminate them as you get better gear subtracts from this aspect of the game. Now while I’m being a spoiled kid and bashing the hard work of the poor developers, let me just add that the lack of dangerous creatures above ground, apart from that one special chicken, is disappointing to me.\n\nNow onto the developers, the charming creators of this experience I am so enjoying. I’ve read a number of negative reviews and nearly each of them they have responded to with grace and factuality to the criticism and gripes people have of this game. They are also active on the Community Hub and welcoming to ideas. Get ready because I will hit you with a list of mine as well as issues. Ugh, when I’m actually energetic enough to write it out. Currently they are my second favorite, a big round of applause to them. Their involvement with the community was a factor in encouraging me to buy Signs of Life.\n\nNow the game has some lore which adds a nice touch. In a way it helps drive you on to discover the full story as you explore and craft. However it is currently lacking in content. Understandable since this is still early access, but please bear that fact in mind. Newcomers, if they are slow minded dimwits like me, can expect to have enough content to work through and learn the ropes for 24.8 hours before it gets dull. Progression till then is perfectly enjoyable if you’ve managed to work out how to proceed. Good news is that a tutorial is in the works. This will transform it into a smoother experience for rookies. However, currently there is only one world, or in Terraria terms, one biome. And that is the green lush forest grassland. I do hope more locations with varieties in animals and flora will be added later. Fingers crossed.\n\nNow that Signs of Life has had Co-op multiplayer added, it is even more fun. This game is another little gem lost in the swirling mass of titles being thrown into Steam since the Greenlight feature, and I find most of them to be very dreary. Don’t pass Signs of Life up if you are into the style. Perhaps genre would be a better term, but oh well.\n\nPS: It is a pity you don’t know how lazy I can be. That I managed to force myself to write a review of this game means it is worth having a gander at. Oh well, oh well. No one will believe me. That’s fine. I know myself. That’s good enough.","August 9, 2015","true","41.6"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","46","51","12","2"

Now with Steamworks Online co-op!\n\nTL;DR: Contains a lot of unique ideas for Early Access, but progression via trial-and-error is prevalent.\n\nInevitably, Signs of Life is going to get compared to Minecraft, Terraria, Edge of Space and Starbound for being a sandbox game where you build up your shelter and arsenal from scratch. However it's got enough unique features and ideas for being Early Access that a $10 pricetag can be justified.\n\nPros:\n-Developer(s) is/are responsive.\n-Many small details in the game. (hit detection and headshots, boots boost kicking damage, basic metallurgy, etc.)\n-Very clean and pleasing art style. (crisp detail in the foreground; soft detail in the background)\n-Armors aren't linearly better or worse. (i.e. damage reflection V.S. mobility V.S. energy regen)\n-Organization is very easy and convenient with crafting worktables, container placement and sets of material pouches.\n-Your wrist-attached "MEG tool" is versatile. (light, mapping, ore-scanning, mining, collecting) and convenient\n-Most enemies are exploitable in some way. (again, your MEG tool is versatile)\n-Achievement hunting is amusing. ('Me Time')\n-Saving and exiting leaves you exactly where you were on that world and character.\n\nNeutrals:\n-Currently no intro/tutorial feature, but it's planned; once implemented, should help players with game progression. Partial fix: get a friend or check out the community hub.\n-Fairly strong "grind" factor (a love/hate relationship, I'm sure) comparable to Minecraft. Not as rough as it used to be, once you get your hands on mining upgrades.\n-The music isn't terrible, but it isn't terrific either. Probably a matter of personal taste on this one.\n\nCons:\n-As of Jan 9, 2014, overall weak Wikia and Steam guide support, requiring players to figure most things out by themselves. May be different now.\n-Locational progression is confusing at first.\n-No "Trash Can" slot to recover deleted items from, creating the potential to completely delete items by accident. FIXED!\n-Ranged options are weak and/or expensive until late-game. Crossbows, bows and energy weapons are actually nice and not too difficult to obtain/keep filled. EDIT: new Sulfur Monsters and Grinder should help with getting sulfur!\n-No liquids in the world whatsoever. Haven't checked in update .5 yet.\n-By default, font size is a little small and Auto Run isn't on. Tweak your options to fix!\n-Some details are too small and require squinting at.\n\nTo iterate, Signs Of Life shows enough novel ideas, potential and active development that it's worth the $10 pricetag, and at least a close eye for free updates.","January 9, 2015","true","50.9"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","46","52","3","6"

He/it is mostly helpful, but offers a great distraction to early game failures. Such as when you get murdered by space goats like a newb.)\n\n-Game Content: So WOW. Much YES. I watched the trailer, looked through the pictures. Hit up the youtubes for a few and still all of that didn't prepare me for the amount of fun and excitment to be had. I'm writing this, and then goiing back to playing I'm having so much damn fun. The ability to transfer my character between worlds is an amazing feature I've enjoyed in other titles, and I am very thankful to have it here too! (Replayability! 10/10)\n\n-UI: Responsive and extremly user friendly. Buttons do what you'd expect them to do. There are also some you didn't think you would need, but are thankful to have! (+10 for being able to move every window!)\n\n-Crafting System: Feels mostly balanced thus far and very easy to use.\nThe right click to change to a sub crafted item makes this system flawless. No digging for a thing to craft a thing. Just click and AGIS is your uncle you have a new shiney. Little to no tab swapping for detailed crafts. Carry (most of) your crafting stations with you!? (Thats right, smelt ore while slaying aliens in the same mine shaft to craft more ammo to slay more aliens.) Perfect. 10/10\n\n-Inventory Management 100/10. (My inventory OCD is blown away by the work invested to keep my gear/mats/junk orginized and readily available. Bags, boxes, crates, furnature galore. Great work on this system!!!) (!!!!!)\n\n-Progression/pace: After playing titles that have similar systems I started with some understanding of how progressing would no doubt work. I wasn't wrong. Very fluid transition between armor sets. Almost never felt like I was grinding for anything. Just exploring for the underground stations passively gave me the materiels I needed for each upgrade to armor/tools/crafting stations. All while ENJOYING the game. Well done.\n\nThe weapon progression did seem to be a bit lacking, but thats only because I refused to waste early mats on ammo and I thought the Leaf Sword was too damn cool looking to replace. Once Steel became an abundant item in my bags, the OP cave clearing began!\n(And then I built a Material Printer and learned how to farm for Power Cores. I own my planet now. All aliens have been served eviction notices and I am currently selling mining rights to intersted buyers/fellow crash landers. Alien slave labor packages available to serious investors.)\n\nTons more to be experienced in this title that I haven't mentioned.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/263200/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen you play a game that exists in a genre that’s already heavily populated with awesome titles, it’s easy to jump to negative comparisons. In the case of Sweet Dogs Studios’s Signs of Life, you’ll be having too much fun to think about how games like Terraria or Starbound may be more expansive.\n\nSigns of Life is what Sweet Dogs Studios defines as a “sci-fi survival sandbox platformer”. It mixes different elements of crafting games while adding an adventure game feel through the storyline. The premise of this game is that you’re one of the lone survivors of a devastating incident which left most of your crew lost or dead. Your task is to land on the planet (which is conveniently Earth-like) your crew originally intended to investigate and survive long enough to find out what happened to them. In spite of the morbid implications left through the clues about your crew that you’ll find throughout the world, Signs of Life manages to stay light-hearted and keep you focused on exploration and fun.\n\nWhen you first start out, you’re given several character creation options. Since the game is still in its Early Access stage, your options are limited but the developers have promised to expand on the character creation system in the future. I simply opted to make the most girly-looking dude possible and ended up with pink slippers and a super-saiyan haircut. You then make your landing on the planet via your escape pod and quickly discover that you’re going to have to improvise in order to make it.\n\nThe crafting options in Signs of Life were a lot more intuitive and varied than I initially expected. You have dozens of options from the very beginning, and as you discover new areas and objects, your virtual companion AGIS compiles new recipes for you. AGIS is only one component of your infinitely useful wrist-laser device, which is what you use to break blocks and collect items. The only thing the wrist-laser can’t be is a weapon – you’ll have to just settle for guns, crossbows, swords, and a plethora of other weapons you can craft based on your preferences.\n\nOne of the more difficult aspects of the crafting is perhaps the gathering of the actual materials. Although some of the materials require a common-sense driven gathering process (picking up rocks from the ground, chopping down trees for wood) others require exploration (you probably won’t find a battery in a tree). You’ll also have to get used to figuring out the base components of certain objects by looking through their recipes and trailing backwards in order to achieve crafting that item. That may seem cumbersome at first, but the crafting menus are built in such a way so that everything is easily sorted and found.\n\nMy personal favorite thing about Signs of Life has to be the art style. The backgrounds that seem to move with you are beautifully done and serve as a contrast to the blockier style of the actual playing space. The graphics give an overall sense of polish to the game that may not always be present since it is still an Early Access game. The music that plays in the background is mostly non-intrusive and peaceful. While it serves to make sure that the planet you’re on isn’t entirely silent, it’s not enough to make you feel like you’re not alone – which was probably the point. Signs of Life really emphasizes the fact that you’re a lone survivor, isn’t always pleasant. The game will definitely benefit from the eventual implementation of multiplayer, as do games like Minecraft and Terraria.\n\nWith Signs of Life, Space Dog Studios has created a game with plenty of character. It’s through intuitive gameplay and special attention to detail that this game will stand out in the eyes of those who play it. When Signs of Life is finally finished and out of Early Access, it will likely have the potential to be a contender among the Terrarias and Starbounds of the genre. Signs of Life is worth the investment. It’s not a perfect game, but it’s definitely a lot of fun.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","April 15, 2015","true","47.7"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","44","53","2","3"

A super deep, and very atmospheric side scroller, that let's you kill, build, and dig your way to complete domination of your little section of the world... which is pretty big, actually.\n\nThe combat in this game isn't too engaging, although it can be pretty funny to kill a chicken with a rock.  Actually though, this game is more about finding and crafting the plans, metals and machinery to build a really cool laser rife to seriously kill that chicken... and anything else that comes your way.  Careful for the huge, metal, mechanical chicken that you may run into later on, though, as he'll probably be looking for some payback for all those dead chickens.\n\nThis game will keep you guessing for some time, and you'll probably need some cheat help to get you moving along at times.   It will keep you entertained for hours, although the long term replay value may be a little lacking.  I played it for over 40 hours before losing interest.... so it was definetely worth the money to me.","June 17, 2015","true","48.0"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","32","34","11","1"

It's well thought out and never do you feel lost or being pushed in a certain direction. (more then I can say for certain other games)\n\nGraphically speaking it is lovely (my starter ship landed next to sheep and chickens, meanwhile epic beards/pink slippers are implemented). Scales well for higher resolutions (1440p+) and has builtin options for bigger fontsizes, which is great for us older folk that don't mind the ability to actually read stuff. Controls overall are refined too. You get several item slots on the UI each being designated to a type of gear tools, melee, guns etc. Harvesting in general works well because you can have the maintool selected and just hotkey stuff like your builtin torch without switching.\n\nNot done much In the crafting department yet. All on seperate windows with flyouts under each type of craftable keeping it neat, tidy and logical. Well thought out UI in general really. On that note I *love* the Ultima Online style inventory system in which you can drop gear wherever you please in each bag. Might seen messy to those not familiar, but with the earlier mentioned slot system and scrolling between items you will soon find that it's not.\n\nSoundtrack is fitting for the game and didn't break the immersion. Overall and relaxing and enjoyable experience so far. Currently seems to be focused on refining the SP rather then MP. Which to me personally is a great thing.\n\nPrice is a steal and easily recommended.","January 28, 2014","true","4.9"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","45","56","0","0"

I've purchased quite a few that have looked promising (and even WERE promising), only to find my initial investment squandered due to the developer(s) not following up on their initial design ideas, or, in two cases, all but abandoning their game completely.\n\nTo add to that anecdote, I never caught the "Minecraft bug." I'm not very artistic, so the idea of an open world where you just GO did not appeal to me. Terraria approached the middle ground that I could see myself enjoying, but this...\n\nSigns of Life is my mecca.\n\nThere are some very unique, well thought-out aspects of the game that really lend to helping it carve out its own identity in the mire of "sandbox" games that have been popping up as of late. From the clever M.E.G. tool that you use to collect resources, to the trial-and-error method of discovering new items to craft, Signs of Life very aptly toes the line between being accessible to the player and patronizing them.\n\nAs you progress throughout the game, the developers have managed to create an atmosphere of discovery that is almost completely organic: the more you do and the more you explore, the more you will learn. That being said, there are a few aspects of the crafting system that aren't very intuitive (@Devs: perhaps a classification system for certain items could help new players to know what can and can't be used as fuel). This is, of course, where the Early Access part of the game comes in, and community involvement is a crucial part.\n\nThe developers are, thankfully, not at all like those mentioned at the beginning of this review. I have seen developer responses within the *HOUR* of an issue becoming known on the forums, and that in and of itself is one damned impressive feat.\n\nIN CLOSING:\n\n+ Wonderful art design; color schemes are fantastic\n+ The soundtrack is haunting, hypnotizing, and cathartic\n+ Excellent flow in the crafting system, save for a few bumps here and there\n+ The world is alive and makes you naturally want to explore\n\n- Some clipping issues in the terrain (my head would get stuck in 99% of cases)\n- Dodge / roll mechanic can be bothersome when trying to make minute adjustments in positioning\n- Overlapping inventory system DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELY BANANA SANDWICH I WILL TYPE IN ALL CAPS FOR THIS\n- (This last point isn't a negative, but it is because I want more story, please.)\n\nFor $10, you're making EXCELLENT use of your money.","February 6, 2015","true","55.2"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","32","37","0","7"

Maybe it will get better as the EA progresses, but so far I found myself binge playing this game once then putting it down and never picking it back up again.\n\nWhy?  Is it a bad game?  No.  But neither is a very engrossing game.  There really isn't much here that's new and unique.  It features a few small touches that are intriguing (such as the wearable holographic mini-map that must be filled in by manual scanning), but largely none of these made me really feel all that engaged.\n\nThe art and presentation is fine, if bland.  Only real complaint I had was that the high-rez, high-saturation pixel art made it hard to figure out what is an actual user interface element and what are just little visual doodads that serve no purpose.   But you learn quickly enough what is clickable and what isn't, so it's not like it prevents you from playing the game.  It's just a style I don't particularly care for in a game.  (Starbound had the same issue, though it featured low-rez pixel art.)\n\nThe trailer showed all kinds of nifty items, such as lasers, flying ships, etc.  But after seven hours of play, I had nothing to show for my time save the same standard progression of items that you find in these games.  I had yet to craft anything that was cool and exciting;  All I saw in my future was an ever-progressing grind.  Replacing my copper items with iron, and so on.  I'm sure I'd get flying laser ships eventually but the incentive isn't there for me to try, particularly when you die very far away from your spawn and must back-track quite a long way to recover your items -- Without even a marker to indicate where you died.  A lot of work for too little reward, IMHO.\n\nCrafting is okay, and like that it's implemented via a list.  (Though it's annoying that you cannot mass open or close categories.)\n\nI think this has signs of life (pun!) but for now I would recommend you wait.","September 27, 2014","false","8.8"," 96 of 146 people (66%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","66","96","146","10","32"

It's very easy to reach a point at which the game has nothing new to show you, or where there is more content but you're completely stuck as to how to advance or just plain don't realize there is more.\n-Rare updates.  It was doing very well, but the last update was two months ago, and didn't add much.  Even if it's just the odd new weapon or another bit of the story revealed, I'd love to see more frequent updates.\nThe Verdict: If you like Terraria, this is like Terraria but in my opinion better fleshed out.  There's less content than in other games, but what there is has been polished to a mirror shine, with the promise of more on the horizon (even if that horizon is sometimes frustratingly far away).

It's for times like this that we need a "Mixed" button.  I don't hate this game, nor do I love it.  I'll just judge it as whether or not I'd recommend it.  At this point in time, the answer is no, but it mainly comes down to your personal choice and willingness to wait for more content.*  I looked online to find out whether I should buy Signs of Life or Starbound.  Everywhere I looked, Signs of Life won in a landslide, saying it was more "Signs of Life = Something an adult made.  Starbound = a 2 year olds plaything."   What I actually saw in playing Signs of Life was more opposite than not, not that I'll go *that* far and say 2-year-olds created this.  However, a giant mech chicken?  That sounds like something out of old school DragonFable.  Also, the conrols are counter-intuitive and it needs controller support (or better mapping).  I think I was expecting more from this game.  Yes, it's in early access.  I'm happy to support a developer.  But to find out we can't even go off planet in this game?  It's a deal-breaker for me, at least at this point in time.  So I guess it boils down to: do you want a game where you can mine and build and explore buildings left by previous inhabitants but not talk to them?  Great!  Do you want to support a (judging by other reviews) helpful and attentive dev team?  Awesome!  But that's about all you can do.  Personally, I don't think I'll play this game until it gets something I can sink my teeth into.  I'm excited to find out what the devs will do with this game, though.

Yet, while only being single player, it does a lot more than other titles trying to cash in on this theme.\nThis game does a fine job standing on its own in this theme, though like everything in beta, it has its own share of problems\n\nWhile the game does a lot right, I feel like the game doesn't know what its doing with itself, as if its trying to be a comedy, and yet take itself seriously.  I can't help but feel like the developers were trying to achieve that quirky balance borderlands 2 does so very well.  The game unfortunately the game never captures this balance, and instead falls flat on its face with its story.\nIt however does do an outstanding job with the crafting system, and the many gadgets you can make with it.\n\nThe game has you start off landing on an unknown planet with minimal survival equipment, the clothes on your back, and an AI partner with terrible dialog.  You then set off to explore the planet, looking for equipment, useful materials and as the name of the game suggests, signs of life.\nThe top of the world looks like Willy Wonka exploded, painting everything in bright colors: its cheery, safe, and it counteracts the rest of the game in terms of atmosphere.\nDig down, or explore one of the abandoned stations at night, and the atmosphere does a complete 180 degree turn.  The atmosphere is dark, dank, empty, and devoid of all human life.  As you explore deeper, the atmosphere of the game gets even more creepy, with alien tentacles raining acid on you, floating sacks of puss that explode, and large vicious looking aliens with scythes for legs.  The further you go down, the more dangerous it feels, the atmosphere does a very good job of this.\n\nUnfortunately the storyline can't seem to latch onto what the atmosphere does, and write a compelling narrative to motivate the player into finding out what happened on this planet.\nInstead the storyline tries to play it silly, inside of a dark, unlit station, with human corpses strung about.\n\nYou find E-readers in these stations, with some of the articales writen in them hint at where items of interest to you can be found.  However, you will mostly be reading about some doctor acting erratically (the game tells you he is afflicted with "Space Madness") and as a result, everyone around him, including his CO's, are implenting EXTREME measures to keep the space madness doctor from rifing through their property.\n\n(minor spoiler here) One such example was the leader of the installation, She finds good doctor madness combing through her pantie drawer.  Instead of sticking the guy behind bars until they can send him into the place with padded walls, she demotes his access, then processes to bury the device that promotes keycard access, several hundred meters underground, just for the hell of it.\n(end of spoiler)\n\nYour only form of story content besides the e-readers, is your partner AI, AGIS.\nAGIS is suppose to be  malfunctioning, and yet, he says nothing you'd think an AI would actually say. He constantly makes useless comments that help in no way, and when he does actually say something somewhat useful, you've already tuned him out.  He's basically a watered down, forgettable version of claptrap attached to your wrist.  Hes annoying, but you can forget about him, so that makes him slightly better than claptrap?\n\nWhere the game actually shines is the use of the M.E.G. your wrist mounted multi tool.  This thing is sweet, and actually puts all the other multitools you see in other games of this theme to shame.  It functions as your map, your scanner used for updating your map, an autolooter, and of course, placing and breaking objects and blocks.  All of these functions can be upgraded to improve them even further, everything besides AGIS that is...  Honestly, all this thing needs is a blade attachment and it'd put the omni-tool in Mass Effect to shame.\n\nThe crafting is very strong here, making use of resources constantly.  In Terraria, theres a point where you stop gathering copper, because you have no more use for copper, unless you maded to make a copper castle, using copper blocks.  Here, copper and most everything else constantly has a use, so your always gathering for everything.\n\nGuns felt kind of lack luster, the game makes you jump through hoops to get your first real gun besides the 9mm pistol, and most later on enemies are resistant to your bullets.  The Laser gun was my go to weapon, as it could kill anything, although waiting on your energy to recharge was a ♥♥♥♥♥, but you never truly ran dry, where as bullets actually use materials.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the game, even though when I played it, there was no final boss fight, or at least I couldn't find one.  My only worry is that they keep rolling with the shallow storyline, and make the final events of the game lackluster, making you feel like you wasted your time, as a bad ending has that effect.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPros:\n- Strong crafting system.\n- Lots of interesting materials to scavange.\n- The M.E.G. Tool does an outstanding job for its intended use, as a multi-tool.\n- Enemies look interesting, and later ones look imposing.\n- Loads of weapons to choose from.\n- Certain areas of the game deliver an erie atmosphere, supporting the actual title of the game.\n- Graphics, while looking the part of a flash game, actually do a pretty good job.\n- The inventory system is reminiscent of the old Ultima games, which I love.  The autosort works very well.\n- Retrieveable arrows and bolts.\n\nCons:\n- No Multiplayer\n- Weak storyline (its a bigger deal, brought by the fact of the first con, no multiplayer.)\n- Gunplay doesn't feel very rewarding, since you need to scavange for both the materials to make the gun itself, and its    ammo.  You are more likely to use ranged weapons with retrievable ammo such as bows and crossbows, or weapons that use your energy.\n- AGIS has to be some sort of spawn from claptrap\n- Lack of boss fights (though it is still in beta)\n- Lack of tutorial on how your M.E.G. is upgraded.\n\nFinal verdict:  Would recommend, but only to those who can't get enough sandbox, blockfest, diamond pickaxe goodness.\nIf you are tired of these games being perpetually in beta such as *cough* Starbound *cough*, then stay away until 1.0.","November 2, 2014","true","16.3"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","5"

You start off in a pod filled with only the basics(such as a gun and a single bullet, if being the only one on a planet gets too boring) and a sassy artificial intelligence that doesn't quite understand the meaning of empathy. From there, you must run, punch, and scream your way to a better home.\n\nThe graphics and soundtrack are both very pleasing, the crafting system is delightful once you build yourself a nice workshop, and the general building mechanics are pretty well executed. The combat, however, lacks in a way that most sidescrollers do: It's not very dynamic. Despite this, the enemies, or at least the ones that are a threat, are well designed. You can power through them, but their gimmicks enable you to employ some neat tactics to make it a bit more fun.\n\nSigns of Life also does not hold your hand. There's no real tutorial and you're mostly left to figure out everything yourself. Most people I've seen get confused with(what I'd call) the story progression of the game, though there are enough hints left about it to where you can eventually figure it out, and be mad at yourself for not doing so sooner.\n\nThe developer is fantastic. They're very engaged with the community, and get right on any issues you may be having. It's worth noting that I had no issues at all until I opted into the beta, and the issues I had there were patched an hour after I contacted them.

I respawned in a base which I am guessing is a Pioneer station. Kept trying to pick up the mining pickaxe and mining clothes. Still couldn't. Fustrated I Made a new character.\n\nExperience 2 : After creating a new character, I repeated the same process EXCEPT, I found the Pioneer station. Took me forever to mine under it to get inside it. Still couldn't pick things up. I looked in the chests, but too conflicted to bother taking anything. I returned outside and found the alien fighting with the bore. I somehow got caught in the middle and joined war between the two breeds. Sheeps were dying left and right as the bores and alien fought. I died soon after. I deleted the character and tried again.\n\nExperience 3 : Repeated the process up to the Pioneer station. I FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO PICK THINGS UP. It didn't tell me until then. (I will let you guys go through this as well.) Excited, I decided to cut trees and mine ores. Died by running into a mantis alien.\n\nExperience 4 : I tried to go and find the Pioneer station along the way I made some things finally, but I ran into some other base that seem to have no entry point. At least none that I could find. While trying to find one, BY MY LUCK I FOUND A GIANT ROBOT CHICKEN OUT FOR BLOOD.

I tried starting a fire and throwing the meat onto it because there didn't seem to be a way to interact with the fire to cook the meat.\n\n4) When you start cutting the trees with the laser, there was no indication that anything was happening. Even if it is something like making the tree shudder a bit like in Don't Starve or having little bits come off like Terraria, there needs to be some sort of visual feedback that something is happening.\n\n5) I also wasn't impressed that I needed to make a wooden sword and club to start out with. For a fantasy game, those are the ideal sorts of weapons but for a sci-fi game they don't seem to fit. I know that it's hard to come up with a simple low level weapon that sticks with the sci-fi theme but perhaps if you already had something like a light saber but needed you to generate energy to make the battery work? This way you stick with the theme but still create a need for exploration and gathering so you can't insta-stomp the local flora/fauna.\n\n6) Not being able to pick up things unless you use the grab laser is also annoying.\n\n7) The pacing of the game is too slow. It doesn't feel like you are achieving anything or getting anywhere, especially at the start of the game when you are new.\n\n8) The inventory system also needs work. We should be allowed to put whatever we want in the hotbar, not have it restricted to what you think is ideal and having to scroll through things.\n\nThat's about it. I just don't feel this game is fun enough to recommend to anyone.\n\nGood luck in the future.","June 29, 2015","false","5.6"," 43 of 66 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","43","66","2","10"

Simpler in that construction of a base doesn't take 5 days, and that hordes of enemies are, while a possibility, not likely to simply turn into a never-ending swarm that'll override any defensive measures in a couple minutes.\n\nThe complexity comes from the mid and late-game (for now) crafting, where you need to use literally every crafting station/system you have on hand to build things like the rocket launcher or the Jewel Bow. Even some of the earlier recipes can take 4 or 5 differing components to make, and at least 2 crafting stations to make the parts in the first place.\n\nHonestly, I don't find it a problem. I find it a nice change of pace from the more "grind it til you have it" tendency of more than a few other games (World of Warcraft, for example.).\n\nMy only real issues stem from just how much digging you're apt to do just to get enough resources to build that fancy Material Printer or that last box of rockets.\n\nI would rate this game a 9/10 as it is, if only because the game is incomplete.","January 28, 2015","true","46.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

They were both great in their own ways. I've since tried other early access games and have had many disappointments.\n\nFortunately, Signs Of Life did not disappoint. There is a lot of exploring to do, many things to do in this game and a lot of things to make. The game is stable and the gameplay is very smooth and polished.\n\nDevelopment is a little slow, but it is steady. As of this review, I think we've been waiting on the next 'big update' for maybe over a year now. However, the devs are active. They chat on the forum. Occasionally they've put out an update which adds something interesting. I should probably add that the dev team only has a few people. So, progress is probably good and steady for a team of this size.\n\nOverall, the $9 price tag is well worth it.

I've already spent enough time into the game to notice that the threats are almost non-existent (aside from the bosses which currently can be exploited). Armor currently just feels optional. Getting ores takes forever currently, but again, the dev says it'll be improved next update. Mining with a pickaxe is a bit clunky cuz it requires so much space, so you're likely to use the MEG tool which can also be upgraded to be superior in digging speeds anyways.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting new game with new ideas and everything, but it being in early access, it's just not quite there yet with the finished games which compete with this game.\n\nEDIT: I'm giving this review a thumbs up based on the dev's replies here and in Steam Discussions. The dev communicates with us all the time and is very appreciative of suggestions and feedback unlike most other game devs out there.

Everything is very wonky and steadily becomes a chore. Even picking up items is a punishment of manual labor, down to the last individual apple and rock. The game has much untapped potential, and will surely rise to achieve, but sadly in its current state you're likely to find something similar on a CD tacked to the back of a gaming magazine sleeve titled "101 Demo games" circa 1998.\n\nThis in mind, I do not regret having purchased it, and look forward to the future for this title. I hope it lives up to that aforementioned potential.\n\n\n\n~Developer Requested Feedback Here~\nWell, it's possible some of my issues could simply be a matter of opinion. For me, the wonky side of things would be combat, movement, even the animation can be at times, but the animation is literally part of the charming charisma this game has, and really shouldn't change.\nSpecifically, swinging 30 times to hit a cornered chicken twice becomes a chore. It's almost easier to kill one that's running from you.\nMovement can be a bit annoying but it's difficult to explain this one. This is where I feel it's mostly opinion. Something about movement feels sluggish and lacks that seemless, fast action, quick response range of motion other similar titles have. I typically find myself avoiding situations and instead end up playing more casually.\n\nChore. I know this is something some people find unqiue about this title, but I myself find it quite frustrating picking up every single apple, rock, and twig, one by one, by one, by one... slowly... spending 5 minutes to claim the tree I just chopped down branch by sometimes-hard-to-spot branch. I know auto pickup is old and done and cliche now, but some systems are still in use today because they work. Quite well. Some may feel this lends a touch of charm to the game, and I understand that. For others, it just won't do. I'm the latter. It's cute at first... gets old VERY fast.\nThe inventory, while unique and interesting, would make an OCD person set their computer on fire. Even after using the sort button. Personally, I like the inventory, it's fun and new and innovative, but I feel like it's tiny and constricted, sometimes complicated, and perhaps a little overwhelming. Holding a hammer, or placing it on the bench, or having to HAVE a hammer even (which is why most titles would include this type of item as part of the workbench in the art...) all of this type of stuff kind of over complicates an already complicated crafting system, which brings me to the crafting menu, or menus...\n\nThe crafting menu is extremely overwhelming. So many tabs, so many lists, so many stuffs.... but in your defense, I can see the careful thought taken into the design for ease of use. Being able to craft the needed materials for a larger recipe by clicking them (such as wood planks, etc)... and honestly there is so much stuff in games like this, crafting is always a tricky system. Other titles even struggle with this as well. It just takes a lot of patience to get used to it. For this game though, I feel like there's no real pipeline in crafting. Right off the escape pod you have like 2 or 3 sets of craftable armor... and they aren't the same. One is clearly the better, and so.... why make the other ones?\n\nMy final rant would be the interface layout and usage. it's unqiue for sure, but the very nature of a quickbar is to let the user set it up how they like it, and not make it a Walmart of your inventory. It's great that I can scroll hotbar 1 to get between my iron pickaxe and my wrist laser mining thingy... but add a copper pickaxe that you found and things become... well... a chore.\nSame thing goes for hotbar 5. Dirt n ♥♥♥♥. Maybe I don't want dirt on 5? Maybe I don't want sand between my dirt and stone? Sometimes flipping through hotbar slot 5 to get to the right block is like walking through clothes, toys, automotive, electronics, lawn and garden, produce, candy, and finally snack foods to get to the dairy section for that milk you wanted in the first place. Get me? I didn't find a way to change it to, well, any other title setup where I can put my own stuff in the slots. If there exists one, great! If not, there probably should.\n\nAll this in mind, you got a thumbs up because this isn't a bad game. It's clearly still being developed and it could get really good as time goes by. It's also great to see a developer actively taking feedback.\nThanks for your interest in my thoughts :)","December 5, 2015","true","9.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","22"

I have been playing starbound for a couple of weeks but hit a wall due to the last big wip and update.\n\nThis game had me hooked within the first 5 minutes.

There are quirky things like small harmless animals spawning in my house, that's really it.\n\nHighlights:\n\n· Visually more realistic than Starbound which can feel a little too cutesy at times.\n\n· Variety of armor and clothing combinations for a distinct look\n\n· The structural building blocks have a great deal of variety and interlock systematically like Legos.\n\n· The crafting system is fun and compels you to explore the planet so you can craft more complex items.\n\n· The story is revealed organically as you discover clues.  More to the planet than meets the eye.","February 2, 2014","true","86.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've spent many a days playing Terraria and Starbound, and I found myself at home when playing Signs of Life.  Personally, I like it more than Starbound, and feel the crafting system, so far, to be VERY deep!  I'm looking forward to what this game will eventually become, but even as it stands right now, I'm having a BLAST playing it!  I've definitely gotten my $10 worth of entertainment out of it, plus a whole lot more!","February 7, 2014","true","11.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Well i stumbled again on this game and this time i looked some videos from youtube and i got interested and bought the game.\n\nI was pretty surprised that this game was this good and considering its still early access. I did play terraria and starbound that are closest games that you can compare to this. But for some reason this feels a bit better somehow. Signs of life tryes to do things a bit its own way and not copying straight from similiar games and seems its a good thing because it feels a bit better.\n\nI like that this game is more scifi oriented and not much of fantasy at all and i hope it stays that way.\n\nCrafting system is very easy to use and it got categories and a search button that i have to use a lot. Lots of items need other crafted items so thats where search comes handy. Could be easier if there was possibility like double click on the required items on the crafting recipe so you could jump straight to making those and skip the search button that way.\n\nOne thing more thing i like about the crafting is that when you find new resources lets say a new ore you learn recipes when you pick it up. Nice way to avoid confusion with massive recipe list at the start.\n\nIt took me around 20 hours maybe to go trough about everything the game has to offer at this point. There are tough some stuff i still could get and will because it's hard not to play this game. There is just something that pulls into this game.\n\nBut its not perfect game tough, it got bugs. I've stumbled on two so far, one was game crashing upon death. I've not died in a long time now so not sure if that issue is still in game.\nSecond i found was that splitting items from a stack makes the whole stack gone all together. Other than that it worked pretty well.\n\nCan't think of much more negative to say other than its not finished and need more content in the game.\nIf you like terraria and starbound i think this should be one to keep an eye on.\n","January 11, 2015","true","94.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've been burned out by other EAs where the devs seem to just drop out, even if it had such a good foundation, and this has happened frequently in 2D side-scroller crafting/adventure games. The devs (I don't know how many there are, if there's multiple) seem to frequently update, are involved in the community, and don't come off as defensive rather open to anything. Even negative reviewers have commented positively on the Devs.\n\nNow, onto the game in a simple pros/cons list with overall review:\n\nPros:\n\n-Simple, yet lovely graphics. This is a smooth looking game for EA, nothing exceptional, but its extremely easy on the eyes.\n-AI isn't aggressive at appropriate times. I don't feel like I'm constantly under danger, which I appreciate when I'm trying to build/explore.\n-The technology in the game, although I'm barely in, seems great. As you come in a landing pod, you can guide it to land, and (as per story) the battery begins to die out, I landed on top of an animal splatting it. I actually laughed out loud when it happened, I'm not the type to laugh, rather smile at these situations, and I've come across a few more like it.\n-I think the Devs listening to feedback is obvious, in other reviews they talk about crafting issues, and as I've just begun to play this game, every ingredient you get opens a recipe, and it seems rather clear cut. While there is some struggle, (pickaxe, for example, I though I'd know how to make it from copper ore, but it took making boards to open the recipe), its not really a pain at all. Its an effort, as I feel there should be with some games. They've also included what seems to be a basic tutorial, again compared to other reviewers, there may've not been one before, and this is representative of the Devs involvement.\n-Ton of potential, for early access, its incredibly well-done, and considering they just added multiplayer, I think there's a ton of room for this game, and as the devs have proven themselves with this, I look forward to other games from them in the future. The pricing is just right for this.\n\nCons:\nI'm only early on, I haven't really seen as many, so this is a nitpick attempt.\n\n-You start off with a multitool that can mine blocks and cut down trees. This isn't bad at all, I like it, but there's instances where a pickaxe or an axe may be necessary in the future, and that kinda gets lost on me. I've come across what seems to be deposits that I can only mine with a pickaxe (I haven't even gone really underground yet), but I don't know what the significant difference is. Again, this is a nitpick attempt, and nothing really critical of the game. As I advance in the game, I may add more cons here, of which I'll note it was edited in, but otherwise.. Not much. Its a really solid EA.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis is what I had wanted from my other sidescrolling sci-fi EAs, except not only is it being properly and consistently executed, its being done so by an engaged Dev who seems to care for community feedback and does it at a extremely decent price. For thsoe who've been burned out by EAs that may've fit this bill, I can only try to assure you in that, I feel this is the one sure time we won't get burned. I'm crossing my fingers, but the devs are making a reputation for themselves and have passion behind this game that is all ready a solid foundation.","July 23, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","4"

This really expands on early access' letting you watch the game evolve, you help it evolve, though that is contolled so the game does not turn into a mess of features.\n\nLastly, I'd like to comment on the lore, as you cannot just have the whole story written up when a game releases on early access, they leave small hints telling you what happened, letting you piece the story together yourself and leaving intreguing cliffhangers to expand upon, allowing you to get together with the rest of the community to converse about it and really boost the feel of this game, and the community's interaction.\n\nIt does have it's bugs, but they're very minor, and there is just a bit of missing content; those holes are being filled pretty rapidly, however!\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game a 9/10 for now, of course this game could take a turn for the worse at any time, like any early access game.","June 2, 2014","true","15.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

As well my personal opinion and first impression, as I only write selective reviews on refreshing game experiences. So the only real issue that I have encountered is the fact that the world is a small place after all and loops around back towards the players starting position, which can be completed around ten minutes or less. That aside it is large enough in terms of depth, the surface world as well an ecological underground world where time has no meaning. I have also been informed  by the developer that "world-generator" is not limited to the previously mentioned constraint, and that is temporarily due to creating quality content to fill the void.\n\nThat fact aside there is plenty of content to keep the player occupied for many hours. As a game about exploration, this allows the player a rewarding experience. I dislike the linear trends of most games, feeding the player non-vital information through tutorials leaving nothing else to discovery. Games only need a few mechanics to be great, a storyline is just the icing on the cake. The game starts abrutly as your escape pod crashes downward into the atmosphere of an unkown planet with a limited fuel supply, you land safely upon flattened terrian with nothing remote of a civilization around as you gaze through the glass upon your new surroundings, you step fourth...\n\nAGIS, your "friendly" artificially "intelligent" friend! This is your A.I. companion, and although it's moral programming is limited, AGIS will allow you to learn crafting reciepes,and reverse engineer as you discover new resources to survive. You will find from time to time, that AGIS is able to lighten your mood during convexing times upon the desolate planet, that or you have gone past the breaking point of your sanity. :D\n\nAGIS is part of your MEG Tool, that's the name of the device attached to your wrist. This multifunctional tool will allow you the player, topographical mapping functions, illumination, traction beam, and laser extraction, powered by a battery capacitor and lens. All of which are upgradable through precious gemstones, and salvage discovered on the planet.(Sapphire, Topaz, Amethyst, Ruby,etc.) in varied conditions affect functionality of your MEG. If you so desire, forgo all of the techology as decreed by the gods! And manually work the planet with your barehands (pick axe, gardening hoe, regular axe, shears, hammer, and seeds).\n\n\nIf your preferred genre of gaming and in general is sci-fi, for $10.99 you won't have any regrets, especially for a game that's currently in the early stages of it's development. Do not try to compare this gem to what's available on the market. If there is an aspect of the game you wish to have included, removed , or improved upon, offer a suggestion on the forums for the game, I'm sure the developers would appreciate it. I whole-heartedly recommend "Signs Of Life" if you are looking for a 2D side scroller with simple build and exploration mechanics. On a personal note this game satsifies my missing nostalgia for the 90's (SNES,SEGA,ETC.) .\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please help further the development of this game by rating this review, +1","November 20, 2015","true","45.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","1"

I put quite a few hours into it and it was enjoyable. I like the UI how you open up the bags and you see all your items laid out inside. Although this can get very cluttered. I started playing a week before they implemented the auto organize feature, it does help alot but items overlaping eachother doesnt look that good. Also some item icons are huge while others are so tiny you can barly see what they are. Hopefully this will be addressed. I also wish they would make it so you can dig deeper. Even though the total depth is pretty deep. It does feel like it doesnt take all that long to get to the bottom.\n\nOverall: I cant wait to try this game again when it comes along more in development.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutridMeat/recommended/263200/","PutridMeat","PutridMeat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutridMeat/","215 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSigns of Potential?\nThe short of it:\n\nThe game has a unique feel, primarily thanks to the quasi-realistic physics of your character as well as the sense of humor.\nThe progression is going to feel very familiar if you've played any similar sorts of games.\nThe natural environments are lackluster when compared to the technological buildings.\nCombat shows promise, but I feel that losing a fight is still mostly a question of being outnumbered or not having good enough gear rather than skill.\nYou will need patience, and a lot of it.  Updates come somewhat slowly.\nThe long of it:\n\nI like this game, but I somewhat begrudgingly recommend it in this Early Access phase.  I love the humor present in some of the logs you come across and definitely get a chuckle out of the AI that acts like it's totally high.  The buildings that you find and explore are filled with interesting little details.\n\nUnfortunately, the core of the gameplay - mining and crafting - doesn't bring much new to the table for the most part.  Mining is made easier due to your fancy gadgets showing you the best ore caches, but it otherwise is very predictable.  You still mine for the typical elements, and still craft mostly the same old stuff.  The gear progression is a little odd to me as well, with iron gear being less effective than bronze, which didn't make a whole load of sense to me.  You can create "sets" of gear that will give you a bonus, however I've only so far run across one set as such - though this will no doubt continue to expand.  You eventually progress to being able to craft modern and futuristic style equipment, but these seem only currently valuable to use against a small handful of enemies.  For the better part, I was able to completely able to dominate this alien world using medieval-tier gear.\n\nThe buildings you find are quite interesting, although I crave more interactivity.  I'd love to be able to repair/access computer systems for example, that allow me to control things such as lighting, food dispensers, automated defenses, etc, etc.  You can find these buildings far too quickly and easily, though, and they are full of stuff that will obviate you needing to craft several different items.  They also make homebuilding fairly obsolete, as they are already a far superior shelter than what you can construct for yourself in the first few hours of the game.  Shelter is also something more of a convenience in this game, as night isn't particularly much more dangerous than day.  There is one species that is nocturnal and that can damage you, but you literally have to trip right over them for that to happen.\n\nThe natural environments are unfortunately not terribly interesting.  You are going to be pretty well acquainted with most of the natural wildlife within the first few minutes of the game, as they tend to completely saturate your surroundings to the point of annoyance.  At first I would feel bad about accidentally killing those cute little Springtails, but they are going to wander into the path of your pick so many times that you will cease to care.  With only a couple of exceptions, the surface critters are so abundant that they pollute the tunnel systems below the surface.\n\nThe underground areas are pretty stark and uninteresting.  The tunnels mostly feel very cramped and claustrophobic, and you don't run into too much interesting terrain until you get very deep and start to run into the ant-agonists (ha ha!) in the bowels of the underworld.  There are a few more new species to discover down there, and they do pose a more significant threat than the surface creatures, though not so much so that I ever really felt scared.  There are also currently no liquid or semi-solid physics you need to worry about.  No scenic waterfalls, or glowing pools of lava, or the danger of burying yourself in sand.  Because of all this, doing the necessary task of mining for crafting ingredients feels far more boring than it has to.\n\nCrafting is a mixed bag.  Literally.  Your bag is going to be mixed full of dozens of different ingredients.  You can craft several different collector satchels that will automatically sort different ingredients as you collect them, which makes it much more managable.  You can also craft most things straight off hand, no crafting station required.  On the one hand, it's more convenient because you can craft most things straight out of your inventory.  On the other, this makes the mechanic of having to return to "home base" nearly irrelevent for most things, and also devalues the need for storage objects - of which you are going to find plenty of anyway.  Some of the recipes don't make very much sense to me as well.  Tin armor being more effective than iron, and the idea of crafting crossbows out of bronze when this would in reality make it much heavier and no more effective as a weapon than plain ol' wood.  You do get to upgrade your fancy MEG tools though, and that's interesting, and you'll later be able to craft increasingly more impressive technological tools and weapons.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\n\nProgress is going slow, but I hope it continues.  Ideally I'd like to have larger and more interesting worlds to explore.  Villages, space pirates, aliens both friendly and hostile, etc.  I'd love to see emergent gameplay happen when various forces in the world collide, such as enemy colonies attacking each other, giving the player the option to participate in their conflict or perhaps just loot the corpses of the losers.  I'd like to see shelters become more important, as well as the defense of shelters.  It would be very cool to be able to build robots and autoturrets to help fend off hostile invaders.  Eventually what I'd hope to see is the ability to progress to the point of being able to build your own shuttle and travel to new, randomly generated worlds.  Perhaps building up entire colonies on multiple worlds and carving out your own little empire.\n\nFor now, it's an interesting entry into a genre that needs some fresh approaches.  I will continue to monitor this game for more signs of life.","February 8, 2015","true","8.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I have all 3 and I think that SoL will be my favorite of them. I havent devoted enough time into SoL to say that with certainity yet, but the inital impressioins were very differnt from those I got with Terraria and SB.\n\nThis game is more intentional it feels. Its slowed down a bit. Everything looks a bit different than what we are used to . Everything seems to have a bit more "weight" to it. I didn't drop in the world and craft full sets of stuff, construct a house, and run across the map laying waste to everything i saw within 1-2 hours.\n\nThe best way to compare it really is to say... Imagine another football game came out. Something other than Madden. We would all naturally campre said game to madden. But when we played it we  would all likely say "its a football game, but its not madden". Its a 2D sandbox resource mining survival game... but its not SB or Terraria.\n\nAlso, Its 9.99. Go buy it. Even if the DEVS packed up shop today and we never saw another update. There is alread 10 bucks worth of content.\n\nShould you buy it? Did you like Terraria? Did you like Starbound? Then yes.... buy this 2. Even if you bought all 3 you've still spent less than any big studio release =)","October 30, 2014","true","6.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I can recommend it for several reasons, and those will be listed.\nIt has a wide array of content, even if it is early access. I haven't played long, but I've already seen four fully (And beautifully) textured armor sets, as well as various different weapons and tools. There's a decent array of creatures, and more will hopefully be added. There is a good elemnt of exploration, even if the world is limited. Furthermore, the world is well designed and constructed. (There's a difference there)\nIt has a... servicable survival element. If you die, you lose all your items and there are a multitude of ways to die. The qualms I have with it is how easy it is to gather food and kill monsters. The fighting is also simple, which is perfectly fine, and in this case, good.\nThe game's controls are... Fine. You can rebind keys and all that, and the game is easy enough to figure out after awhile. However, there are a few minor problems with it. E.G. If you rebind a key, it goes back to default when you leave the game.\nThe game has good textures and a decent aesthetic. However, if there was one qualm I had with it, it was the voxel-based terrain. Some games do well with it, but those games (Like minecraft) usually don't utilize good textures, they're trying to instill nostalgia. In my eyes, voxels and lifelike graphics don't match. Still, it's still only a minor qualm, and many people enjoy the voxels. I might just be the black sheep.\nOverall, I'd recommend this game for the above reasons. It has a great concept, it has great playability, it runs fine, and a fine aesthetic. Buy Signs of Life, it's well worth the price.","February 8, 2014","true","23.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can make all the things, dig all the tiles (minus the "bottom" of the starting planet. Not sure if that will change later), fight all the creatures and feel cool doing it. My favorite thing has to be the laser digger; you can upgrade it to the point where you literally just pass over tiles and they are already dug. This is awesome.\n\nThe data module that talks to you (Agis its called?) its rather amusing, talking to you like you would someone over the internet rather than an in-person conversation. I laughed outloud a few times at its responses.\n\nIts still got a ways to go but I feel like this game could be a real gem with the kind of developers it has.

Things appear complicated at first glance, but we quickly found it to be intuitive and well-laid out. The game sets the bar for how hot-bars should be done. Music is good, graphics are fine enough. What really sets this apart from others like it in the genre, is tech depth. I mean after 4 hours we felt that we barely scratched the surface here.

This game is very much like Starbound minus interplanetory exploration.\n\nA wrist tool that acts like Starbound's matter manipulator was probably meant to be while looking cooler at the same time. Physics for arms/legs/tools meaning if you're in a mine tunnel, you'll probably want to stab that alien with your sword instead of swinging it since the ceiling's kinda low!\n\nSigns of Life is, compared to starbound, a well-polished game with more content. For example, one of the main issues that I find in Starbound is that the procedural creature generation holds back the crafting system. In SoL, killing a sheep gives you wool and red meat, killing a chicken gives you feathers and poultry. In SB, you're getting pixels or alien meat.\n\nThe bases are also well made, make sense, and tell a tiny story. Again, it lacks procedural generation for the bases and just about everything, but I never thought that feature was all it's cracked up to be.\n\nThe only cons I have is that mining is an extremely time consuming endeavor, and that the horizontal size of the map is very tiny.\n\nOverall, I feel the game has high potential. I would like to see a much larger surface, more surface features such as little buildings, and torches you can hold while using the wrist laser for mining.","February 2, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But if you like sci fi side scrollers this is for you.\nI reccomend this game for all and i enjoy to this day and good luck with future development and updates developer.","September 14, 2015","true","30.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Leans more towards a realistic feel than the other games in the genre. Has a goofy sense of humor, but doesn't feel like it's overdone. Developer has stated they are focusing more on an enriching story than a free-form building game. Already has some interesting plot elements, but still feels a little shallow right now. Lots of construction options, but a lot of them feel kinda pointless at the current time - feels like a work in progress, which is only a bad thing if the developer doesn't follow through.\n\nOverall at this point in time, a good game for maybe 10-15 hours of playing. I think it's worth the current asking price of $11. Looking forward to some future updates. especially the continuation of the story, and I'll probably come back and check them out.","September 10, 2015","true","19.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The devs are friendly and most of the time respond to problems you have with the game. Personally the best part of the game would be how creative the devs are for instance one of the bosses in the game is a giant robot chicken and I call him Bob even though his name is Buff Wreckion the only problem I have with this game is that it kinda hard to mine with the pickax at first but you soon learn how to do it. The devs update every once in awhile but the updates are always interesting or have something new to do. If you like Sci-Fi survival game I think you would like the game and one more thing the devs have a weird obsession with chickens for some odd reason.","June 5","true","64.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","11"

You're not some blocky dude, or a sprite that looks like it was ripped from Final fantasy, you play as a detailed human being.\n\nYou begin your journey alone, save for your trusty wrist device's AI (Whom may or may not have much sympathy for human life), aboard a pod freshly landed on some alien planet that isn't too different from earth, save for the fact that you can probably walk along it's surface in like, 15 minutes. But you aren't quite so alone, with sheep, tapirs, and other generally peaceful wildlife decorating the planet's surface, while deep underground, you'll find things that you'll need to shake more than just a stick at.\n\nWith plenty of weapons, armors, parts, items, objects, and basically a whole metric sh-tton of other stuff, this game is packed with crafting materails. And you don't just use some logs to make things like a chair. No, you saw them into planks, use cotton and thread to make padding, and craft nails that you require a hammer to use to assamble the entire thing. Crafting isn't just slapping a few pieces together, you craft all of the parts needed to assemble what you need. And there's lots of things to be made. Need guns? SMGs, handguns, shotguns, rifles and more are just a mining trip away. Want to hit things? Swords, clubs, bats, and even weapons made from pieces of your foes can be made to give your target a good beating or cut them down to size. Want to protect your delicate babyflesh? Armors can be made out of anything, from wood and twine, to bone, to iron, to silver, to some of the rarest minerals you can find.\n\nThe game is still in alpha when this review is/was made, but it's still a fantastic game so far, with multiplayer now built in and more amazing things on the way. Keep it up, developers, this one may just set a trend for a whole new generation of sandbox games.","July 29, 2015","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After recently being disappointed with Darkout, I decided to give this one a shot.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was your AI companion and the giver of what amounts to the game's tutorial (unfinished as it is).  Namely, I noticed that I actually grunt-chuckled a bit at one or two of his lines, which is something I'm not used to experiencing...  I mean, sure, he's no comedic god, but how often is it where you honestly make some audible expulsion of breath when playing something by yourself?\n\n...the second thing I noticed was just how helpless and left to your own devices you are in the beginning.  Not to say the game is particularly difficult, it really isn't...  But the learning curve for figuring out what you're supposed to do and how you're supposed to do it is quite a tricky slope.  It does somewhat help that AGIS is as snarky as he is, so those first flailing hours of trying to work out how to do and craft things really makes you feel like the self-destructive primitive fleshbag AGIS thinks you are.  Still, it really helps to be very patient with this game in the beginning...  It doesn't so much hold your hand as thrust it into a fire and then smack you for getting yourself burned.\n\nPerservere through the liftoff phase, and you'll find an actually quite pretty, engaging environment with lovely lighting effects, a great deal of playstyle customization, and an atmosphere that manages to be irreverently tongue-in-cheek and yet still bizarrely creepy and tense at times.\n\nThe game is still quite unfinished however, the "tech tree" and progression of the game is hamhanded at its absolute best, and a confusing maze that turns in on itself at all other times.  It's frequently very difficult to find out "where do I go next?" or, worse, "what do I *DO*?".  As well, the game currently just sort of peters off as there's no real indication that you've accessed most or all the recipes and enemies it has to offer at this point.  But it will certainly give you plenty of hours of exploration and running like a coward before that time comes.\n\n\nAll in all, I would very much recommend this title.  It's different enough from Terraria to stand alone as its own game, similar enough to not be completely alien, and in my opinion actually does a few of the gameplay mechanics better than the genre's poster child.","September 22, 2014","true","35.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","5"

There are alot of things  this particular game has going for it, dynamics of exploration, different sequences of products you can develop, and the assumption that you can develop many different ways to suit our personality throughout it. I know this game is still being developed but i would have thought it would be essential to looking at guides or a mode where you can play the game in a guide to actually understand the fundamentals of what youre actaully doing. For instance, i play for 20 mins looking my character...not really knowing what to do or what was available until i watched some youtube videos. I think developing an actual guide to what this machine does and what it will do for you, levels of exploration in deep underground mining, levels of hazards when pursuing deeper exploration etc. Plus it seems once you go underground, the surface seems to not provide much other than trees...and maybe it should be balanced a little bit. Ill definitely continue playing the game to get better at it but maybe more bases and or guides to upgrading can help.

That was completely my mistake. That actually changes a lot of the issues I personally had, and this is now a YES RECOMMEND game now.\n\nI've saved the original review below for context with the dev comments:\n\n------Previous review--------\nI cannot recommend this game at this time. It's too early to buy.\n\nI think a lot of the problems I had were with the early access so don't take this as a complete no on recommendation, just no for now.  It's a bit clunky and counter intuitive, the controls are not optimal and the toolbelt can be frustrating. I think it's just too early right now, and it's clear there is a lot of work to go on the game. I'm not sure if I have a lot of faith in the controls getting better because they're so bad, but hey anything can happen from now and the time of completion. So take that comment with a grain of salt. On a more positive note there are some really great moments to this game and it shows a large amount of potential.\n\nI will review this again at a later date as the game is more complete and hopefully upgrade it to a recommend. But for right now, I can't recommend it for the state that it's in.\n----------End of old review------------\n\nThank you so much to the Dev for responding and clearing up that issue with the game, turns out it was me. I can tell that this game is going to be good, and the fact that the dev took the time out to help me with my specific issue is beyond awesome.

The title of the game explains exactly what this game injects into the Open World/ Survial/ Building hybrid genre thing that a good few games have going on. A pulse in the almost "Beating a dead horse" game style. A sign of life that is! Puns aside. I don't compare games. Signs of Life lands you on an alien planet, that isn't too alien. It's like Earth in ways, thats why it was chosen. But like Earth it's got it's own life forms and plant life. This of course means some will be harmless and others want your sweet meats! Gravity is still a thing here, but your guy jumps like it may be less, or he might just be robot from the waist down, I don't know IT'S SPACE AGE FUTURE STUFF!\n\nOnto the game itself. There's a story, but it's being worked on of course. The crafting is pretty solid, a component you might need to craft makes sense. One thing about it, is you're gonna need to take steps at times. Take Dynamite sticks for example, you need cotton and wood to make a spool of cotton fabric, then you need the fabric AND more cotton to make cotton cushoining. But that's still only 1 out of 4 items you need to make Dynamite. This isn't really a problem with how much the game provides you with! Sure you think it has too many things around, but you're also on an Alien planet that hasn't been overrun by humanity so supplies abundant! And you're gonna notice you wished you collected more before trying to craft, trust me.\nThis is a good game. I can see it going in a good direction and the scale being wonderous.

Though the game can be frustorating when it comes to finding certain resources, like grey stone to make a campfire, lack of clear objectives and directions, and the very small hit boxes on the creatures (talking about when you try to kick a creature), I really like the game. It has pretty good controls and a really good concept. The theme of a sifi, sandbox, building game really fits it. Despite some difficulties navigating caves and the other frustrations, i can easily see this game grow to multiplayer game that almost loved by all. As the game developes, I bet a lot of the games current tools, like the mini map hologram, will change and upgraded to even better tools (couldn't think of anything  better to say there). At it's currently an alpha game, i give the game a 6 out of 10, because I know others might not be as patience and understanding of its alpha gameplay.

No new mechanics besides reusable arrows.\n- world feels smaller than competition- there are no flying isles/anything to visit in the air/space\n\nIn overall, the game is nice and i can easily recommend it although not if you are looking for something new/fresh (game is great for newcommers of this genre but not so great for someone who played all the competiton games already :) )","April 22, 2014","true","41.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's nothing to tell me where it was, only if I remember it. Die and you might have to start over from scratch if you can't find your corpse or just repeatedly keep dying until you find it.\n\nAnything that drops will be there forever until you scoop it up. It will sometimes cause lag if there's too much junk lying about. Personnaly I would have liked the idea to have some sort of auto-pick as an option instead of having to constantly hold the button or key down.\n\nDon't really like how they've setup the inventory. you drop it into a bag, and then you can shake the bag to get it to sort. Often times it's hard to find stuff, unless you carry lots of bags. The inventory system reminds me of some old games I used to play in the 90s.\n\nFrom the 3 games I've played, there really isn't much to the story. There's really not much to do but dig and dig some more and upgrade your stuff so you can dig some more. I haven't played this game since last summer (2014), just not a whole lot to do. There's no point is base building, since there are already 2 pre-built bases for you to use.\n\nThere are some mobs to kill, but the only serious threat is the spitter mob and it's the mob you usually encounter first. And it's the only one I've ever been killed by, the rest are pushovers.\n\nAnother game I'd give neutral rating if I could.

The Devs are focusing on the right areas for this game's design and will put more of the content in later, as opposed to some other games out there with all the bells and whistles but have artwork that clashes and mushy controls.","January 7","true","25.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

A few things in the trailer don't seem to exist in the current version of the game (e.g. starting in a base, a jump-jet with unlimited fuel, a moon environment... it actually looks like the early parts of the trailer... that's supposed to be backstory, but presenting it in the form of actual gameplay that we the players don't get to experience is a dirty trick. Though there is still a very playable (if incomplete) game here with most of the demonstrated features. I still, though, have other criticisms.\n\nFirst of all, the inventory management system is a serious pain. With no auto-organizing, optional snap-to-grid placements, and the inefficent sort/organize functions for containers... at least being able to carry an unlimited number of nested containers and label them though, helps organize things. But something tells me the final version of the game is going to do away with that.\n\nSecondly, the controls. In addition to the difficulty of successfully picking up smaller/thinner items, there's also the awkward and clumsy movement that gives me lots of frustration trying to make jumps. It's also hard to attack exactly where you want to attack. Singling out the right item you want to use in automatic mode takes a long time if you've got a lot of stuff (and an effective unlimited inventory means you can and should get as many toys on your person as possible) and manual mode is impractical since the hotbar is limited to seven slots plus two quick slots.\n\nThirdly is the fake difficulty. Death is cheap (you drop everything and respawn, and I don't think items ever disappear from the world) but it can be really irritating to get back to where you dropped all your stuff -- especially when you respawn with a partial bar of health, an empty stomach (you only regenerate health when you've had something to eat), and no armor. And many monsters that stand in your way can kill you in precisely two hits in that state. And then there's the frustration of having to re-organize your main inventory -- since whenever you pick something up with the grab laser (the fastest way to pick stuff up) it just gets thrown into a random spot in your bag.\n\nFourth -- the progression. It just doesn't feel right. This is clearly a space-age survival game, but the metals available to use don't even include titanium. Steel is the second-best metal there is, with the tier after that being practical post-game equipment. Also, why the heck is bronze stronger than iron?\n\nFifth, everything that's missing. No music. No way to quickly switch ammo types on a held weapon (you need to select the item in question which you probably have in a nested container in your inventory to change its used ammo).  No mechanism wiring systems (no designing elaborate traps or light switches). No liquids (water/lava/etc).\n\nI haven't even tried to build a base of my own because the game gives you a prefabricated base from the start, and building structures is made a lot more complicated than it has to be as every building material has like 8 different types of blocks, and the clunky interface and crafting required would make it more of a chore than it's worth. I dread having to build anything creatively in this game.\n\nI've clocked 31 hours into this game (as of this writing) and I feel like I've basically seen everything there is to see. That's depressingly low for a survival game. You're better off going for Starbound -- this game has a long way to go before it can even hold a candle to it.\n\nMaybe I'll check back in a few versions and see how it's advanced.","January 14","false","31.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I'm on the edge here, but ultimately not reccomended. Mostly ebcause of low replayability.\n\nPros:\n- nice graphics in comparison with similar titles\n- clearly SF-themed and oriented\n- some interesting objects and animals that do make you feel like its an alien world.\n- has some background story and its interesting to play it the first time\n\nCons:\n- short, you can reach top range gear quickly and not much left to do from that point on\n- while the world is procedurally generated, the amount of biomes and objects is very limited. So playing it the second time feels entierly the same as playing it teh first time.\n- building options are frankly very limited in comparison to let's say terraria or minecraft. For such an SF-themed game, you will be unable to build the nice futuristic style buildings that you can see in the game (these are NPC ones and mostly cannot be removed or rebult).\n- Same main missions, same boss etc in each playthrough.\n- Low overall replayability. This is sadly not what one would expect from minecraft-ish style procedurally generated world games.\n\n\nOverall teh game can be enjoyable in you first playthough, but once you pass it once you ill have no reason to play it again. Sluggish development doesn't help.","May 13, 2015","false","35.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","1"

Also like U6, everything has the same kind of "polish" so it's not always clear what buttons do what on windows (the minus button was not apparent as the 'close window' button, especially with what appeared to be a button [but wasn't] in the very top right corner - where the close button always is in modern UIs).\n\nThe game feels clunky in the UI and in how your character moves and interacts with terrain, and the animations add to the clunky feeling. This is part of a disconnect that I'm experiencing  I am not compelled to explore or figure things out, and when exploring it's not apparent what I can do with the things I mine/gather or how to do things with them. The game is clearly meant to be very open, but it is too lacking in focus at the beginning.\n\nHowever, this game is definitely not the worst in the genre, and I would still put it in the top 25% of this style of game. My recommendation is to wait until later in Early Access when more of the game is finished, and check reviews then. I hope the devs continue working on this game because it does have potential.","December 26, 2015","false","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","12"

I bought it because it seemed like Starbound, both in graphical style and in game content.  But as it usually is on Steam, let the buyer beware.  Because this game is a frustrating mess that anyone would be better to avoid.\n\nAt first glance, the game is pretty and detailed - graphically the game works...however...\n\nAltho the game doesnt state it, this is a digging game.  You dig...and dig...and dig.  The game only progresses when you dig.  It slows the game down to a boring crawl.  Can't make steel until you find anthracite...and that one is VERY far underground.  Funny thing - you can build a laser pistol, but you cant make steel.\n\nCombat just plain ole sucks.   Weaponry, when you can make something useful,  is laughably  underpowered.  Three shots from a pistol to kill a crawling slug,  anything bigger and you better be climbing...if you get caught on a straight run, you're dead.  Not because you dont have something that will do the job - you just can't access it fast enough in the clunky UI before the monsters kill you.\n\nCrafting recipes, while seeming to be balanced, hit an invisible wall because of two things: a required "Project" and the correct materials.  Recipes show up based on what you pick up, meaning that you may get a recipe you can't use, because you're not sure what the resource is from.   Add in that you may have the materials, but can't use a recipe because you can't complete a required Project, and frustration ensues.\n\nAlso, prepare to restart again and again...with nothing.  When you die, and you WILL die because of the poor game mechanics, you drop everything you own.  Everything...right down to your sandals.   Then you get restarted back on the surface sans anything.  Which means totally resupplying yourself and a long run back to where you died to reclaim all your swag before you can try anything else....which is totally unecessary and totally boring.  And of course you can't build anything to help with the restart process because the resources are too rare.  Catch-22.  For me, that was the thing which made the game more trouble than it was worth.\n\nGo spend your ten bucks on something else..stay away from this one.\n\n","January 20","false","32.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","1"

So why not do the same for the lazer thing? More update are no the way filled with hours of fun but as of now the underground is boring and most of the enemies you encounter are easy to kill and some of them even drop really nice stuff and by 'nice' I mean stuff you shouldn't have soo early(like gems or whatever that make your lazer stronger which as mentioned above makes the game even easier) all of the weapons give the game a nice feel,the feeling you get when you upgrade from a bow and arrow to a burst rifle (which is best ftw) is amazing but it falls just short when you realize that most of the weapons do ♥♥♥♥ damage and that means that instead of getting a burst rifle or any other weapon for that matter you might as well just stick with the clobb- the smg with terrible accuracy but with a damn fine fire rate.Why you ask?\nthe burst rifle does 10-15 dmg (depending on the enemy you're facing) and the clobb seems to do the same.What would you preffer, to hit an enemie 3 times for 10-15 dmg or 15 times  for 10 dmg?(rifle round vs 9mm come on now...) Don't get me started on the railgun and the rocket launcher 4 devastating hits for a crab/frog looking creature? come on! Just a few buffs and a few tweeks to make this an awesome game (and more enemies to use it on).\n\nThe devs are really cool guys,which is why I just know they will make the game better with time,and I'm willing to wait .\n(excuse my english and obvious lack of punctuation)\n-Cream","January 1","true","15.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","6"

The mechanics are pretty similar with the occasional tweak here and there. There's a fairly typical mix of old and new weapons, swords vs guns and so on. It's nice that to have an early armor options that require minimal killing of things, although some of the plants can be deadly, since some of the critters that drop leather are kinda dangerous.\n\nAt this point (0.6?) the limited story is a bit of a downside in my opinion. It feels disconnected, kind of like my experience in Starbound up to the initial starbase and thereabouts. Terraria has a stronger, but looser narrative. I think it'd be nice to tie the player in a bit more, since whatever the lore is aside, it feels like the player crash landed and then stumbled into stuff. So, there's not much attachment or concern for the back story people except to hope they had some good stuff you can loot and take not of any warnings about what to avoid... Not sure why I've crashed on a planet in an escape pod.\n\nRegarding the UI:\nI do think that the inventory is not a strong point as is. It's interesting, but stuff visually overlaps, which is a little annoying when you have to click on things and having to manually request auto-arrange/auto-sort can be annoying at times. The auto-bar which groups items into a small set of categories and provides access via scroll to all items of a certain type through a particular bar is, however, a nifty feature, even if it occasionally leads to unintended shooting (you know, like of your foot!) and food consumption... One of the more interesting notions is how the map works. You don't get a map by default or even by passive exploration, you've got to actively build one with the scanner. I'd strongly recommend upgrading it at least one step before engaging in a serious world mapping attempt, though, it'll make it a fair bit easier.\n\nTL;DR\n\nFun to play and fairly engaging, but there's not pressure to build anything more than a minimal shelter before heading off to explore. The AI communications are annoying in a way, but a nice touch even if it's kinda of telling you that you're an idiot the entire time and implying that you wouldn't even survive without it's help. Some things to get used to with the user interface (UI) and movement. Also, try not to fall too far, it's kind of painful.\n\nP.S.\nGiant Robot Chicken is a plus. Surprised that it's peaceful if you don't attack it though.

Hopefully new features will be added soon.  The biggest problem for me are the controls. I found it very awkward to control the character and tis has put me off. Also the way the enemies move seem awkward. I have since brought Starbound which in my opinion is a better game.

There is everything I like - crafting, building, combat, exploring and of course - survival. You start as lone surviver from starship crash on a strange planet and its from you to decide what to do, to stay alive.\nCrafting is amazing, almost everything you can get has some purpose and can be used to make some stuff. There are plenty of strange creatures around so expect some fighting. Building your own shelter is a challenge in the beginning, when you are not even sure how to make campfire...\nWith time, you grow as a master of the place, conquering wildlife around nad making progress with the game storyline (to be honest, this could be better, but patches are comming...) and as a crafter.\nGoing deeper and deeper inside the planet is awesome, and you quickly appreciate the matter of having some source of light with you, as there is always something in the darkness what wants you dead.\nEvery Starbound player will imidietely recognize this game as "almost the same". True - both are very similar. Both I love :)\nI hope devs will keep up the great job and we will be able to travel to distant planets to have more & more of this addictive adventure.","October 21, 2015","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The crafting is fun and interesting,  showing promise at release as long as more content is added,  as crafting is currently a bit limited.   Ingesting ideas abound,  but again need a little more polish,  as enemy ai is easily tricked,  and is even simpler on multiplayer. The current final boss of the game is challenging on single player,  but doesn't drop aggro on the primary target, allowing a friend to stand behind it jabbing away. I really enjoyed the experience,  being a bit slower than similar titles wasn't a detriment,  and can't wait to see where the development takes this game.
