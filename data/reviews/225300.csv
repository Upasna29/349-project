Lara Croft was one of the coolest things back then. Oh, how things have changed. After TRII it all pretty much went downhill.\n\nUntil earlier this year, with the release of the Tomb Raider reboot. Lara was finally cool again. That's also the one game that you should play if you want to experience a Tomb Raider game. Not that this one is bad, it's just awfully dated.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/225300/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Lara Croft is searching for an artifact called the Dagger of Xian but discovers that a mysterious organization is also tracking it. If she wants to be the first to reach it and prevent a catastrophic fate for the world, she will need to find the keys that will open the way... elsewhere than in China.\n\nI must say that Tomb Raider II isn't perhaps my favorite game in the series, as I'm heavily influenced by the first opus and Anniversary. But the story is well written too. I mean, who doesn't want to follow her under the water or in Italy or in Tibet?\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as the first game: you jump, you search levers, you move stuff and you shoot anything coming in your way. And Tomb Raider II has a major shift here: instead of the animals or the legendary creatures, your enemies are now humans. Many humans. Many crazy humans. And you're confronted to them more than the animals (true, you have sharks, dogs, even Yetis or spiders). I suppose that maybe, this shift may have contributed to the fact that I'm still clinging more to the first game.\n\nBut this game is also introducting vehicles for Lara: boat (well in Venice) and the snow bike which I had the most fun with. This is great to take ramps, to jump over pits or to race against the clock. That's also one of the main changes. Another new thing is the fact that you have allies in the game in the form of Tibetan monks. Don't hurt them and they'll let you in peace.\n\nTomb Raider II is also an improvement for Lara herself: she has more weapons (like an harpoon for example) if she needs to defend herself (and trust me, she will need them nearly all the time). But the best improvement is probably aethestic: she's looking more curvy than angular, though she's still wearing her regular outfit.\n\nHowever, during the game, now, Lara changes also clothes. While the change is perhaps minimal, it's more realistic for the levels. It's just a little disappointing that she must find her way on a platform in the middle of the sea, where it's very very industrial. But generally, the landscapes are still sticking to the "Tomb Raider", aka, historical places like the Great Wall of China or Venice but also more mysterious levels like a wreck of a cruiser or a Tibetan monastery. It's very nice done and guess what? The T-Rex makes also a cameo.\n\nAnyway, I liked a lot the soundtrack, mainly the one used with the snow bike for the first time.\n\nTomb Raider II is a nice way to keep going with the series. Too bad, it doesn't come with the add-on The Golden Mask (more snowbiking!) but anyway, if you're nostalgic of putting the butler in the fridge, given the price and the regular promotion of -75%/-80%, you shouldn't hesitate.","February 10","true","23.7"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/225300/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","Core Design's insanely successful sequel to the original, classic Tomb Raider (1996) is just more of the same. However, for some reason, this statement seems to often be taken as a negative one, whereas I just view it as more of a good thing. And that's exactly what Tomb Raider II is. Much more!\n\nLet's start with aesthetics. The graphics are largely improved in comparison with the first game. Lara looks like an even more sexy bunch of polygons this time around, complete with larger and rounder breasts, which I assume took up 60%+ of the development time and budget. Lara also has a ragdoll ponytail, which would actually look quite good, if it didn't look like a three-section staff that could knock somebody out. It would come as no surprise to me if she was almost every teenage guy's wet dream back in '97. Moving on, we have video settings this time around! Yes, actual video settings, and I'm fairly certain the game runs without any emulators or graphical enhancements that weren't there in the original release. There's even support for widescreen resolutions, but I prefer to keep it at 4:3.\n\nTextures and other models are largely improved, although for some reason all the male characters look incredibly wrinkly. I think they just started with Winston's model and built upon every male character from there. Finally, there's an improved lighting engine, which also plays a faily big role in the game itself, as well as being a nice visual enhancement. There's only one complaint here, and that's the FMVs. Not only do they have awful scanlines, but the game goes windowed in full-screen and it just looks wrong. However, when you compare that to the first one, where you'd have to alt-tab and the game would sometimes crash, it's not a big deal.\n\nSound-wise, it's not as good as the first, at least in my opinion. The main theme is a gutted remix of the original, but Nathan McRee provides a nice selection of short, dramatic pieces which generally fit each situation well. Lara's new voice actor is good, although for some reason they didn't replace all her lines from the original. Seems a bit odd. All the male voice actors are god awful though. Just awful. Funny, but still awful. Guns sound incredibly satisfying, and there's a larger selection of environmental sounds to add to the atmosphere.\n\nIn terms of plot, it's very simple; point-A to point-B. Lara hears of a legendary artifact called the Dagger of Xian, visiting China, Italy, and Tibet in the process to claim it. There's a couple of hackneyed villains here and there, but it's all very basic. If you want better stories, I'd player later entires in the series.\n\nNothing much has changed gameplay or control-wise; rather there's just been some additional things slapped onto the already solid gameplay to provide some variety. Levels are insanely long. Like, hours long. There's 17 levels in the game and it took me 24 or so hours to complete. I'm a slow gamer, but that's still insanely long for an action adventure-game. I've also noticed a large increase in difficulty from the first game, and the learning curve is nowhere near as smooth. It seems to be completely random, but all I can say is that I recommend you save after pretty much every puzzle; according to my end statistics, I saved 217 times. There's a lot of instant deaths, and to be honest it feels quite cheap, but I suppose that's why you can save at any time. Secrets have changed and are more rewarding, and completionists will love finding them all. The new weapons are awesome, quite frankly, and some, such as the M16, require some actual tactics to use, rather than just holding control and backflipping.\n\nThe use of newly added flares takes advantage of the aforementioned improved lighting system, as a lot of areas in the game are too dark to see without them, and it adds a nice extra element of exploration and discovery. Although you can use them underwater, which is kind of funny. Ladders and ziplines are also new, although the former are incredibly cumbersome, overused and slow, and the latter appears about 3 times in the whole game, so they really don't count for much in my book. As such, Lara comes equipped with some new manoeuvres, such as doing a half-turn in mid-air, and the animations for these are all just as fluid and beautiful as in the first game. Lastly, vehicle sections, which I was at first skeptical and hesitant about experiencing, are actually some of the most enjoyable parts of the game. It's a shame then, however, that like ziplines, they appear so rarely throughout the game.\n\nSo what's the verdict then? Well, Tomb Raider II is everything a perfect sequel should be. It's an improvement over the previous title in an abundance of ways, but at the same time, I think the game suffers a bit from a lack of overall fluidity and pace. For example, my personal favourite parts of the game are the first couple of levels and the last 5, whereas the middle section of the game is all basically indistinguishable, incredibly long and tiring. There's also a lot of backtracking, far more than in the original. This game requires a lot of patience, but I do think it is worth it. The added positives and negatives balance it out to be exactly as good as the original, which I suppose means that it fails a sequel. But that doesn't mean it isn't a kick-♥♥♥, sexy, hi-octane and lengthy adventure.\n\n3.5/5","September 16, 2014","true","28.1"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","22","24","5","0"

There was no necessity of DOS anymore like it was for TR I.\nThe plot revolves around the Dagger from Xian, a powerful object that can transform its occupier into an even more powerful dragon when stabbed in the heart. Lara Croft travels around the world to find and add this dagger to her collection. On her journey the young woman meets Marco Bartoli, the head of a mafia organization. He and his henchmen are on the same search and will try to hinder Lara to get to the dagger first.\n\nSince the first Lara Croft game some noteable things have changed. First of all the graphics got an minor allround-improvement. While you can still count pixels and a lot of polygons that are used, the surfaces are smoothed and the surrounding light advanced. Also the appearance of Lara Croft changed, her hair is now a long plait and throughout her adventure she will wear different -to her surrounding fitting- clothes, e.g. for the underwater levels she will wear a wetsuite. Every level looks different and holds the atmosphere from the beginning till the end.\n\nBesides of the graphics, the weapon arsenal got an advancement. Pistols, uzi and the shotgun stood the same, while the magnum from Tomb Raider I is exchanged into the automatic pistols. New weapons are the harpoon, with which the player is able to shoot underwater, the M16 and the grenade launcher as the most powerful weapon in the game. New are the flares too, which will light Lara's dangerous travel through caves and dark alleys.\n\nDifferent to the first game of this franchise are also the two added vehicles like the snowmobile (in Tibet) and the boat (in Venice). With these the player can travel faster in the level as well as overjump wider gorges. Lara Croft got new moves, include a roll midair after a jump and a acrobatic dive.\n\nLaudable is the possibility for unlimited saves that comes with the new game on all platforms. The player is now able to save at any point in the game, which simplifies the whole playthrough a lot. Besides the named changes the gameplay is still the same, a mix between solving puzzles, platforming and adventuring (& dying a lot!).\n\nApropos solving puzzles: The player has to stay focused all the time. When activating a button or a lever a new door will open but not always in your immediate proximity. Try to memorise the layout of the level and in which places closed doors hinder you from progressing. Be careful, not only human and animals will stay in the path of Lara Croft. Traps all around are threatening Lara's life most of the time at unpredictable places. This keeps the fun up but frustrates at the same time after the 10th death in a row. Yet, it is possible to play through all 18 levels without a guide and with a careful gameplay even without dying.\n\nSince this game is a port from the Playstation the controls feel a bit clunky. The most weird part is the fact, that the whole game on the PC is played with a keyboard only. This hinders the player also from changing the camera angle, besides the possibility to move Lara's head. Players that are not used to the keyboard only controls will be frustrated, since most of the deaths come from the limited field of view. Once used to the controls this game will bring you many hours of fun, and rage likewise though.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nGraphicwise and controlwise this game might be primitive compared to todays standards. Still, this nostalgic gem contains a lot of fun, while visiting Venice, China and other places. The fight against Lara's environment, the mafia organization and the hunt after the Dagger of Xian will fill hours of your time. I never played through the whole game once, so the levels starting from Tibet were an absolutely blind run for me. Lara died a lot, I raged a lot but still the curiosity how and if Lara will be able to collect the Dagger of Xian kept me moving on. For those who already played through the game, probably more than one time, this game is filled with nostalgia and always worth to play through it again and over again.\n\nFans of the Tomb Raider franchise should get this classic immediately!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●\nTomb Raider II is now available at PlayStation 3, and PSP (via PlayStation Network), iOS and Android with improved controls. More nostalgia on other platforms, yey!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Improved graphics compared to Tomb Raider I\n[✔] New weapons, vehicles and acrobatic movements\n[✔] Complete new enemies and 18 levels\n[✔] Unlimited saves at any point\n[✔] No DOS, steam version workes on all modern OS\n[✔] Ported to modern systems such as PS3, iOS, Android\n\n[✖] Clunky, keyboard-only controls\n[✖] Graphics primitve compared to todays standards\n[✖] Fixed camera, only possible to move Lara's head\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjrym1rJBI\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

It's classic puzzle-solving at its finest. In fact I'm pretty sure that playing it made me smarter. There's no AI holding your hand here, nor any obnoxious button graphics that flash on-screen and yell at you to mash the Y key to perform some entirely gimmicky and circumstantial roundhouse backflip to the face that you'll never need to do again. Just Lara and her lovably awkward polygons running straight ahead with the arms fully stretched out at a stiff, perpendicular angle to the body. On occasion, you can make her say "No," in a charming British voice, over and over again, and then kill her in a variety of exciting ways.\n\nSerously though, the levels are rendered beautifully, leaving just the right amount to the imagination, and many of the puzzles actually require more than three brain cells to figure out. There are no journal entries offering fluff faux "immersion," no toggled map overlays to tell you where you are, and very little clues to help you out - just you and an often convoluted and action-packed pathway from the start of a level to the exit. The levels themselves, especially the memorable Venice series, have personality and often make you feel real suspense and a sense of danger. While some puzzles might frustrate the modern gamer (certain ones depend on very exact placement of Lara to perform a series of jumps with no room for error, for instance, which can get pretty tedious), the feeling of accomplishment you get after finally landing that horrendous jump, or opening that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ door, is so worth the effort.\n\nIn my opinion, this and the original Tomb Raider are the best installments in the series, mostly thanks to their simplicity. What it lacks in modern graphics, the game makes up for tenfold in gameplay and creativity of story and design. Plus, for the first time, Lara gets to use vehicles, which add a great deal of fun to the levels they appear in, by which I mean you can drive them off cliffs and explode.\n\nAll in all, you won't regret giving this a try. Yeah, you'll probably laugh at Lara and make fun of the dated graphics, and swear loudly at the controls, but these days, that's part of the fun. Definitely a must for 90s action/adventure gaming fans and especially people who don't mind video games not insulting their intelligence for a change.\n\nOh and you can lock the butler in the freezer.","January 28, 2014","true","0.8"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

When you are dropped off in China for the first time, the graphics may not be so impressive, but for a game from 1998, its pretty nice. Throughout the game, I only really had 2 problems. This game, compared to Tomb Raider I, is more fighting oriented and is "overflowed' by the amounts of combat (Human-to-Human). In Tomb Raider I, you fought around 10 people, all of them being reoccuring characters in the storyline. My second problem was how excessively long the Shipwreck stages were.

With its intricate and creative level design, Tomb Raider II is an excellent example of this, and deserves the attention of any slower-paced adventure gamer today, despite being released almost 20 years ago.\n\nThe combat isn't very interesting at all, but that's not what I'm here for. When I play the classic Tomb Raider games developed by Core (1-3), I think, "Yay! Oldschool games with a fantastic sense of exploration!", not, "Yay! I get to jump around while shooting a bunch of generic bad guys with awful AI!". Fortunately, there isn't too much combat in TR II, and I often found myself solving puzzles and examining various rooms in complete solitude. Speaking of puzzles, I felt that the game's difficulty was just right -- tricky enough so that I couldn't breeze through a level, but at the same time not ridiculously difficult/illogical as to require a walkthrough whenever a new room is entered. I never felt like there was too much backtracking, either (TR 4 has far too much backtracking in my opinion, and thinking about that game just makes me want to punch something, but I digress).\n\nOverall, Tomb Raider II is a very high-quality adventure/exploration game, but I rank it lower than TR 1 or 3 due to the four sunken ship levels that occur about half-way into the game. These levels weren't BAD in design, but I got rather sick of running around rusted and ugly engine rooms after awhile. The other locations were top-notch, though -- Barkhang Monastery is a beautiful place to get lost in. You can expect to spend at least 12 hours on TR II without using a walkthrough, so it's a great buy for its price.\n\nJust for reference, here’s how I would rate Tomb Raider 2 relative to the other Tomb Raider games I have played, from best to worst:\n\nTomb Raider 1\nTomb Raider 3\nTomb Raider: Anniversary\nTomb Raider: Legend\nTomb Raider 2\nTomb Raider 5 (Read my review)\nTomb Raider: Underworld\nTomb Raider 4\n\n(I haven’t played Angel of Darkness or Tomb Raider 2013)","January 4, 2015","true","16.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

While the graphics aren't as good as the current games (obviously!) and some people might not be able to overcome this, I can't agree with the controls complaints. You need to understand that this game came out in 1997 when the current WSAD system wasn't the standard. Sure, it takes time to get used to the controls, but when you do, you will find out this is one of the most precise control systems.\n\nNow, finally to the review. I have very fond memories of this game and consider it one of the top games in Tomb Raider franchise. Great choice of locations (China, Venice, wreck of Maria Doria, Tibet), thick atmosphere and simple, but sufficient story...yes, there aren't as many movement options as in its successor, Tomb Raider III, but I never thought that matters. The only downside to this great game is the Steam port - what the flip is the problem with FMVs? They're all windowed and in small resolution. But other than that, this game is brilliant. If you aren't an impatient kind of gamer who hates games that really take some effort to finish, get it.

Following on from Lara's adventures in Tomb Raider, Lara finds herself in pursuit of a mythical Chinese artifact, The Dagger of Xian. Lara's journey begins at the Great Wall in China, then to the city of Venice, deep under the sea to the wreckage of the ship, Maria Doria, then to TIbet and finally back to China to face off against the leader of the Fiamma Nera, Marco Bartolli.\n\nGameplay is considerably like the first game, only Lara can now climb ladders, twist around in mid-air or underwater to face the other way, use flares to light up dark areas and carries a much bigger arsenal with weapons like the Grenade Launcher, Harpoon Gun and Automatic Pistols, whilst still maintaining weapons from the first, like the Shotgun and Uzis. Lara controls much better in this game, runs faster than in TR1, Lara also has a new voice actress replacing Shelley Blond, the more mature and rich voice of Judith Gibbins. Another thing to be noted is that Lara has several costume changes in-game, you start in the classic gear, later she changes to a wetsuit for the underwater levels, and finally dons a bomber jacket for the cold Tibetan Foothills before returning to the classic look for the final levels. Nathan McCree returns from the first game to compose the music, and it is chilling! The title theme is a very memorable one, but some of the music can really chill, even scare you!\n\nThis game is by no means short. It can be quite complicated, but with a good look around and a lot of thought, you can beat it!

The patch is available at http://tombraiders.net/stella/downloads/TR2files.html\nThe game has a free expansion called The Golden Mask which includes 5 extra missions.\n\nIn a perfect world this should be played after finishing:\n- Tomb Raider (I)\n- Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business","August 27, 2013","true","32.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I decided to skip getting Tomb Raider 1 since it is just like Anniversary except for a few parts here and there. Tomb Raider 2 I never played except for the demo, but now that I started playing it is a really nice game. The scenery is amazing and there is oodles of enemies to blaze up with your pistols, shotgun, or grenade launcher. Haha ;)\n\nI really enjoy this game so far. I do know how the controls can be kind of different from the later Tomb Raider games, but it never hurts to learn the very old controls from the new ones. It is a good change that is worth learning. I have watched walkthoughs that pretty much helped me here and there with the secrets in the China level.

Featuring many elements that would later become staples in future games. Such as Lara's free flowing ponytail and enormous outdoor levels.\n\nIt's a game that I recommend quite often over any of the others in the series. Moreso because it's clear the developers had a very clear focus with regard to it's development. The game has a very interesting and engaging plot, with imaginative locations such as Tibet, Venice, the bottom of the ocean and the Great Wall of China.\n\nWhile Tomb Raider 3 and later 4 would expand on many individual elements featured in 2. This one sold 8 million copies worldwide for good reason. It's just that damned good.","May 2, 2013","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a great soundtrack and the game has vastly improved compared to Tomb Raider I and you can lock Winston in a freezer.\n\nThe only problem is that I'm assuming this version has the patches that came out and one of the patches makes Lara stumble when she does a back flip/tries to do a back flip and that is a bit annoying, this game runs better without patches and there is no way to reverse them. This might only be a problem with my game but who knows. The fmv files are a bit weird in that they window the game, only for the fmv though, but this isn't really a major problem or a problem at all.\n\nI do only have 1 hour on record, but that doesn't account for how great this game is!","July 24, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have no idea how I got as far as I did without any walkthroughs.\n\nI hope theres not just humans and normal animals the rest of the game. That would be a little dissappointing when the first one keeps introducing interesting creatures. But even so, I don't think it will ruin this game for me.

Sega was still in the hardware business, Microsoft hadn’t yet entered it, Bioshock wouldn’t be released for another decade, and outside Japan, PlayStation didn’t even have analog sticks. It was certainly a very different landscape to the industry we know today, but don’t be fooled; the year had its own type of first-class offerings to gamers at the time.\n\nIn 1997, Tomb Raider II was Blockbuster of the Year. The start of the year had already seen the western release of Final Fantasy VII, but, a thirty-hour-plus JRPG with a mix of 2D and 3D graphics and its hybrid take on turn-based combat, it was a slow burner. With Tomb Raider II, Lara was running, jumping, swimming, shooting, mowing down thugs on a snowmobile, all in 3D, all in real-time. It was a technical achievement unsurpassed in ‘97, and that would go unsurpassed until the following year, with the likes of Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo and, of course, Tomb Raider III.\n\nIf complaints about the early Tomb Raider sequels revolve mainly around them being too similar to the original, they’re probably true - but it’d be unfair to apply them to the first of these sequels. Tomb Raider II may have been Tomb Raider 1 on steroids, but with the original having set down so groundbreaking a formula, it made little sense to depart from it in the immediate follow-up. And while the core gameplay remains largely the same, Tomb Raider II does bring many new things to the table. From the introduction of vehicles that offer new dimensions in speed and mobility, to a bigger weapon arsenal of which no two are alike, Tomb Raider II is far more than a simple reskin. Even the graphical overhaul breathes new life into the game world, from little touches such as Lara’s full-length ponytail, to sharper textures and the inclusion of sky (a big deal in ‘97!). The result is a succession of characters and environments more rich and with more personality than ever before.\n\nThe settings and level design for these environments is also a step up from that of the original. With the exception of roughly a third of the game, Tomb Raider II trades the original’s ancient caves and catacombs in favour of the modern and the urban - Lara guns her way through an opera house in Venice, an oil rig, a capsized ship at the bottom of the sea. With these comes the same traps found in the original Tomb Raider, updated to fit within their modern worlds, and admittedly with a hint of the ridiculous - crates swinging with constant momentum and sandbags that fall at exactly the wrong moment, for instance. But suspend your disbelief and you can appreciate inventiveness in the name of maintaining a challenge.\n\nThe combat, too, has taken a bounding leap from the original’s simple point-and-shoot gunplay. With urban areas comes an army of human foes, each one armed with vicious weaponry, from basic lead pipes and pistols, to pump-action shotguns and flamethrowers, the last of these a one-hit kill if Lara isn’t careful. Now more than ever the combat is a ballet of gunplay and movement, where a split-second decision between offensive and defensive (and the best choice of weapon for each foe) can mean the difference between life and death. Underwater combat also makes its debut, adding a new breed of suspense as well as thrills.\n\nTomb Raider II remains the best-selling game in the series, and it’s a distinction that was well-earned. With the title, developers Core Design took their already-iconic adventurer to new heights, and while the story is predictably hit-or-miss, the production values are sky-high. Almost two decades after its initial release, the game remains a shining example of the action-adventure video game. Outstanding stuff.","January 10","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

But the same people would probably have complained about "more of the same" if Tomb raider 2 had continued on the path of exploring old ruins...\n\nBut It's very interesting never the less , and I very much enjoyed the levels of this game. The difficulty is at time rather staggering even more than TR1 , but with perseverance it offers great gameplay and a real sense of discovery following the female counterpart of Indiana Jones.\n\nApart from the oil platform which was rather ugly, the levels are beautifully done and rather unique, like exploring the inside of a sunken luxury ship deep on the bottom of the ocean or a mysterious tibetan temple with its gorgeous art. Yes even through the game is from 1997 and rather blocky, it's still beautifully made and worth a look or three. The game is difficult but never unfairly hard and there is a great deal more of shooting bad guys than the first.\n\nGreat game overall, demand a lot of commitment to complete, but felt quite rewarding when you got there with a rather funny almost pastiche ending.","October 13, 2014","true","62.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/szarps/recommended/225300/","szarps","Szarps;","http://steamcommunity.com/id/szarps/","166 products in account","I will resume this game in one word, punishing. So i will break this down easily, when you are making a game, you must adjust the difficulty according to the gameplay mechanics avalibable. The game is clrearly much more hard than the first one (which is nice) but the problem is its badly directed the way they want you to go across all the things. Lets say that if this game has the mechanics and flexibility the TR of the 2000's, it would be an awesome game with just about the right difficulty to keep it chalenging while still punishing you for the mistakes you make. I'm also aware the game has almost 20 years old, but man I grow playing this old games and believe me when I say that it was a common mistake the idea of implementing extreme difficulty with low and unflexible mechanics in games, you may say: "that is the whole idea" if that so, then why with the advance in tecnology we have, the games are getting more easy? 2 reasons, as the time passes by the mechanics become more natural, the characters are more easy to control and they do less award things and are A LOT more responsive at any command you throw them and the second is marketing (for the sake of hitting the most amount of audiencie possible so everyone can enjoy, therefor much more money).\n\nNow putting aside the unflexible gameplay, the game is pretty solid, havent played enough to talk about the history but seems "OK", the level desing is pretty awesome and is really well desing to hide the secrets (except for a part on the first level where there is like 2 pickups that require EXTREME coordination (not impossible though) that is more a flaw in the engine where if you are nearby an item lara won't walk to it and interact with it (like underwater) you must step right up and then you can pick it up and this is really annoying because this 2 pickups are in a context where if you aren't fast enough you die and if you pick them up you must pay with a little blood (usually more than 15% of your health, but if you were fast you could make it in one piece but is really hardly likely to happen.), the sound effects has changed a little since the last game and are fairly better, graphics are a bit better (mostly lara's model because now she has her pony tale and it also moves when she runs and if you are in an outside level and idle, the hair will simulate the breeze of wind) and texture overall are at the same quality as the last one, and for the year this game was released they were amazing. Menu still uses the same base, now the compass (which was useless as I never use it) is gone and replaced with a chronometer which give you stats on your game so far, from time taken, secrets founds (which are now 3 little statues per level), and ammo/health packs used, so a pretty nice progress. Also nice progress on the video department, the game doesnt require a DOS OP/DOSbox because windwos 95/98 where already a thing for most PC at the time, plus now in the first start of the game now displays a menu so you can configure it, and the best thing is the res of the game it adapts according to your video card (basically you can run the game on +720p without any problem nor needing to installing nothing).\n\n-Some annoying bugs:\n-if the "roof" is a bit close to you, you cant perform a jump at all, and this didnt happen with his successor\n-If you have custom controls, whenever you relaunch the game, it will use both (your bindings and the default ones, just like the first game) so you need to go to controls in the menu and reselect (everytime you wanna play) "user controls", otherwise if you bind the space bar with jump you will jump but you also grab your guns.\n\nTL;DR: the game is too punishing for the unflexiblie gameplay/mechanics it has, also the desingners could have done a better job (like as they allowed you to roll in the air and underwater) with some minor details like the way you need to be near an item to pick it up or interact with it on land, grab some of the edges with a less level of exigency and climbing a LOT faster. If you dont mind that things go ahead and play it, otherwise, skip yourself a possible butthurt","June 18, 2015","false","10.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There are other better Tomb Raider games from this era to play.  Probably worth it when on sale, but that's about it.\n\nI may not be an expert tomb raider, but I have played through this one, number 3, and am currently part way through 4, so I have a decent idea of how the games work.  The reason I have not played the 1st one (officially) is that I decided to get the strory aspect from the newer Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which is the remake.  Given the discrepancy in game release dates and control schemes, it would be vastly unfair to compare it with the older games.\n\nFirstly, the graphics have aged.  But then again, the game is released back in 1996, so I can let it pass, it was probably fine, maybe even mind blowing back then.\n\nThe controls and general gameplay are going to be the hardest to get a handle on when first starting.  In short, Lara controls almost exatcly like a tank.  Do not go in expecting to use a mouse and keyboard with the WSAD mentality, the game uses either ye olde joystick are keyboard only, and I'm not even 100% sure on the joystick.  However, it feels like part of the challenge and fun of the game comes from mastering the controls.\n\nLevel design is adequate.  I remember it was interesting to navigate and solve the environment puzzles, but I don't remember vast portions of the game, so nothing really left much of an impression.\n\nCombat is bad.  The way Lara is controlled does not make combat easy in the first place.  This is complicated, especially in this game, when most of the enemies are in tight quarters, and many are armed with guns.  It makes it difficult to get through the game without guzzling many of the medkits you find.  Fortunately, many of the other games so far have far fewer armed enemies, which balances combat for the better.  I don't remember there being many bosses, it may only be restricted to one, but I'm finding that these Tomb Raider games have a habit of making boss fights rather difficult.\n\nStory: I can't remember, so I'm not going to comment too much.  However, these games are rather short on dialogue, character development, narrative.  Mostly, just excuses to move you from location to location and get you into a level.  I'm fine with that, just don't go in expecting a novel masterpiece.\n\nFinally, I couldn't get any of the graphical issues or FMV sequences corrected.  I didn't spend much time on it, but this one has more technical issues than the other games I've loaded so far.","September 7, 2015","false","27.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","1"

The controls ruin the game for me. Twenty hours between the first game and this one; the controls still don't feel natural. In fact, pretty much every problem I have with the game (much like the first game) can be traced back to the controls. It's not even the same case as something like Dark Souls, La-Mulana, or even Gunvalkyrie where the control scheme is just different and you get used to it after an hour or two. I do get it, though. I do get why this game is still so well-received. It's because of the people who played it back in the day. I'll admit it; I'm the same way with Glover. Lotsa people hate that game for the controls, but I think they're just fine. I also admit that the reason why I can get the controls to work is because I played it so much when I was younger.\n\nAs for Tomb Raider, this is my first time with the series. I didn't grow up with it, so I came into the series as an outsider. Again, as far as everything else goes, I quite liked it. The puzzles are great, the atmosphere was incredible in the first game, especially when things go all Lovecraftian. The platforming and combat... could've been great as well, had the controls been better. However, when even after 20 some hours I still haven't gotten used to the controls, I don't think that's a problem on my end. That's why I can't recommend this game to first-timers of the series. It seems like a petty complaint, but once again, all of the problems I've had with the past two games stem from the controls. I won't give this a score, as I haven't completed the game. I don't think I will in the future, either. Here's to hoping I can enjoy Tomb Raider 3.","July 12, 2014","false","4.8"," 9 of 30 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","9","30","0","3"

This game is not exatly how I remembered it to be.\n\nI had good memories of this game when it was released originally. Unfortunately they were far from the truth.\nIt must have been just the horny teenager me drooling over Lara Crofts low polygon curves and hearing her moan while she climbs stuff. And I did stop back then like at the Venice levels or so, cause the jumping got on my nerves then too.\n\nThere's nothing else in this game than visually cool looking places (which are kinda crappy looking nowadays) and some later single enemies to keep you interested in it.\n\nThe plot is ridiculous, but let's get over it and see what we have left.\nYou collect white, yellow and green phallus statues(?) as a hobby while doing your ridiculous quest of killing hundreds of hired guns and endangered animals that spawn from thin air.\nEnemies are harmless, only the flamethrower and snowmobile guys can kill you early on/middle game. That is IF you don't mess up your camera controls and lose sight of you and your enemies. You take bullets like a tank, but if you get set on fire or a snowmobile runs over your toes, you die instantly. Also as you would expect crows do more damage that bullets.\nDoors in this world are operated not by door handles, but huge levers located on the other side of the city.\n\nControls are ok for the most part, but it's really hard to get used to the quirks like the player not jumping immidiately. Wall/object clipping is horrible in some places and ruins jumps and makes diving a pain in the rocky parts.\nYou don't really aim your guns, Lara does it for you while you're jumping backflips. I really liked that feature when I played the game first time and still think it's really cool.\n\nThe graphics ok for a game this old and some of the places are visually really good looking. But the graphics are generally REALLY unclear and make finding what ever you're searching very hard. Simple things like ledges are hidden in the textures which are not seamless at all.\nLara's animations look great, but the basic thug animations look really poor. Their walking animation is like Minecraft Alpha poor.\nEnemies AI is crap too. Enemies also spawn to areas you have already cleared behind you (with no entrances).\n\nVideos didn't play ok on my computer, they played fullscreen interlaced with what ever program I had open on background showing through the video.\n\nSounds are really crappy. Music was ok and some even good, but there was little of it.\n\n-The player animations take FOREVER, are not cancelable and you have to repeat them in order to progress in the game. Even death animations have to wait for the previous to complete.\n(This makes 30% of the play time)\n-The game relies on the player having to return to visited parts of the map constantly.\n(This makes 350%-1050% of the play time)\n-Some platformer sections are a pain and require you to know where to jump beforehand blindly.\n(This makes 20% of the play time and forces you to save every 3 seconds)\n\nI liked the puzzle solving (including the drag boxes type) parts, but they are the easy part and not a match to the annoyance of always searching the right kind of blurry texture for a way to go or knowing that you'll have to backtrack again to progress.\n\nThe game takes a long time to complete. But it's not cause there's so much content, only because you have to backtrack 10 times (I'm not even exaggerating) every map and wait for the animations to complete.\nI ment to complete this game now for the 14 year old me, but it was so unbelievably painful that I had to stop right at the end before I gRJAF_AgatgrlagricASTKgu","October 24, 2014","false","21.6"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","6","24","2","1"

One is "short-distance jump" which can be achieved with Jump key + forward (up arrow), second one is "long-distance jump", you have to gain some velocity to achieve this jump. Run for a while with forward key, then press jump button. Tapping jump button while running is recommended.\n* Save constantly, ofc if you're sure that you're on a right spot. Especially useful before risky jumps. Even if you don't die, climbing a place again will be a waste of time and boring.\n* Use a gamepad. Better than keyboard.\n* Time by time, use walking to set optimal standing point before jumps. While walking, Lara won't fall off from edges (as i observed).\n\nPros and cons:\n+ Fun "playground"s\n+ Nostalgic\n\n- Controls are horrible, even with a gamepad. Mostly you have to make millimetric calculations to jump properly.\n- Graphics are deceiving, i mean time by time, you can't understand what is a ladder or movable crate. Actually it's OK for 1997 and for TR2, but even Chronicles (TR5) has that kind of stupidity... Anyway, that was off-topic.\n- Some of puzzles are bad with a foolish logic. There are a lot of them.\n- "Playgrounds". That means there is a place you have to solve how to reach the end of a level, but if you take a look, some of places are ridiculous. It doesn't have to be realistic and actually great, since it makes you feel like you're playing a game. But some areas are crazy and with a combination of weird logic of the game, solving those foolish puzzles getting unnecessarily harder (i.e. Opera House level).\n- Ridiculous death traps\n\nSummary\nIf you're a current/next generation gamer, keep away from this title. Even if you like old games and/or grew up with these, consider about it before start to play Tomb Raider 2.","April 3, 2014","false","8.5"," 11 of 36 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","11","36","0","0"

There are some technical issues that the game can have, especially on 64-bit versions of Windows, but I've noticed that Compatibility Mode (run in Windows 95 mode on Windows 7 x64 Pro) tends to take care of most of the issues I've experienced with it.  You'll also want to create a custom resolution in your video card for your native resolution's 4:3 aspect ratio.  So with 1920x1080 as an example, you would create a 1440x1080 resolution to run in full screen, or run in windowed mode to see the game in its proper aspect ratio.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's not bad.  I think the biggest downfall to the game is that the developer went for the "more is more" approach, and it ended up backfiring on them.  Instead of fixing some of the core game mechanics, Eidos just pushed for a bigger tomb raider game.  We get more weapons, more bad guys, larger levels, more challenging puzzles, and more moves for Lara to execute.  But on the negative, Lara still controls awkwardly, combat is still horrible, and the locations are just straight-up boring.  How can I put this... Tomb Raider II doesn't really have tombs in it.  Oh sure, there's the first level, and the few near the end.  But for the most part, Lara is running around places like the canals of Venice (huh?), opera houses, naval bases, and shipwrecks.  And what's worse, is that the game actually starts out pretty good!  The first level has you romping through a section of the ancient Great Wall of China, and its fantastic.  It's full of booby traps, and generally keeps you on your toes.  The immediately after that, you're thrust into Venice, where you must run around the canals in search of the main bad-guy's hideout...  Weird.  In the end, Tomb Raider II just feels like a tedious and boring version of the original.  While Eidos did make a few touch-up improvements (more polys for Lara, the ability to walk in water, real-time lighting, etc.), they neglected to fix any of the core gameplay issues.  In all fairness, the original Tomb Raider was released in 1996, and this sequel was released just a year later.  So I'm pretty sure that it was a lack of time that prevented Eidos from fixing these issues.  Also, I believe that the third Tomb Raider also came out a year after this, and it also continues the trend of "more" - again, without any fixes to the same gameplay issues that the first game had.\n\nIf you're a nostalgic fan, go ahead and get this game on sale.  It's not as tedious as the third installment, and if you've already beaten this game, there's no reason you can't romp through it again.  If you've never played the Tomb Raider games, I would strongly advise to start with the first and probably end with the first.  It just goes downhill from there until Crystal Dynamics revived the series with Tomb Raider Legend.\n\nTL:DR - Not a bad game at all.  But if you've never played the series, go ahead and start with the first one.  If you have played the first one, just know that the little improvements they made to the game don't outweigh its bigger flaws.  Still recommended though.","February 10, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Her second adventure takes her along the Great Wall of China, the snowy terrains of Tibet, Italy’s city of Venice and a sunken shipwreck, accompanied by more complex series of jumping puzzles and death traps, lever activated time puzzles and the merciless killing of treasure hunting goons and exotic animals that stand in her path.\n\nThe game grants Lara the ability to climb ladders and craggy walls, to roll in the air and underwater for trickier puzzles, and to drive vehicles such as speedboats and snowmobiles around certain levels in the game, which can be incredibly fun and very tedious at the same time. Flares have been thrown into the game to allow Lara to explore particularly dark areas with ease, which come in handy for some of the later levels, along with new weapons packing serious firepower like the M16 assault rifle, a grenade launcher and automatic dual pistols (which replace the dual magnums that were available in TR1), along with all weapons within the previous game.\n\nEnemies now have the intelligence to climb surfaces in order to reach Lara and carry pretty damaging weaponry, making combat somewhat more difficult, especially when they corner the player in tight spaces. Meaning there will be more ammo to find, a few more medicine packs to collect, and there are 3 secrets to find throughout each level; the gold, jade and silver dragons.\n\nFor those who have played Tomb Raider I, you will be pleased to hear that instead of having to save your progress at a save crystal and having to restart tedious levels every time Lara plummets to her death from that point, Tomb Raider II allows you to save your progress from your save manual whenever and wherever. It makes life much, much easier.\n\nAll environments and graphics appear to have been enhanced both in colour and in quality in this game, ultimately keeping movable blocks and secret areas better hidden, so it’s very easy to overlook a potential secret or an area full of loot if you aren’t actively exploring the entire level. The soundtrack in the game has been heavily built off its predecessor, only playing on certain cues like when the protagonist steps into the path of a rolling boulder, as it did in the previous game.\n\nAnother change to be noted is the change in voice actress for our fearless protagonist. Personally, I felt that her new voice fitted Lara better as she sounds much more experienced and capable of handling herself like a badass, whereas, her voice in TR1 portrayed her to be more of an arrogant adolescent.\n\nThe tutorial area in Lara Croft’s manor has developed greatly from its elder. The crates blocking most of the large manor have now been removed, inviting the player to explore the charming home more thoroughly. The gymnasium and the swimming pool reappear in this game, but with much obstacles to manoeuvre through and a prettier pool to swim around in.\n\nHere is where you are introduced to Winston, Lara’s old butler who is intent on following her around the house while groaning and carrying a tray of rattling tea cups. On the odd occasion when I accidently ran into him, there is a chance that he will break wind. It can be pretty fun for a while, but eventually having him dog you around the manor will grow tedious. My solution was to have him follow me to the meat locker in the kitchen, wait for him to follow a certain distance behind, then perform a well-timed leap out of the area, and lock him in. I found watching him try to walk through the door grunting and groaning to be quite amusing. Cruel, but amusing.\n\nLara can now venture outside the manor and explore the maze behind it. The main section behind the maze is an assault course the player can now test out their skills on obstacles that are a bit more challenging than the gym.\n\nAll in all, if you’re looking for a game where you can relax and enjoy shooting lead into your enemies, but still challenging enough that it keeps you wondering about any potential death traps around the corner, Tomb Raider II is a classic game with plenty of everything and is generally fun to play, even when using the Playstation controls, although the PC controls are much more fluid.","March 14, 2015","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no horendous quite-time events, while cutscenes don't interrupt gameplay but feel more like a reward for conquering a set of levels.\n\nLevels are open and vertical; unlike those in Tomb Raider III they flow quite well. Jumping and climbing are the focus here. The game is also much more colorful that Tomb Raider I which stuck with more of a grey/ brown palette. The pixelated pastel textures are quite nostaligic.\n\nIf you like solitary exploration, vertical level design and varied environments, this game is for you.","January 11, 2015","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd give this game a 7/10 score though because although it has many timeless elements of game design that still make it quite a bit of fun to play through, it does not have as clear and interesting a story as the first Tomb Raider, it falls short of that mark on most measures; and additionally it shows it's age graphically.  Is it still worth playing, yeah, but it could play much better with a bit of modernization.  The character model for Lara is of course excellently done for the time, as are her animations; but I think there may be more polygons in her model than in the rest of the game.  The modelling though isn't really where the game suffers;but rather in the low resolution textures.  The cut-scenes look extremely grainy on modern resolutions and the textures on the environments are sometimes poor enough to really pull you out of any immersion you may have.  I will say that there are a very wide variety of environments and some of them are quite in interesting, although if you're like me, you may not be able to clearly understand why you are actually going to all these peculiar places.  The story just isn't particularly clear or engaging.  The platforming controls are somewhat finicky.  You really end up using a set of manuevers in kind of the same way you might in a fighting game to clear these challenges.  Once you get those moves down, it's usually more a matter of finding where you need to platform to rather than the execution that is the challenge.  There are some block pushing/lever pulling puzzles as well and these are solid, usually not too much of a challenge but that's fine as they don't overstay their welcome.  As far as the combat, it's very similar to the first Tomb Raider as well, and the added weapon, and enemy variety is one of the real clear improvements over it's predecessor.  Overall, the game is dated, but fun.  If you are considering taking a look at the classic roots of the franchise though, I'd start with Tomb Raider 1 (better story, somewhat better level design, and native x-input support for the PC), and if you enjoy that .. heck yeah TR 2 is worth the time investment.","March 29, 2015","true","43.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prepare to be jumping over large pits, avoiding rolling boulders, and shooting at seemingly random placed baddies. Also get ready to be hitting that save button a lot to avoid long and tedious do overs. This game has an AMAZING story and the level design is very well done. There is a really good balance between trying to find the hidden doors, the right buttons, and that one key you need to continue, and fighting the good variety of baddies that you'll be encountering. This game also had a little scare factor. With little to no background music, solving the puzzles can become quite relaxing until that BLARING alert music starts warning you of a nearby spawned enemy which had me jumping more than occasionally. This game however does have some drawbacks. The camera angles can be REALLY annoying and you'll be going around corners firing just to make sure there arent any enemies down that way. The number of enemies near the end of the game can also be a bit absurd and you'll need some fancy aerobics to avoid attacks and still getting the shots off you need.","September 10, 2014","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In many ways it's a refinement of the first game, carrying on with the same jumping and switch-throwing basics, but dressing them up in more varied environments. The somewhat monotonous rocks and sand of the original are swapped out for interesting locales like an opera house and sunken ship, and in a small but important change, most stages feature an outdoor portion under a blue sky.\n\nLara herself has been given a big upgrade, with a brand new character model that better matches her promotional art. She finally gets to wear her iconic braid in-game, and her chest no longer looks like it could take your eye out. This game is also the start of costume changes for Lara, kicking off the tradition with a particularly famous wetsuit.\n\nLara's action repertoire is expanded with two new moves. She can climb ladders now, which feels like a natural addition to her moveset, and integrates just as smoothly into the game's level designs. The new flares that she carries are less successful. Though necessary on a few occasions, it's questionable whether they earn having their own dedicated button – but at least they produce a nice lighting effect.\n\nOn the downside, even in its second outing there are signs that classic Tomb Raider is showing its age. Its new environments are assembled from the same clumsy building blocks of the first game, resulting in some weird proportions in places like the interiors of Lara's home. More egregiously, the majority of the enemies Lara faces this time are human, but with no difference in AI from the animal enemies she fought the first time around. Equipped with guns, the new human foes are a lot more dangerous, but your best tactic is still to find a high ledge where you can shoot repeatedly at them, as they stupidly run around in confused circles below. Eventually these encounters feel like tiresome interruptions of the core gameplay.\n\nOf course it's no surprise that Tomb Raider II is at its best when it's not focused on combat, and the series' particular brand of puzzle platforming is still excellent when it's left alone to do its thing. Some standout stages are the monastery (which is formed as a central hub surrounded by short platforming challenges) and the temple (a thorough gauntlet that will test all the skills you've accumulated).\n\nWith it's second game, the Tomb Raider series was hurriedly growing into the fame that it had fallen into unexpectedly. Some of its improvements were essential to defining the character of the franchise's early years, and most of what was fun about the first game carries over intact. But at the same time, it's clear that the original formula is already being stretched toward its limit – and the series' ongoing struggle to balance action with adventure was a problem right from the first sequel.","August 12, 2015","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a great experience and an even better game than its prequel. I really like the direction in which this game took the Tomb Raider Series after Tomb Raider I. Still there are some flaws I could not ignore. The story is somewhat weird and not quite as interesting as Lara's first adventure. In addition to that it has a fair amount of flawed logic.\nStill this game is a big improvement. The first half of the game simply amazed me. The locations and non linear leveldesign were absolutely astonishing while the huge amount of fights made up for a fast paced experience. I loved solving the jump puzzles and found myself (positively) confused by the vast amount of options in each level.\nHowever, the second half of the game felt a bit over the top. It took me into the more supernatural part of the story, which for instance was really cool, but (in my humble opinion) felt like it was stretched over too many levels.\nI also think the fighting mechanics still offer great space for improvement so I am very curious to play the next Tomb Raider titles.\n\nNo matter its little flaws this game is still very worth playing especially for people who enjoy Tomb Raider games or Tomb Raider like games. That being said I can only encourage everyone to play this amazing piece of gaming history.\n\n- Pudels","May 10, 2014","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is, by modern design standards. If we were to go back, this would still not be a great game, but it is a good one. This dichotomy is because many of the things that people would find frustrating, were pretty regular in the early days of 3d games. Camera issues and artificial difficulty (from trying to find how to progress, trying to pull of a difficult jump while lara controls like a jumbo jet, or where a key is hidden) were common issues by todays standards and (if I remember correctly), were annoying back then, but we dealt with it, and while certain games do it better, TR 2 was a good action-puzzle-platformer. The key word is patience with this game. Have patience and you will be rewarded. Patience and saving every few minutes and before major jumps or action scenes. While its rewarding to solve a level, you will get stuck while you search for some way to get by. And those ways are usually super dumb. Now in the day this was just a ploy to sell strategy guides. Fortunately we have free strategy guides online, and unless you want to spend a long time on one section, you may have to use it. However, despite not aging well, if you can put up with the frustrating design of the time, it is a good long (although maybe for the wrong reasons) adventure. I'm going to recommend it for people who want to experience it. For people who want the best TR game though, I really do recommend Anniversary, its the adventure of the old games with more modern design.","December 29, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In many ways it's a refinement of the first game, carrying on with the same jumping and switch-throwing basics, but dressing them up in more varied environments. The somewhat monotonous rocks and sand of the original are swapped out for interesting locales like an opera house and sunken ship, and in a small but important change, most stages feature an outdoor portion under a blue sky.\n\nLara herself has been given a big upgrade, with a brand new character model that better matches her promotional art. She finally gets to wear her iconic braid in-game, and her chest no longer looks like it could take your eye out. This game is also the start of costume changes for Lara, kicking off the tradition with a particularly famous wetsuit.\n\nLara's action repertoire is expanded with two new moves. She can climb ladders now, which feels like a natural addition to her moveset, and integrates just as smoothly into the game's level designs. The new flares that she carries are less successful. Though necessary on a few occasions, it's questionable whether they earn having their own dedicated button – but at least they produce a nice lighting effect.\n\nOn the downside, even in its second outing there are signs that classic Tomb Raider is showing its age. Its new environments are assembled from the same clumsy building blocks of the first game, resulting in some weird proportions in places like the interiors of Lara's home. More egregiously, the majority of the enemies Lara faces this time are human, but with no difference in AI from the animal enemies she fought the first time around. Equipped with guns, the new human foes are a lot more dangerous, but your best tactic is still to find a high ledge where you can shoot repeatedly at them, as they stupidly run around in confused circles below. Eventually these encounters feel like tiresome interruptions of the core gameplay.\n\nOf course it's no surprise that Tomb Raider II is at its best when it's not focused on combat, and the series' particular brand of puzzle platforming is still excellent when it's left alone to do its thing. Some standout stages are the monastery (which is formed as a central hub surrounded by short platforming challenges) and the temple (a thorough gauntlet that will test all the skills you've accumulated).\n\nWith it's second game, the Tomb Raider series was hurriedly growing into the fame that it had fallen into unexpectedly. Some of its improvements were essential to defining the character of the franchise's early years, and most of what was fun about the first game carries over intact. But at the same time, it's clear that the original formula is already being stretched toward its limit – and the series' ongoing struggle to balance action with adventure was a problem right from the first sequel.","August 12, 2015","true","44.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sounds, atmosphere, puzzles, exploration, laras booty, music and general captivating essence of the game are just perfection. However, this is a long and complicated game and requires alot of patience. The controls are dated and hard to master but when you get it down it's completely worth it. This is a game that wants you to explore every square inch of it, it's filled with secrets and heavily rewards those who explore relentlessly. As is tradition with tomb raider games, this is first and foremost an exploration game. There are plenty of puzzles and enemies and everything inbetween that all up to make this timeless gem.\n\n10/10\n\n","November 4, 2015","true","38.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game runs and plays fine, but has a huge amount of bugs coming from windows 95/98. Controller support that was built for the older controller functions but very limited, I was using a Rumble Pad 2 and it worked for the most part except strafing. FMV's do not function at all for me and immediatly crash the game upon startup. I even tried downloading a modded upscaled FMV and still didnt work properly. Maybe someone should reach out to someone in the community to build a fully updated install for this. I tried the few that were on the community guide to no avail. They upscaled some textures but still didnt fix the FMV issue. Besides that its a very fun game and looks much better on PC than it did on the PSX. Very worth a play but just remember you have to have some technical knowledge of older games on older PC's to hopefully properly play this game. Good Luck!","January 31","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
