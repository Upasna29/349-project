This is a gritty story about guerilla warfare and an oppressive regime. While the story is good, the gameplay is even better. Sure, it takes around ten bullets to take down the standard enemies, but this is more than made up for by the ability to "bullet juggle" enemies by shooting them continuously. This game also has some interesting and original mechanics that spice up gameplay, but to tell you about them would spoil the story. Suffice to say, this game, while being a shooter/action game at heart, also has puzzles every once in a while as a break from the action.\n\nI guess that is what I like so much about this game, that it tells a rather messed up story using irony and moments of hilarity to minimize the effect. Some of these moments may be unintentional (I personally like to roll like a tumbleweed throughout the levels), but some, like the title of the game and the snippets of dialogue scattered throughout, are well thought out.\n\nVerdict: 10/10 Because I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this game. I had a lot of fun playing it and everything works well together.\n","November 25, 2013","true","1.8"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","46","54","0","2"

The thing I love most about Rocketbirds is its art. It LOOKS amazing. I love everything about not only the quality of the art, but the cartoony style. I also love the theme of chickens vs penguins. In a game culture where so many things are grimdark or the same old human space marines shooting the same old badguy marines and/or aliens and/or zombies, there is something refreshing about a change of wallpaper. And what great-looking wallpaper it is.\n\nI also was interested in Rocketbirds because it looked like it had some action akin to a metroidvania or possibly something a little bit more contra style. I typically enjoy those types of games, so it seemed like a safe buy. But ultimately Rocketbirds just didn't satisfy me. Here are the turnoffs:\n\n1) Movement feels sluggish and stiff, like driving a tank that also has to peel itself off the linoleum every time it stops and starts again.\n\n2) Shooting is incredibly simple. You can either shoot straight ahead or you can crouch and shoot straight ahead. That's it. You can't change aim direction while shooting, though, and HB controls and moves slow. So one of this game's favorite things to do is have 2 to 4 penguins come running in from both sides of the screen and attack you from both sides. If you only shoot one way, you'll get shot in the back. Ostensibly what you want to do is quickly shoot back and forth to keep enemies on both sides staggered. However, if you are shooting right and want to shoot left, you have to release the trigger, turn HB around, then start shooting again. Since HB also controls/moves very slowly, this makes it very easy to get ganked in the most frustrating way.\n\n3) The platforming feels very bad. The jumps are sluggish as the rest of HB's movements, for starters, but the other weird thing is that HB will auto-grab any ledges he jumps toward---and he will do it at a fairly far distance. This is great if you are actually trying to get up on that ledge, but if you don't want to auto-grab that ledge, then having him auto-grab it is annoying. The same goes for dropping over the edge of a ledge or precipice. If you are standing on an edge and press down, HB will automatically climb down that ledge. This is annoying in situations where you climb up onto a ledge, then an enemy runs on screen, and what you WANT to do is press down to crouch and shoot, but instead HB crawls down the ledge. Sigh.\n\n4) Trying to line HB up with a buttons and switches can be awkward due to jerky movements. Likewise, there are also lots of light puzzles involving pushing crates around, but pushing the crates also feels awkward due to jerky movements. This is the "sticky" aspect of controlling HB. Because while on one hand he feels sluggish, he is also difficult when trying to make more fine/precise movements, because his movement/animation tends to "pop". When pushing crates, they don't just slide across the floor in a smooth, consistent motion. They jerk and lurch forward as you push them. When trying to make fine movements, such as to line HB up with a button, he will jerk to the left and right of the button.\n\n5) There are different guns in the game, but it largely doesn't matter which gun you use. They all pretty much control the same, and for the vast majority of enemy encounters, one gun does not provide any advantage over another gun. There are power differences and rate of fire differences, but due to the way the combat works, it doesn't really change your tactics in any significant way.\n\n6) You can use mind control on the penguin enemies to take over their minds and make them go shoot their friends, but they control exactly the same as HB (except in the rare case where you can mind control a bazooka penguins), so the gameplay doesn't feel different. This still makes for good puzzling, however.\n\nI got frustrated once I got to one of the ships where you had to flip the self-destruct button and escape the ship in time. (Time challenges. Always thrilling.) I was struggling with the controls but eeking by up until that point, but at that point it was just asking for more than I was willing to fight the controls for.\n\nFinal Verdict: A beautiful looking game with a great heart, but the controls just don't feel very good, which brings the rest of the experience down.","October 9, 2015","false","1.6"," 71 of 99 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","71","99","3","0"

It isnt super short either. So you do get plently of game play hours out of it. Overall the game storyboard is well thought out and put together. It is a bit violent but kids over 8-10 should be fine playing. But use your own judgement. Every child is different. This game has not disappointed.

This gem was clearly inspired by Rolling Thunder, with a bit of Astroid (old arcade game from the 80's) inspired segments thrown in. I can't say too many harsh things about it, but its really a great game in my personal opinion. The game is a bit short, but being im not a fan of excessively long games, the shortness of the game is much welcome. The soundtrack is also outstanding. The sounds of indie rock music that plays between cut scenes and gameplay is welcome and wonderfully fits the game's mood.  The run and gun game play is also just as satisfying. I would recommend this game to anyone who are into old school run and gun games like rolling thunder and, hell even dirty harry for the NES.

This is one of those games where you see it, and you ignore it, because it just has that look to it, that its gonna be a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game that belongs nowhere other than a bundle, and you only activate it just to add a +1 to your library. BUT... no.... no no no no no...\n\nThis game is ridiculously fun. The art style is cool, the controls are nice and tight and work well, the sounds are high quality, the music is great, and the humor is so corny you have to laugh. REALLY enjoyed what ive played so far, definitely going to be coming back for more, im loving it. It's not some super hard platformer or side scroller shoot em up. It's a mindless game with mindless shooting just like it appears to be, but its done in a way that makes it highly enjoyable.\nFirst i was just running through the levels shooting up the penguin enemies. Then i got to a part where i found my jetpack. It shoots me up in the ait, and theres a huge Zeppelin that's spitting out penguins with jetpacks and we're twirling around in the air having dogfights. Was a lot of fun. I'm only two or three levels into the game and can already tell its a keeper. Even if nothing changes and this same gameplay repeats itself, its still a great game.\nI would definitely reccomend this to anyone who likes side scrollerr shooters even in the slightest. I can't wait to hook up with someone to play some co-op with. I imagine it would be lots of laughs.\nAs far as pricing, i definitely would not want to pay the full $9.99 for it, it's a great game. But it's not $9.99 great. If you can manage to get your hands on an old bundle code, or you catch it on a sale here through Steam, or elswhere like Amazon or GMG, grab it. $5.00 would be a fair price for it with ease.\n\non a scale of 1 to 10 i give this a solid 9.","January 4, 2014","true","1.0"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"

Even at three hours, it overstays its welcome. The levels are all the same - climb around some buildings, press switches to call the elevators, oops can't go that way, must brainbug an enemy to press a button or something, go grab that crate, run back to where you were, finish the level, oh wait another building except this one is in the jungle instead of on an ice mountain. There are some occasional flying dog fight missions to break it up, but by the end (well much before that) I was ready for the game to be over (make it stop). The end is certainly anticlimactic since the main boss fight isn't even the main boss.\n\nThere are some collectables - red signs you must hit. However, there is only one in a level at a time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Das_Biotop/recommended/215510/","Das_Biotop","Dr. Unlustig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Das_Biotop/","358 products in account","After playing through Rocketbirds and reading some reviews I feel the need to defend this game.\n\nThe biggest problem of Rocketbirds may be the way it presents itself. Most people expect a Run'n'Gun with this kind of presentation. A simple, yet satisfying chaotic shooter...but what you get is a game, which is more challenging on your mind than on your trigger finger.\n\nBut one thing after another. The first thing you'll notice is the amazing artstyle, which is depicting a cartoony approach, with some gory elemtents sprinkled throughout. The graphics are mostly very clear and easy on the eye with some additional eye-candy effects, which in most cases don't obscure the players view. Slight variations in the colorpalette throughout the game give every level a distinct feel and provide a certain variety. The big selling point for the graphics is the 3D-effect. Instead of having a flat view on the scenery, like you would expect with this style, every scene has at least some aspect to give it some depth. And it looks amazing in motion.\n\nThe soundtrack is also unique. Most of the times you won't notice the music, but in some instances, vocal tracks are played. The rock band New World Revolution provided some tracks for this game and they fit just perfectly. Sound FX are nothing particularly amazing, but they did their job.\n\nThe gameplay is where it gets really interesting. As I wrote above, this absolutly is not a Run'n'Gun. The stiff movement of your character forces the player to be really aware of the enemys movement and position. The battles are challenging but doable, if the character is in the right position and prioritizes which enemy to kill first. Rushing from screen to screen will punish the player. The enemys are attacking very quickly with very little windup time to their attacks, so caution is needed. This approach to combat is, in my book atleast, absolutely legit, if it weren't for the big battles with many enemies attacking in waves. I found no way to complete these section without dying. You will bombarded with bullets from both sides that will stunlock you. In most cases I just tanked through these battles. This is made possible by the checkpoint system, which allows the waves to be winnable. A new checkpoint is reached after every wave and if you die, you'll get resurected with full health and ammo. The checkpoint system in general makes the whole game very forgiving. If the characters health is depleted and the player has to restart from the last checkpoint, he will be where he/she died in less than a minute. This makes the whole challenge very forgiving and counters frustration.\nSome light puzzles also made their way into Rocketbirds. But describing them as puzzles is an overstatement. They mostly consist of finding a certain path and evading enemies in time. Three times (or was it four) the game lives up to its name, the player gets a jetpack and leaves the planet to go dogfighting in the sky. A nice diversion, but these sections are short and few.\n\nAnother game I was constantly reminded of during my playthrough was Abes Odyssey. The carefull aproach you have to take and the stiff controls reference the early oddworld games. I wouldn't be surprised if the developers of Rocketbirds would cite Abe as an influence.\n\nAfter my playthrough I was left with an experience which was perfect in lenght, it did all it wanted to do and didn't stretch itself further than it needed to be. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes Oddworld or is looking for a very unique game.","January 15","true","3.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

Since I know that many of you have this game (bundles/sales/free giveaways) I just want to spare you the trouble of ever starting this below-par platformer.\n\nFirst I would like to start with the good things, because it's not all that bad.\nShooting is fun. Humour is OK. Political conotations are appreciated. "Brain bugs" are a decent mechanic all around.\n\nNow with the bad.\nLevel design which is so tightly crammed leaving you no room for outmaneuvering your enemies - meaning the games is linear as linear gets. Really, no paths to chose whatsoever.\nPuzzle sequences, which are actually not puzzle sequences at al as all you need to do is move some boxes around - going from A to B, then from B to A, then from A to B again, try to jump up a few times and flick the switch that leads to C...\nCheckpoints, which will often leave you between a rock and a hard place.\nLagg in online co-op. Sometimes gamebreaking (probaly not everyone has experienced this, but we did).\n\nCo-op was the thing I really hoped will save this game from it's mediocrity. But it didn't. Infact, co-op is probably the worse segment of Rocketbirds. Why? You see, there is a unique mechanic that is essential in co-op mode, the one featuring one player jumping on-top another mostly used for reaching high ledges.\n\nThere are two major issues with this.\nThe first one is that it is not optinal - you just jump next to your partner and you are automatically on-top of him, which leads to HUNDREDS of falls, fails, repeats, backtraking instances.\nSecond one is that there is virtually no room in those tightly squeezes corridors for this mechanic to actually work properly, leaving you with a sorrow grim on your face time and time again.\nYou know the game is bad when you and your partner laugh about how bad this really is.\n\nIf you allready own this game, sure, give it a try, why not.

As unexpectedly serious in tone as the story is, what's even more surprising is how well it comes together. I genuinely began to empathize with our hero's plight to free his country from the oppressive reign of the Penguins, which is no small feat for a game starring a machinegun toting chicken. The stilted, self aware voice acting and dialog add a darkly humorous overtone onto this which when taken in tandem is a completely unique and entertaining narrative that outdoes the straightforward tale underneath.\n\nGameplay is a side-scrolling shooter stripped to its bare fundamentals, involving little more than rolling from room to room guns blazing and shooting anyone dumb enough to try and stop you. Interspersed are a few sections strapping you into a jetpack for aerial combat, but for the most part the developer chose to keep things simple and uncomplicated, which I think the game is better off for. My only complaint are the somewhat stiff and clunky controls, whether using KB&M or a gamepad (though I would definitely advise using the later if you have the option). You can only shoot directly in front of you, but switching directions takes a split second too long and allows for a bunch of cheap shots from enemies, and can get you into some tight spots during later levels. I did get a hang of them eventually, but they could certainly be improved.\n\nBut cumbersome controls are in no way able to bring the game down. The art style which places animated 2D character models against realistic, slightly offset 3D backgrounds is brilliant, and the kickbutt soundtrack is impeccable to say the least. Despite being extremely brief the campaign is exciting and full of action, with solid (though entirely habitual) gameplay and a creative, excellently constructed presentation that sets it apart from the rest. More than anything else though Rocketbirds is simply very, very cool and an adventure well worth taking.","October 11, 2013","true","2.8"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","1"

It is obviously... content driven. It revels in its art and theme with a silly world about anthropomorphic birds that have political and racial problems, including genocide. That's where the game shines. The art and theme of the game are really charming.\n\nThe gameplay on the other hand is lacking in thoughtfulness. It has its moments. At its best, the game is puzzle-platforming, including some simple platforming and crate-stacking. It also allows you to possess enemies in a method very reminiscent to "Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee," which is super enjoyable. There's nothing quite like gunning down bad guys that think you're friendly, taking all the risk with none of the.. risk. It's cool! But most of the rest of the gameplay, including the last boss, revolve around its sloppy gunplay.\nAt first it might not be so bad. Shoot a bad guy ~25 times and he dies. He juggles in the air with each shot until death which seems fun until the very moment when 2 or more bad guys are on screen. Your bullets will not go through flying bodies, which means if there are 3 guys stacked front-to-back, you will only hit the guy in front while the rest gun you down, knocking you off-screen to recover, at best, and at worst, stunlocking you until you die.\nThere is a sort of hiding / cover system in the form of a background layer you can move into at specified points, but this is ALWAYS [ALWAYS (ALWAYS)] omitted when you're in a difficult combat scenario. This means your only way of succeeding in the difficult combat sections is just retrying it until you get lucky and the enemy AI just doesn't shoot you as much as usual. Wow it's frustrating.\n\nThere are also combat sections that involve jetpacking around in the air shooting down enemies with jetpacks. This is kinda fun and feels much less luck-driven, but there's not much particularly challenging, as there's pretty much one strategy: Fly around and don't get shot while shooting. In a word: Shallow.\n\nSo all this said, there are good things in the game's aesthetic to experience but, for goodness sake, play it on Easy mode. There is absolutely nothing about the game's difficulty that is fun as it revolves entirely around a mechanic that you wish would just turn off.","May 27, 2014","false","6.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

On a random whim, I decided to try it as a filler game, and was very surprised with the quality of what I played.\n\nIf you like fairly casual, side-scrolling action, and pump-you-up music, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are quite good - the detail in the environment and characters is well-done, and the art-style pops out nicely. The music is very good if you don't mind rock-style - the cutscenes pump you up, and the story is decent (and comical at times).\n\nThe controls are very basic and easy to pick up. The tutorials are quick and helpful, instructing you on new game mechanics as they are introduced. The learning curve is minimal, however, the most difficult part of the game is probably timing your attacks, as you can get swarmed from both the left and right sides at any time. Because you (and your enemies) can air juggle with attacks (popping a character up and stun-locking them with bullet fire), if you let even a single enemy get a shot on you, you can quickly find yourself in a dangerous situation. Choosing both the appropriate weapon and timing your attacks will ensure your survival.\n\nGameplay is very linear, however, there are parts where you are required to backtrack a bit. Many of the "puzzles" require you to collect various colored keycards and/or push and pull crates to allow you to reach higher ledges. There are collectibles in the form of signs that you can reach for extra achievements - some of which take extra effort and intuition to find.\n\nSome of the weapons you will find as you progress include a submachine gun and a shotgun. The submachine gun is fantastic for juggling opponents, but does very little damage. While the shotgun is deadly at close range, it is an ammo-eating monster, and can cause you to get overwhelmed if you are attack from the opposite side (as its bullets cannot reach an enemy on the opposite end of the screen). Health and ammo crates are usually common throughout the level, and enemies seem to always drop a small amount of ammo. Ammunition is shared among all weapons, and you do not have to reload, ensuring that action is constant and rapid.\n\nLater, you unlock a  mind-control grenade that allows you to take over enemies, which is essential for continuing the game in many levels. Whenever you take control of an enemy, the script they go through is very comical.  Sometimes, I use this weapon just for fun, and to watch the same script over and over again.\n\nOverall, the game can be a lot of mindless fun, will be enjoyed by 2D-platformer enthusiasts. A good game for casual, time-filling gameplay.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","October 17, 2014","true","0.9"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

Turns out I was wrong, after playing it for a couple of hours and beating I can say that I enjoyed myself more and more until the end, the soundtrack is amazing, even though the plot is nothing too big it's still funny and the graphic style certainly fits very well to the theme. The gameplay is alright though, it has some "puzzle" sections where you need to drag some crates in order to jump on top of them, other than that is mostly jumping, running and shooting, which is fine by me. Overall I think Rocketbirds is not an amazing game but certainly a good one and a very funny one too, I strongly encourage you to give it a shot.","October 28, 2013","true","3.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

It was a lot of style and not a lot of substance, and I was worried the whole game was going to carry on in that vein. But as I got further in and the gameplay started deepening, I found myself more and more interested in seeing it through. It might not be a perfect platformer, but it paves over a lot of the rough spots with some unique flair.\n\nRocketbirds puts you in the role of the titular Hardboiled Chicken, a Stallone-esque supermerc on a mission to assassinate a sniveling, dictatorial penguin. The journey takes a number of twists and turns, through military prisons, museums, and jetpack jaunts through the clouds, all while dispensing bits of backstory in rock opera cutscenes. I'm not kidding in the least, here... the developers enlisted the musical talents of New World Revolution to provide the soundtrack, and they're used to the most at every turn. Everything in the game is set to vocalized tracks, with the cutscenes completely choreographed to the music. It gives the game a strange feel, like someone set out to make a music video and ended up with a video game instead.\n\nPart of this feel stems from the simplistic gameplay. Rocketbirds plays like a more fluid Prince of Persia, with jumps carefully measured and having to keep your character facing the right direction. Adding guns to this formula is historically not the best idea, and indeed the gunplay in Rocketbirds is basically a race to pull the trigger first. Your shots juggle enemies and they take loads of bullets to kill for real, so each foe requires several seconds of constant attention. When enemies approach from both sides, this is a problem that requires a careful balance of shots. Enemies can also bullet-juggle you, so by the end of the game failing to service an enemy can make you dead very, very fast.\n\nLuckily, Rocketbirds doesn't hinge its appeal on the gunplay. Combat is less a feature of each level than platforming, keycard hunting, and gimmicks. New systems get introduced almost every other level, ranging from jetpack fights to mind control. There's enough to look forward to to keep you trundling through levels, even if the core gameplay is simple and frustrating at times. There's even a pretty entertaining co-op mode and I'm not usually a big co-op guy. I won't say Rocketbirds is for everyone, but if you ever wanted to play through a 90s animated metal music video, it'll hit the right notes.","February 12","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

Neat graphics and gameplay, nice story and fitting background music (which may become a little annoying during replays though). It supports 3D glasses and a controller (didn't try them personally). You can complete the main story in about 5 hours or less in the first playthrough, but co-op mode and achievement whoring (100% easily doable) extend the playtime 5-fold.\nA bit glitchy sometimes, if it happens during a cutscene just press esc and jump it.\nSome parts are a bit tough compared to the rest of the game, just don't surrender and keep trying until you get it right.\nIn the jetpack stages the mouse influences your movement, so if you aim and control your direction with the keyboard at the same time you'll fly like a drunk and hit the missile you were trying to avoid.","January 17, 2013","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The soundtrack...it's awesome. The aesthetics are also pretty nice...a bit different from the usual, so kudoz on that. Let me think...nope, can't think of anything more. What I really don't get is how this game can get reviews like 5/5 or 9/10...on the store page...this is ridiculous. Even if it wasn't so bad, it would never be THAT good. I read ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like "plenty of content"...I beat this in 2.8 hours!!!!!!! And most of it was being stuck...lol. A pro can beat this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in under an hour...this is NOT plenty of content...jesus christ.\n\nWhy you should NOT buy this game, not even during a sale, as I did:\n\nYou are a chicken...this is cool. You have guns...also cool. This is where cool ends.\nYou can either run or "roll"...funnily enough the roll move is also the best way of locomotion for 95% of the game. Running was only useful for 1 or 2 precision actions. Rolling can be chained together, it is faster, more responsive, you need it to bypass enemies with shields and 95% of the time whenever you encounter an enemy they will immediately drop down and shoot at you. If you are in "run" mode this means you will simply shoot over their heads, miss and die a gruesome and quick death.\n\nBy the way...enemies. There are a few generic enemy types. Enemies with guns, with bigger guns, with shields and melee weapons and those with rockets. None of those is even remotely challenging on its own, however they have the annoying habit of appearing suddenly BEHIND you, which wouldn't be that bad, but for the following:\n\nThe game has no continous scrolling background...you move through fixed backgrounds, after about 2-3 seconds you reach the end of a screen and a new screen is instantly loaded. On this screen there can be a number of enemies...you can't know, so I found it best to just be rolling around all the time and instantly shooting as soon as I entered a new screen. Often enough enemies will then enter the screen behind you, while you are already fighting an enemy before you, meaning they will shoot you in the back, which more often than not results in your death or severe health loss and subsequent death on the next screen. The only way to prevent this is to either stick to the very end of a screen, because enemies will not shoot you outside of the current screen or roll behind an enemy and make sure to not have enemies in both directions. They will not shoot one another (the shield guys are an exception, somehow they can be bypassed by enemy bullets).\n\nEnemies are also bullet sponges. No matter the weapon, pistol or assault rifle, they will take a whole lot of punishment. This only changes with the final weapon, which does not have a continuous firing mode, but a burst mode...you get that weapon after you have completed 90% of the game...or even more...have I mentioned that you can only shoot left or right? no up/down...nope.\n\nPuzzles...this game has "puzzles". These puzzles look something like this: There is a Tower with 4 sections and 4 levels or so...the puzzle involves you going from Section A, level 2, to Section B, level 3, collect a card, go to Section C, level 1, collect another card, go to Section D, level 3, mind control a minion, activate some elevator, go to Section C, level 4, ride the elevator down to Section A, level 1, collect another card, lalalalsakgnjfdajkgndfjksgndsjknagjksdnjkganfdgk\n\nI can't even! I understand backtracking...what I don't understand is senseless prolonging of levels. I completed this game in about 2-3 hours on normal...most of that time was spent dying randomly or trying to figure some stupid puzzle out that has you going around the whole level multiple times...I especially loved the crates in level 11...‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you. All the levels are built like this famous ziggurat puzzle or whatever it's called: move the top layer to an empty space, move the next layer to the next empty space, move the first layer back and forth and so on, until you have moved thy ziggurat/Pyramid whatever from 1 place to another...it's horrible design. The final level has you ride different elevators up and DOWN a rocket again, as the villain tries to flee from you!!!!!! WTF? And that after the most boring boss fight in history that lasted ages anyway and didn't even have music...you have to experience this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to believe it.\n\nBetween those levels you can use a jetpack...you might think this would be fun...it's not. The level are literally always the same. There are 2 enemy types, each wave spawning more of each. That's it...survive a few waves then blow up the airships with the same procedure as explained above.\n\nYou also have grenades, which are pretty useless, because to throw them far you have to stand up. Standing up in a fight usually means you die before you even threw the damn thing. Even behind "cover"...You also have a sort of brain control thing...this isn't a tottaly useless feature but most of the times you can only use it at fixed points in the game to control an enemy and open a door or move a box or activate an elevator...lame, boring...also sometimes it takes 1 hit, sometimes 3...lol weird.\n\nThe check points are also a joke. Sometimes you start right after you died, sometimes you have to navigate half of the level again. They are just really awkwardly placed at times. Especially before the final "wave" fight...man those are stupid...if you die at the first wave, you have to ride the elevator upwards again...this takes about 10 seconds or so...it's unnecessary. After the first wave though the game saves after every wave and even respawns you with additional health and ammo...lol.\n\nThe voice acting and writing is so bad, that I almost had to switch the sound off. Luckily they did not use a lot of voice acting. They even have some kind of wannabe Schwarzenegger accent in there...wtf. It's so bad. The writing itself is extremely boring. You do not care about most of the stuff. The best you get out of the story are the cutscenes, which evoke at least some kind of emotion. The soundtrack also helps...\n\nYou're also being objected to several superfluous text bubbles that you have to endure...nothing really matters but you also can't skip it.\n\nThe sad part is that I wanted to like this game...but the more I played the more I hated it, so my final voting if I had to would be 5/10, because the soundtrack and the art and the general aesthetic is pretty nice. Gameplay wise this game is junk...sorry.\n\nSummary:\n\n+ Awesome soundtrack IF you like Alt rock\n+ Nice setting, different types of birds acting as "races"\n+ Nice graphics style in general\n\n- bad gunplay\n- bad movement controls\n- horrible level design\n- boring enemy design\n- at times unfair save points and general situations\n- no continuous game screen, instead multiple screens per level\n- boring game mechanics\n- shallow game play\n- cringeworthy voice acting\n- extremely boring story\n- annoying writing and waiting and elevator rides...so many elevator rides\n\nDo yourself a favour and do not buy this game. Instead by "Mark of the Ninja" or "Shank 1/2". Those are games that do everything a lot better, have great gameplay and a cool story, while being similar enough to a 2D killing simulator...\n\nUgh...including this review I have wasted about 3-4 hours of my life with this...why?","January 2, 2015","false","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a shooting side scroller with the addition of 3-D mechanics , seems gimicky but it does make the game look sleeker.\nThe game's humor is alright, I think the concept of what the story is about is actually kind of interesting and snarky in a way.Likable characters - or birds heh. They're cool.\nYou shoot things generally, it's pretty simple, you can also roll around to avoid enemies (for the most part). I like how simple the game generally is- people may not like the shooting aspects as it may come off as dissapointing or extremley simplistic but it gets the job done. The only major gripes I have with this game is multiplayer as the online community is basically high and dry since this game is a pretty vague and unknown indie game (at least that's what i've noticed). Alot of people ran away from this game because alot of PC gamers couldn't even start the game and it faced plenty of crashes, BUT I believe the devs fixed all of this by this point so there's no more to be concerned about. If you're just bored and you want to start up a game really fast and kill your boredom off with a decent game , i'd recommend this baby.\n\nEDIT: This game isn't terrible or anything but i recommened buying this if it's less than 10 bucks. Otherwise ehhh I'd skip it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/215510/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nRocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is an ‚Äúarcade-indie shooter‚Äù you could say it‚Äôs an ‚Äúarcade shooter-indie‚Äù, or even an ‚Äúindependent shooter arcade‚Äù. Regardless of what you call it, this was the first game I‚Äôve ever played on steam in this genre.\nI enjoyed the unique game play, the game did force me to play through the story three times, but it‚Äôs a pretty short story so I can forgive it. (Thank you for letting me select specific levels, that made my achievement hunting much easier.)\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  The story of Hardboiled Chick is revealed through the gameplay, I don‚Äôt want to spoil the story, you play as ‚ÄúHardboiled‚Äù a Rooster who sometimes has a rocket strapped to his back. The game makes many clich√© references to ‚Äúmacho first person shooter games‚Äù, or movies in general, however it‚Äôs all in good humor. (I don‚Äôt think it took itself too seriously, thankfully)\n\nGame Play: The controls on the game took a bit of getting used to, you shoot the direction you face. There are some controls that overlap, like trying to get up from a crouch and getting on top of a box. I learned how to work my way around that type of cumbersome mechanic, as a whole though, the game played very well. (note: I play all my games with a keyboard and mouse, however this is one of those games that would play much better with a gamepad, I‚Äôm sure of it)\nThe place the game shines is when you‚Äôre in jetpack-mode thus the name ‚ÄúRocketbirds‚Äù. Then the game plays like an arcade shooter, but that requires the use of your mouse to control the direction you fly. I found myself enjoying the flying more than the rest of the game.\n\nAchievements: As with any general game, there are the achievements you get for playing the game, in addition there are many achievements you will miss on your first play through, which may require a second or third play through. As I indicated in my quick review, ‚Äúselecting specific levels, made my achievement hunting much easier‚Äù.\n\nPrice: Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken‚Äôs standard price is $9.99 I could almost purchase Starbound with that money (inside joke directed at Vinehugger & Zauss ‚Äì whom never read my reviews) as I keep saying, my value system is (Cost / Time = Value), I played this game for 8 hours, I‚Äôll probably put in another hour or two playing multi-player with my brother Jett50Two, (thank you in advance, my poor achievement tagalong) I think that a dollar an hour is a very good quality. As usual insert comment about games are better on sale, blah blah blah, humblebundle, blah blah blah.\n\nConclusion: I think this game did a very good job telling Hardboiled chicken‚Äôs story, I LOVED the music (it was rock, how could I not love it?) the game play was par for the course. At a dollar an hour, I think that‚Äôs a reasonable price as well.","May 14, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was laughing right from the second I got control over the main character. The plot is quite ridiculous as well and the humanoid bird-people were hilarious. The soundtrack is outstanding and I even continued to listen to it on Spotify weeks after beating the game.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it was entertaining enough to get me through the end of the game, but it was nowhere near innovative. I know it was trying to go for that old 80's action style gameplay, but I don't feel it holds up as well today. The jetpack dogfight sections were my favorite part and added a much needed change of pace.\nThe typical semi-stealth, semi-shoot-em-up 2D sections got repetitive after a while. With the option to use grenades and the mind-control device, the multi-leveled sections gave the player freedom to try new strategies and experiment. On the other hand, the flat, obstacle-less sections forced me into the same pattern of gunplay given the lack of options.\n\nI got this game in the Humble Indie Bundle and it was definitely worth the time I spent on it.","January 13, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I personally feel the sounds used as well as choice of music is simply brilliant! I've found myself hearing it when not gaming quite often. I finished the game within 3 hours and feel that there is a good pace between the jetpack missions along with the standard shoot em'up style of gameplay. Some of the gameplay elements such as controlling the enemy through bots is quite ingenious and will make you think why is the AI making an infinite amount of penguins spawn on the door.\n\nHowever, a couple of things did leave a sour taste in my mouth which can put off some buyers such as\n\n> the missions are quite repetitive in terms of what to do. Find a keycard and unlock a door; not only does this get stale after a while, but some of the missions require puzzle solving skills (getting crates from around the mission, planning how to get them over eachother' which can turn away people wanting a pure run and gun game\n\n> there is little variety between the guns. There are 3 weapon classes with only 2 weapons in each class, and two throwable weapons (ones that can allow you to control enemies and grenades) Considering the lenght of the game though, I do feel its quite justifiable.\n\nNot really a complaint buy some people may not like the fact that the game is a windowed game.\n\nIf you can look past these quirks though you will find an intriguing game of killing penguins as a chicken with grenades and guns. I do feel though I should note that I got this game in a bundle, so I did not pay anything near full price for it, and this can impact the way I do feel about the game.\n\nI hope this helps, and thanks for reading!","June 15, 2014","true","3.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

General platforming and some good quality toilet humor along the way to overthrowing the penguin dictator.\n\nIt has some good things going for it, like lots of chicken on penguin violence and lots of penguin on penguin violence.  I like  that you can exercise mind control on enemy penguins and make them commit fratricide.  After you've used them up like a spent prophylactic you can throw them away by making them commit suicide.  It's quite entertaining.\n\nThe animation is top notch and the controls are a bit clunky but it rarely gets in the way.  There are a few levels where you strap on a jetpack and do some dogfighting, which breaks up the platforming nicely.\n\nThere are a few things that drag this game down though.\n\nArtificial difficulty.  At points in the game they just throw enemies at you from both directions (it's 2D).   Therefore to execute your attack, turn around and execute another attack in time is darn near impossible before those guys just surround you and spam you with gunfire so you can't do anything but sit there and flop around getting shot until they drain all your health.  It gets very annoying.\n\nThe puzzles never change, you must find this keycard to open that door and advance in the level.  The further you get through the story the less intuitive the keycard quests become.  Here is the formula to figure out the path; if you kill a penguin standing somewhere and he is immediately replaced by another you're suppose to take control of him to do your dirty work, ie open a door or move a platform and take out a few of his teammates in the process.  However to do this you have to throw a....lets call it a "mind control grenade".... so as the story goes on they crowbar in more artificial difficulty by making you throw it through smaller windows, bank it off a wall, or make the guy pace around etc.\n\nOverall it's a decent game, however I'm about 2/3 through it and I believe I've reached the point of diminishing returns regarding entertainment vs frustration due to ramping artificial difficulty.","November 28, 2013","false","2.8"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

My Xbox 360 controller worked on the menu, but input failed to register once I entered the game. I won't make it that big of a deal, however, since I'm fine with keyboard and mouse. The gameplay itself is much more of a cause for worry.\n\nThe fist thing you notice is that jumping is stiff, like the infamous Castlevania jump: you can't change direction in midair. There's also a painfully slow windup time and hang time for each jump, making platforming a pain and breaking the flow of transitioning from run to jump. You can grab onto ledges and pull yourself up, which would be kinda cool if the game didn't completely depend on this SINGLE MECHANIC for 100% of platforming from start to finish. Every time I jump or pull myself up I sigh at how slow it takes. But hey, you might wonder, isn't the game also focused on combat? That should be a nice refresher. Well, guess again.\n\nRocketbirds has a ridiculously shallow form of combat. You shoot directly forward, or you crouch and shoot directly forward. You can't change direction while shooting, so you have to stop shooting and turn around if enemies appear on either side of you. The different weapons seem to be there simply for necessity rather than variety, because the only difference between weapons is the amount of time it takes to kill the enemy. You can throw grenades, but it breaks the flow of the game with its clunky behavior and no way to tell where exactly your mouse is aiming so that you can affect the projected trajectory. There's also the ability to take temporary control of an enemy instead of Hardboiled Chicken, but that feature is COMPLETELY POINTLESS because gameplay doesn't really change at all.\n\nThere are cutscenes, but they're awful, especially the voice acting. The game also tries to be kinda funny, but I had to double take to make sure that certain lines were ridiculously pathetic attempts at humor. Anything I actually like about this game? Well, the artstyle isn't too bad; I kinda like it. There's also a section early in the game that works like a 2D dogfight minigame which I definitely enjoyed, but the rest of the game is just boring, even painful, to play.\n\nTL;DR: Rocketbirds brings nothing new to the action platformer, while also managing to ruin the basics of the genre.","August 24, 2015","false","1.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/helldee/recommended/215510/","helldee","eldee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/helldee/","402 products in account","I really wanted to like this game, but half an hour into it and I'm just done.. it rubs me in all the wrong ways.\n\nAllow me to enumerate my grievances.\n\nFirst- the music is terrible. Think of the worst prog rock crap you heard in the mid 90's and then layer random chicken and gun sound effects over it. Okay sure, that's mean- and subjective. But what isn't subjective is the fact that it's repetetive as hell! And not just in a "this type of music uses four chords and repeats the same crap over and over again", but the actual system that delivers the music seems to be somewhat broken- often restarting the music for doing simple things like pausing or walking through a doorway. If the music didn't have vocals, it'd be instantly less annoying- but it'd also have the beneficial side effect of masking the fact that it restarts ALL THE TIME. Okay, so you can turn the music off- let's forgive them this point and move on, shall we?\n\nNext, the art. The chickens themselves are actually well designed and interesting- I'll be honest, they're one of the main reasons I flushed $5 down the drain on this one. The hand-drawn look is somewhat unique and appealing- but slap it on some poorly rendered quasi-3D backgrounds that look like something out of a late 90's PSX game and it sucks the life right out of it. But as we all know, fancy art does not a good game make- so again, let's forgive them this point and move on.\n\nGameplay. So much potential.. This seems like one of those ideas that was designed on paper and then executed from start to finish without any usability testing or gameplay prototyping.. none of that 'find the fun' stuff- because it's just not fun. At the end of the day, that's what kills this game for me and it's tragic because it really does have a lot of potential. Imagine playing contra where your dude took up half the screen, moved at a snails pace, rolled at the slightest touch of a button. Now imagine playing that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ized game, only allow shooting left or right, and make it so you waste tons of ammo juggling dead bodies against the edge of a screen while trying to get the guy who's behind the guy you just killed.\n\nThe one redeeming part of the gameplay were the jetpack segments of the game, which plays a bit like MiniSquadron if you've ever played that. HOWEVER- they manage to donk that up too by constantly changing the focal point of the camera to parts of the sky that your dude isn't even in! So you're controlling a flying chicken completely blind while the game spawns more AI into the field- by the time the camera pulls back you waste time trying to find yourself and orient so you can take on the new enemies. When AI flies offscreen there's no offscreen indicators that hint at where they might be coming from.. so you just fly around hoping to cross paths with them (meanwhile the AI knows exactly where you are at all times).\n\nI'm not even going to get into the poorly balanced weapons and ammo system, or the infuriating juggle/stun system.\n\nSo I can safely recommend that you stay clear of this one, unless A) you're morbidly curious, and B) it's sufficiently discounted.","January 17, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I had some misconeptions about it, but after I realized it's going for a Flashback / Blackthorne (Blackhawk) kind of gameplay I had no troubles adjusting to some of it's quirks.\n\nFirst of all, the controls are a bit awkward - much like Flashback or Blackthorne, so instead of playing this like Contra you are forced to take your time and patiently get rid of obstacles. You will be mostly jumping small gaps, ride elevators, occasionally push some crates and look for keycards. The game manages a good balance between small puzzles (nothing too complicated, especially since you just got very few options so it becomes more or less obvious what you have to do), action and exploration. Thanks to frequent checkpoints even the annoying arena-fights become bearable, the same goes for Luftrausers-esque "Rocketbird"-sequences.\n\nWhat really sets the game apart from the competetion is the excellent realization of it's storyline. Rocketbirds is an excellent work of pulp fiction, a revenge saga that easiley manages to pull off a tough as nails Chicken mercenary starting a revolution by fighting off fascist pengiuns and doing so with maximum grindhouse-style. The game is actually quite dark, with a good portion of toilet humor thrown in for ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and giggles. Intermissions and cutscenes feature some very catchy synthpop/rock-tunes that give the action some kind of musicvideo-flavour that I found quite refreshing and entertaining. And the realization of nuke-silos, pengiun blimps, torture-rooms in P.O.W.-camps is quite excellent. I am pretty sure Rocketbirds would have been a fun graphic novel if it hadn't become a videogame.\n\nOne thing that's also worth mentioning is the lovely "faux 3D" effect this game has, using a weird shifting perspective on foreground-objects and making heavy use of multiple parallax-layers in the background. The result is downright beautiful - it unfortunately not always helps the gameplay and is reason for a lot of misjumps on my part, but man does it look good.\n\nSo, conclusion-time. If you love yourself some Flashback or Blackthorne gameplay-wise, this might be a good addition to your game library. I do think that the aesthetics and story (while not being partiuclarly clever or original) are presented in such a way that one could excuse the somewhat limited gameplay but I could see the very 90ies gamefeel not be appealing to everyone. Rocketbirds is mostly a style over substance affair with archaic gameplay, but bearing that in mind there is quite a bit of fun to be had with the hardboiled chicken even if you don't know the classics that obviously inspired this title a great deal.","May 18, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Basically every level is going to involve a new mechanic, including, yes, a stealth level (one that might actually leave you stumped on where to go for a bit) until midgame, when you begin repeating levels (hi jetpack stages).\n\nThe problem is, it does none of these things well. Apparently you needed a gun to punch men, as you learn when your weapons are confiscated and you can no longer perform melee moves. Some of the guns flat out suck, but you're going to get a selection of them by the end despite only wanting to use one or two because ???. Combat comes down to "crouch and fire/punch" with the occasional "stand up to shoot because someone is behind 'cover'" moment. Getting shot up? Walk offscreen and then begin juggling people as they walk onto yours because neither you or the enemy can shoot between screens, and this game is real bad about animation getting in the way of gameplay (see: the huge lead time/cutscene on brainbugs).\n\nWhen I started it, I was a lot more optimistic about the title, and then I kept playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CriticalPwnage/recommended/215510/","CriticalPwnage","=)EC(= Critical Pwnage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CriticalPwnage/","670 products in account","Tedious, clunky, and infuriating. It's a side scrolling shooter type game where you can juggle enemies by shooting them, but if you aren't quick enough the enemies can juggle you as well. There is almost no way to avoid getting juggled besides shooting first or hiding in the background in certain areas on a few levels. A total of six weapons can be obtained in game; three of them are simply better versions of the first three. Setting and story were somewhat interesting, but the Developers chose not to do elaborate on anything besides providing a basic background for the events of the game as told through music video cutscenes. The music is decent, not great though. It's some sort of British  Alt - Indie rock. Did I mention that the controls are clunky as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•? You move insanely slow, with awkward jumping and rolls thrown in to round out the crappiness. You also can't aim up or down, which is just as well since most of the time your enemies will be on the same level as you juggling you the second you come into view. The only things this game has going for it are the graphics, which are nice, and the jetpack sections which reminded me of Luftrausers. It's a shame a game called rocketbirds doesn't let you actually be a rocketbird most of the time.","January 25, 2015","false","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it is indeed similar, the graphic content of the game actually surprised and offput me a bit, and after awhile felt it was way over done just for the sake of being gory or graphic.  Characters are pretty stereotyped, though the animated cutscenes are well done, as is the voice acting.  The dialogue though is really stale for the main cast I felt, though the penguin henchmen you run into had much more amusing dialogue.\n\nGraphicsThe sprites themselves are very well animated (minus sliding boxes around), and the environments are detailed and lush.  The problem is the lack of variety, as you'll either be in a military base, blimp, or forest with the same similar backdrops and details minus a few neat areas that I wish were more prevelant.  Enemy types are also for the most part the same with different colored uniforms.  There are a few different enemy types but you really don't run into them long enough to notice, or they are a boss of sorts and are a one off sadly.\n\nControlsThe keyboard personally had a bit of a wonky control layout, but much more response while the controller (which you need to manually go into the options to enable) had better key layout but a weird sluggish feeling to it.  Also rocket levels are a nightmare on keyboard but much more smooth on controller.\n\nGameplayI have no clue how some of these mechanics were deemed okay and sent off to the final product.  Maybe I had extremely bad luck in the game, maybe the game just hates me, but beating this game is a bit like gambling.  You can count your cards, do all the math in your head in probability but it still falls down to that 5% chance that the game will have everything against you.  You cannot aim your gun.  You can only shoot left or right, crouch/roll jump and switch weapons.  Later you get neat little things called brainbugs to control your opponent and grenades but god help you if you even think of using anything other then your machine gun in combat.  Rolling does nothing to dodge incomming fire, and the only way to not be juggled around for 5 seconds being shot at is to pray the level designers put a crate (which they never do minus two or three times) or some sort of thing to hide in.  Or just shoot before they do unless luck decides it says no.  You will be put into near impossible situations such as having two enemies on either side of you with no cover, and friendly enemy fire doesn't exist, yet you can kill a penguin, juggle it's body while another penguin camps behind it and shoots through his friend's corpse and at you.  Walking into the next part can also result in death due to them open firing before you can even have the camera slide fully over into what's even killing you and can only hope the enemy is looking the other way when this occurs.  The puzzle element is more aggrivating than most, as you'll most likely need to brainbug and control an enemy (which is cool but the process involved is tedious) and flip switches or slide boxes around cause you're too short or fat.  Aiming the brainbugs is an incredibly slow process and the aim arch moves slower then water boils.  I want to add your grenades use the same mechanic, and also you can kill yourself with them too and make them impossible to use practically in combat as the enemy is either juggling you with fire or in your face punching you.  The only thing they seem to have gotten right is the rocket levels to which there are only three (with a name like Rocketbirds you'd assume you'd just jetpack everywhere, apparently not).  My only qualm is the keyboard control scheme and the fact the camera can have a mind of its own, zooming in close or super far out and you looking like a grain of rice.\n\nSoundDon't be fooled by the endorsed music.  The only time music ever plays is the title screen, cutscenes and very specific places in the game.  Otherwise you're left with the ambience of a military base or jungle with in-game chat sounding like two iron plates rubbing together in the slowest form imaginable.  Even the endorsed music kinda felt like your generic emo-ish indie fair, I personally didn't like it, but I'll leave that up to personal opinion.\n\nConclusionI never actually bothered to beat this game, as I'm on the last boss and just got so darn frustrated by all the stupid mechanics I ragequit.  Apparently the only easier way to kill that boss is to do the most obnoxious task of finding all the red flags achievement and being gifted a knife to kill it with.  I can't be bothered with that crap, and I'd rather actually play a game that involves strategy then play Russian Roulette.","February 6, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"

You are a rooster, or chicken (in co-op) and you are trying to save the general's daughter from the evil penguin empire.  My daughter and I played through the entire co-op and loved it.  Some parts can be frustrating, but overcome with patience.  The end of each level is very funny, because the daughter runs away after you save her each time, which really annoys the roosters.  The music is rock and will come in scripted parts of the game.  The game controller or keyboard set-up both work very well with this game.

Some of which is the fact that the game is just no fun at all. I dread opening the game and starting it up. I totally get what this game is trying to do, and that's awesome, but this game doesn't do it well. The controls just feel loose and wonky, certain parts of the game aren't as well thought out as they should be (namely the jetpack sequence), and the game presents no real challenge apart from frustratingly dealing with the game itself. For instance, when killing enemies, just crouch and hold the fire button until they die, because once you shoot an enemy for the first time, they get juggled and cannot break from it, giving the game no challenge. I will say, the music is alright, if totally repetative. If you want a sidescrolling game that is a parody/love letter to action films of the 80s, just invest in BroForce.","January 3, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's practically no story here, you are a hardboiled chicken hero who must liberate a land from Nazi penguins. The setting works well. The game itself is a side-scrolling shooter but there is a lot of emphasis on top notch animations, which don't necessarily spell better gameplay. Because there are a lot of animation frames dedicated to each action, the controls can seem cumbersome and unresponsive in a genre like a shooter.\n\nThe game also throws in some bullet hell sequences which are very exciting to play through. Probably the most exciting parts of the entire game.\n\nBUT the game itself is pretty forgiving (on normal difficulty anyway) so it's nothing game breaking. Also has local and online Co-op which I haven't tried.

(even allows you to remote control enemies with a 'brain bug")\n-The Jetpack combat scenarios are always fun.\n-The later non-jetpack game combat sequences are satisfyingly challenging\n\nCons:\n-Much of the game's combat is a boring frustrating slog of just spamming the shoot button. Especially the first half.\n-Game does a poor job at times explaining what exactly it is that you can do.\n-Later in the game you'll be ardously moving boxes around and this is arguably one of the worst parts of the game.\n-Some puzzles are head scratchers for longer than they are welcome due to something being unclearly presented.\n-Getting stunlocked in the harder combat sections\n-Not enough jetpack combat, nor enough variety in it. Its fun, but I felt like its poorly fleshed out.\n\nNuetral:\n-End boss is interesting, but easy.\n-Not being able aim up or down has always been something that has annoyed me in games like this, but I suppose its nessesary aspect of 'puzzle' games, otherwise a lot of the challenges might have been a bit too easy..\n-Game wont eat too much of your time, It took me about 5 hours to beat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mperor/recommended/215510/","mperor","M.P.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mperor/","663 products in account","Rocket birds: Hardboiled Chicken\nWell‚Ä¶ This one is weird: The gameplay is shaped like a 2D run-and-gun with a bit of platforming and Sokoban mixed in. It‚Äôs reasonably okay and the puzzles are simple enough to get around. The controls are a bit fickle, though, and and shooting, while somewhat satisfying, is hampered by the fact that the automatic weaponry completely locks up whoever is getting shot. That means that when you meet an opponent whoever shoots first wins - and when, later in the game, you end up being surrounded by enemies you‚Äôre gonna wind up cursing at the shooting mechanics a lot. There is a cover mechanic implemented, but I didn‚Äôt find it to be particularly useful due to the somewhat clunky controls of maneuvering - I mostly ended up rolling past enemies, only to get up and shoot them in the back.\nOverall, the gameplay itself leaves a lot to be desired - there‚Äôs potential in here, but it needs polish.\n\nThen there‚Äôs graphics and sound. The backdrops are mostly grey‚Äôish and boring (like: really boring), although the character designs, and the way birds are framed - from nazi penguins to the chicken prisoners - are amusing and work really well. Animation is notably stiff, but not in any way detrimental to the gameplay.\nI guess what the game does best is in the sound department: While the levels are notably devoid of music or ambience - with footsteps (and gunshots) being the only thing heard - the gameplay is interspersed with music videos retelling the story of protagonist Hardboiled to the alternative rock-sounding music by Austrian music project New World Revolution. At first, I thought it really odd and jarring to have the gameplay interrupted by music videos, but over time I actually grew to appreciate this as one of the best parts of the game. The videos are well animated and actually interesting, touching on themes like war and genocide in a way I surely didn‚Äôt expect!\nWhether my appreciation of the music videos says more about their greatness or the inferiority of the actual game, I‚Äôm not really sure about. Maybe both, because, honestly, it isn‚Äôt a very good game.\n\nAt select times, the game gets serious with the plot, but most of the time you almost forget it‚Äôs even there as you run from Point A to Point B to shoot penguins, pick up keycards, operate elevators and move boxes. And that‚Äôs a shame because I liked what little plot I saw - like the plot was balancing on the edge of an epiphany in its portrayal of war, sitting right between mature portrayal of the horrors and dehumanizing on one side and a B-movie featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger on the other.\n\nAlso, the voice acting is laughable - Hardboiled sounds like he doesn‚Äôt even want to be part of the game.\n\nIn the end, I‚Äôm afraid I really can‚Äôt recommend this game. I don‚Äôt say that lightly, as it is really, really close to being interesting. The cliffhanger ending even left me wanting more of the story - just with less of the actual game. This is a good story/bad game kind of situation - I hope Ratloop either work out their serious gameplay kinks or find another medium for their potential sequel.\n\nStill‚Ä¶ If genocidal nazi penguins sounds like your thing, and you can work past the broken combat system, there are things to love in here.","January 18, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack alone is also worth buying the game for, honestly I'm only writing this review right now because I came back to the purchase page to see if I could buy the soundtrack when it prompted me for a review. The storyline is amusing in that it doesn't take itself too seriously yet doesn't fail to re-create the character stereotypes you'd expect from the genre (think Stalone, Willis, etc.,.). Like all beat 'em ups, you have to have an appreciation for the genre, and an understanding of what it is and is not. This isn't going to be a 30+ hours game. It's not going to tug on your heart strings and weave a deep, lengthy, philosophical tale that makes you re-examine life and its meaning. It's not going to be particularly challenging mentally - this isn't Myst, but it IS going to be relaxing but not boring, beautifully designed, humurous at points, and fun.\n\n","December 23, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You, the nameless chicken, was captured by the penguin regime when small and brainwashed into being the ultimate commando, but on a mission, you were shock by the atrocity, and saw a younger version of yourself and reverted back to being on the chicken side. However, you are alone, and aside from a few resistance members, there is no help. But it doesn't matter... You will destroy Putzki, head of the Penguin regime, and end their reign of terror... or die trying (well, there's always reload from checkpoint).\n\nThe game is basically a platformer shooter where you need to jump, crouch, and otherwise shoot, ambush, and kill your way through the penguin army in your quest. As you continue, you gain additional weapons. You start with a trusty pistol, but you will soon upgrade to SMG, shotgun, and later, assault rifle, and you also gain the use of grenades and "brainbugs" that can remote control a penguin if you can get it close enough and have the penguin kill penguins for you, at least for a little while. The puzzles are bascially trying to get the keycards to advance to a different part of the map, and that obviously requires some backtracking, and crate stacking, and so on to allow you to access ledges that were not otherwise accessible.\n\nThere are "timed sections" where you fight your way through a penguin zepplin to the escape hatch, and that can get REALLY hairy!\n\nThe rocket fights are rather cute, as you basically control this rocket pack, which only has on, or off. You can control the direction, and if you turn rocket off, you go on inertia until gravity takes over. This can let you shake pursuers and shoot them full of lead as they fly by (i.e. the Maverick maneuver from Top Gun) . Penguins also have helicopter rocketeers who shoots guided rockets at you but if you fly carefully you can guide the rocket to hit an enemy instead before they self-destruct due to lack of fuel. Once you got everybody, you either land on the zepplin and fight through it, or you make your way back to the ground for more penguin destruction.\n\nThe game slowly introduces tougher enemies and the pacing is about just right. Long cutscenes between some levels setup the stage and shows the back history of the world and how it got to the present day. It is quite a bit of fun, and there's even a coop mode (which I didn't try). My only gripe is the timed sections being a bit too hard, even on normal. IMHO, of course.\n\nMay not be worth full price, but it's definitely worth trying if you like some action every once in a while.","November 8, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/215510/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a side-scrolling action game starring a former-experiment turned chicken mercenary (Hardboiled) on a quest for vengeance against the evil penguin empire. The art style is very cartoony but yields a sadistic undertone through various bloody cinematics and player actions.\n\nGameplay in Rocketbirds is vaguely reminiscent of the Oddworld series with encounters that resemble that of Another World. By which I mean: movement and aiming is a bit jerky and awkward and the game will often put you in a situation where enemies will be coming at you from both sides of the screen. In some instances these two factors can result in some very infuriating battles, but since the checkpoint system is so generous, you‚Äôll probably make it through after a few tries. Another neat thing the game gives you is the ability to mind control enemies with a throwable grenade-like device enabling you to use them to solve puzzles and remove enemies before having them remove themselves with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nTrue to the name, a good part of the game will be spent flying around with a rocket strapped to your back. These sequences are generally marathon sessions of spawn, kill, spawn, and kill again, but manage to still be fun as the controls are pretty good and you can do neat tricks like leading enemy missiles back towards them through clever maneuvering.\n\nIf I had to pick a downside with this game it would be the extremely short length coupled with the really bad voice acting (the latter was probably done on purpose). Though for the frequent sale price of around $2, it‚Äôs hard to complain!\n","November 8, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It controls wells, and has some interesting concepts, but it fails to be phenomenal.\n\nRocketbirds is a 2D platform shooter, with some other elements mixed in. The main combat of the game is not very satisfying, as the most difficult encounters just generally devolve into you quickly altnerating between shooting behind and ahead of you. The different guns really aren't all that interesting either. They just do more damage at the cost of more ammo, which is so plentiful that it's hardly a concern.\n\nThe most redeeming quality of this game is the mind control bugs, which allow you to control the actions of guards. This makes for some interesting puzzles, but they're ultimately pretty shallow. There are other segments as well, like flying, but ultimately, it doesn't do it as well as other games.\n\nThe story is passable, but nothing super interesting. Music is nice, but nothing Jaw dropping. This game just completely fails to excite. There are better games for $10.","October 25, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overall look, art direction, all of that just clicks.  Some of the voice acting and bird talking was a little jarring, but I think that might of been intentional.  The soundtrack was well executed and pretty good.  The general action felt just right, lightly frustrating, but easy to execute.  The gun action was simple, but was challenging at times.   I can see this rubbing some gamers wrong, particularly the younger ones who aren't used to sidescrolling action games, but all in all I felt this was a great game, and I'm hoping the sequel makes it's way to steam quickly once it's released on Sony's platforms.","May 7, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack alone is also worth buying the game for, honestly I'm only writing this review right now because I came back to the purchase page to see if I could buy the soundtrack when it prompted me for a review. The storyline is amusing in that it doesn't take itself too seriously yet doesn't fail to re-create the character stereotypes you'd expect from the genre (think Stalone, Willis, etc.,.). Like all beat 'em ups, you have to have an appreciation for the genre, and an understanding of what it is and is not. This isn't going to be a 30+ hours game. It's not going to tug on your heart strings and weave a deep, lengthy, philosophical tale that makes you re-examine life and its meaning. It's not going to be particularly challenging mentally - this isn't Myst, but it IS going to be relaxing but not boring, beautifully designed, humurous at points, and fun.\n\n","December 23, 2014","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gun gameplay is really lame. There are only two planes that the guns fire: Standing up or ducking. If the enemy ducks and shoots, you are screwed 90% of the time. You cannot see the bullets at all, making shooting even more frustrating. There is no way to avoid bullets if the enemy is ducking while shooting.  You can only do one thing at a time in this game. You can either move, jump, or shoot. No combinations. On top of this broken gameplay, the game is really boring and has poor sound design.

At first that may seem to be social commentary, but  fact, most of the cutscenes are just watered-down cliches from various war films. The story is ONLY there to give reason to your extermination of the penguin general population. And what an extermination it is. The gameplay, despite a few issues (Why can't the mouse be used to AIM my weapon?) is solid, and it's great fun slaughtering large numbers of fowl. It doesn't look half bad, either. The art is phenomenal, and the psuedo-3D levels, backgrounds and characters are well designed, having an almost comic-book feel.

It controls wells, and has some interesting concepts, but it fails to be phenomenal.\n\nRocketbirds is a 2D platform shooter, with some other elements mixed in. The main combat of the game is not very satisfying, as the most difficult encounters just generally devolve into you quickly altnerating between shooting behind and ahead of you. The different guns really aren't all that interesting either. They just do more damage at the cost of more ammo, which is so plentiful that it's hardly a concern.\n\nThe most redeeming quality of this game is the mind control bugs, which allow you to control the actions of guards.

There are other segments as well, like flying, but ultimately, it doesn't do it as well as other games.\n\nThe story is passable, but nothing super interesting.

But as soon as you get into combat you'll realize that there's nothing to it. All you can do is shoot (while standing still!), jump (no use in combat), crouch (absolutely mandatory) and hide in some rarely scattered secondary-z-layers of the level ... which again is nearly useless.\n\nControls overall are a little slow or even delayed, which could be due to gamdesign. But in a game whose combat system focusses on shooting, it rather causes frustration than immersion. And the story appears nearly absent so far.\n\nI have now pushed myself for some 5 to 6 hours into the game (in offline mode, therefore not equal to my registered playtime) and I am still failing to find the fun in it. I do not recommend this game. Sorry.\n\nThe intentions were good, the trailers convinced me, but as long as there's no fun in gameplay, you're missing the whole point of playing a game.\n\nThe only upside: The rocket-missions.

It largely consists of mundane platforming and shooting enemies, even the weakest of which are bullet tanks. The story is more of an outline than anything else, and never engrosses the player. The level designs run out of new ideas a third of the way through the game, which is to say an hour in. The voice acting is terrible.\n\nThe music is obnoxious. Many people seem to enjoy the song stylings of the band featured in the game, but I was not one of them. And if you find that you are not a fan of their sound, then Rocketbirds will be a chore to get through. Cutscenes typically consist of nothing but loud music, and gameplay is set to 20 second snippets of songs that run on a loop, with a default volume that makes it louder than anything else going on. This might even be okay if the music were purely instrumental, but there are very often lyrics that have nothing to do with anything happening in the game.\n\nRocketbirds is short, but not sweet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thehungrywalrus/recommended/215510/","thehungrywalrus","fishing boy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thehungrywalrus/","162 products in account","Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a run-and-gun platformer with Naz- I mean penguins and other birds.\nThe Gist of the Game:\n\nThe game itself is fairly short, running around 3-4 hours without much exploring for achievements. You play as Hardboiled Chicken, a chicken hell-bent on defeating the penguin regime. Throughout the game, you uncover the secrets of the regime and the life of Hardboiled Chicken. After Hardboiled Chicken is imprisoned by the regime, it's your job to team up with the revolutionaries and defeat the regime.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game progresses by using levels. The 15 levels in the game are puzzle-based, which works well for most of the game. However, on later levels, backtracing your steps to solve puzzles becomes tedious. Although, it feels good to finally complete a puzzle you struggle with. Throughout the levels, you pick up various guns to take out enemies with. As the game progresses, you get a good feel for what guns works best in situations you are given. There three "jetpack levels" where you use your infamous jetpack to fly through the air and defeat penguins in order to access zeppelins that belong to the regime. These levels are enjoyable and are a nice break from platforming when you need one. The levels are all linear for the most part, as you may have guessed. When it's all said and done, there's not much replay value except going for achievements; yet that is expected. It's a lighthearted and fun platformer that is easy to pick up and play.\n\nOverall, I'd give the gameplay a 7.5/10\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics in the game are somewhat simple yet pleasing to the eyes. The artwork is enjoyable throughout the game. It helps with the immersion of the game, if you call it that. Each background throughout each level contains little details that are very satisfying. In the settings, you are able to set the game in 3D, which is cool if thats your type of thing. This plays a part with the 3D design of the levels. As you play through levels, walls and holes are able to be seen as the screen slightly rotates. It is hard to explain, but as you walk, you are able to see another side to a building, ledge, or even tree. The graphics are simple but nailed right on the spot if it's something you prefer.\n\nOverall, I'd give the graphics a 9.5/10\n\nControls:\n\nThe controls feel clunky at times. When hopping from ledge to ledge, it can begin to be frustrating trying to grab hold of one. When pushing boxes, controls don't feel as smooth as they should be. The controls aren't too bad, yet they can be infuriating at times. During jetpack levels, controls feel smooth and great. However, during combat while platforming, the game falls a little short. Switching between weapons is easy, yet taking cover, crouching, and rolling are cumbersome to sum up. I personally played with an Xbox 360 controller. I would imagine that playing with a keyboard would be more frustrating. The controls don't make the game unplayable, but they hinder gameplay at times.\n\nOverall, I'd give the controls a 7/10\n\nStory & Characters\n\nThe story of this game isn't a deep one, yet it is a good one. Hardboiled Chicken wants his revenge on the penguin regime. He attempts to infiltrate their headquarters, but it caught and thrown in prison. He meets another bird who is part of a group of revolutionaries. Together, you and the revolutionaries progress to finally overthrow the penguin regime. The characters are insanely loveable for some odd reason. I can't get enough of the different penguins, chickens, and other birds throughout the game. Their dialogues can be funny and even cheesey, yet I can't get enough. For a lighter platformer, the story and characters in this game are amazing. The story could be a tad deeper if the game was longer. However, for its length, the story felt just right. I would love to see more Rocketbirds characters put to use! They're just chockful of character. and likeability.\n\nOverall, I'd give the story a 9\nI'd give the characters a 10\n\nPrice:\n\nI got the game in a bundle, so paying $2.99 for this and several other games was a steal. The game's regular pricetag of $9.99 seems a bit too lofty in my opinion. The game just falls too short for that pricetag. I would recommend picking it up during a Steam Sale.\n\nSo all-in-all, Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a fun little platformed that you either absolutely love, hate, or have a love-hate relationship with. Overall, I'd give the game itself an 8/10. I would absolutely love to see more Rocketbirds games with more characters, longer playtime, and more of a story!\n\nPlease note that I havn't played the co-op mode at all. I would love too though. If anybody wants to play co-op just add me and we can play.","April 5, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all I have to say that this game looks brilliant, it has really good graphics and some kind of weird 3D movements in the background which is nice. Gameplay is smooth, I use keyboard and mouse and I haven't encountered a problem yet. It has puzzles, action and comedy in it. Oh I almost forgot, I wish they had a soundtrack DLC because musics in the cutscenes are seriously good. I bought it when it's on sale and I'm actually blown away by this game, I just gave break to write this review.\n\nPros:\n+Good Graphics\n+Smooth Gameplay\n+Epic Musics/Cutscenes\n+It has a good Co-Op that you can play with your friends\n+Puzzles are the way they should be.(Not too hard but not too easy.)\n+It has a comedy mixed storyline\n+You can be a jetpacked chicken and shoot penguins [10/10 Best game]\n+You can mind control penguins by a farting bug [78/45 eggs GOTY]\n\nCons:\n-Addicting\n-When you mind control penguins they usually talk to eachother and I actually feel bad killing the other one by using his friend. :/\n\nConclusion:\n\nReally nice game, haven't had this much fun for a long time.

You, the nameless chicken, was captured by the penguin regime when small and brainwashed into being the ultimate commando, but on a mission, you were shock by the atrocity, and saw a younger version of yourself and reverted back to being on the chicken side. However, you are alone, and aside from a few resistance members, there is no help. But it doesn't matter... You will destroy Putzki, head of the Penguin regime, and end their reign of terror... or die trying (well, there's always reload from checkpoint).\n\nThe game is basically a platformer shooter where you need to jump, crouch, and otherwise shoot, ambush, and kill your way through the penguin army in your quest. As you continue, you gain additional weapons. You start with a trusty pistol, but you will soon upgrade to SMG, shotgun, and later, assault rifle, and you also gain the use of grenades and "brainbugs" that can remote control a penguin if you can get it close enough and have the penguin kill penguins for you, at least for a little while. The puzzles are bascially trying to get the keycards to advance to a different part of the map, and that obviously requires some backtracking, and crate stacking, and so on to allow you to access ledges that were not otherwise accessible.\n\nThere are "timed sections" where you fight your way through a penguin zepplin to the escape hatch, and that can get REALLY hairy!\n\nThe rocket fights are rather cute, as you basically control this rocket pack, which only has on, or off. You can control the direction, and if you turn rocket off, you go on inertia until gravity takes over. This can let you shake pursuers and shoot them full of lead as they fly by (i.e. the Maverick maneuver from Top Gun) . Penguins also have helicopter rocketeers who shoots guided rockets at you but if you fly carefully you can guide the rocket to hit an enemy instead before they self-destruct due to lack of fuel. Once you got everybody, you either land on the zepplin and fight through it, or you make your way back to the ground for more penguin destruction.\n\nThe game slowly introduces tougher enemies and the pacing is about just right. Long cutscenes between some levels setup the stage and shows the back history of the world and how it got to the present day. It is quite a bit of fun, and there's even a coop mode (which I didn't try). My only gripe is the timed sections being a bit too hard, even on normal. IMHO, of course.\n\nMay not be worth full price, but it's definitely worth trying if you like some action every once in a while.","November 8, 2015","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/215510/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a side-scrolling action game starring a former-experiment turned chicken mercenary (Hardboiled) on a quest for vengeance against the evil penguin empire. The art style is very cartoony but yields a sadistic undertone through various bloody cinematics and player actions.\n\nGameplay in Rocketbirds is vaguely reminiscent of the Oddworld series with encounters that resemble that of Another World. By which I mean: movement and aiming is a bit jerky and awkward and the game will often put you in a situation where enemies will be coming at you from both sides of the screen. In some instances these two factors can result in some very infuriating battles, but since the checkpoint system is so generous, you‚Äôll probably make it through after a few tries. Another neat thing the game gives you is the ability to mind control enemies with a throwable grenade-like device enabling you to use them to solve puzzles and remove enemies before having them remove themselves with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nTrue to the name, a good part of the game will be spent flying around with a rocket strapped to your back. These sequences are generally marathon sessions of spawn, kill, spawn, and kill again, but manage to still be fun as the controls are pretty good and you can do neat tricks like leading enemy missiles back towards them through clever maneuvering.\n\nIf I had to pick a downside with this game it would be the extremely short length coupled with the really bad voice acting (the latter was probably done on purpose). Though for the frequent sale price of around $2, it‚Äôs hard to complain!\n","November 8, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a bad game. Actually, I'd recommend it as a good action platformer (with some unfortunate puzzle elements). However: the areas with waves of enemies in a locked room are broken, with enemies being "human" (penguin) shields to your bullets but not to each others. I kept getting killed by enemies that were behind other enemies who could shoot past their allies but I was instead shooting the dead, juggled bodies of their allies instead of them. Also, the jetpack sections are a mess, with a huge zoom-out effect and screen scroll every time new flying enemies appear, making it harder to see the ammo or health pickup you were aiming for or the rocket that is still chasing you (fired from a previous enemy) that you're still expected to avoid, even if both you and the rocket are off screen. Both the waves of enemies and the jetpack sections checkpoint frequently, so they become a battle of attrition rather than skill. These two sections are also where the game showcases its' soundtrack. Short sections of uninspired music looping endlessly. On first hearing at the title screen, it got me in the mood for an action game. But repetitively looped in frustrating, cheaply designed action sequences (the waves and the jetpack), both these sections and the one to two verse or chorus songs had both gameplay and music making each other worse. There are also some ridiculous puzzle sections involving playing around with box stacking and elevators that do nothing but artificially lengthen the game. One section had me chase an enemy up a set of elevators, back down, and then back up again, requiring a floor change at each of about six floors on the first two of those runs. I was not amused.\n\nOther than the above, quite an enjoyable game. But if the come out with a sequel, I will not be buying it, given the amount of cheap time-lengthening and unbalanced gameplay of this game. That, and the story of "Rocketbirds: Hardboilded Chicken" (what there is of it) would hardly support two or more games.\n\nI doubt I'll play this game again, because there's no way I'm putting up with that nonsense again.\n\nOh, and if you get stuck on how to proceed, like I did numerous times (minor SPOILERS), the answer is ALWAYS one of: run past it, use one or more crates, or control an enemy through brain bugs. Don't expect the puzzles to be deep, or you'll just end up confused.","September 27, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Jumping is painfully stiff) and to top it all off the "extra objectives" require you to backtrack from the middle to end of the level all the way back to the start, and may even require you to restart the level from way back since you had to keep a specific enemy alive in order to reach a marker (there is zero indication of which enemy you aren't supposed to kill until it's too late).\n\nAlso the soundtrack blows.","September 15, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if this goes on sale, it's not really all that fun. The basic run and gun that makes up a majority of this game isn't done in a way that makes it interesting to play, and the motions and pacing are a chore to get through. There are some "puzzles" that mostly entail a lot of backtracking, and aren't very clever in their implementation. Most of the actions you can perform end up feeling rather stilted, making it feel clunky to control. And finally, the writing is very poor, without much heart or wit. Finally, the main boss ends up not having any music, making for a fight with no redeeming qualities.","September 19, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Except we couldn't hear a word either of them was saying, because the designers decided that playing their "badass" rock soundtrack over the image of two characters talking was more important than any actual context or storyline.\n\nI mean, it's not like a game needs a story to be good. But if you're going to waste my time with two characters talking, at LEAST have them say something. Is this hard to understand? I don't think this would be hard to understand.\n\nThat's what I thought, anyway, until the second cinamatic, where characters DID communicate. They managed to say exactly nothing about anything, except that they're going to try to kill me. I don't really know why. I guess I was infiltrating their base?\n\nHonestly, maybe they explained this in the first cinamatic. I skipped it because I didn't feel like watching two people talking without dialogue.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, you move forward and you shoot guys. Note I didn't say you have to aim, because you don't. And you don't have to move strategically -- forward is the only direction you have to move.\n\nIt takes like 10 bullets to kill an enemy. This is probably because the game would be way too short if it took one bullet to kill an enemy.  I couldn't say for sure, though, because in the 8 minutes I actually decided to play this game, I couldn't think of a single reason to keep going.\n\nMaybe it gets good at some point. I figured my time was too valuable to waste time finding out.","September 11, 2014","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first that may seem to be social commentary, but  fact, most of the cutscenes are just watered-down cliches from various war films. The story is ONLY there to give reason to your extermination of the penguin general population. And what an extermination it is. The gameplay, despite a few issues (Why can't the mouse be used to AIM my weapon?) is solid, and it's great fun slaughtering large numbers of fowl. It doesn't look half bad, either. The art is phenomenal, and the psuedo-3D levels, backgrounds and characters are well designed, having an almost comic-book feel. Finally, the coop is amazingly fun, despite having to load every other level and have Hardboiled stare you down for about forty seconds while it loads. In the end, though.. the game's upsides shine through the bugs.\nA final word:\nThe only good kind of penguin is a dead penguin.\n8.5/10","May 19, 2013","true","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not that it's bad.  But it IS simple*.  And quite short.  TOO short.\n\nAt first, Hardboiled's (that's the character's name) animations seem choppy, which makes movement seem choppy, which it actually isn't.  It's weird.  Hard to explain.  And then there are the jetpack levels, which are buttery smooth.  Both are fun in their own way, but the jetpack aspect of R:HC in particular bears the distinct mark of unrealized potential.  Now that I think about it, the potential fun of the grenade and mind-control elements weren't exploited nearly as much as they should have been, either.  While these ARE essentially criticisms, they also suggest that any expansion packs or sequels could be fairly great.\n\nAnd I never thought I'd say this, but one missing feature I'd like to have seen is the option to turn off the blood and gore.  There's a younger age group the art style and relatively simple platform-type gameplay would appeal to, were it not for the more adult violence.  Honestly, as silly as the game is, the blood almost feels out of place anyway.\n\nIs Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken worth $10?  For me, no.  Would it have been worth $3?  Sure.  Why not.  On payday.\n\n\n*Simple, except for the signs.  Tagging each of the three hidden signs in each level can be quite a chore, if not also mind-bendingly difficult.  Hope you enjoy re-backtracking through emptied stages.  BUT collect them all and you'll unlock... a meaningless achievement.

You might think it‚Äôs a shooting game, but really it‚Äôs not. There‚Äôs about two really nitty gritty fights where they toss enemies at you, three or so rocket pack fight sections, and a final boss. Other than that shooting is pretty much getting the first hit, or dodge rolling to go and get a first hit.\n\nThat said, the platforming puzzles can be pretty decent. Nothing to write home about, but with its design, setting, and music it makes the game enjoyable for the most part. IF they do a sequel I think the game could be polished up to be something even more memorable.\n\n","February 9","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lazatoy/recommended/215510/","Lazatoy","Lazatoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lazatoy/","46 products in account","Review: RocketBirds: Hardboiled Chicken\nWhat Is It?RocketBirds is a cinematic platformer with shooting and jetpacks, with one of the most gleefully absurd premises I've ever seen for a game, in which you play as Hardboiled, a rebel penguin (with a bad past) trying to destroy a penguin nazi army. Players will be shooting penguins, blowing them up, using bugs to control their minds, and chasing after the 2 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s that started this whole situation.\n\nThe High Points (pros)The first thing I noticed about Rocketbirds can be found in the above summary: it's really strange, but in a way that works for what the developers were trying to acomplish. The controls are great, and work well on both K+M and a GamePad. This game also has some pretty funny dark humor, which is scattershot throughout the game. The levels are varied in cool ways, and... holy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, this game looks AMAZING! The visual style the developers were trying to go for here works, and excellently. The flying segments are loads of fun, though I personally recommend using a keyboard and mouse for them. Finally: the music. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but in my honest opinion, I believe it fits the games tone and feel without a cheap feeling, and is full of cool remixes of previous songs on the soundtrack. The final thing to note is the Co-Op. It's fun, and works greater than I expected.\n\nIn Summary:\n-Strange and absurd, but fantastic premise\n-Great controls\n-Dark Humor\n-Varied Levels\n-Amazing Visuals\n-Flying Segments\n-Great Music\n-Co-Op Mode\n\nThe Low Points (cons)The biggest flaw about RocketBirds I have is simple: the platforming is a bit sluggish, and the jumping doesn't feel much better. The flying segments may be fun, but not if you use a GamePad. Also, speaking of GamePads, from what I've heard, if you're using an Xbox One controller, you MAY run into a few issues, like the GamePad not working properly. Another thing to note is simple: this game is nothing new. It does not re-invent the wheel, which isn'd bad, but the way it re-uses said wheel could have been better. The game is short, but, this is more of a nitpick than an issue. This game tries to have puzzles, but, all they ammount to are: a) use brainbug on enemy, make him do something, and b) move crates. This gets annoying after a bit. Finally, the final boss. On easy, you'll be doing it over and over again... on Hard, it's easier! This is odd.\n\nIn Summary:\n-Sluggish platforming and jumping\n-Xbox One controllers have issues\n-Flying Segments feel clunky on GamePads\n-Nothing new here\n-Repetitive, easy puzzles\n-Final boss is easier on Hard mode for some reason\n\nIN CONCLUSION (verdict)Rocketbirds is an... interesting game. It's absurd premise and dark humor work well like the devs intended, and the visuals are excellent. The flying segments are fun (not on Gamepads, though), as well. However, as a platformer, its a bit dull. If you skip this game, you're not missing much as there's nothing really new here. While it is flawed, and certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea, I really enjoyed Rocketbirds despite it's flaws, even when I first played it's demo back when it was first released on the PlayStation 3. Is it good? Maybe, if you're willing to give it a shot knowing the issues firsthand.\n\nFINAL GRADE: B-","May 18","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
