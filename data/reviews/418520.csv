Just like the videos show, you can create rooms, trees, mountains, and everything your mind can conceptualize and then zoom in and out to add unreal levels of detail. The demo videos showing a tree-within-a-tree-within-a-tree isn't exaggerating slightly: it really has about 6-7 levels of "trees" in their demo scene.\n\nThe most fun I had with this was sampling the multiplayer (still in beta, but coming soon). Fire up a team Skype call, launch multiplayer, and we collaborated on a work project, where everyone was "drawing" all over every surface like they were 3D whiteboards. You could watch your teammates as they drew Godzilla-sized in the air over your heads, while you marched around the front of your sculpture like an ant. We could see, in real-time, every stroke of everyone around us, and designing levels where you actually DRAW the levels together was a blast. (Don't forget to save often so you can pull up the work later on your own single-player world and review all of your collaboration from the comfort of your own room.)\n\nWhere a picture paints a thousand words, this tool explodes that by an order of several magnitudes. The concept was simple, but incredibly well-executed. If you're queasy around heights... you may want to keep your feet planted on the ground for this one.\n","April 4","true","14.6"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/D-Vive/recommended/418520/","D-Vive","D Vive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/D-Vive/","44 products in account","SculptrVR is uniquely great. It is a much more powerful experience than Tilt Brush which seems comparable at first glance.\n\nIn SculptrVR you get a sense of volume in the space right away with even the default ball of voxels. The ability to scale and teleport gives you the ability to change your perspective in a big way.\n\nThe most telling thing is that my daughter made an entire island in SculptrVR as the first thing she ever did in the Vive. She made a hut with a bed, a pool, a boat and waves. Then she'd walk around in them and acted as if they were completely real.\n\nIn Tilt Brush she made flat drawings vertically in space and labeled them with names. That was despite having seen people use Tilt Brush on youtube and being very excited about building a house.\n\nTilt Brush just isn't quite set up for her to be immersed in the environment like she wants (and SculptrVR is). I had to lift her up to let her finish the head and hair on one person. She did draw herself a portal and stepped through it when it was time to quit though, so that was cool.","April 14","true","74.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

I've dreamed of an app like this for a while now, so it's not surprising that it kept me busy for several hours. However, in case the developer is open for suggestions, there are a couple of things that can be addressed:\n\nThere aren't very many options for tools; just sphere, cube, rocket, spraycan, and this one projectile-orb thing that I can't get to work (plus their eraser equivalents). I could think of a few tool ideas right off the bat that would certainly make building things faster (straight-line box fill, rectangular-prismic box fill, resolution of boxes in drawing spheres, cut/copy/paste, recolor, sunlight direction, bezier curve box fill, etc).\n\nAlso, there are only 16 possible colors for boxes, all of which appear to have the same color scheme as wool blocks in Minecraft. This is really one of my lesser complaints; I can understand if 16 colors is for memory-saving purposes, because I can tell the program was made with space-saving in mind. (I'm going to take a wild guess and say that every heterogeneous block is defined by eight smaller blocks, some of which might recursively consist of eight even-smaller blocks and so on.) Despite this, a color palette that allows users to decide which 16 colors are used would be nice.\n\nBecause this program is so new, I'll excuse these minor issues and say that I recommend this game, because let's be honest: creating worlds of vastly differing scales is an awesome and undervisited idea. I see so much potential as to what SculptrVR could become; in particular, I'm excited to see what you mean when you say "Game inside the scupted worlds" on the list of things that are coming soon.\n\nEdit: I'm not very good at actually writing reviews, so my bad if this was a little unfair-sounding.","April 11","true","32.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

I'm sure you do. You love 3D ? VR ? Minecraft ? Build giant and small scale stuff, full of details ?\n\nIt's all that and more. You can scale yourself as a giant to build mountains within minutes. Then scale down to carve tunnels and mines in it with missiles. And finally scale down some more to decorate your own personnal Moria with fine sculptures, so small that only you know they're there.\n\nAlso, multiplayer is coming. it's a no-brainer.","April 6","true","0.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It would be great to be able to then use these worlds in a game of some sort, so I can definitely see that coming one day either to ScultVR or another game like this. I would say that the price is way too high for the current state of the app, so maybe wait until a bigger sale to pick this up one unless you really love creating voxel art or environments.","April 9","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Being able to build at multiple sizes and scale yourself is amazing.\n\nA few suggestions to improve it:\n- Expanded color palette\n- Undo / redo shortcuts (tiltbrush does this with a left click on the trackpad\n- Visual indicator of scale (sometimes it's hard to know what size I was at when making something)\n- Block snap, at certain block size / scale combos the snapping is more of a hinderance than a help when it doesn't line up.\n\nLooking forward to seeing future improvements","May 3","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It's really easy to build things, and it's a lot of fun to see your drawings at different scales. Like, for example, you can sit on the ground and draw the frame of a cube at a tiny scale, then change the scale so it looks bigger than a house, and you're sitting on top of it. With this, you can create an environment very quickly by doing it on a small scale, and then see it around you at full size.\n\nDefinitely worth giving a try!","April 22","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
