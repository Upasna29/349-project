While the graphics are a little subpar and bland, the gameplay is brisk and the ambient music appropriate.  Surprisingly, the Steam Overlay is supported which is unusual for PopCap titles.  Overall, there is enough gaming goodness here to give Venice a positive recommendation.  For any action puzzlers out there, Venice is a good buy.","December 19, 2012","true","4.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It is a great game for at the office and having some time to play around. It is set in Venice and you put different objects through different spins and turns to get the object in its correct spot to trigger the end of the level. The graphics are basic. The gameplay is simple and easy to learn. A child would have alot of fun with this game. I highly recommend it for anyone ready for a good challenge and a fun time. This is a ideal game for any casual gamer!","April 1, 2011","true","8.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

That is about as close to the description of the gameplay mechanic as I can get. I have no idea how to describe it any other way.\n\nWith a bit more than 70 levels, Venice Deluxe does offer a few puzzling constellations challenging to think around the corner, in a manner of speaking.\n\nThere isn't much more to say. But it definitely is a fun game to play if you are patient enough to get every level down perfectly.","February 24, 2015","true","7.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Hit targets above base shooter; difficulty varies but tactics easily learned. No pressure, can stop & restart at will.  Good for relaxing & focusing on shooter & target with minimal stress.","December 11, 2013","true","250.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.\nORIGINAL, AS PEEGLES. HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.","September 14, 2012","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you fail to catch a symbol that didn't meet any hole and gets bounced back, you fail.\nThere are various powerups, but that's about all the diversity. Gets boring soon.","February 4, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolMu/recommended/3490/","SolMu","SolumnMushroom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SolMu/","132 products in account","Venice is a puzzle game from casual game company PopCap.  While the company is very familiar to many people, this game is not.  It's a hidden gem on the PC platform, and it has a harsh difficulty curve.\n\nThe game centers around Venice, Italy sinking into the waves, and it's up to you, as a random small-ish gondola, to save the treasures of Venice before all is lost.  It's a better story than Bejeweled, but not exactly AAA writing.  But, for what it needs to do, it sets the game up perfectly.\n\nIf you've ever played Luxor or Zuma, the game controls essentially like that.  Your objective is to match all of the shapes without letting any fall into the water below.  This is where the game can and will screw you over multiple times, by placing nearly impossible trick shots that rely on pin-point timing and accuracy.  It can get frustrating, but you feel a good sense of accomplishment after completing the level.\n\nThe music is up to PopCap standards, as it fits the gameplay very well, and adds to the atmosphere.  The visuals do the job, but show their age.  Not too much to the point of looking bad, but enough to notice.  I have a reoccuring problem with many of PopCap's games.  It doesn't detect that my graphics card supports hardware acceleration, even though it does.  I'm sporting an AMD Radeon HD 8240, and my old iBook G4 from 2005 supports hardware acceleration.  I don't get it, but the game looks nice even without accelerated graphics.\n\nOverall, I give this game my Seal of Reccomendation.  Pick it up if you want an obscure classic.  I'm not responsible for any hardware-related damage you may inflict upon your system.","August 13, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
