While I may beg to differ in some regard after playing this indie sci-fi horror first person shooter from Badfly Interactive (originally a mobile title released for both IoS and Android) set aboard a derelict space ship in the deep, dark outer reaches of space featuring Zombies - our favorite go to guys when the plains of first person shooting and horror decide to meet  - then yes I am inclined to believe so. Dead Effect might be a novel item to a person that has a) never played a first person shooter or b) never played a first person shooter set in space or c) never played a first person shooter set in space featuring zombies. Judging by the positive reception the game received on mobile I am inclined to believe that there is a deep, dark and cavernous chasm that exists between mobile gamers and console/pc gamers with very little cross over.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545417649\nAs a PC gamer Dead Effects premise will feel immediately familiar to anyone who has played DOOM or Dead Space (two infinitely better titles to invest you money in if you are a PC gamer). Granted both the above mentioned titles probably had about 3000 X the budget of Dead Effect but still if you are looking for an on-the-rails sci-fi-horror-shooter then you are best simply going with the above mentioned and giving this one a complete wide berth because in Dead Effect's opinion imitation isn't even the best form of flattery. It's just a dull, linear, garbage piece of corridor shooting that happens to be set in space featuring zombies. After reaching the third level in this tedious and laborious title I was asking myself "what the ♥♥♥♥ are you doing with your life?"\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545678926\nGeneric as ♥♥♥♥ and lukewarm as ♥♥♥♥, level design is repetitive with every single space/zombie trope being flung at the wall to see what sticks. The story (if you can call its cliches a story) sees your character who just happens to be a member of some elite unit awake from cryogenic sleep to find out that - oh the horror! - something terrible has take place aboard the ship he or she (you do at least get the chance to choose the sex) has been travelling on. Que much running around said spaceship (if you can call it running since it feels like you have moon boots strapped to your feet) shooting first, asking questions later. It also appears that your character must suffer from some upper respiratory disease because you can't run five feet before being totally out of breath (so much for being a member of an elite unit) which brings the game to a grinding halt as you shuffle about slower than a zombie missing his very own legs in order to regain your stamina back so you can at least move properly once again. To add insult to injury the game features no checkpoint system so should you end up dying five seconds from completing the level then I am afraid its all the way back to the beginning of the level for you. Yes this is the kind of game you will have to grind, grind, grind, grind and grind some more just to move forward. Not fun in my opinion.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545416430\nAt least if you are going for some sort of imitation then please try and make an effort. There is a certain pedigree when it comes to this genre after all. If you really are a sucker for all things pew-pew featuring long space corridors and the shuffling dead and you haven't had your fill yet then this generic piece of doody might just do it for you.

Trigger zombies.  Shoot zombie heads until they're dead, or you're dead.  This sounded great, in a Painkiller-esque sort of way... until I actually played it.\n\nThere is hardly any mobility, because the fights are almost always inside very short corridors or other zones and your character cannot jump over stuff that an 80-year-old grandmother with the flu could.  Yes, that's right, kids, it is 2014, and somebody thought a FPS WITHOUT JUMPING OR ANY REAL USE OF THE THIRD DIMENSION WAS GOOD GAME DESIGN.\n\nThis is not even Quake; this is Doom, badly done, with modern-ish graphics.  It's not as fun as Doom, though.\n\nThen let's talk about the guns and approach to game-balance.   Guns go bang.  Zombies get tougher.  Upgrade guns every level, so that guns still hurt zombies.\n\nThe magical upgrade system for guns between levels (because, gosh, pacing weapons availability throughout the story would take actual game-design skill) is lame and makes this feel like a title that was originally intending to be F2P, but failed to find an investor.  Especially the "gold" bit- that's a classic bit of F2P design (gold would normally cost Real Money, kids) but It is absolutely atrocious game design to need multiple resources in a SP campaign.  Seriously- if you don't want players to have gun X until Y point... don't give the players gun X.  Not real complicated.\n\nBut, to add insult to injury, the gun choices are perversely bad- not "so bad it's good", or "bad because it's part of a purposeful attempt to talk about an Idea" but bad out of sheer lazy programming and poor attention to detail.\n\nPistols might vary hugely in total DPS delievered per bullet fired... but the two pistols I've found thus far?  They have exactly as many starting bullets.  So, hmm, which one am I going to pick?  The one that will do 4000% damage for all shots fired, or the one that does 3000%?\n\nSeriously?  Whoever designed this couldn't be bothered to get balance even roughly done, or differentiate weapons correctly?\n\nThe list of these kinds of good-god-why mistakes is terribly long.\n\nHow about a UI where it took many random button presses to figure out how to merely switch guns before a mission?  How about the game awarding upgrades to weapons I didn't even have equipped?\nHow about having a "grenade" button that, instead of instantly throwing a grenade, does the same thing as pressing the Select Grenade key?\nHow about a plot so lame and incoherently written that I could care less?\nHow about playing a female character, and hearing male breathing the first time I used the Sprint feature?\nHow about "crouching" so low you'd have to crawl IRL?\nHow about the transition from standing to crouching having absolutely zero purpose in the game at all?  No accuracy boost, no stealthiness, nothin'- it's just a gimpy way to move around.\n\nLastly... the graphics are really sub-par.  Each element is OK, in a boring, done-that-been-there fake-looking High Tech kind of way.  The zombies aren't terrible or exciting, although they really  don't make any sense at all- I'm on some high-tech spacecraft, there are no trees... so, uh, where did all those chainsaws come from???\n\nThat said, the environments and level designs are very lousy.  They aren't invested with any emotional involvement and  the vast majority of the locations look exactly the same; until I got to the D-Tox room, I was pretty much just staring at the same bland sci-fi-ish corridors over and over, with heavy use of colored lighting instead of genuine attempts to create interesting spaces.\n\nAnyhow... if the gameplay wasn't terrible, I could have let the lousy use of art assets go; this wasn't a AAA title and I was expecting gameplay, not graphics, to be the show.  But for the record, it's not done well; the art assets are just fine, but the level designs are terrible and there is never a sense of Place about the vast majority of the ship, which makes the fact that gameplay consists mainly of doing the same encounters with the same zombie hordes, over and over again, that much more boring.\n\nCould this game be fixed?  Somewhat.  Issues with the UI, the concepts of balance for the weapons, etc., could be addressed.  The major issues are with the level designs, not allowing jumping in general, and the lousy plot; these things aren't so easily addressed.  Anyhow, I hope that the developers read this and, should they get the opportunity to ever make another game, take this critique very seriously- I do not mind if your levels aren't AAA-looking in screenshots, but you'd darn well better build a game that's actually fun, if you want to avoid a diatribe like this one from Steam raters and reviewers alike.","December 30, 2014","false","3.9"," 200 of 269 people (74%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","74","200","269","23","9"

Your best option then is to live up with player's expectations of the genre, plus surprise them with one truly good and well executed idea to deliver a great experience.\n\nIn Dead Effect, you are shooting zombies in a spacecraft. That's it. Many titles comes to mind like Doom, Dead Space and such. And for a reason. It seems that most of these games tropes has been collaged in this game, but with no to little inspiration. The level design is repetitive, the zombies aren't that exciting, and the storyline has a smell of deja-vu.\n\nBut let's say Dead Effect uses these fairly known genre elements to lay a great core mechanic on top of it? If only.\n\nFirst, your character moves a little too slowly (it glides actually since there is no footstep sounds), and can run just a few meters since he's apparently an heavy smoker. He also cannot jump so I suspect he or she's overweight too.\n\nYour character can carry two weapons, that are predefined for most of the story campaign : pistol + rifle or revolver + shotgun. But since all the weapons are suboptimal at first, and have a atrociously long reload time, you die often - or walk back all the corridors just to be safe.\n\nTo make things worse, Dead Effect does not feature a save game or checkpoint system, forcing you to restart the whole mission even if you die a couple of seconds before the end. You're in to grind your way to the next level, and it really feels like a chore.\n\nIf you want a better weapon, don't try to pick one, you'll have to upgrade yours or buy one during the intermission - explaining why you are collecting money while trying to escape.\n\nAnd here is the fatal flaw of the game. In my opinion, either :\n- you design and balance each weapon to provide player with variety, uniqueness and consistency (like Doom, Half Life, Fear, etc);\n- you can buy upgrades or upgraded version of your weapons in a marketplace (like Borderlands, Bioshock) to add the thrill of finding a badass one - at least for a couple of hours;\n- you can upgrade your weapons & gear using "spare parts" found in the world (like Dead Space, Shadowgrounds Survivor) to add the thrill of making tough choices.\nBut I personnaly find using a "pay as you go to upgrade your gear" too artificial and really non-immersive, especially when you're supposed to be alone, cut from civilization.\n\nI know that Dead Effect is a port from a iOS game, and uses micro-payements. But that's not an excuse for bad or inadequate game design. For the PC version you pay upfront, so, in way, you're supposed to see none of the monetization elements.\n\nSo, if you really like to shoot zombies, endless corridors and flat storyline, you can give this game a shot. A piece of advice : upgrade only your best weapon and be cautious of the grenadier zombies.","February 23, 2015","false","7.7"," 124 of 178 people (70%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","70","124","178","13","10"

For me the look and the intensity of this game was quite enjoyable.\n\nIn the past I've been quite dismissive of Early Access titles and this has been based on a few notorious titles and the comments of famous YouTube personalities.  It's not a perfect or finished game, but this is one title you don't have to worry about.\n\nThe game environment reminds me of Doom 3, and likely takes some inspiration from it. I like the graphics and it runs just fine on my old computer.  The sound and music are really good and contribute to the overall experience.  The voice acting isn't so great, but it's passable.\n\nAt first the game feels really slow, because it is not possible to sprint or jump; you move at one speed.  The zombies don't move fast either, but when hordes of them are coming for you, the experience feels tense.  If you let a couple of zombies get too close you're finished.  A lack of quick save and check points adds to the tension; you really want to finish each episode in one go.  If you die continuation is possible, but it'll cost you some in-game cash (don't worry, no micro-transactions or in-game spending of real world cash).\n\nThe game does have an auto-heal option, but one must play long enough to earn the right to activate this feature. It'll become clear this isn't necessary by that time anyway.  I recommend never turning it on.\n\nIncluded are 6 playable episodes, as well as 2 extra game modes, Survival and Biohazard.  Survival mode requires fighting for a specified time, and Biohazard requires defeating a fixed number of waves of zombies.  It's pretty clear from the most recent July 17th, 2014 update that these guys are hard at work.  Co-op and multiplayer options are expected to be included if the development team gets enough support and feedback.\n\nFor me the game was enjoyable.  I recommend it to someone looking for a gory, old school FPS experience.  Considering this game is made by a team of 5 guys, I have to say: GOOD JOB!","July 22, 2014","true","16.1"," 59 of 80 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","59","80","0","7"

First of all, it's miles ahead of the portable version, almost a different game. The fact that there are no microtransactions help you enjoy this as a wholesome product, albeit with a little bit of fair grinding.\n\nA good zombie game needs 2 things: good zombies and good weapons. While this is far from many AAA titles, the weapons in Dead Effect look and sound meaty enough to feel the punch of every shot, but don't expect spectecular quality of animations and sounds.\nThe zombies however are a whole other dimension, and are at the core of what makes Dead Effect so fun, as they should be. Despite the small scope of the game, it features quite a few types of enemies, each of which in its turn has its preset of behaviors, some of which are randomnly generated depending on difficulty. In other words: zombies are dangerous and unpredictable, and demand the best of your attention, reaction and situational awareness. The dodge funcion is in this game for a damn good reason. This, combined with the very much Doom3-inspired leveldesign, make up for a great immersive atmosphere of an ever-so-popular contaminated spaceship setting. There's even a small cheesy story that works well enough to glue the events together and give the player a sense of purpose in addition to a sense of place.\n\nIf I had to complain about Dead Effect, which would be stupid considering the price, I'd say some will find the grinding tiresome (althought there's not THAT much of it compared to other games of this type), and not much variety beyond the campaign and the survival modes. While admittedly true, these problems didn't stop me from finishing the game twice, and I'm sure I'll be going in for a third time on Hell difficulty where almost every zombie hit is deadly.\n\nIn conclusion, Dead Effect is easliy one of my best surprise purchases on Steam. It's like Doom 3 and Killing Floor had a baby that doesn't know much yet but already shows great potential for being its own thing. Big thing, hopefully.","January 8, 2015","true","25.5"," 60 of 82 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","60","82","10","3"

It runs for all devices on the Unity Engine. While the actual game for mobile devices turns out to be a so-called freemium game with ingame purchases, the PC version reounces this.\n\nIf the player follows the story, he will notice that it is highly cliché-ridden. He jumps into the role of either Gunar Davis or his female counterpart Jane Grey, who awakes from cryostasis sleep in 2045, a lot earlier than expected. After orienting themselves, the protagonist has to find out what happened on the ship. It does not take long and he encounters the first crew members, mutated into zombies, which can not wait to get their hands on the brain of him. However, one last survivor and coincidentally the german chief of medicine on this ship - Dr. Wagner - contacts the protagonist through a comlink of the suit. The player discovers that an experiement was going to happen, called "The Dead Effect" but adverse circumstances lead to a leak of the virus, mutating the entire crew on the ship and also seize already the health of the protagonist. Dr. Wagner also explains, that the ship is set to autopilot and on its course back to earth. A ticking time bomb that has to be neutralised by turning off the propulsion unit. But before that is possible, Dr. Wagner directs the protagonist into the medi-bed chamber to get rid of the health anomalies. Through this procedure the protagonist gains a bullet time skill and is now able to slow down surroundings and time itself. Dr. Wagner explains which steps follow after, but will the player be capable of saving the whole mankind or is everything not what it seems?\nClichés over clichés from various genres and games, but akwardly this creates a very fun atmosphere with the possiblity to tease out a smile of the player.\n\nGameplaywise, Dead Effect comes close to the genre of wave shooters. The player discovers room by room with a goal to fullfill and also huge waves of creatures to exterminate. For this purpose the player has the choice between different primary and secondary weapons and depending on what character was chosen, he starts with different weapons at the beginning. Collected money from levels can be used to either buy ammunition and grenades, new weapons or upgrade the current equipment. This is not necesseraly needed, since everything can be found on the journey through the ship, even upgrades if the player gets lucky.\nAs already mentioned at the very beginning of this review, Dead Effect is actually a freemium game. That means, premium currency - in this case gold bars - have to be purchased with real money on the mobile ports. Yet, the PC version got rid of this and gives now the opportunity to farm in different modes very quickly. Speaking of which; Dead Effect does not only contain a story mode, but also several different modes such as "Biohazard" and "Survival". Both endow the player with money and gold bars, depending on difficulty and length of waves which have to be successfully finished. Unfortunately, a Co-Op mode can only be found in the follow-up "Dead Effect 2".\nMed-Stations will heal the protagonist if needed and while discovering the ship and its not so friendly inhabitants, the player also stumbles over upgrade stations. With these he is able to upgrade different parts of the suit to either gain more health or to extend the bullet time plus much more. Every station is single use only, so it is highly recommended to survey the whole situation before the usage.\nSecrets inside the story can lengthen the gameplay a bit, for example destroying Secret Orbs or finding tablets, which also explain the background story a bit more. Finishing Dead Effect will unlock "New Game Plus" to play through the game again with the current armory and upgrades. Indeed an interesting way to create replay value for those, who already enjoyed Dead Effect. The game itself contains twelve missions each of them self-contained sequences.\n\nThe controls, in the case of this review played with a Xbox 360 controller, are better than probably expected from a mobile port. However, Dead Effect explains every control with keyboard and mouse keys though. If the player wants to play with a controller, he has to find out what button triggers what action or needs to scroll through the keymapping option in the menu. A pity but in depth nothing game breaking. Moving and looking around feels smooth and works perfect even with a controller.\n\nListens the player closely to the character e.g. when he breathes, he will notice that the developer could not decide for which character model they want to use use either the female or male voice. So it happens that the female character breathes heavily manly after a quick sprint or the male character panics like the female counterpart in the cryostasis chamber. Something that should not happen but after all the trashfactor works with it.\nThe voiceacting is okay for this title and even here it makes a feature of the trash factor, e.g. with the bad german accent from Dr. Wagner. Besides of this the sound effects are well made and the intro song is nice to listen to.\n\nTo cut a long story short, Dead Effect has a lot of clichés together with a great trash factor. But both points do not hinder the possibility to have fun while shooting through a horde of invested crew members to see their guts splattering all over the place. It is not worth the full price but if it is on a sale, Dead Effect can be recommended for having 3 hours of trashy fun!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nI have seen this game often on the android store in the "Recommended for you" section but never dared to play it, since I really abhor microtransactions. When I heared that the PC version would be different and there is no need to grind a long time for gold bars, I gave this game a chance. In the end, it was trashy and I smiled about every single cliché that came up with the progress I made storywise. For what it was, I think 5 bucks are too expensive and this game should be bought on a sale, if you do not want to regret it.\n\nStill, I can recommend it and if you truely want to support the developer for probably more content/games in the future, just go ahead and buy it!\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Solid mobile port without microtransactions\n[✔] Story+ mode plus two more different (wave)-modes incl. secrets\n[✔] Better graphics than on android and iOS\n[✔] Weapon Purchasing and Upgrading options\n\n[✖] Permuted sound effects of the characters\n[✖] Controls show off for keyboard and mouse, for controller need to scroll through keymapping\n[✖] Sometimes too many zombies in one room, grenade zombies can 1-hit the player\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw0U3akDTYg\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

You have your Slow-Mo Ability similar to Max Payne and graphics similar to Doom 3 which is kinda neat.\n\nThe Zombies themselves can only be killed by a headshot which makes things a bit difficult as they swarm you, so at times the game is pretty intense. and some of these levels can be difficult early on. You can upgrade your weapons that you find or buy throughout the game between missions. and play through a Survival Mode similar to Killing Floor choosing the amount of waves you fight. highest being 10 I think. Coop should be added in the near future so that will be cool. Got this for $4.79 and it was well worth it.

What I can say for this game is that it's cheap, although $5 is really the most I would pay for this game.  After launching the game I saw that it had an ok amount of options for such a cheap game but it seemed a bit odd in the sense that it was minimalistic looking yet not in a "modern" type way, more like a "cheap looking" kind of deal.  I started up the game and played the first story mission--the graphics weren't terrible and the sound was heavily based on bass trying to raise the tension.  After a minute or two it became painfully obvious that this is a port of a mobile game and it shows, even down to the "Tap to..." command prompts.  Not to say that mobile ports are inherently bad, but that they do need to improve with controls and input response when ported to pc.  The need to sprint is needed, especially when you have an enemy who has a machine gun and you can't make it to the next corner to take cover before they open fire again.  The "Tap to..." command prompts should go along with the obvious free-to-play model of slowly upgrading weapons in a now paid port (as opposed to the free to play iOS and android versions).\n\nSo in short, it's not a terrible game, but for a free-to-play game with a free-to-play design and mobile-reminiscent controls, five dollars is five too many.","October 17, 2014","false","0.4"," 58 of 89 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","58","89","0","7"

Price at about 1€ with discount, i just couldn't resist. Cool weapons and upgrades for them is what kept me playing. But i still had to force myself to beat the main story because i lost interest in it half the way through the game. I actually spent more time playing biohazard and survival maps. Getting gold and cash for wepons and upgrades turned out to be more enjoyable because chasing the "mad profesor" wasn't so much fun.\nRespawn option may be interesting because the game doesn't have a save option where you can reload in the middle of the level/mission, so if you get killed you can choose to restart the level or respawn at the nearest danger-free corner but you'll have to give away some of your precious game credits you saved for upgrades or else. Auto-heal option can be bought as an upgrade, it heals player slowly over time and makes the game more enjoyable as you can get killed so fast by speeding zombies when you turn your back on them or if you get too close and they jump at you. It's true, few types of zombies do jump at your feet, to polish your footwear or is it a foot fetish, do they even know? You even have a military dressed zombies who can headshot you with a hand grenade, probably ex NFL player, happens a lot, not a spoiler just a friendly warning. Those are some of the highlights...\nWhat always bothered me, level design is almost monotone. Same colors, walls, electronics... But of course, it's a space ship, probably economy class. I know games almost twenty years old, with better level design. So much for "New ideas"...\nTalking about slow... Everything in this game happens so slow, movement speed, throwing grenades, reloading, you're only allowed to die quickly. Time is relative and this game will basically trap you inside its realm with it's own time rules. While in reality everything looks normal, you've actually grown older trying to spend more time on low quality content this game has to offer.\nI recommend this game, i cleared the whole space ship from zombies, and now it's my... precious.\n","April 23","true","9.5"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","25","34","5","0"

My firends have heard me talk about it, I've posted screenshots & videos. I just can't get enough of this game. Even as early access it has so much potential. With only 3 levels I have over 40 hours played and the devs are planning so much more content. Play this if you like horror games and/or shooters.  It does have a heavy Doom feel to me (In a very good way, it doesn't feel like a rip-off), it really seems like something that ID would have developed. Of course it is early access right now so you have to accept some bugs like jump not working yet as an example. Of course I could live without the jump just saying know that it is early access and still pretty early in the development process. For the price you can't really go wrong, plus it looks like they will be adding multiplayer which will give it a whole lot more replay value.

You awaken from a Hybernation Pod to find the ship badly damaged and the crew seemingly dead by what appear to be zombified crew members. So far in the short hour I've played I found the game to be fun, if not predictable so far. Each level you complete gives you a review of how well you done with the option of replaying it. Hidden orbs and stashes are located on each level, and you pick up various weapons as you navigate through the ship. The credits you obtain while exploring can be used at the end of each level to purchase upgrades, new weapons and more. I look forward to seeing where the game goes with the story, as I only completed the first level and then replayed it for good measure.

While it does take a little bit of getting used to, it is playable, but it's mediocre in my honest opinion. The idea kinda felt like a Dead Space clone where you're in space, you have a navigator, and you have to fight of mutated or zombified humans. It's slow at first but gets more and more difficult as you progress. I've played maybe half an hour and I didn't seem all that interested. It get's stale and a little more difficult since the infected enemies can spawn randomly in areas you just passed to bring out the 'THE PLACE YOU CHECKED IS VISUALLY EMPTY OF LIFE, BUT I LIKE TO HIDE IN THE VENTS' kind of scenario.

You get tossed into an arena based level, full filling the objective listed in each mission. Before you head out the game offers you the opportunity to purchase and upgrade your weaponry. It's a very arcady FPS that knows exactly what it is and makes no illusion to it's identity.\n\nI wouldn't go into Dead Effect expecting a full narrative experience from games like Bioshock or Wolfenstian last order. The story is pretty bad, and the voice acting even worst, but where the game shines is it's excellent feeling run and gun gameplay. There is a fair variety of firearms to use, and they all feel great! Excellent visual and audio feedback on each shot, classic and challenging difficulty scaling, it's generic FPS done right!\n\nDead Effect has it's origins in mobile tablet gaming and the Steam version is basically an upresed version of the mobile original. They've done a pretty good job of upresing, as the texture quality is quite good, as well as the lighting, showing a good amount of visual fidelity. Where it takes a hit in the visuals is it's lower polycount models used, due to it being on mobile originally, and the menu screen has too much left overs from it's origins, with big unnecessary buttons. As far as visuals are concerned, it does a passable job as a PC port.\n\nDead Effect probably won't be the very best FPS you'll ever play, nor is it very original, but what it does it does very well. It's gameplay, though generic, is designed well for maximum entertainment in shorter burst play time. At it's price of $5 there's not too much to complain about. If you're looking for an entertaining but cheap action FPS, and don't mind it being some what flawed in comparison to it's competitors, Dead Effect is a very viable choice.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent feeling run and gun gameplay\n- Multiple game modes to play\n- Brings FPS back to it's roots of run and gun\n- More than fair asking price\n\nCons:\n- Unoriginal\n- Terrible voice acting\n- Left over Mobile UI","February 25, 2015","true","3.9"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","0"

It's very arcade-like, which is to say, there aren't a lot of frills. The campaign is fairly short, but if you want to collect all the upgrades and weapons, there's a decent amount of replayability.\n\nIt's rather refreshing in that the biggest threat is simply the number of enemies coming at you and they are almost never going to surprise you (they aren't stealthy zombies by any means, like in a "real" zombie scenario). Rarely (not never, mind you) was ammo an issue, and there's an upgrade you can buy that gives you absurdly powerful health regen, and at that point your only fear is getting swarmed because you literally can't kill the zombies fast enough, and you're incredibly slow moving yourself. I loved to hate the grenade zombie, which is exactly as terrifying as it sounds, because he's a zombie who can throw grenades that potentially one hit you, but he's fairly uncommon, easy to spot, and the ceilings have lots of underhangs for the grenades to bounce off and kill zombies for you, so he's not an unreasonable sort.\n\nAnyways, despite being early access, all the features feel relatively polished. I'm not sure how I feel about the distinction between money (which is hidden in levels, but not dropped) and "gold bars" (which are only dropped randomly by enemies). I guess it's nice to have a second currency that you can only buy a limited number of things with, but I just don't know if its really necessary.","January 7, 2015","true","5.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","1"

The game mechanics are poor, the controls are very limiting (especially the movement -- you can't f*cking jump), the cut scenes are obnoxious, the framerate is limited to 60Hz, the graphic detail is underwhelming even at so called "extreme" settings and the save points are far to widely spaced (you have to play a whole damned level to get a save).  Maybe they couldn't figure how to code anything better, my sympathy to them.

Would love to see this game more developed and on going!! Gives me the much needed gameplay I love from Black Ops II Zombies and mixes in nice weapon upgrades and game modes. I would love to see a more developed single player, the gibs head shots are the best. This game is heading in a fun great direction!!\nMore weapons (another melee weapon would be nice)! Grenade exploding effects, THE BEST!!! More levels and maps! More different zombies!! Game engine is awesome smooth gameplay addicting with earning bonus cash, random item pickups upgrades and gold!! Multiplayer would be wicked with customized skins and customized weapons and specials!! Just leaving feedback awesome job guys I can't wait to play more!!\n\nI would be playing this all the time if specs kept for all computer players to join in and mulitplayer coop and pvp!! Greatness!!!!\n\n\nFeedback on bugs and such controls!!\n--------------\nTheres a flashlight on the HUD but you can't use one? I tried all buttons checked out configuration whats that about? A working flashlight would be awesome!!\nWithout a flashlight way too dark some areas in game, like to see what I'm killing.\n*update I don't know if this was intended, but playing as the Male character profile is when the flashlight doesnt work, and lots of parts of the 3 levels and in Survival and Biohazard modes some parts in the levels are way way too dark and again no working flashlight, but playing as Frey the female character on her profile, the flashlight does work turn on and off, and the lighting is perfect way more lit up in more areas though flashlight still helps in dark spots. In saying this, the darkness is a challenge and if you could somehow see the difference in Males version game dark as hell levels, it's kinda neat darkness would be great and challenging if only the flashlight works.\n\nThe zombies fading away Blade like golden fairy dust, kinda cool but I felt takes away from the blood gory mess that sprays all over the cam love that effect!!! A dark burned dust away bloody mess would be nice..\n\nJump button please? love jumping... sprint would be awesome too, love sprinting :)\nsecret areas, doors, ala original Doom and Tomb Raider style?\n\nother then that perfection.. I need more I'm hooked..\nI hope you guys get the funding to finish and continue this game!!\nPlease open to open donations and cool weapons gifts for donating or something again!!\nPlease another update new maps levels something soon!!! arrrrgh!!!! this game is so good haha!!\n\n*new* also yah a seperate button that doesnt coincide with the weapons for the grenade would be awesome, and in harder modes especially maybe some small health packs throughout the hopefully new maps would help","April 20, 2014","true","33.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/286040/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Dead Effect is a story driven first-person corridor shooter set aboard a futuristic research vessel/station, where an accident suddenly turns the crew into homicidal zombies.  It is a very well made game enjoyable to play and satisfying to beat.  Essentially it is a free 2 play iOS port.  One of the few I have played that works well as a PC game.\n\nYou are part of an Elite unit awakened from hibernation to respond to an emergency aboard the vessel.  You can choose to take on the role of a male or female soldier the only difference being the starting weapons and the voice-overs.  Once armed you go up against a horde of zombie type enemies.  Your job 'as always' is to go from level to level and complete objectives in order to progress to the end boss.\n\nEnemies consist of several types of zombie: crawler, zombie, scientist zombie, soldier zombie, spitters and grenade zombies, plus a few specials which I wont mention and spoil for you here.  Combat against the zombies is one of the strong points of the game.  While they are only effective in packs and at close quarters, the badder zombies can spit venom or throw grenades which can be deadly from range.  Furthermore even though the zombies close distance slowly their strength is in numbers, especially when moving through the vessels tight walkways.\n\nAs you move along the infested decks of the vessel you will be able to collect ammo and grenade refils, and credits from the (un)dead crew.  In addition you can collect datapads with snippets of story to help explain the events which unfolded before you awoke.  Killing enemies sometimes provides valuable item drops such as gold bars, credits (i.e. in-game cash), new weapon unlocks or weapon upgrades.  Gold bars seem to be largely a remnant of its free2play days, which I suspect were gained largely through some sort of microtransactions.  Thankfully though these do not exist in this PC version.  Gold bars can be used to buy a handful of ultra-powerful weapons or an auto-heal feature which seems redundant for most players except for casual gamers.  Credits allow you to purchase or upgrade combat weapons.\n\nYou start with a basic 1000 volt stungun which is good when you fighting lone enemies.  As you play you get access to better weapons.  Even though you can only carry two types of firearm (1-handed sidearm & a 2-handed assault weapon) and 1 batch of grenades during a level.  You can switch between several model types between levels.  This limitation is quite realistic even if you prefer the old skool method of carrying an arsenal into combat.\n\nWeapons include different types of: handgun, assault rifle, shotgun, bows, energy weapons and a minigun. Melee lovers take note that there is a chainsaw weapon which you can get close and personal with the enemy but I found it to be the least satisfying of the weapons to play.  Whats even better about the guns is that they can be upgraded during play.  5 levels for each weapon that increase stats like: reload speed, magazine capacity, damage and accuracy.  New weapons can be purchased with the credits you collect.  By far the most satisfying weapons are the shotgun or the bow with exploding arrow heads! :)  You also get two special if limited abilties: Bullet time (slow-mo action) and Devastation (powerful strike eminating from the player).\n\nThe campaign consists of twelve levels ranging from short to long in terms of duration.  All levels though similar in the challenges and obstacles they provide are pretty well designed.  You will probably have to play through the game twice to complete the campaign achievements.  In addition there have been two modes added and play similarly to Killing Floor - Survival maps require you to not die for a number of minutes, while in Biohazard maps you must survive numerous waves of ever increasing difficultly.  There are around six maps for each mode.  These I found were adequate at best.  To be better coop is really needed here.\n\nOverall I found the gameplay and aesthetics (graphics & sound) were pretty good, setting the right tone that will remind older gamers of Doom 3 or System Shock [if you have played either].  The story while pretty standard does its job in immersing you within the setting.  Graphics for a port are really well done bringing a claustraphobic feel as you move around the vessel. While voice-overs (there are three one for each marine character and the only other survivor a scientist who guides you) are quite good for an indie game.  I did discover a very few minor bugs which were not game-breakers but these were fixed during my time playing the game.\n\nRock, Paper, Shotgun wrote that Dead Effect fails in its ambition.  After playing through the game I found that what the game may lack in terms of ambition it more than makes up for in immersion, and quality implementation and delivery.  In conclusion Id say so many games that come through Early Access fail to deliver, Dead Effect does that and more.\n\nFor the price its an easy recommendation.  Looking forward to the sequel.","January 21, 2015","true","37.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","2"

It's good in that it creates a more immersive environment, which is already a bloody, dark and foreboding atmosphere, but bad in that the acting is not very good.Graphically, the game is top notch. All the various locations you visit pretty much look the same, but I guess that's expected from an industrial spaceship. The zombies are nicely detailed, and the atmospheric effects are great.At its core, Dead Effect is yet another fun shooter featuring everyone's favorite reanimated beings. You won't find anything new, but it offers a decent challenge, and has some great replayability in survival mode and trying to earn all the achievements. If you're a fan of violent, bloody, horror themed games, you'll find a good distraction in this one.","July 23, 2014","true","10.4"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","1"

You may enter bullet time. But under no circumstances are you to engage a zombie in melee combat. Melee combat, like jumping, is strictly forbidden.\n- Space ships of the future constantly talk to you in a feminine and soothing - yet eerily robotic - voice and never shut up.\n- We will conquer FTL travel and initiate cryosleep in only 30 years!\n- It takes an elite female soldier only several seconds to begin panting for air after sprinting. And when she pants she sounds like a man.\n- In a world where FTL travel is possible, flashlights can only operate for about a minute or so before needing to be turned off and recharged.\n- Your interface will point you in the direction of your next objective, even if that means it runs you right into a wall.

They are not peashooters you find in most of the games - including the upcoming Doom4. The soundtrack on the background is athmospheric but the voice acting is kinda meh (read: amusing) - but I forgive it. I don't play this game with mouse/keyboard but with a controller and it's and awesome experience.\n\nThe zombies are "old school" zombies -- not those hyper modified Usain Bolt runners -- original zombies are brain dead and DE1 is loyal to it. The gameplay is relatively easy once you get into mechanics and weapons and your two skills. The grenade throwing zombies are sometimes annoying but when a grenade explode your screen slows down for a short moment. This is the point where you know there are grenade zombies around and you can anticipate and take them down eg. by using your bullet time mode skill.\n\nMy favourite map is Mission 5: Cargo Bay which I've been playing a-lot with the survival and biohazard.

But it suffers from awful voice acting that is honestly really funny, a basic story, and production values that aren't too high. However, at $8.00 you can't go wrong with this game.\n\nThere's a lot of guns to use as well, each with their own upgrade trees despite them being very basic and doing nothing to change the appearance of your guns. It's also very clear that this game was a mobile game of some type, with irritating minigames that range from QTEs to weird hacking puzzles that would be more fun on a tablet. The interface, the gold, and other "artifacts" clearly show this was some type of tablet game. I can't see a phone being able to handle these visuals, but I can definitely see a tablet doing it!\n\nThe graphics are quite good actually, and they remind me of Doom 3 but modified with higher resolution textures. There's a lot of options for PC gamers that are very welcome, including the coveted FOV slider, and there's really nothing much to complain about here. The sounds are satisfying and the music is decent, with a few standout tracks. The production values might feel cheap here and there, but there's some quality hidden in this little budget game!\n\nOf all the indie FPS games out there, I highly reccomend this one to the zombie slayers out there.

First off I'll say its a suprising little endevor. I rarely see such polish from games made by a small team. as i said before  there's tons of zombie games out there these days. Thankfully this is one of the best small dev zombie games i've seen in a long time.\n\nThe Good:\n\nEngaging story\nBeautiful graphics (for  a small dev game)\nintersting game modes outside of the single player mode.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nLack luster weak gun sounds (maybe it's something with how my desktop detects my 2.1 system  but none of the guns really rattle my woofer , in fact they sound like they all fire from the sats only. I got a 200 dollar 2.1 system  I want some BASS when I shoot. EDIT: as of to date, I have found a couple of guns that do thump nicely on my woofer. Especially the chain gun.\n\nGraphics occasionally slow down, while they are beautiful graphics they aren't so beautiful that they should be slowing my frames down. My system runs Far cry 3 flawlessly at max settings.\n\n\nOverall i give this game a 78%.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swenor/recommended/286040/","swenor","swenor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swenor/","805 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game = Doom 3 + Dead Space.\nHorror. Space. Zombies. Freaks. Weapons. Massacre. Action. Darkness. Hunt. Escape. Atmosphere.\nIf you like all above, then it's a perfect title for you.\n\nTrapped on a space station you have to find out what's going on and most importantly - survive. The story is ok. Nothing extraordinary, but it's a good excuse to lead you through several levels of sci-fi corridors covered in selective darkness. You have guns, ammo and flashlight - all you need to survive. There are 2 special abilities that help you survive as well as special stations that improve your physical condition. Mysterious? Sure, but I won't spoil all for you. The setting is excellent and execution is great. It's often dark. Maps vary from small to big. From short to long. From small to complicated. The surroundings are consistent across all maps - you are stuck in space in some installation, right? It all has metal and very industrial look, which fits the game perfectly, but every level is different and you don't have impression of visiting the same place over and over.\n\nWhat about gameplay? Kill all zombies with what you got. You don't need more. Just don't die from shambling freaks. Most of them are small slowly walking zombies, but that's not all. Ther are bigger weirdos and you have to wipe them out. All of them.\nIn terms of mechanics DE is a simple game, but gameplay is very enjoyable (unless you don't like the genre).\nWeapons look, feel and sound great. I like that guns kick back a bit. That's nice. Assault rifles, shotguns, pistols and... extras :D Models for firearms and enemies as well as their animations are above good. So is sound overall and graphical effects (slow motion, particles, dismemberment amon many). Music is excellent. Graphics is very good. Voice acting is convincing.\nI like the way they used Unity engine. It's versatile and the game has overall presentation way above good. Performance is nothing to be worried about. Key customization is good and there are TOGGLE options for Iron Sights (Zoom with weapon) and Crouch.\n\nSP story is one thing. Survival and Biohazard are a different type of gameplay. Survive till the end with some twists. Over the course of campaign and survival based modes you can earn money and improve your weaponry. Sometimes enemies will drop an improvement for your gun which is nice. There is a bit of grind tied to unlocking new levels of guns' performance but you won't play this game just one time.\n\nPROPS and THANKS to developer for supporting this game - they are doing a good job. They released recently a HUGE patch (1.3). It fixes several bugs and introduces features requested widely by community (FOV, mouse acceleration etc etc). That's not all - the same patch came with 6 (six) new sp maps and 2 maps for survival modes (and bonus special map for Biohazard mode). Now story offers 12 (twelve) maps which is awesome. I'm still waiting for promised coop modes (for both story and survival based modes). Overall as an Early Access this games presented a HIGH quality even BEFORE the 1.3 patch. I say YES to such approach to Early Access.\nBuy it!","December 13, 2014","true","31.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Oh boy, start was promising i have to admit that. I just completed the game, took me 4.3 steam hours and yet i still haven't got all steam trading cards. Dead Effect is so bad that devs really like to torture people and force to play long enough to actually get all steam trading cards.\n\nWhy do people have to make ripoffs of other games *cough* "Dead Space" *cough*. I mean really "Dead Effect"? Ripoff you say? Yes, title itself already describes it, don't you see resemblance? The game is in space and player is in space craft, there is nothing more to be said.\n\n- Story?\n\nI didn't care, since it is indie game.\n\n- Gameplay?\n\nShoot several types of zombies in space. That's basically it.\n\n- Zombies?\n\nThere are several types of zombies. Few walkers / crawlers, armored ones, ranged (spitter type) who spit red projectiles at you quite often and explosive / suicide type zombie with GRENADES, yah thats right 90 % of thrown grenades result you being dead, not to mention that nade has  huge explosive range. Because of this explosive / suicide zombie i experienced frustration, this zombie lacks suicide animation because when you come closer to him he will suicide with no animation instead you would think that he is going to throw another nade at you. Oh come devs why not just give minigun to all zombies instead for faster lose scenario, oh right, there is one zombie with minigun but he is suppose to be mini boss (not final boss) at the near end game. Of course chainsaw zombies *yawn*.\n\n- Combat?\n\nBasically every zombie close attack is the same. They start to rush toward you then duck and hit, not even it gives you more frustration but that with each attack you get knocked back and messes up your aim. What's with the KNOCK BACK HITS?\n\n- Misc.\n\nI don't know why but for some reason player gets pushed away from some objects such as boxes / crates and corners.\n\n- Overall\n\nThere is one positive feature that i actually liked, collect credits, buy and upgrade weapons. In my opinion game still needs changes and updates it's not finished and story is waaaay to short.","March 7, 2015","false","5.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

The music and sounds go extremely well with creating a tense, adrenaline-filled atmosphere. Even though the gameplay is fairly slow in the beginning (zombies move pretty slow initially), the music really adds to the intensity of facing a horde of zombies while having a limited ammo count.\n\nThe controls are straightforward for your typical first-person shooter (you also can't jump, crouch, or sprint) and the learning curve is minimal to moderate; however, the zombie mobs can get challenging if you decide to go on a shooting frenzy vs. conserving your ammo. Making your shots count is crucial because zombies can rush you while you are reloading or after you've missed a shot.\n\nUpgrading/purchasing weapons and equipment occurs between levels, and the game keeps you playing by implementing a random drop chance with every playthrough. There are a variety of weapons and upgrades, increasing the replayability value. When you die, you may respawn (vs. restarting the entire mission) for a percentage of your money.\n\nAlthough the pacing of the action starts off slow, the atmosphere is so perfect with the music score, tight environments, and reasonable number of enemies per area. Taking the time to look down your sights and pick your shots can and will be very rewarding (you want to maximize your headshots if possible).\n\nThe levels are not too long, but remain really fun and action-packed.\n\nGreat for people who like gore, zombies, and first-person action.\n\nHighly recommend!","July 30, 2014","true","12.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

A combination of secrets and collectibles coupled with weapon upgrades encourages replayability similar to the Raid Mode from Resident Evil Revelations. Story is simple and doesn't interfere with the carnage, and the voice acting is charmingly awkward and reminiscent of the golden age of the late 90's-early 00's.\n\nIf there's one complaint I could make it would be the rather linear weapon progression and the limited ammo pool for pistol weapons limiting the viability of more specialized weapons like the compound bow. Also there is precious little in the way of character upgrades, but hopefully these issues will be addressed in future updates.\n\nFor $5 I can't recommend this game enough, and once it gets co-op it's basically a must-buy.","November 5, 2014","true","16.9"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","1"

If you included a basic jumping mechanism and a melee attack (if you don't already have one, if so I couldnt figure it out), this game would probably be one of the best first person zombie shooters I've ever played.  The horrendous lag is also a consistent problem, causing me to die constantly without any fighting chance.

But it's time to edit it as versions 1.3 and 1.4 improved greatly the game.\n\nIt's pretty rare when I install Early Access. And when I saw the video after buying a Groupees bundle, I was like: OMFG, IT LOOKS LIKE DOOM3! Being a huge fan of the series Doom (my first FPS was DOOM II), I didn't hesitate to activate the game.\n\nIf you want the cards, I stop you right now: it can take time to farm them - I don't know if it's still the case.\n\nBack to the review, when I launched Dead Effect, I didn't know that it was first a game for tablets. And when I played the first minutes, I saw immediately some little problems but it's Early Access after all. But never did I feel like I was in a port of an iOS game. Developers managed to do a very decent port, listening to us, early access players: they added a run option very very helpful in 1.3.\n\nLike I've said, it looks like Doom 3 and so, I'm not disappointed in graphics. It's dark enough to see your path (but not always the enemies) but the flashlight isn't really brightening the room. Remember that I had an hard time to find the flashlight icon? Well, it's no more the case. I can see it clearly, probably because of the change of design and the run icon.\n\nI'm really feeling like I'm lost in space, though Dead Space will stay as number one in that feeling (I said Dead Space, not Dead Space 2 or 3). Weapons for now look good: the Stungun is powerful enough to kill an enemy. But the problem is the slow reload (even if you can buy upgrades after each mission). Ammo, like credits, are seen from far away thanks to big icons  (which I love) but tablets are difficult to spot - Doom 3 made me a PDA or documents searching lover. Anyway, now, all the tablets that you found can be read from the main menu.\n\nSingle player campaign is finished, they added more for Survival and Biohazard and I found myself in better shape with the run option AND the devastation power, new to 1.3. And I love the new weapon, the Deviant-Arc. Anyway, with all the weapons available (some can be bought with gold), you can really find your own style (even with the bow and the crossbow).\n\nThey also redid the main menu - removing mainly all leftovers from the mobile version (like game center) - in 1.4 and fixed some bugs. Like I said, they're listening to us.\n\nGrenade zombies are less powerful (well, can't say that in Hell difficulty but at least in Easy and Medium, you don't die from one hit). The new ennemy, while not really a badass in Easy, is really doing damages and resistant in higher difficulty. I think that it's not even in the mobile version. I should try it because the APK for Android was in an Humble Bundle (got the PC on Groupees, remember).\n\nAnd what's best? I can play a woman. Being a woman myself, I love playing as my gender.\n\nSoundtrack is good, like the voice acting, it's very professionnal. And Wagner's laugh...\n\nI'll tell you something: I enjoy it. Zombies in space? Yeah, seen and seen. But when you have a serious team, listening to players, behind that type of game, it can lead to a very good game. And for five bucks, even in Early Access,... well, it's worthy of your wallet. Besides, while co-op and multi are still absents, the developers have the intention to develop it. But like they said, they needed time. And I can wait a long time with them. I don't mind. Because they're listening to their customers, always answering you in the forums and thanking you for the bugs you found.

Unfortunately, this is not actually something which exists in the game world - just keep your flashlight handy.\n\nWith a brief experience (and a shotgun), one might begin to subconsciously downplay the presented risks. I am convinced that this was a ploy by the designers to lull the player into a false sense of security. Don't be fooled. There will always be more zombies, and that slavering clutch of bloodthirsty undead shambling toward you are actually moving a little faster than you first thought. It also seems you forgot to reload after the last encounter. I should likewise mention that your stun gauntlet is still recharging after liquefying the nearest zombie's face, and you're a dozen mobile corpses away from the next healing bay. Better tag that reload button and hope you can chamber a few rounds before they get into lunging distance, because there certainly isn't anywhere to run.","October 15, 2014","true","8.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Reminds me of Doom 3, with some flashbacks to System Shock 2. A quite straight foward shooter, where you fight hordes of zombies and collect stuff that lets you buy upgrades for weapons between levels. Guns initially reload very slowly, meaning you have to be careful and strategic, keeping you on edge. I was worried the game's mobile origin might hold it back, or it might be an "on rails" type game.

It's a F2P Android game reworked into a paid Steam release, which usually sends up nothing but red flags. Mercifully, your $5 purchase is actually put to decent use. The developers have included 3 levels with this release and a whole bevy of weaponry to outfit your arsenal. Strong enemies will also drop weapon upgrades and unlocks for free so you have to grind less. Gold bars are dropped as well, which is crucial given they pay the way for your revives. The gameplay is considerably slower than most FPS's and ammo management is somewhat more pressing than your average shooter affair. The game isn't survival horror by any stretch of the imagination but does do a decent job building a gory, creepy environment.\n\nEnemies are your standard fair for a zombie survival shooter. You have slow walkers, runners, hurlers, chainsaw guys, one or two bosses and a few odds and ends. It's nothing special but the game throws enough zeds your way that you'll be happy variety is limited. Headshots are as important as ever and will help you survive the most dangerous of opponents. Level 3 is a tad unfair in that it throws a billion zombies at you without offering terribly many places to go. This is a DOOM-like corridor shooter, minus the faster and more responsive movement.\n\nYour enjoyment of Dead Effect is dependent on what you expect from a $5 mobile port. The game is decent and offers some playability but in its early state, has a small amount of content. It's a short experience with multiplayer and more levels potentially inbound. If you're looking to splatter some more undead brains on the wall, turn your own brain off and pick this up. If you're looking for a deep, nuanced zed-hunting experience, look elsewhere.","April 22, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I am excited to see where this will go!\n\nI will say that there needs to be a little more urgrncy in the reloading sometimes. Seems like the guy is leisurely reloading at a nice relaxing day on the range while he daydreams whats for dinner, while theres like 30 zombies right in his face. Even if it takes the same amount of time to reload, you should probably speed up the animationsa for reload, it bothers the heck out of me.\n\nAnd when youre reloading shotgun, and you click shoot, id like it if the charactter responded quicker. Theres like a huge delay. because when youve got four slugs in the chamber ready to go, and theres three zombies right in your face, itd be nice if you could justt pull the trigger and blow them away without a 1-2 second delay ( it seems like the main character is like " hey hey, ill get to it in a second, hold your horses", while hes getting mauled.\n\nOverall controls seem slightly sluggish to me.\n\nId say it needs a constand stream of content, it has addicting gameplay, just not a lot to do.\nLonger single player story, more weapons etc etc. More depth and content, the game is worth the tim.\n\nAlso, in today's day and age, theres no real reason not to include a jump ability. I would say adding the ability to jump would definitely help the quality of the game.\n\nAnd some of the voice acting seems a little cheesy, but not too bad, ive definitely heard way worse.\n\nAlso- With the guys in the yellow hazmat suits and the fat guys who spit blood at you, id say itd be an improvement in gameplay mechanice if there were some headshot animations, or anything like that, if i shoot a guy in the face with a shotgun, i expect them to go down, regardless of how undead or mutated they are.\n\nAnyway- Excellent game, GREAT quality overall, im not ripping in the above statements, I just think fixing those few things would be a HUGE improvement. And add some more survival levels, and maybe add the option to go with no time limit, thatd be pretty neat.\n\nOverall great experience for an alpha game, WOULD RECOMMEND","November 20, 2014","true","6.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Really crisp colors, detailed designs, and cool character animations.\nThe plot is pretty typical - Infection aboard the ship and the crew has been turned into monsters. Nothing new, but hey who questions these kinds of thing. You have a gun and you know what to do.\nThe gameplay is simplistic, point n' click to shoot, navigate through the halls, look for little treasures and ammunition, get the achievements then onto the next one.\nHonestly there's nothing very intense about the infected except when they're in huge masses, but that's because you know those shell counts are about to go down. I haven't felt any fear or panic like I had initially expected. I think something that contributes to that is you have the ability to move very fast (for a very short time) and they don't. So to get out of any situation is to simply put space between you and them and shoot. Even the mele weapon doesn't really give you the option to get up close and dirty.\nI know there's an android/IOS app of this game, and that's one of the reasons I got it for Steam. But it still feels like an app game and not something played with a keyboard and mouse. It definitley needs to be fully converted with the playable freedoms of a PC game, and THEN I think this game will be phenomenal.\n\nBut right now, the app is free and this is $8. For some, it won't be a bang for their buck and I don't blame you.\nI will recommend this in the hopes that it will be updated or reduxed altogether because it has some amazing potential that the Sci-Fi Horror genre needs.","January 19, 2015","true","14.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Weak voice acting, mediocre plot, average gunplay and movement, standard on rails zombie shooter. Yet despite that, it is still pretty fun and worth a couple of bucks. Also great if you enjoy going for achievements. If you are the type that enjoys seeing an achievement unlock and can use that as motivation when the game gets rather repetitive, then this will work well for you.\n\nA lot of the achievements are kind of giveaways for continuing the story or completing levels in other game modes, but the ones that are challenges are just challenging enough to be fun, but not so hard you get frustrated trying to achieve them. The hardest one, in my opinion (and which I'm still working on as of writing this) is the massive grind to kill 10000 zombies, but even that isn't so bad, as one of the "Biohazard" (kill some number of waves of zombies) levels offers a total of 335 zombies to kill each time, so you can either just do the grind, or pop in whenever you feel like it to polish off a chunk until the achievement pops.\n\nIn short, the game was fun enough to keep my attention, has decent achievements to add a bit more motivation, and was definitely worth the very low price I got it for as part of a bundle. I'd say it's worth it at regular price if you are looking for something not-at-all-deep to play, and it's a definite buy on sale. :)","February 8, 2015","true","18.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","1"

Please don't do what I did and buy this on impulse thanks to some nice looking screen shots. The only thing this game has going for it is the visuals which are admitedly pretty good. Everything else is honestly pretty sub par. The guns have no real kick to them and the reload animations are D tier (most of the animations for your character could be much better as well), the zombie AI is very simplistic where all they can really do is move towards you and attack, the upgrade system is the same on all the weapons feels lacking with nothing but reload speed, damage, accuracy, and clip size (Some of them are also pretty bizzare in this context. Why is there a reload speed upgrade on the grenades?), the story is uninspired at best, and last of all the game just feels bad to play in ways that are hard to explain. It might be mouse acceleration or maybe just the movement in general. If this was still in early access this would be more excusable but if this is indeed the release it leaves much to be desired.

Well, for starters.....\n\nContent for the game is wide and filling time wise. One option that is offered separate from the campaign is that once you have completed a mission, it unlocks and you have the option to replay it if it was one you enjoyed, or one you wanted to improve upon. I like that they have this option, as you don't have to play through the entire game again just to replay that one mission. The lighting and effects of the game are reminiscent of DOOM 3, and do a good job of adding to the tense atmosphere needed for a horror FPS game. The voice acting is poor and overdone, and actually takes away from that horror feel although.\n\nThere is a large variety of weapons available, but you are only able to take 3 into the game at a time, and there are rules to which three; (you can't put an assault rifle in your handgun slot, and you can't take an assault rifle and a shotgun but no grenades, for example). While the weapons have the right heavy feel and sound good, having a cap of three weapons undermines the large variety of weapons that are offered. You can always have a little of personal discretion or preference in your choice, but you will also be shoe-horned into using certain types of weapons as they all feel ruffly the same meaning some will be much better for wider encounters.\n\nCharacter upgrades are very limited; basically health regeneration. The weapons can be upgraded, for the most part by purchasing them with the in game money. The money system did transfer over well to PC, and is relatively balanced. What I found to be unbalance, however, was the difficulty settings. I normally play a game on the hard to hardcore setting, but in this game I found myself being one-shot by monsters on the easy setting, unless I adjusted the Gamma settings to make the rooms brighter. (Doing that however, took away from the atmosphere and immersion into the game). The easy difficulty setting plays and feels like it is the hard setting. This ties into the money aspect of the game as well, because when you die mid level, you have to use your hard won currency to revive yourself, and the further you get into the game, the more credits it costs to revive.\n\nPlaying it on the easiest difficulty and being one-shot by enemies that you cannot see, and then spending your money that should be spent on upgrades on reviving your character instead, makes you feel that you are never progressing with your character. I go into more detail on this topic in my video review, which I encourage you to watch if you want more exploration on the reasons why.\n\nThe multitude of irritants throughout this game including the difficulty levels, the weapons limitations, the difficult to follow story and the lack of character upgrades all add up to making this a game an unbalanced time annoy-er that I cannot recommend.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","November 29, 2015","false","3.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","15","27","2","0"

Headshots tend to kill most in one hit with almost all the weapons. Body shots do next to nothing. You have many kinds of zombies to kill including some that will make you rip your hair out. You have a few abilities to help you in your mission. There are a few modes to pick from but they all are standard zombie FPS fare.\n\nThe story is so cliche and cheesy but it serves its purpose more or less. You are a soldier who has become surrounded by the undead and it is your job to prevent it from spreading. Your standard zombie survival plot.\n\nThe controls are good enough to deal with. You can remap the keys to whatever you want. Controller support is okish but I would recommend a keyboard & mouse for this. Nothing feels off really though using space bar for interacting seems a bit off.\n\nThe graphics are fine. Everything seemed easy to distinguish. The dark corridors do hide most textures but luckily, all items flash when you are near them.\n\nMusic wasn't exactly the top idea in mind in this game. Nothing stands out and it doesn't even provide any real atmosphere.\n\nSounds seem a little off. The gun sounds are a big culprit of this. They just don't sound convincing enough. Zombie moans are fine.\n\nThe difficulty is a tad too easy, even on hard. Your health means little since there are healing stations peppered throughout each level and there is more than enough ammo for you to miss several times.","January 1, 2015","true","10.0"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","19","35","2","1"

I played trough it and I found it nice, though I would want it to be longer, and I am hoping that you will add more levels into the game as it grows, that would just be fantastic to hear and see.\n\nThis game has three identifying features that I like about it:\n\n1. The enemies that you encounter are hard, they are not so easy to kill at first, but bit by bit they get a bit easier, but they are still quite tough. Which is something I like. I hope to see more of the enemies that will come, and see how tough they are.\n2. There is a big need of backtracking trough the game, you often have to back away, reload your guns, then come back in and do what you can. It's good to see that in the levels you are in, you always need a place where you can and need to backtrack to finish of your enemies.\n3. You need to be clever in your play trough. My best strategy in the game is to shoot the enemies that I can with my weapon of choice, and if I run out of ammo in the clip, and don't have time to reload, I can switch to my other weapon that has a lot more ammo in the meantime, then back away, reload and do it again. Even using the grenades is quite clever of a tactic.\n\nI also love the voice acting in the game. Quite fantastic for an early access game. The character feels a bit stiff though in movement, I would also like to see some other survivors that are alive and work as NPC's that can fight along with you.\n\nAll in all, I give the game 8/10\n\nGood job guys!

I had never heard of it, and no one I know has it or has heard of it either. Not the worst game to get - especially when the bundle renders it to under 50 cents in price. In that regard, I recommend this game. It is a decent enough experience for the price I paid for.\n\nThat being said, it isn't this price for most people. I will keep my review as "Recommended" only because it's early access and some of my gripes with the game may change in time. But I would wait a bit longer to see if the meat gets a bit more cooked on this one.\n\nPros - Lighting is great. Really nice to look at in that regard.\n\nThat's the big pro for me. Whether or not certain things are cons however, I'm not sure. I'll put them in the middle for now. Depending on the person, it could be good, could be bad.\n\nMiddle - Gun play. The hit boxes are... mediocre. Sometimes I'll get a satisfying headshot, and sometimes the bullet will just miss. Zombies don't take much to kill (at least as far as I've been) so I can't list it as a con, but it's not a pro. It's just something that needs work.\n\nTextures. Some are good. Some are decent. Some are awful. Most of the time they're in the good or decent area, but there isn't much normalization in them. I can't list it as a con though because the majority of the time they aren't jarringly bad.\n\nThat leads me to the cons.\n\nCons - Level design. Not the worst. Some areas are cool enough to say to myself "That's pretty cool" but the majority of the time it's just one tunnel to the next tunnel, to the next tunnel. It used to be an app so I don't expect brilliance here, but it's quite boring after a while.\n\nControls. You feel a bit weighty sometimes (like for moving) but floaty in others (like for turning). For the latter, it doesn't help that you look up and down a full 180 degrees and there's no torso rendered. So you feel like you're just arms attached to a floating head. And when I say you feel weighty when you move, it's not necessarily a good feeling. It just feels so slow to me. I want to sprint but I have to meander around the hallways. Really slows down the pace.\n\nI would wait a bit more for this game. It can kill a half hour or an hour of time here and there, but that's about all its good for. I'm not sure how long it is as I haven't beaten the game yet, but if $5 isn't much to you, go ahead and buy it.

So keep this in mind, if you got trouble with mono.dll, then your'e antivirus could be the cause of this.\n\nI'm right now done with the first level of the singleplayer game in story mode.\nAnd this is what my review is based on.\n\nThe game loads fast, and so does the level i just played through.\nOnce done loading you are presented with the current situation.\n(The devs have put a lot of sweat and blood into DE, the visuals look really good !)\nPartially a cutscene, in wich your'e character awakes into a nightmare.  Everybody arround you is dead, except the undead wich are pretty much "alive" and kicking. The first thing to do is finding the weapon that is close by. After this it's down with the elevator. Scream !! Haha i just love that. One more elevator down and a small cutscene, showing 3 zombies eating their dinner. Yummy ! Now my weapon will come in handy. allthough this little fellow has a cooldowntime, and you must be close to the target, it does it's job. The zombies are served with a quick death and i can add a pistol to my collection.....\n\nI could go on telling you people what's happening after this, but i rather advise you to buy the game instead. :)\n\nIf you like old school fps games, and zombies, presented with great visuals and smooth gameplay, then buy this game!\n\nI rate this game 9/10","July 18, 2014","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Very very dark and VERY creepy atmosphere in this game, I am not easy to get a jump out of and you got a few out of me in the short time I was checking this game out tonight. The aiming seems to be missing just a little something, I am not sure what it is at this moment, I am sure I will figure it out tomorrow when I do a full review and get some video for Yout Tube. I actually like the fact that the grenades are a 1 and done for the zombies, kinda just like they would pretty much be in real life. Tossing them is a little bit of a challenge, maybe increase throwing distance and give us an arc reticle like in some games? showing us the flight path to give us the ability to aim it perfectly? The ADS and reload speeds seem slightly sluggish at start as well, I would expect (from the characters view point) someone that is suddenly facing down a bunch of zombies would be so hyped up on adrenaline that he would be able to get the sights up FAST. One last thing before I wind this down, the zombies crawling / lunging....they crawl faster then they walk lol also I would LOVE some sort of melee ability to at least create some much needed space, or at least the ability to stomp on their skulls while crawling at me.

I'm not sure how long it is as I haven't beaten the game yet, but if $5 isn't much to you, go ahead and buy it.

And it runs like butter. The zombies heads literally explode, its such an awesome feeling. And the slo-mo bullet time with the tracer rounds looks epic as hell.\n\nThe selection of weapons is sweet, you start with a .45 acp with a really satisfying gun sound. On the second level you pick up an assault rifle. Than you get greeted by a sweet inventory page where you can unlock crossbows, auto-shottys, chainsaws, gatling guns. And it's not like some cheap freemium knock off game. They de-pay2gay'ed it and made it so that each superzombie has a chance to drop gold or a weapon unlock ticket. So you don't have to buy credits or gold or anything like that. It's a true pc game through and through. NOT just an ipad port.\n\nOh yeah and all the weapons have iron sights. This game pretty much has it all. This games music is awesome too, it's surpsingly well orchestrated and sinister. I usually don't pay much attention to a games background music, but this games background music really sets the tone.\n\nUpdate: The last update is awesome, it added three more campaign levels for a total of six. So now the we have a nice chunk of quality gaming to deal with. I literally played the same level four times in a row just finding all the secret orbs and trying to unlock certain weapons.

I think I've bought it in some bundle, or with a huge discount.\n\n+ Zombies. I'm a fan, so... Just bare with it.\n\n+ Familiar gameplay. Killing Floor + Dead Trigger 2 (on Facebook), I guess, are the closest by genre.\n\nCons:\n- Repetitiveness. The game is extremely boring ane repetitive, I have no idea how did it get 87% rating with this little amount of effort put into it. Basically, it's a simplified and "dumbified" version of Killing Floor, with even worse (or you call it "even more oldshool") graphics.\n\n- Low optimization. Game starts randomly lagging and glitching sometimes. It did quit to desktop several times too (and I've only played something like 2-3 hours).\n\n- Awful UI. The UI is just painful to operate.\n\n- Graphics quality. As I've mentioned before, the game was optimized extremely poorly - on a PC, that Skyrim runs on smoothly, this game ran on 20-30 FPS, with lags and glitches on some levels.\n\n- Dull sounds. Even though the graphics quality is poor (to say the least), the sounds are just dull and painful to listen to -- I've muted the game in my first 10-15 minutes of the gameplay.\n\n- Lack of support. The game is out of Early Access, so the chances of the game being improved to a point where it'd become playable are pretty slim.\n\nOutcome:\nI'd rate this game 2.5 out of 10.0.","January 1, 2015","false","4.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

But wait, if you die you can use credits found across the ship to revive!!\n\nOh, but that doesn't matter when you are stuck in certain corridor or above elevators where the moment to move out to proceed, BOOM! the zombie will suicide bomb you over and over until you restart the level.\n\nVery weak gameplay, poor acting and story telling and a general feeling of unpolished gameplay, only get this if you can find it on sale for 1$.\n\nPersonal Rating: 1/5","March 19, 2015","false","6.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

You can do the story which will keep you entertained for a bit.  You can replay missions and easily collect credits.  Things that I wish it had was more guns and better awards.\n\nPros:\n- Can be fun for several hours of mindless zombie killing gameplay\n- The grind doesn't get dull in 5-10 minutes\n- Decent/Good graphics for a game of its type\n- Obtainable goals ingame instead of the usual "pay 99999999 ingame dollars or $1 for this"\n- You actually have close situations and not jump scares to pump your blood\n- First Person Camera angle done so so right.\n\nCons:\n- AI is a bit odd at times\n- Another zombie shooter that only stands out because it's on Steam\n- Can't see your feet(I don't care but I know a lot of people get butthurt over this)\n\nOverall, a really nice game and I recommend it to everyone who is looking for a zombie shooter with realistic blood pumping situations of survival instead of forced or guessable jump scares.  9/10 Sloths.","December 25, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

Good diversity of enemies, even though some should not be in such tight rooms since it doesn't make much sense for a security guy being allowed to walk with grenades in a space station.\n\nCons: Some doors close when you pass through them and they cannot be opened again, the game doesn't tell you that and you may end up being stuck in a wall trying to shoot all zombies coming at you because the root you planned doesn't work because of the door that you just passed through doesn't open anymore. The lack of information, especially about the doors (they change color from red (locked) to green (unlocked) but you don't have time to look at your back when you are shooting a lot of zombies coming at you, I expected something like a energy problem happening so there is an excuse for doors locking themselves after you pass through them, it fits the game since you sometimes have to turn on the power to make the elevator and some doors work.\n\nYou are stuck in the healing machines until you are healed completely, if you are being attacked while in the machine, you can never get out of it, you either kill all enemies or have a slow death being healed and taking damage at the same time.\nThe zombies who throw grenades spawn mostly in horrible places, making you a easy target, most of the time they spawn in the dark (they have dark clothing\armor), so grenades are thrown at you from out of nowhere until you find out where they are or die trying, also, the reach of their throw is absurd, one good thing is the fact that they can kill themselves and other zombies by throwing it in a nearby wall making the grenade come back to them. They are also able to explode themselves if you get close, and the time to get away from them is too short, making you take damage anyway, damage that might kill you. If you upgrade your healing speed on the machines and a grenade guy start throwing grenades at you while you are in the machine and you have no ammo, looks like there is a possibility of being stuck in the machine forever, I didn't tested that because there is only one save for the profile and this thing can only be tested in one room where both things exist, and it is before the machine that upgrades your character appear, so it is probably something to keep in mind in the making of the next missions.\nThe ammount of money you can pay for dying and being revived in a cleared room to continue your mission is too low, making the option to restart the mission not worthy of the time it would take to reach the same place where you died in the previous try.\n\nI recommend the game on the basis of it's potencial, it is already a good game, even though the price is a bit high in my currency to buy it with the few missions it has, but that's a economic problem not related to game, and probably not important to people who live in countries that are richer than mine. If you would like Dead Space in first person with the impact of the basic weapons in Doom 3, this is a good game for you. I had fun with it, and a bit of frustration, needs some stuff to be fixed, but I think it will be a really good game when it is finished.\n\nAlso, sorry for any mistakes with the english language, it is not my main language.","October 12, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Its straight to the point: Collect money, intel, ammo and anything that a zombie drops. Also KILL KILL KILL! lol You basically can buy new weapons like chainsaw, shotguns, assault rifles and pistols and upgrade them each and also find gernades and mines and stuff like that. The whole point of the game is to exterminate all the zombies onboard this space ship. Theres really no deep story missions here its just a simple pick up n play zombie fps shooter. Theres survival mode which is basically having to survive waves of zombies as well as a time limit mode where you must complete the mission in the time limit given. Overall the game is short and isnt a triple a zombie title but, for $4.99 your given a zombie fps game that looks pretty good and that is honestly really freaking fun to play especially blowing zombies heads off.","June 18, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

If you have enjoyed of these 2 I truly recommend this action loaded zombie shooter.\n\nDo not expect any mind blowing experience for the game quality corresponds quite well with 5€ price tag. I read that this is actually a simple android translation. There is only few enemy types and the variation is tiny: weak zombie - strong zombie - acid spitting zombie etc., and I think if there weren't special abilities like bullet-time or powerful melee strike blowing up all enemies around the fighting could be just dull.\n\nThe story is as cheesy and cliché as it could be and a bit amusingly the panting voice is the same masculine groan whatsoever you were playing as male or woman. As conclusion Dead Effect might not be the most magnificent game in the universe, but heck - the action provided is fun til' the end.","June 15, 2015","true","8.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Your character glides around like he's on rails, he can't sprint for more than three seconds per minute without getting puffed, the voice acting and dialogue is arguably ill-advised (like a second-rate Duke Nukem or Serious Sam being guided around by the maddest "mad Nazi scientist" stereotype this side of Auschwitz), and there's an ever-so-slightly questionable save system which requires you to complete a whole level before said save occurs (though you can spend your hard-earned dollars on NOT having to go all the way back to the start of the mission...money you COULD be spending on new weapons and upgrades once you've completed the mission, but oh well)!\n\nOne should furthermore be prepared for some of the WORST excuses for "quick-time" events in the history of video gaming (and that's surely gotta be sayin' somethin').  Oh, and no matter how much you turn down the music, you STILL can't hear what your mad nazi scientist friend is saying to you half the time, not least of all because he usually picks the exact moment that a lot of noisy action is happening in which to tell you what you're supposed to be doing next...\n\nApart from the above, the graphics are rather nice (i.e. make for nice screenshots, even if they don't look so flash when you're actually MOVING), the gameplay is by-and-largely "fun", and it's always kinda nice and refreshing to see old-school WALKING zombies every once in a while.  Which isn't to say that this doesn't take ANY influence from more recent "running zombie"/"infected"-type games...I mean, what post-Left 4 Dead zombie game would be complete without a fat, Boomer-ish zombie who spits or vomits at you?  So originality is certainly NOT this game's strongest point, but at least it can't be accused of being pretentious (or even remotely ambitious in any way, shape or form, for that matter).\n\nOn the whole, not too bad a game at all if you've already played all the Dead Space games and the hundreds of frankly superior first-person shooters also available on Steam.  And I guess the price tag is pretty reasonable, if you're swayed by such things (I had my copy gifted by an over-generous friend, so no complaints from me at that end, hahaha).\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","April 8, 2015","true","5.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","2"

Hey big publishers, that trash dev is smarter, than you! Next, the game is actually less linear than Call of Duty while being significantly cheaper and the story isn't that much worse either. That out of the way, the game is still a C-movie. Voice acting so bad it hurts, shooting space zombies, that's pretty much it. Visuals aren't bad, surely not top notch, but not bad. And an FoV-slider (hey big publishers, this trash dev is still smarter than you). I know I'm repeating myself, but I'm still astonished that something that looks like a mobile port is a better port than A-titles. Anyway, it's an FPS about zombies in space, what's there to expect? Pop heads, in slow motion if you want and enjoy feeling brainless yourself doing so. The lack of a jump button is irritating though. Hey, at least the story is better than the voice acting.","March 6","true","6.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Unit 13 (That's you) and crew are embarking on a mission to colonized the planet Tau Ceti f. Suddenly you are rudely awakened from your cryogenic sleep only to discover the ESS Meridian has now become a direlect with no sign of life. And the few crew members that are left have become unrealistically hostile and devoid of any survival instincts.\n\nGameplay: If you've played any FPS game before, then Dead Effect is no different. Standard keyboard, mouse and Xbox controller layout, controls are very fluid and responsive. The games AI isn't the best, but it's far from bad. The AI becomes a little more savy on harder difficulty settings. Hell, they turn into excellent flankers and teleporters (just keep your head on a swivel, trust me). And what's a FPS with out a little "Bullet Time" (Rockstar should have copyrighted this word, all that money) gameplay action. Enabling you to see your enemies limbs and brains splatter across the screen and enviroment, to an excellently done soundtrack.\n\nPros: Standard FPS run-and-gun action game with a simple story plot. Suprisingly good graphics with plenty of blood and entrails to look at. Dead Effect's musical score is quite impressive, coupled with an impressive looking enviroment it really helps set the games overall tone.\n\nCons: Partial controller support, meaning sometimes (most of the time) you are forced to use the keyboard and mouse to navigate through most menus. Another pain being you aren't able to map all player controls to the controller, luckly you can at least map the buttons most needed to play the game.\n\n(((Verdict)))\nA standard FPS with great graphics, plenty of blood and guts. Dead Effect has an excellently scored OST with detailed enviroments and smooth, responsive controls. A game with an average story and AI, suprisingly fun while some might find it repetitive. Dead Effect is a game that offers quite a bit for its small price tag.\n\n---Score---\n6.5 out of 10","September 13, 2015","true","23.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's dirt cheap right now at 70% off and it's worth every penny.\n\nThe title of the game is obviously a play on "Dead Space" and "Mass Effect", and even though both of those games had zombies in space, to an effect, this game is more reminiscent of games in the id Tech engines (e.g., Doom 3 and RAGE)\nalthough it still manages to pull off a "Dead Space" vibe at times, which is really nice considering the first Dead Space is so poorly optimized on PC that it's often not worth playing anymore. but i digress; on to the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n+Visually the game looks great, and lightning and shaders are used to great effect. the particle effects look great and complement the environment well.\n+very cheap. SO cheap in fact that even if you don't think you'll like it, there's almost no reason to not at least give it a shot\n+The Zombies. Normally that would be a con, since there's just been SOOO MANY zombie games lately, but the inventive use of the environment and the fairly novel use of a space setting sets this game apart from so many other zombie games\n+The story. that's right there's actually a story in this headshot simulator. It's not necessarily a new or novel story, but just the inclusion at all in such a normally cut-and-dry indie title is a breath of fresh air, and most of the context is gotten through in-game logs and tablets, which helps with the immersion. I'm not done with the game yet but i am very excited to finish!\n+The sound. OH ! the sound! sound, ambience, and music is SO important in a game like this, and these guys nailed it. from the quiet halls with the creaking and settling hull in the background, to the tense and frantic zombie engagments, there's no sound effect or piece of music that feels out of place, and that also helps so much with the immersion\n\nNow, before i move on to the cons, i must admit that the very low cost of the game right now helps to eliminate most of these as actually bothersome, i just feel it's my duty to list them anyways\n\nCons:\n-No one will be mistaking this for a AAA title, the voice-over work is just decent, and at times the tone of the voice actor/actress doesn't match their current surroundings or situatation (i.e., being in obviously dire peril and sounding unconcerned to the point of almost parody)\n-there's a certain "sharpness" or lack of polish to some textures and menus that's, it not bothersome, at least noticeable\n-It's short, it may only take you a few hours to finish the story mode, and after that there's not really any incentive to replay other than beating it on a harder difficulty or trying out the "horde" mode\n-Single player. This was not a huge issue for me, as in fact i am not a big fan of multiplayer games (outside of co-op), but i know the lack of a multiplayer mode could be a deal-breaker for some\n\n\nAll-in-all, i realy hope to see more from this developer, they did an excellent job with this game, and if this is just a sort of preview of what they have to offer, i can't wait to see what they come up with next","February 24, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

You assume the role of one of two space marine meatheads (the stereotypical male space marine meathead or the stereotypical female space marine meathead, just to clarify) aboard an FTL ship in deep space woken from cryogenic status up to a ship full of zombies, and proceed through a succession of linear mission levels usually consisting of finding a few switches to power up elevators or unlock doors and shooting everything that moves with a standard (and I'd say woefully small) arsenal of weapons.  No platforming (you can't jump in the game: a thing I haven't seen in an FPS since Doom), no puzzle solving, nothing requiring anything much thought. Just go to room, shoot all the zombies, get a few generic instructions from the badly acted German accented scientist, rinse, wash, repeat.  No spoilers.\n\nAlong the way you find credits and gold bars to upgrade your arsenal, and a bunch of tablets containing various emails and communicaes left behind to attempt to flesh out the story and universe a bit more: you know, the same thing every sci-fi/horror themed FPS has done since System Shock.\n\nReally, this is an amalgam of cliches from System Shock, Doom, and Dead Space cobbled together for no other purpose other than to give us a familiar setting that provides massive hordes of undead to spend several cathartic hours mowing down.\n\nGo in with low expectations and you'll find a fun, competently put-together FPS.  Go in expecting more than that and you'll find yourself very disappointed.","February 27","true","5.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","2"

Definitely a winner if you are in to have so many guns to unlock and upgrades to earn through grinding Survival mode. Well worth your time investing in the chainsaw, grenades, and chaingun. The gun alone will give you infinite currency to buy every upgrade you'll ever need. Always be sure to first restock your chaingun ammo after each Survival mode round. You can also collect bullets from lockers in the Survival maps. Once you max upgrade the guns of your choice and stockpile ammo - it's time to head to the campaign and complete story mode.\n\nVoice acting may be up to par of the first Resident Evil.

I can't say anything against the graphics, they are nothing special, but not bad either, but that's pretty much the only good thing I can say about this game.\n\nThe game mechanics are sub-par. You can't even jump, aiming is a game of luck; at least with some weapons and some enemies simply refuse to die even after 5 or more headshots. Oh, and you WILL get swarmed by zombies all the time, since your tools are simply not effective enough to kill them fast enough.\n\nAnd this is actually the worst part of the game. You can't just progress from level to level like in most FPS. No, the game wants you to play every level again and again and again, because every single piece of equipment and every upgrade costs in-game money and you WILL have to upgrade them. Healing? Pay with points. Better shotgun? Pay with points. Ammo? Pay with points. And of course a single grenade alone costs so much points that you will have to replay a previous level in case you don't use it in a super effective way. Which, of course, will not work, because sometimes explosions will just drip off from enemies.\n\nAs I get it the devs promised to put more work into the game, but that never happened.","December 31, 2015","false","0.9"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","16","31","6","3"

Was not expecting much... however having played a lot of games and being from the generation of NES it is so head banging that in a FPS you can not jump at all. So far the story ended sort of ok (7) and the script a barely pass (6), the character did not develop but I did not have great expectations as you really follow the back story through pads scattered around, a bit like doom 3.\n\nBasically you are shooting a horde of zombies. Same as the Iphone android game I hear. There is a special ability, which reminds me of Bioshock. Neverthteless I do not know if I will replay more of the main story as I played on hell and it was a very easy game and no one jumps from behind so easy peasy..... Nevertheless the good things....\n\nSurvival mode is really good, hordes of zombies after zombies, the other mode you can play is really good, not as much as zmbies from call of duty but you ahve fun, specially if you enjoy zombies shooting at you and not following a set path where you can go around in circles very easily.\n\nThe upgrade of weapons seemed alright and fair. You want to be revived? You better spend some money collected in the game, seems alright. However I think they should let you be revivied according to your score, saying rather than spending the money you have found, which by the way is so easy to find, you should be revived as many times as your game score lets you.\n\nFor the price tag? Fair enough. You love FPS? You can get better games out there. Enjoy shooting at hordes of Zombies and horror games? Jump in. Want to spend some easy time shooting something?

Do buy, and support them for future releases that hopefully have more quality in them.","June 2, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkbullet545/recommended/286040/","darkbullet545","DankBullet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkbullet545/","226 products in account","Dead Effect is a mobile-ported zombie survival game (surprised to see one here on Steam) set in the enviroment of a spaceship, I will be breaking down the game by it's natural elements.\n\nStory: Surprisingly, this mobile-ported game has a storyline attached to it, but I was not really expecting a storyline at all when I launched the campaign up. In short, the storyline is VERY linear and basic, and for the rest of this statement, the storyline was not good at all. Luckily the gameplay of this game makes it still an average game.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay of Dead Effect is simple and sweet, upgrading weapons you come across is nice when it comes to zombie survival games nowadays. Since there are zombies you face in the game, there are other variants you'll come across whilst blasting through the campaign. And what is also nice is that you get to upgrade yourself as well which comes in handy. What kinda bugs me since this was a mobile-ported game, there's no PC elements in the game, meaning there is no quicksave, quickload etc. Another gameplay mechanic I should mention is whenever you die you would have to decide to establish one of two options to move through the game, the first one is to restart, which does mean that you have to restart the whole chapter, while the other option is you can continue for a price of credits which is the currency in the game to buy weapons and its upgrades (luckily for your ownself upgrades there is no cost, but there is a catch). The price for continuing does change, I was playing through the game on Medium and I don't know if there is an increase of price when you die on higher difficulties. One last thing to mention, there are some extra gameplay modes in the game, there is New Game +, which is self-explanatory, another one is Survival, and lastly I saw Biohazard, not sure what that one would be.\n\nI don't really know if there's any other things I can cover about this game, but overall for a measly price of only $8, I would recommend to you to buy this game when it's on sale, since the storyline sucks, which matters the most in a game in my opinion. Don't take this review I'm writing the wrong way, this game is an average joe, but again, buy it when it pops up on sale.","January 23, 2015","true","9.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

If you are an experienced FPS player you will recognize plot and play mechanics that have been inspired by or outright copied from such well-known predecessors as Quake 2, Half-life, System Shock 2 and Doom 3. so it has a very been-there-done-that feel.  All the corridors look the same.  All the zombie monsters look like familiar copies from Doom 3 such as the chain-saw zombie.   The weapons are your typical pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, mini-gun, high-tech cross bow, grenade types. The music oscillates between different versions of spooky sci-fi riffs and action soundtrack orchestral motiffs.  The controls are your basic W-A-S-D, space, 1-2-3-4 or scroll wheel (for weapons).  You do have controls for flashlight and crouch but these are basically not really needed.  You can't save during missions but you can pick up credits that can be used to revive yourself if you die.  Gold and credits can be picked up to purchase weapons and upgrades between missions.  You have two profile slots for a male and female protoganist but gameplay is identical regardless of who you pick.\n\nSo, you might think that on the basis of the above description I would tell you not to buy and play this game but you would be wrong.  For the price I paid ($4.99) you get the gaming version of snack food - something that satisfies that craving to just shoot stuff for 20 - 30 minutes without the need to learn complex controls, go through a steep learning curve or possess ridiculously high eye-hand coordination skills in order to make progress. It's not really a hard game but just hard enough (especially in the beginning) that you actually need to pay attention and employ some elementary strategy in order to finish the different missions.  It does also have some nice options - for example, you easily replay any mission level that you like plus there are stand-alone game maps where, on a timed basis, you can practice with different weapons and earn additonal credits and gold for new weapons and upgrades.  So, when you don't have time to FPS binge all night but you need a little distraction or break from whatever boring thing you are doing  Dead Effect fits that need.","February 3, 2015","true","79.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

Secondly, its Indie and can compete with the "top notch gaming companies." Even if the campaign might be mildly predictable and slightly typical, it is delivered in a way that makes it far from that. Basically, as an elite soldier in a zombie infected ship, you must fight your way out or become one of those plagued. The first several missions feel really intense and that's just not because you might be new to it. However, I feel like as you progress, some of that robust flavor is lost.

After playing through the game and finishing the campaign I felt obligated to leave a review for it because not only is it not a bad game, I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that it's actually a very good game.\n\nI think the main criticisms I read were that the story and the voice acting were bad. I'd be really surprised if anyone looked at clips and screenshots of Dead Effect and anticipated a gripping narrative. You wake up, you're on a spaceship and the crew have been infected with a virus and are now zombies. Personally? That's all I need to know, or want to know in this particular game because what's worse than a lack of story? Is one that's shoved down your throat where it's not needed. As for the voice acting? Yeah, it's atrocious, but it is also a mobile port and considering all the things the game gets right, cheesy voice acting can be forgiven. The campaign is short (around 6 hours) but there is a bit of replay value with new game+ and survival mode. There is a small arsenal to pick from and each weapon can be upgraded using in game currency. Admittedly, Dead Effect doesn't really try anything particularly new and yes, it's another entry into a pretty congested genre, but that doesn't make it a bad game. Dead Effect never promises to be anything it isn't.\n\nThe bottom line is that the game is a lot of fun, and for the price? It's a bargain. (I bought it for 79p on sale but would have happily paid the £3.99 asking price)\n\nI have played plenty of games in my time, and more than my share of bad ones; Dead Effect doesn't fall into that category. If you are a fan of the genre, then you really can't go wrong considering the asking price. I enjoyed the game enough that I will be purchasing Dead Effect 2 when it goes on sale.","March 18","true","11.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","2"

Needs to learn from killing floor desperately. There is no sprint there is no jump. You will get pinned in mere seconds and get killed shortly after. Clearly meant to be multiplayer but even the single player is too unbalanced. I was easily overwhelmed and had no way to even evade the hordes i was facing down due to the fact that i cannot run or jump and every gun even the shotgun fires a single bullet. Shotgun is possibly firing slug ammo because anything else would have easily killed more than 1 zombie at once.  Each area is cramped and it's very easy to get stuck on something. I'm fully aware that this game is in a early build and it needs drastic improvement and though the story is weak probably on purpose it could use some slowing down and a-lot less zombies. Otherwise the game ran fine and at moments i felt scared until i became frustrated. Until this improves I'd stick with killing floor.","October 30, 2014","false","0.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/286040/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Having to replay entire levels of any game because of unavoidable BS deaths is not good. But any good game doesn't do that to a player, hence the reason this is not a good game, or at least the main reason out of many. You want to get a basic idea of how bad this game is? It is ported from a phone/tablet game, which right there is bad enough, but combine that with some really bad flaws and you have a wreck of a game. Dead Effect 2 has all the same problems and sucks even worse than this game. I know because I've played it on my Android. It is a cancerous f2p mobile cash sink that hopefully bombs when it comes to pc but it won't because most people on steam are idiots who buy trash.\n\nThis game is horribly, horribly flawed. And besides that, it is just plain boring. Enemies shamble at you slowly and you mow them down. The only ways you die are from either A) taking ten full hours to reload your gun and getting killed while doing so and B) grenade throwing zombies that kill you before you can even know where they are because they blend in and the grenades are tiny and blend in too. It should still be in greenlight as an alpha and not even be in early access or even for sale yet. The grenade tossing zombies completely ruin this game and tons of other people will agree with me. They were an obvious ploy to get more people to spend money on coins in this game when it was a mobile game and should've been fixed when it was ported. If the game has never had a in-game shop then that would be very surprising. You can be doing fine then all of a sudden you will unavoidably drop dead. You cannot tell they are there among the other zombies because they blend in with them, you cannot tell they have thrown a grenade because their throwing animation is so quick and vague, and you cannot see the grenades because they are so tiny and they blend in with the level graphics. You cannot realistically select "continue" because it charges you an insane amount of game cash and you need every drop of the money you find for upgrades. There are no save/check points so if you die you have to repeat an entire level. Even if you upgrade your weapon's reload time entirely, it still reloads slower than any game I have ever seen and of course you die while reloading unless you do a heavy amount of backtracking/running away. Even after upgrading the reload time fives times to the max, the assault rifle reload time still feels exactly the same as when I started the game. Several times deep into a level I have been backed into a corner and died while reloading since it takes about a full day to reload. And since continuing isn't realistically an option like I said, several times I have died very deep into a level, meaning I had to restart the level, erasing the very long amount of playtime I just put in. The fat guys spit at you and no effort whatsoever was put into the graphic of his spit: it is just a red line coming at you that looks like it was drawn in MS Paint. The rest of the effects are the same bad quality as the phone version of this game, but the graphics are good though. The sound and music are also good. The problem with the graphics though is like I pointed out, a lot of things blend together because the enemies, level graphics, and everything else all looks very similar.\n\nThis game needs fixed to be considered a fun playable game. It also has bad frame dips when a bunch of zombies are on screen because it is either horribly coded, horribly optimized, or both. This game just needs much more work period. Even if they could just implement checkpointing or saving, it would improve the game immensely. You know what, on second thought it doesn't need more work, it just needs to be buried deep in steam and never ever promoted again so it is forgotten about so nobody else wastes even a ♥♥♥♥ing single god damn dollar on it.\n\nNo rating/10 because it should still be being worked on and in kickstarter, not a full release. It sucks on mobile and it sucks equally as much on pc. This review isn't meant to complain. I am not complaining at all because I only paid $3 for this. I am just being totally honest. I can withstand some crap, but having to repeat entire levels one too many times because you die because of serious game flaws, just meant an uninstall for this wreck of a game.\n\nPS: It randomly crashes sometimes.

The story is a little short since it can be played through in about 7 hours. The dialog is not the best but the graphics and gameplay is done well.  All weapons are not unlocked so you need to collect money or gold to purchase them. The game started off giving me two different pistols, a shotgun, and an assault rifle which are able to be upgraded.\n\nThe game also has two other game modes besides the story which are survival and biohazard. Survival allows you to select a map and sets a time limit of 3 minutes in which you need to fight off zombies to gain cash and an achievement. Biohazard is similar but instead of a time limit there will be a total of 4 waves with the last wave including a boss. Once you finish the last wave you will be rewarded with cash, gold bars (amount depending on difficulty), and an achievement.

This a gem of a game, covered in coal and dirt. Yet unpolished and somewhat ugly from certain angles, it does not fail to impress, the old school gamer from within bringing back an old feeling of real challenge. Yes some animations are choppy and unrefined, yes some textures look like they were ripped off of google images, cropped and copy pasted into the game, yes the mechanics and hitdetection feel clunky, even unfair towards the player at times, yes the voice acting/dialogue feels cliche and cheese and... so WHAT!?\nThere were far worse games released at almost full retail price in the last decade by so called AAA devs with a far greater resources, still unable to evoke that glimmer of fun, excitement and fun playing them. And YOU are going to complain at a 5$ game, that offers you content at least 5 times for that, not to mention when you can see the hard work, sweat, blood and passion put in to this product? It's one thing to have high standards and another to be a try hard elitist game connoisseur. This is why we can't have nice things anymore. This is why we don't have as many innovations in gaming as we used to.\nTo those consumers, that come from simpler times, of scarcity, novelty and patient gratitude, I warm heartingly recommend this game to you. Explore and survive this new zombie universe. Slaughter your way through hordes of zombies, in narrow, claustrophobia inducing halls, against true adversity from both enemies and game itself with a rather impressive array of weaponry. Forget and push aside the hateful, banefull words of the rabble and the ones who forgot what it's like to be a true game enthusiast of old. So gorge yourself on this games' beauty and make it succumb to your will, beating it into submission, as you have done with so many other before it. By the way I strongly recommed to not be discourged by the first 2-3 levels of the game. Take your time learning its' mechanics, its' flaws and mercilessly beat it at its' own rules. >:D","October 22, 2015","true","5.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I really liked the premise of the game but like mobile, the controls are clunky and stiff and the game itself is riddled with bugs. For example, I went through one room, get ambushed by a zombie horde, back tracked through a door I came though to gain some distance, only to find I was locked in the room because the door was rigged to where you weren't supposed to backtrace upon the linear path set before you and had to restart the level. Next time I tried the door refused to even open at all.\n\nAgain the game is nice but playing wise, unless you have no real bars set, it's another one of those clunky cookie cutter mobile games ported pc that is more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ then it is fun once the bugs and controls start to show their colors.","November 3, 2015","false","2.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I bought this game because I like to support indie games and their developers, but this port is just lazy. The phone interface still shows up, as if you'd be using a touchscreen to play it. The game runs at like 20-30 fps on medium, and like 12 on extreme. I should probably also state that I can get about 60 fps on medium in skyrim, and 45 in far cry 4 on medium. This game just isn't finished. There are so many things that need to be fixed, and yet people keep reccommending it! I could only stand about an hour of the game before becoming annoyed with the horrible balancing system. You use in game currency to respawn and buy weapons. "Well that's not that bad," you say. Yes it is. The entire game is based around buying amazing weapons with real life currency to actually beat the game. I played on normal because that's usually the most balanced, and room after room I was surrounded by zombies. It makes me sound like a noob, but when you can't jump and are stuck in a corner being surrounded by zombies with no way to get out, it becomes frustrating. I have no problem being surrounded by zombies, but you can't jump AT ALL, you can sprint for like 2 seconds, and the character takes a good 5-10 seconds just to reload a weapon. All in all, this is a game for masochists.","March 21, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Overall, it is on par with Killing Floor. The graphics remind me a bit of Dead Space 1 because of the claustrophobic, slick spaceship design. DE has extremely nice textures, lighting, effects, and classic zombie animations that create a suspenseful and foreboding atmosphere which is fueled by a superb John Carpenter-like soundtrack. The guns that you can buy and upgrade, with funds earned by completing missions, feel very satisfying and add a large variety of firepower. The fast-moving game play, sprinkled with map objectives, feels like an updated classic Doom with multiple modes of play. I’m really looking forward to the co-op mode now in development. The FUN FACTOR is through the roof! This is a no-brainer must-buy for all First-Person-Shooter and horror fans. Well done, Badfly Interactive, thanks for such an awesome game!","March 2, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My wife was laughing at me for wasting $1.49.  I'm writing this review without one instance of regret.  In fact, I feel this game is worth way more than it's asking price.  Anyone who reads my reviews knows I don't rehash what the game story is about, that's part of the fun of playing the game!

No problem, play the mini-games the developers have provided and buy and upgrade your weaponary until they are freaking unstoppable!!!

The shop feels like it was supposed to have microtransactions, but they never implemented the in-game purchases system. Stopped playing after the first boss cause they dropped the name of the game as the name of the entire zombification plague and said "Oh yeah, the plague lets you bend time cause reasons". Just too many little things drag it down.","February 21","true","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has bullet time, upgrading weapons, character upgrades later in the game and a special area attack. A male and female character to play but it doesn't change the story one bit as far as I can tell. Story didn't have any surprises but still fun enough to follow along. Survival missions, replying finished levels and more upgrades than you can afford to do just through one play through gives some replayability for those looking for it. There are better guns than the 4 you gets during the game, my guess is they are for the increased difficulty on the new game plus and to keep interest beyond the short single player storyline.","February 24","true","14.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

REALLY. It reminds me so much of Doom 3, which I loved. But, alas, I didn't. Why? Well, first off, you need to pay in-game money (which you find scattered around the place) to continue from where you are. If you don't pay, you start from the beginning of the chapter/game (Don't know since didn't get past first chapter. I had already decided my thoughts on the game, and was not enjoying myself) I hate that kind of thing, and I know alot of other people hate it aswell. I'm just glad it's not real money. Second of all, it's really, really.... bland. Everything is the same. I was wish through my time playing I would find a new gun, or get to the next chapter or.... SOMETHING! Something new! Something that was differant from what the game was so far! The animations are laughable. Just look at the first 5 minutes of gameplay or something, and you'll see it. It's shockingly bad. But animations aren't everything. Gameplay is important. And the gameplay is repetitive. I do not recommend this game. If you like the look of it, check out Doom 3: BFG edition.

As far as "sci-fi horror fps shooter" games go, this is probably the best indie one on steam. I know there isnt much competition in that specific genre, but whats available on steam is usually garbage for it, this is not the case with Dead Effect. It's incredibly well done with some pretty intense gameplay, and for having originally been a mobile game, this makes it all the more impressive. The voice-acting is downright terrible , but i feel like this was done on purpose, for it adds a certain charm. This one guy even does the worst Arnold shwarzenegger impression i've ever heard, and its funny. Had the voice been mediocre, instead of horrible, i think this game would have lost some of its charm. Anyways, here are some pros and cons\n\nThe Pros:\n- The Price - This is def worth the full price of admission, and you get it on sale, even better.\n- Gameplay - The game was honestly more intense than most FPS games I've played. They really piled the zombies in this game, and killing them never stopped being a blast.\n- Variety of zombies - A decent variety of zombies to kill\n- Length - The campaign is short and sweet, and a ton of extra stuff is available. Alot of content went into this game\n- Sound - Good sound effects for the weapons\n\n\nThe Average:\n- Graphics : The majority of the ship looks the same\n- Music : Its okay\n- Weapons: Not much variety\n- Upgrading: Not much variety, but its still nice\n\nThe Cons:\nVoice Acting: Its so bad, but to some, like myself, this can be fun\nEnding: Bad ending, or lack of i should say.\n\nIn Conclusion, Dead Effect is a solid sci-fi zombie killing experience. The Gameplay is Solid, intense, and pretty addicting. Killing hordes of zombies never got old too my suprise. Indie Sci-fi Horror games are extremely scarce, and the majority that are available on steam are pretty terrible, and way over priced. Dead Effect is not only 10x better than most of those games, its also significantly cheaper. If your into that genre, or enjoy games such as  Doom/ Dead Space, then I highly recommend this Solid game","March 16, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Considering it's a tablet port, the controls feel fluid and precise (although the sight on the most expensive assault rifle sways horribly when you move your mouse), the zombies are well animated, the weapons are literally "This gun is far better than this gun. Use this.", and when you get the minigun, you've practically won the game.\n\nIt looks good, there are plenty of secrets to find,  the music seems a little out of place at times, but the sound design is rather well done. They've done a good job of making sure you know you're on a broken down, abandoned, zombie filled spaceship, with the hisses of broken oxygen tanks and hoses, the gargling and moaning zombies are easy to locate due to the fact that, even with just speakers, you can hear exactly how far they are from you, AND where they're likely located.\n\nFor £3.99, I genuinely cannot complain. It's very reminiscent of games like Rise of the Triad, Painkiller, and in survival mode, maybe even Serious Sam, gameplay-wise.  I just got nearly two hours of non-stop fun out of it, but I will say this..\n\nIf you're looking for a perfectly polished, difficult, long, drawn out experience, this isn't the game for you.\n\nIf you want a few hours of mindless zombie slaying with some quite decent story (albeit grammatically incorrect, at times) told through the dialogue over the communicator you're wearing, and through text-based PDA logs (a-la Doom 3 without them actually being read out to you) that you find throughout the game (some are hidden fairly well, so check EVERYWHERE in the room you're in before moving on to the next one! If you stand still for a sec and look around, you'll catch them glinting slightly, making them a little easier to find!), where you can just unload stupid amounts of ammo in to stupid amounts of zombies, whether you play the story, biohazard mode, or survival mode, this is the game for you.\n\nI strongly recommend looking up the first level of the story on youtube before you buy, as this game COULD be either the best £3.99 you've spent in months, or the worst, based on what your tastes are.  I enjoyed what little I played of it, and if you're anything like me, and sometimes just like to blow off some steam (hurr hurr), killing zombies mindlessly, you'll have a riot. Do not, however expect any semblance of multiplayer. I mean that. There is none. At all. This is a solely single-player experience.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 8/10\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nAll in all, a fun, yet very average-at-times experience.","March 17, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I hope I didn't pay much for it.  It's really not worth much.\n\nIt's trying to be a typical zombie shooter but with clunky controls, poor aiming, competent at best modeling, highly repetitive zombie models, and not much more.  There were several special effects (for instance the electricity from the very first weapon you get) that look like they might have been done in MSPaint.  Most of the restrictions that were put in place to create suspense, limited stamina for running or flashlight power, only ever served to be annoying.\n\nHonestly, there are far better games if you want to blow zombies away.

It actually feels like a mobile game someone thought would be fine on the big screen. I got it with a bundle so I cannot complain too much, but its still drek. I suppose I better at least say what it is I guess, for someone unable to see this turd for what it is.\n\nIts a space ship game, with zombies, you kill them. That's it. Oh you can use keycards, what innovation. Weapon selection is exactly what anyone who has played a FPS game will know (junk, then pistol, then shotty, etc etc). It feels very sluggish, nothing seems smooth with this game. That's part of its cheapness, it feels like one of those budget games in the supermarket than you have never heard of before, often come in a “ACTION TIME” series full of cheap rubbish and the odd old time classic that clearly just ran out of copyright and is considered abandon ware.\n\nIts not a game you will hate mind, I do not want to give that impression. Its so utterly generic and dull that I doubt anyone could be too annoyed with it. Personally I consider that the worst thing a game could ever be, boring.

In Dead Effect you get guns, ammo and bullet time.  In return you use guns, ammo and bullet time to knock the stuffin' out of zombies in ridiculous, cartoon-y splatters of blood, guts and brains.  You will do this over and over again as you collect money to upgrade equipment, find tablets to flesh out the backstory and enjoy some of the cheesiest, most poorly acted voice-overs since the beginning of time.  Don't let my smart-alecky sentences chase you away.  I had alot of fun playing this and am already at work on a new game plus with the intention of enjoying the other modes shortly after.  The game basically is a B movie splatter-fest combining Doom, Dead Space and Resident Evil.  It's not nearly as good as any of those games but it doesn't need to be.  It does what it does well enough and is plenty entertaining, especially for the low price tag.\n\nThe game is deliciously simple and after stomping through Volgarr, Betrayer, Deadlight and several other games that required some thought, strategy and timing, it was fun to turn off my brain entirely for this one.  As a hard as nails space marine, you're way too tough to jump, think crouching is for fools and can't ran worth a crap due to your heavy space suit.  None of that really matters as you blunder from one point to the next pressing a few buttons (barely disguised as mission objects) while blasting every single zombie in your path with shotguns, assault rifles, magnums, pistols and more.  It's not very difficult, although the grenade zombie is a pest but as long as you have cash you can pick up right where you fell in a heap by paying to revive.  Dying's not much of a problem anyways because the levels are fairly short and really once you've got a few guns at your disposal, you'll shred everything like paper.\n\nHaving a new game plus to carry over your gear and earn more cash to buy those elusive, extra expensive guns was a great idea and the weapons themselves are satisfying to shoot.  By no means is this blaster-o-rama without its flaws.  The graphics for the zombies, guns and splatter FX are all pretty solid but the levels are mostly a bland set of corridors, walkways and other similar areas.  It doesn't detract too much from the score (and as an old school gamer I don't give a hoot about graphics really) but don't expect to get any twisted scenery to match the dire situation your'e fighting your way through.  Since zombies are the opponent du jour, it was cool to see some varied types;  chainsaw wielders, spitters, grenade tossers, armored zombies, etc., yet none of them really pose much of a challenge.  You might die a few times at first while figuring out how to manage their numbers, but again, once you have the tiniest modicum of strategy and beefed up guns, they go down like paper planes in a tornado.\n\nWhile not a major problem, the controls will sometimes get you in a bit of trouble as they can be touchy and have you staring at the nearest vacant wall instead of the revenants you need unleash hot fury upon.  Another slightly irritating aspect is that other than the chainsaw, there is no melee combat.  In close quarters you've got the electric arm, shotgun or saw...but that's it.  It would have been sweet if you could carry more of your levelled up guns around, or swap out a few of the things they make you carry for other guns.  The grenades weren't overly useful at all.\n\nThere's really only two bosses in the game (three total if you count the second encounter with the first one), but they are so easy I'd practically bet you 50 bucks that you won't die while fighting them.  Aside from very early on you're never in that much trouble, so those looking for a white-knuckle, bullets to bedlam challenge, you're barking up the wrong corpse.  This is seriously exactly what you need if you're just looking to shoot thousands of bullets, drop mobs of the undead and really only tax the trigger finger.  Nothing more/nothing less...  It was honestly alot of fun, if not something you have to have (depending on your tastes).  I will certainly play Dead Effect 2 and it'd be a hoot to see this with some multi-player options.  I'll make a list of pros and cons for you, and then please excuse me, I have more zombies needin' taught some manners!\n\nPros:\n\n-Fun arsenal of weapons that are a blast to shoot and upgrade\n-Satisfying, old school combat\n-Enough secrets, modes and extras to encourage additional playthroughs\n-Mobs of zombies are a hoot to pummel\n-Easy to pick and up play\n\nCons\n-After a few skirmishes there's virtually no challenge\n-Upgrades are awesome, but also render you darn near invincible\n-Putrid boss fights that are far too easy\n-Controls can be a bit touchy and oversensitive\n-Few more levels wouldn't hurt\n-Other than the chainsaw, there's no melee combat or close quarters hand defense\n-It would have been nice to be able to carry more than 2 weapons at a time or at least swap out the electric arm, or grenades for another gun\n\nThis is a budget game that does things right.  Unlike the semi-horrid Land of the Dead, this is a zombie smashing romp that's worth taking.  It's far, far, far from perfect but if you know what you're getting and that's what you wanted, you'll have some fun!\n\nRating:  7/10","August 24, 2015","true","13.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(a weapon or a weapon upgrade drop is very handy)\n\n- survival and biohazard gamemodes\nin survival mode you take on an endless horde of zombies, your goal is to get a highest combo possile and to survive till the timer runs out, youl be rewarded with credits (amount based on difficulty)\nbiohazard is pretty much the same as survival exept its wave based and without timer that can run out, you win the game by surviving all waves, and just like survival mode youl be rewarded with credits with addition to gold bars (amount based on difficulty and length of the gamemode) before you start a match you can choose the length of the gamemode and the difficulty\n\n- new game plus\nthere is new game plus wich you can take all of your unlocks to a higher difficulty if your tired of the difficulty your on.\n\nwhats decent:\n\n-12 levels campaign\nthe campaign was fun to play but it isnt that special compared to other zombie games but its not bad ether for a 5 euro indie app game it was decent enough, for those who wants to play there fav campaign level again you can do so by choosing level select there you can replay the levels while still keeping your unlocks such as your weapons and its upgrades.\n\nnow lets talk about the bad things in this game:\n\n-low amount of gold bars drops\nthe gold bars that are getting dropped by zombies are very low on amount youl get only 1-2 each campaign level while you can get 8 if you play biohazard and if you set the game mode length to long and difficulty to medium grinding that is just way easier of getting golden bars then just doing the campaign all over again if your saving for a gun that cost allot of gold bars.\n\n-OP kamikaze grenade zombies\nthese guys are tough, armored and anoying as hell one of the most dangerous zombie types in the game, these guys are gona make you swear allot in this game because they can instant kill you with ether trowing a grenade at you with a frontal hit or suiciding near you they are hard to kill since they wear a body armor there only weak spot is their head but its hard to aim at if hes accompanied by a bunch of zombies so focusing only on them isnt easy their damage realy needs to get nerfed because they where the main cause of my deaths in the game.\n\n-paying credits to get revived\nthis is defindly one of the bad things this game has when you die you dont get to spawn near a checkpoint like most shooters do, instead it gives you the option to pay  with your credits (and the costs vary) and be revived to continue where you left of or to restart the entire level, yes there are no checkpoints in the levels so more reason to hate those OP kamikaze grenade zombies.\n\n-cramped rooms\ntheres allot of times that theres to much zombies in small rooms or hallways wich youl get anxious, and its hard to combat them that way as you will get easy cornered and ganged with no escape.\n\nlow stamina and batterys:\nyour stamina and baterys run out way to fast and its reloading takes way to long long enough for a zombie horde to corner you or to suprise you in dark areas.\n\nwel that was it, like i said above its a decent game for 5 bucks youl gona enjoy it for what it is but i prefer to wait till its on sale then youl get a good deal out of it i personaly enjoyed and liked this game and im looking forward what the developer is planing to add in the sequel dead effect 2 wich i have sadly heard that it will be free to play unlike the first game wich is unfortunate. have a good day all thx for reading\n\noow yeah almost forgot developer if you read this for the love of god nerf those anoying OP kamikaze grenade zombies if your planing to bring them back in dead effect 2.","September 4, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

For $5 and for being a mobile port I really feel this game is pretty good. I don't know or remember if it was more than $5 when it was first released on Steam but its current price is pretty damn reasonable for this game. Its main campaign is about 4 hours long on Medium difficulty and it has quite a few extra game modes and difficulties to play on afterwards. It has something like 10 or 12 weapons, mostly guns, and has a pretty good upgrade system. You have 2 special abilities which both work well in the game and on harder difficulties it is pretty challenging. Its graphics are well done all things considered and plays quite well. When I first started playing it had some nast mouse acceleration but once I turned that off it was fine. There's no Jumping in the game but thats only a problem if you get swarmed by enemies and the enemies themselves have a little bit of variety. Theres your average zombies and about 5 or 6 variations of zombies. Theres only 1 type that is REALLY annoying but the rest are fine but you kill them all in basically the same way so theres not much variety to the game play itself from the zombies.\n\nIts hard to describe but the game is fun and if you just want to play a mindless shooter that is enjoyable, nice to look at and not overly difficult then this is a fun little gem for $5. I did enjoy my playthrough, i'll probably come back to it at some point and most of the guns are unique and varied. The weapons themselves control well and are fun to use and as said before are all upgradeable. The sound effects and animations on the guns are very well done and give the game a pretty visceral feel. The story of the game is pretty bland and uninteresting but it is kind of silly at times which is enjoyable. Theres only a few boss fights in the game and they're nothing to write home about.\n\nPros -\n- It costs $5.\n- Decent graphics and fidelity.\n- Nice sound design.\n- Good amount of weapons that are mostly distinct.\n- Animation quality is good.\n- Voice acting isn't as bad as I'd expected.\n- Upgrade system for weapons and skills.\n- Extra game modes and difficulties.\n- Decent visual settings menu.\n- Deliberate combat\n- No microtransactions. Its good to see mobile ports that recognize the difference between platforms.\n\nCons -\n- Repetative gameplay.\n- Anticlimactic boss fights.\n- Weak story and weak ending.\n- One very annoying type of zombie.\n- Female character has a clearly male breathing sound effect when out of breath from sprinting.\n- Mediocre level design.\n- Annoying respawn mechanic. You can restart a level for free but respawning in the level from where you died from costs in game currency.\n\nAll in all for what this game costs its worth the investment to me. The combat feels good and is deliberate, you have to make your shots count! The zombies can pose quite a challenge at times but not too challenging if you don't want it to be. And like I said this game has some pretty good replay value and potential. Dead Effect has a lot of ups and downs but I feel its positives definitely outweigh its negatives and is worth asking price.\n\nNumbers don't mean everything, and I don't like giving a score but if I had to give it one i'd say Dead Effect is a.....\n\n6.5/10","June 27, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(a weapon or a weapon upgrade drop is very handy)\n\n- survival and biohazard gamemodes\nin survival mode you take on an endless horde of zombies, your goal is to get a highest combo possile and to survive till the timer runs out, youl be rewarded with credits (amount based on difficulty)\nbiohazard is pretty much the same as survival exept its wave based and without timer that can run out, you win the game by surviving all waves, and just like survival mode youl be rewarded with credits with addition to gold bars (amount based on difficulty and length of the gamemode) before you start a match you can choose the length of the gamemode and the difficulty\n\n- new game plus\nthere is new game plus wich you can take all of your unlocks to a higher difficulty if your tired of the difficulty your on.\n\nwhats decent:\n\n-12 levels campaign\nthe campaign was fun to play but it isnt that special compared to other zombie games but its not bad ether for a 5 euro indie app game it was decent enough, for those who wants to play there fav campaign level again you can do so by choosing level select there you can replay the levels while still keeping your unlocks such as your weapons and its upgrades.\n\nnow lets talk about the bad things in this game:\n\n-low amount of gold bars drops\nthe gold bars that are getting dropped by zombies are very low on amount youl get only 1-2 each campaign level while you can get 8 if you play biohazard and if you set the game mode length to long and difficulty to medium grinding that is just way easier of getting golden bars then just doing the campaign all over again if your saving for a gun that cost allot of gold bars.\n\n-OP kamikaze grenade zombies\nthese guys are tough, armored and anoying as hell one of the most dangerous zombie types in the game, these guys are gona make you swear allot in this game because they can instant kill you with ether trowing a grenade at you with a frontal hit or suiciding near you they are hard to kill since they wear a body armor there only weak spot is their head but its hard to aim at if hes accompanied by a bunch of zombies so focusing only on them isnt easy their damage realy needs to get nerfed because they where the main cause of my deaths in the game.\n\n-paying credits to get revived\nthis is defindly one of the bad things this game has when you die you dont get to spawn near a checkpoint like most shooters do, instead it gives you the option to pay  with your credits (and the costs vary) and be revived to continue where you left of or to restart the entire level, yes there are no checkpoints in the levels so more reason to hate those OP kamikaze grenade zombies.\n\n-cramped rooms\ntheres allot of times that theres to much zombies in small rooms or hallways wich youl get anxious, and its hard to combat them that way as you will get easy cornered and ganged with no escape.\n\nlow stamina and batterys:\nyour stamina and baterys run out way to fast and its reloading takes way to long long enough for a zombie horde to corner you or to suprise you in dark areas.\n\nwel that was it, like i said above its a decent game for 5 bucks youl gona enjoy it for what it is but i prefer to wait till its on sale then youl get a good deal out of it i personaly enjoyed and liked this game and im looking forward what the developer is planing to add in the sequel dead effect 2 wich i have sadly heard that it will be free to play unlike the first game wich is unfortunate. have a good day all thx for reading\n\noow yeah almost forgot developer if you read this for the love of god nerf those anoying OP kamikaze grenade zombies if your planing to bring them back in dead effect 2.","September 4, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It actually feels like a mobile game someone thought would be fine on the big screen. I got it with a bundle so I cannot complain too much, but its still drek. I suppose I better at least say what it is I guess, for someone unable to see this turd for what it is.\n\nIts a space ship game, with zombies, you kill them. That's it. Oh you can use keycards, what innovation. Weapon selection is exactly what anyone who has played a FPS game will know (junk, then pistol, then shotty, etc etc). It feels very sluggish, nothing seems smooth with this game. That's part of its cheapness, it feels like one of those budget games in the supermarket than you have never heard of before, often come in a “ACTION TIME” series full of cheap rubbish and the odd old time classic that clearly just ran out of copyright and is considered abandon ware.\n\nIts not a game you will hate mind, I do not want to give that impression. Its so utterly generic and dull that I doubt anyone could be too annoyed with it. Personally I consider that the worst thing a game could ever be, boring. The sluggish feeling really starts to grate though, the “zombies” react the same to your shots, so even what little it offers is marred by a poorly put together cash grab.","April 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

As many have already given good, detailed descripsions and positive reviews on Dead Effect.\nWhen I heard it was originally for mobile phones, I was kind off put off, I will not lie to you. After reading lots of positivety and feedback about it, I decided to gamble and took my chances to purchase Dead Effect.\nI am not exactly an expert at reviewing games.  However, I willl mention this ladies and gentlemen....\n\n\nIf you like killing the undead, saving up credits for many badass looking  weapons, being in a claustropbic abandoned space ship, replacing Demons, with Zombies.  To a similar ''Doom'' type formular.  Then Bobbs your uncle.\n\nIt is worth every single penny in my opinion.  Genius little game design for four squids, can you really go wrong ?  The level of detail and atmosphere is nice, the graphics are good and well beyond passable.  More importantly though, with the mouse and keyboard this is a treat to play.\n\nThe game is far from perfect but you can see it has a lot of potential.  It will surely give other game developers, lots of nice ideas.  So it could  further expand, with a real meaning in a beggining, of an interesting franchise.\n\nI read that Dead Effect 2 is even better.  Personally, I will wait for a slight price drop.  It really is a no brainer though.... Well done developers for porting it over to PC.  It is simple but satisfying.  A good job well done I think. Go for it and see. "Splatt with all the eyeballs flying out torwards you and all sorts''.   XD\n\n\n8/10 is very generous maybe a 7.5/10 realistically.  I did not expect it to be this good. Buy it. Trust me. you will not regret it if you like zombies, you simply cannot go wrong with this.","April 24","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am sympathetic towards indie developers, obvoiusly they don't have the budget or man power to compete at the same level as other studios. Is this a bad game? If you compare it to major games like Doom than yes, however if you keep your expectations in check and realize you are playing a fun distraction with a minimal budget it isn't all that bad.\n\n\n","April 19","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is so bad. It is unbelievably bad. I can't believe how bad it is. The amount of anger I have experienced playing it is phenomenal. I don't even know how to describe this game other than say that all it is is watching reload animations. It takes approximately 3 seconds to unload an entire clip. It takes 3.5 seconds to reload. That means you are spending more than half your gun action reloading. And usually when you are reloading there are a dozen or so zombies around you. I hate this game. I really honestly hate this game. I have reloaded so many times...\n\nMaybe I never got the guns that might make this game fun. But you need currency to get better guns and every time you die in this game it costs you currency, and you die so much because your guns are so crappy that you never have neough currency to get better ones. You have to play the game to get currency, but when playing you die, and lose all your currency, so basically there is no reason to play the game. The game actually doesn't want you to play it. That's what I inferred from it anyway.\n\nIt's horrible. Don't buy it. Don't play it. I want it removed from my Steam library. I don't even want a refund or anything. I just want it removed.\n","September 30, 2015","false","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

ADJUSTMENTS - I don't have an NVIDEA graphics driver on my little laptop, so the game ran somewhat shakey and surreal, untill I turned 1. VISUAL QUALITY 2. SHADER QUALITY and 3. EFFECT QUALITY down to the MEDIUM SETTING, and the game still looks just fine to me, and runs smooth . (What V-Sync, Antialiasing, and Anisotrophy is or does I'm not sure, but I don't think that I touched on those in the video opions .) ............. TRICKS - I originally replayed level one about ten times, to earn enough space zombie bucks to beef up my hot girly's shotgun, but then I found that I didn't need to do that . When I press the right bumper button, on my gamepad controller BOOM !!!!! All the zombies around me suffer exploding heads, which is a great way to get out of a zombie bum rush, then keep going in and out with the stun gun (you don't have to shoot heads), and you'll gradually be able to pick off most of them as they come in and you back up . Just get the rhythm down for recharging of the basic stun - about five seconds, and the head explosion thing - about two minutes . Also, take out the gun turrets with your hand grenades .

I am sympathetic towards indie developers, obvoiusly they don't have the budget or man power to compete at the same level as other studios. Is this a bad game? If you compare it to major games like Doom than yes, however if you keep your expectations in check and realize you are playing a fun distraction with a minimal budget it isn't all that bad.\n\n\n","April 19","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As many have already given good, detailed descripsions and positive reviews on Dead Effect.\nWhen I heard it was originally for mobile phones, I was kind off put off, I will not lie to you. After reading lots of positivety and feedback about it, I decided to gamble and took my chances to purchase Dead Effect.\nI am not exactly an expert at reviewing games.  However, I willl mention this ladies and gentlemen....\n\n\nIf you like killing the undead, saving up credits for many badass looking  weapons, being in a claustropbic abandoned space ship, replacing Demons, with Zombies.  To a similar ''Doom'' type formular.  Then Bobbs your uncle.\n\nIt is worth every single penny in my opinion.  Genius little game design for four squids, can you really go wrong ?  The level of detail and atmosphere is nice, the graphics are good and well beyond passable.  More importantly though, with the mouse and keyboard this is a treat to play.\n\nThe game is far from perfect but you can see it has a lot of potential.  It will surely give other game developers, lots of nice ideas.  So it could  further expand, with a real meaning in a beggining, of an interesting franchise.\n\nI read that Dead Effect 2 is even better.  Personally, I will wait for a slight price drop.  It really is a no brainer though.... Well done developers for porting it over to PC.  It is simple but satisfying.  A good job well done I think. Go for it and see. "Splatt with all the eyeballs flying out torwards you and all sorts''.   XD\n\n\n8/10 is very generous maybe a 7.5/10 realistically.  I did not expect it to be this good. Buy it. Trust me. you will not regret it if you like zombies, you simply cannot go wrong with this.","April 24","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The weapons are pretty standard fare, but manage to be fun -- especially the electrical shock glove that you get at the very beginning.\n\nIf you like first-person shooters and zombie games, then this one is certainly worth giving a try. It can be very difficult at times, but the longer you play the more upgrades you get and the easier it gets to really lay into the zombie hordes looking to tear you apart.","May 25","true","55.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Only things that are missing is a melee attack, jumping and hand to hand combat weapons :). Yea you get a arm tazer but honestly in a hoard of zombies its damn near suicide. A baseball bat, crowbar or something would have been alot better. Other then that its all around fun. A little of dead space mixed with resident evil and maybe COD lol. Was a bit disappointed that there was no intro story movie and not sure if there even are any. That's always a big thing for me, great movie clips to dig you into the role of the character and give you more background info on your current situation. Yea being thrown into the game without a clue is often fun and exciting too while you piece together the story. That's what this one seems like so far.

I have played this game extensively and found many things. The game has or had great potential to be something good. I feel as though the game was half finished then abandoned after the developers made enough money for a sequel. My heart bleeds for games that coulda been great. It had an ok story, decent graphics that were optimized fairly well so that you didnt need an super high tech PC build to run it, and some good content, but it fell short after I found out the announcement of the sequel. The negatives of the game is. Clunky cutscenes, controls, gameplay, eventually after you exhaust the content of the game it sorta just sits in your steam for years collecting dust, and the ending was not fullfiling at all. Even though the story was predictable I found it likeable in a way. I also noticed that at some point possibly the game might have been being designed to be a horror game, but was hastely changed to an action shooter. I will admit it had great horror potential. Amazing in fact! If it was done properly and finished I could totally see this game being worth much more. As it stands now I would not recommend this game much to many. If your looking for a good quick game thrill then I guess this game is for you.","February 17","false","13.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Well everything apparently.\n\nThis is a port of a mobile game (which I should have known) so it has a weird pace to it that is instantly recognizable as such.  The combat promotes a limited range of movement due to the fact that aiming and walking around with a touch screen is quite difficult. When you throw a mouse and keyboard into the mix the whole situation is almost comical. You just end up picking off big groups of exteremely slow moving zombies by effortlessly shooting them one by one in the face, moving back a bit, and then repeating the process.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

I'll be updating this review as I play through more of the game; all of this is gathered from the first mission.\n\n1. Game feels strictly like a mobile port in many ways. You can't yet use the escape key to back out of menus, there's no explanation of controls, and the presence of giant circular icons clearly denotes something that would have been tapped on a mobile device. The last only became a problem for me in one place: unlocking chests / lockers / whatever those were. You just mash E a few times while the screen shakes for no explained reason, and they're unlocked... There also is no ability to modify controls, at least from within the game (mentioned by StarSepp in comments of this review). Doesn't look like there's any config to edit the controls, either.\n\n2. It took six or more headshots to kill a zombie in the first level, the variety in the radioactive yellow suit. Why?\n\n3. I can't jump what is this WHAT IS THIS\n\n4. Scrolling through weapons causes me to throw waste grenades.\n\n5. Text within some of the logs / items on screen bleeds through the perimiter of its textbox and looks ugly. Easy to fix with a scrollbar.\n\nOverall the game needs heavy work and probably shouldn't be available yet.","April 16, 2014","false","0.6"," 13 of 34 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","13","34","0","7"

I personally think this game is great. the weapons you can buy(a little too pricey for how common credits are but what are ya gonna do...) are really bad ♥♥♥ and make this slightly stiff shooter so much better. The Power glove weapon thing you start out with is very usefull and makes you add diversity to your kills with its very helpful pulse explosion and a high damage percise tazer like attack that really saves you in tight spots. i dont know if this is trying to be scary all around but the atmosphere that was used in Dead Space 1 resembles this very much but with a lack of audio(Background noises that keep you aware of the horrors around the next corner) to in a way make the rusty broken down space station seem scary... if youve read this far i think that youd love to hear about the guy that talks to you over that radio being some dude trying to sound like Arnold which is just icing on the cake that is this game.

Straight run and gun, blast everything, kill everything that moves, period. On that level, it succeeds.\n\nI'm not going to be too harsh on it since i bought it on sale for $1.49. However, there are problems. The audio sliders don't seem to be doing anything for me. While the voice acting is pretty awful, and gameplay is linear, it would be nice to be able to hear what's going on but i can't since i the music is so loud. The graphics are mediocre, but get the job done. Oh yeah, the voice acting is terrible, the storyline is pretty shallow and there are silly quick time sequences.\n\nThis game also hates triple screen, and unlike most games i have, this game will not use a single screen when i turn it down to 1920x1080. Instead, it stretches the 1920 across all three screens. Not cool. Really, the only problem i've run across in triple screen is that the tablets are unusable. Once i pick one up to read it, it gets stretched to unreadable proportions and i can't get out of it. I have to ctrl-alt-del and end the program. I'm guessing there are buttons i'm supposed to click. Maybe i'll disable my screen grouping, or maybe i'll just finish the game without bothering to read the tablets.\n\nBut forget all that and buy it anyway. It's a quick and dirty, zombies in space, sci-fi fps. The controls are crisp and responsive. No realistic anything to get in the way. It's a blast from the past kind of game and i love it for that.","February 26, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't allow much variance in play style, and you can't even jump. The first weapon you get is a shock weapon. If you run out of ammo and need to rely on the shock weapon, you might as well restart the mission because you're most likely already dead. The lack of checkpoints is also rather annoying. If you die or need to quit in the middle of a mission, even one room away from completion, you have to start all over again.\n\nThe voice acting is bad to the point of being funny, so that's kind of a plus. The biggest advantage was that I got some cards to sell.\n\nSome might like the game, but I wouldn't suggest it... unless maybe if it's on sale... a good sale, not just 10% off.","April 7, 2015","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This is totally not that game. However, if you're looking for a shooter you can waste your time on and not feel completely compelled to listen to the story, and can enjoy some different game modes in and just kill some monsters. This game is perfect for you.\n\nThe game is a horror shooter and it does this well. The atmosphere is epic and probably the greatest feature of the game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty on par with most other games of this style if not better, with some lower resolution textures in some places, but really not bad for the first game from a new company.\n\nThe story is pretty meh, and the voice acting is terrible. But lets be honest, you're not really buying it for that.\n\nThe gunplay doesn't really stand out as anything special, it's just average and works as you'd expect it to.\n\nOn a whole, I'd say this game is really average, there's nothing new here, but it's fun. I recommend it because it's priced to sell as an average game. I picked it up on sale for cheap and it's completely worth it. I would have probably paid the full price for it. This was probably intended to generate a bit of revenue for a new company to build something bigger, I believe they successfully did a good job releasing a product that's priced correctly to raise money for possible future projects, and also something that will give the customers value for their money.","February 25, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally think this game is great. the weapons you can buy(a little too pricey for how common credits are but what are ya gonna do...) are really bad ♥♥♥ and make this slightly stiff shooter so much better. The Power glove weapon thing you start out with is very usefull and makes you add diversity to your kills with its very helpful pulse explosion and a high damage percise tazer like attack that really saves you in tight spots. i dont know if this is trying to be scary all around but the atmosphere that was used in Dead Space 1 resembles this very much but with a lack of audio(Background noises that keep you aware of the horrors around the next corner) to in a way make the rusty broken down space station seem scary... if youve read this far i think that youd love to hear about the guy that talks to you over that radio being some dude trying to sound like Arnold which is just icing on the cake that is this game.

Straight run and gun, blast everything, kill everything that moves, period. On that level, it succeeds.\n\nI'm not going to be too harsh on it since i bought it on sale for $1.49. However, there are problems. The audio sliders don't seem to be doing anything for me. While the voice acting is pretty awful, and gameplay is linear, it would be nice to be able to hear what's going on but i can't since i the music is so loud. The graphics are mediocre, but get the job done. Oh yeah, the voice acting is terrible, the storyline is pretty shallow and there are silly quick time sequences.\n\nThis game also hates triple screen, and unlike most games i have, this game will not use a single screen when i turn it down to 1920x1080. Instead, it stretches the 1920 across all three screens. Not cool. Really, the only problem i've run across in triple screen is that the tablets are unusable. Once i pick one up to read it, it gets stretched to unreadable proportions and i can't get out of it. I have to ctrl-alt-del and end the program. I'm guessing there are buttons i'm supposed to click. Maybe i'll disable my screen grouping, or maybe i'll just finish the game without bothering to read the tablets.\n\nBut forget all that and buy it anyway. It's a quick and dirty, zombies in space, sci-fi fps. The controls are crisp and responsive. No realistic anything to get in the way. It's a blast from the past kind of game and i love it for that.","February 26, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played a couple of first person shooters before on the pc and Dead Effect wasn't that bad in comparison. The screen lagged for me a few times but nothing that deterred me from keep playing the game.\n\nThe powers the game gives you are nice but you would think that they were unnecessary except to make things look cool as you obliterate hordes of zombies while you fire on them in bullet time but I was proven wrong when I had to use them in certain areas of the game that requires you to use them no matter how much of a crack shot you are. Though they tend to feel Overpowered at times, especially at boss fights.\n\nBullet time > Empty mag on boss > Reload and repeat if you have time > Rinse and repeat. A little underwhelming once you understand their attack patterns. Then again, I haven't tried hard mode yet so I can't claim any bragging rights on that.\n\nThe story isn't that grandiose in comparison to a few other games out there but then again, I'm here to shoot zombies not listen to a story. Still, if you have the patience to take the time and seek out the tidbits of story background, you'll find it quite engaging...provided you aren't busy shooting at zombies that is.\n\nAlso, final boss fight, so silly at the end.

So it's a recommendation ONLY WHEN IT'S ON SALE.\n\nThe game loses most of it's value from the "grenade" zombies that will lob grenades at you and literally kill you in one hit. However, once you realize that money is almost pointless, dying often isn't even a big deal because you can just pay to respawn. I don't do well with zombies that know how to use weapons (I guess sticks/melee weapons are OK, but that's where I draw the line).\n\nOther than that you're in for a nice shallow kill all zombies that you see type game. It's nothing special but if you're a zombie fan it's worth getting this when it's on sale. A couple of bucks for at least 10 hours of fun is sometimes better than what some expensive DLC will offer.","May 1, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played a couple of first person shooters before on the pc and Dead Effect wasn't that bad in comparison. The screen lagged for me a few times but nothing that deterred me from keep playing the game.\n\nThe powers the game gives you are nice but you would think that they were unnecessary except to make things look cool as you obliterate hordes of zombies while you fire on them in bullet time but I was proven wrong when I had to use them in certain areas of the game that requires you to use them no matter how much of a crack shot you are. Though they tend to feel Overpowered at times, especially at boss fights.\n\nBullet time > Empty mag on boss > Reload and repeat if you have time > Rinse and repeat. A little underwhelming once you understand their attack patterns. Then again, I haven't tried hard mode yet so I can't claim any bragging rights on that.\n\nThe story isn't that grandiose in comparison to a few other games out there but then again, I'm here to shoot zombies not listen to a story. Still, if you have the patience to take the time and seek out the tidbits of story background, you'll find it quite engaging...provided you aren't busy shooting at zombies that is.\n\nAlso, final boss fight, so silly at the end.

Also the protagonist is a ex-special forces badass who can slow down time into bullet-time action sequences.

When people look at these games they don't look at what's good in the game, they spen about 9/10s of their gameplay time looking for bugs, or critisizing how the game looks. Yeah, I know games that are coming out now adays are choppy and rushed, even the AAA titles, but these guys/gals worked hard, and they are still working hard, give them a break. It is a fun game, I enjoyed the time I spent playing it, I didn't look at the graphics or the animations, I was looking for something fun to do in my spare time, and this game was good for that, I played it, had fun, and moved on to the next title.

If you say it's ♥♥♥♥ because of bugs, every game would be ♥♥♥♥ in your eyes, there is not one game that hasn't had bugs at some point. I really think this game is great, it may not be the most original game out there, but it's a fun game none the less. Whatever happened to people playing games for the fun of it, now it's all about which game has the best graphics, and which game has the least bugs, no one cares for fun anymore. When people look at these games they don't look at what's good in the game, they spen about 9/10s of their gameplay time looking for bugs, or critisizing how the game looks. Yeah, I know games that are coming out now adays are choppy and rushed, even the AAA titles, but these guys/gals worked hard, and they are still working hard, give them a break. It is a fun game, I enjoyed the time I spent playing it, I didn't look at the graphics or the animations, I was looking for something fun to do in my spare time, and this game was good for that, I played it, had fun, and moved on to the next title. No this game isn't perfect, but it isn't unplayable and it is very much possible to play it and have fun whilst doing so.","April 18, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Graphics are likeable, plot is not that silly after all, single player campaign is a bit short, but there are additional modes like Survival, Biohazard (kill X enemy waves) and you can repeat single missions.\n\nInteresting things - at later levels you can upgrade your suit through several upgrade stations (1 point each). Interesting enough, those points are permanent - you get the advantage in all game modes.\n\nGuns are nice, minigun is probably the best one. There is a small hole in the desing (I think) - basically when you have upgraded your suit a bit and improved your main weapon to the point that it can shoot and reload fast, then you can repeatedly do first biohazard mission for cash and gold and thus in about an hour you can afford like most of weapons that are available.\n\nThere is also a New Game Plus or whatever it's called - basically, a new game on a bit higher difficulty, where you have all you've got in a previous playthrough.\n\nI do recommend this shooter, it's very good, pace is great, tons of fun.\n\n___\n\nOne guy noticed that one type of enemy took all of his fun from this game. Well, soldiers with grenades are a bit pain in the back, but still this a shooter where player should react quickly. But after all - you can upgrade your health and after one or two upgrades you can withstand one grenade. Also try to save gold for autohealing, it really helps.\n\n","November 11, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are pretty nice and the flow of the control and movement feels nice, except the character moves way too slow and can not jump. After three missions, I believe it was, you are in an elevator room about to exit with hordes of these zombies coming for you and no matter what you do, they seem impossible to beat. You wind up dying lots, and lots of times as a result. Yes you can use grenades but there are so many of these things coming at you that you wont have enough, and you will have to rely on a lot of head shooting, which is not that hard, but the problem is the floor crawlers. They are hard to hit. The sheer number of zombies that the devs throw at you in this seemingly very early level of the game has made me so frustrated with this game that I stopped playing it. Seriously, to make a game this difficuolt so early in the game is a sure fire game killer for me. There is no reason to expect a player, after 3 or 4 levels, to be an expert and be able to wipe out an army of zombies while you are merely trying to make it to some other room outside the room you are in. If you try and go around them, your character simply collides with them and u are stuck getting your asssss wipped. This game started off nice but I can see it is a bomb after 3 short levels. If you want to waste your money and buy it, by all means do so but remember who was the one who warned you against this garbage.  Even at a small price of $5.00 it is a dud and a serious aggravator.

But it has some nice points and over time I grew to like it. Soundtrack is ok, The story line has "B" written all over it, but halfway through the game they come up with pretty elegant excuse for it (if you bother with collecting the PDAs), but still there are too many clichés. It has a very Doom3-like feel to it and, surprisingly, sometimes it can give you a nice scare.\n\nIt also borrowed ideas from other games as well (Mass Effect 2 hacking anyone?), but not in a offensive way. Voice acting is cheesy, but again, it was meant to be (obvious excuse on the devs part, I know) and if you are a bit tipsy it is actually fun. Obviously there are some problems as well. Guns feel wrong and secondary aim is just rubbish, which is a very low point in FPS. There are only few types of enemies (granade ones are really OP) and in the end of the story mode you are left with "Boy, that escalated quickly" feeling, but then you see the credits and you have to give credit where it's due ;). Nice game for such a small team.\n\nWould I recommend this for 5Euros (and in my case much less)? Hell yeah!\n\nBTW: After first start i realized that Dead Effect actually comes from my country, but subtitles are not correct at all, Czechs beware, It is better to play in English. :)","April 22, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

That shouldn't be ignored. It is fun, challenging, much longer than I was expecting and three times better than the iOs version i played beforehand. The tablets are great, you pick them up around the map and they give you extra story that Arnie/Wagner dosen't. His accent is hilarious by the way. The only problem is the guns are way too cheap. the upgrades are progressively expensive and really drain your cash, but the actual weapons are super cheap. After spending no money for the first three levels I could afford the crossbow, which kills the final boss in 3 shots and clears rooms of zombies at a time (just a tad OP). Your gold carries over when you start again on that character slot, which is nice if you buy the best assault rifle after 3 levels then decide that you prefer the stock shotgun... Anyway this game is cheap, fun, has no microtransactions and most of these first negative reviews are just whiny arses who can't get past minibosses (also, shooting grenade zombies in the grenade belt detonates them, the grenade zombies around them and everything in the room. just a tip.)

I enjoyed the gameplay, loved the atmosphere and found the voice acting very  amusing.\n\nIs it perfect?  No.  But it was a lot of fun and kept me entertained for the full 5.3 hours it took me to get through it.  I will be playing through it again and will also be buying Dead Effect 2 when it comes out.  $4.99 well spent.  Thank you for your work and effort with this.\n\nOn a (long) side note:\n\nI've been reading some of the negative reviews here and just want to ask people what exactly they expected to see for the $$ they spent on this.\n\nIt's not a multiplayer game and isn't listed that way - so stop saying you only like multiplayer games - no one cares.  If you only enjoy multiplayer,  just buy games that are.\n\nSome complained that it was too claustrophobic.  News flash...spaceships ARE close-quartered areas - just watch some of the YouTube videos of actual interiors.  You can almost ALWAYS find your way out of a sticky situation in this game if you use your head.  Granted, I did wish sometimes that I had the ability to jump over obstacles...but oh, well - just have to play a little differently and not get myself into situations where I would need to do so if I wanted to more easily escape a corner I've backed myself.\n\nAnd please stop comparing these indie titles to big budget studio games - that's just ridiculous.  So it's reminiscent of Doom, Dead Space or whatever other game you think it looks like - so what.  Unless, of course, you yourself have created a game that's unique and innovative and has never seen before?  There are plenty of big budget games out there that are also very similar in look and gameplay - so get over it.\n\nConstructive criticism is always good - harsh, smart*** criticism, while sometimes amusing, is just a waste of time and it's  only redeeming value is in making the reviewer look completely foolish.\n\n\n","October 23, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good assortment of weapons you can continuously upgrade with credits you earn from playing the story, or special missions.\nSecrets! Secret signs you can shoot in various rooms of every level unlocks story lore, enemy concept art, and more.    In-Game, there are logs you can pick up to further the lore of the game without being intrusive on the immersion, like Dead Space.\nCons!\nLike many people have said, there's a few outstanding problems that can ruin the immersion.\n1.Flashlight: Yes it runs out of battery and needs to be recharged. You hardly need the flashlight for the most part, as most rooms are adequately lit.\n2.Pathing: Sometimes the arrow points you into a wall; however, most of the time this means you go up through an elevator. Some games don't want to hold your hand through it; what's wrong with that?\n3.Enemies: The grenade-throwing zombie: When you get one-shotted by it yes it feels cheap...unless you realize that you can either A: Upgrade your character's health to be able to withstand a point-blank hit or B: Enter bullet time and casually evade it. It's not a question of cheapness; it's about using the skills the game gave you to evade the grenade.\n4.Items: Enemies drop glowing gold bars, money, ammo. The look of the drops isn't very consistent with the environment and sticks out, contrasting to Dead Space's drops which do. However, at five dollars, are you really expecting super-high quality? You get what you pay for.\n\nAll in all, if you're bored but you like FPS zombie space games and this is on sale, might as well get it. At full price, five dollars is still pretty cheap.","October 24, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are likeable, plot is not that silly after all, single player campaign is a bit short, but there are additional modes like Survival, Biohazard (kill X enemy waves) and you can repeat single missions.\n\nInteresting things - at later levels you can upgrade your suit through several upgrade stations (1 point each). Interesting enough, those points are permanent - you get the advantage in all game modes.\n\nGuns are nice, minigun is probably the best one. There is a small hole in the desing (I think) - basically when you have upgraded your suit a bit and improved your main weapon to the point that it can shoot and reload fast, then you can repeatedly do first biohazard mission for cash and gold and thus in about an hour you can afford like most of weapons that are available.\n\nThere is also a New Game Plus or whatever it's called - basically, a new game on a bit higher difficulty, where you have all you've got in a previous playthrough.\n\nI do recommend this shooter, it's very good, pace is great, tons of fun.\n\n___\n\nOne guy noticed that one type of enemy took all of his fun from this game. Well, soldiers with grenades are a bit pain in the back, but still this a shooter where player should react quickly. But after all - you can upgrade your health and after one or two upgrades you can withstand one grenade. Also try to save gold for autohealing, it really helps.\n\n","November 11, 2015","true","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found the option to use a gamepad helpful, but the game doesn't have complete controller support (e.g. Once paused, I had to use the mouse to unpause & the upgrade/buy menu only use the mouse).\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a pretty good game that definitely feels like it was ported from a mobile device.

For a total of the 4 hours I spent playing this game.\nOnce you've played Biohazard and Survival, the story is irrelevant and pointless to play.\nPros and Cons time.\nPros:\n-Good graphics\n-Nice weapon design\n-Fairly decent soundtrack\nCons:\n-Very limited amount of weapons in your loadout. 2.\n-Could have way better voice acting\n-Has WAY too many enemies in one room. There's like a hundred in a small room, and a thousand in slightly bigger rooms.\n-Often repetitive gameplay, such as rushing into a room with enemies in it. Read the previous con for details.\n-Has enemies in literally every room you enter, which makes no sense in any way.\n-Stolen sounds, an example is the SPAS-12 (forgot the name of this in the game) sounds. They're stolen from the shotgun from Halo.\n-Complicated weapon names. This is bad because you forget the names, and you get these random upgrades and you have no idea whether to be happy or disappointed.\n-Promises a lot of gore. Which it lacks.\n\nThe Cons list goes on for a while so I'll stop it here.\nBut their tactic for sales was a cheap one. Not too long before this game came out, the Doom reboot was confirmed. This got people excited for getting a game that you go around and destroy everything in. But they had to wait so long, so what these guys did was ripped off the old ones and mixed a bit of Doom 3 in there, and added new graphics. Therefore people would buy it constantly because they would need something to fill the Doom gap. Little did they know, it was not entertaining after a while. Short storyline compared to the one of Doom, especially in terms of time. Think about it, this game doesnt even have a 5 hour campaign, and Doom has a 13 hour one. This game has no multiplayer which makes it even less playable. Doom's got one where you can even create modes rather than be restricted to certain ones. And enemy creativity? Doom passes this by thousands of miles. Just think, it just so happens that theres chainsaw wielding zombies like in Doom 3, and shirtless fat zombies which are, again, from Doom 3.","April 2","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like D3, it takes place on a space station that has been overrun with Space Zombies. You, the Grizzled Space Marine, must stop them with your Space Guns and Space Grenades. There is much KERPLOWing and KERPLOOPing as zombie parts fly, and explosive things go KABOOM. Along the way, you pick up PDAs which tell the story of the Dumb Scientists who started the whole mess. Eventually you face off against The Big Bad Guy, and then... it just kinda ends.\n\nThe main difference between "Dead Effect" and D3 (other than the former's much shorter runtime) is the nature of the combat. In D3, you were faced with a steady trickle of monsters that would pop out of nowhere and attack from a distance with pistols, fireballs, etc. By contrast, "Dead Effect" basically repeats one combat scenario over and over again:\n\n1. You open a door\n2. You see a group of 20 slow-moving zombies start shuffling toward you\n3. You pick out the one zombie holding a grenade and shoot him first (optional, but recommended)\n4. You walk backwards and pump shotgun blasts at the rest as they stumble uselessly in your direction, since they aren't capable of ranged attacks\n5. You celebrate victory\n\nI'm really not exaggerating; that's pretty much the whole game. Personally, I found this to be quite fun in a mindless B-movie kind of way. But I could see how others could hate it with full justification.\n\nTL;DR: it's a boilerplate zombie shooter in space with repetitive combat. I found it to be oddly charming and competently made, and perfectly satisfactory as cheap fun. Others may (and do) hate it, and I don't begrudge them that. To each their own.","December 18, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not great, and there's better stuff out there. Now I am going to go eat a Mr. Big because I am a big fat fatty.","January 2","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So it's a recommendation ONLY WHEN IT'S ON SALE.\n\nThe game loses most of it's value from the "grenade" zombies that will lob grenades at you and literally kill you in one hit. However, once you realize that money is almost pointless, dying often isn't even a big deal because you can just pay to respawn. I don't do well with zombies that know how to use weapons (I guess sticks/melee weapons are OK, but that's where I draw the line).\n\nOther than that you're in for a nice shallow kill all zombies that you see type game. It's nothing special but if you're a zombie fan it's worth getting this when it's on sale. A couple of bucks for at least 10 hours of fun is sometimes better than what some expensive DLC will offer.","May 1, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's only 6.1 hours game time for me.\n\nYet I would have been happy had I paid the full price of £4. Thats's because from the start, DE takes off like a tuned up Doom 3 and it never lets go.\n\nThe graphics are great even though there is not enough AA to calm them down. It leaves us with plenty of dazzling lines about. However for the price and the intense fun DE delivers, it doesn't matter for a fraction of a second. With DE you simply get stuck in and have a blast.\n\nThe switching weapons to upgrade menu had me confused. Only by the end of the game I guessed it was mouse wheel scroll to select which weapon to upgrade. Bad point that because I tried every key and mouse click. I still managed very well in the game though because it was set to default upgrade the shotgun - good weapon.\n\nIf you think not being able to jump is a deal breaker, this is not for you. Personally I forgave it instantly, the moment I found I could exit open elevators before they got right down. The only other aspect to mention about the mechanics, is that the shooting is good.\n\nDE is solid. The biggest surprise is that it's quite scary, and extremely engaging. From the Steam screenshots it looks the opposite, and only questionably worth £4. I just finished it, and even at 6 hours long it feels highly replayable. DE to me was worth every minute and pound invested.","May 5, 2015","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

As such, I think a little slack is deserved. It was designed by a small team with a focus on mobile functionality. As such, the gameplay is a little stiff and knunky. However, it's easy to get used to with a little practice.\n\nDead Effect's campaign is rather short, but features new game+ and time and wave based survival modes to supplement that. You take on the role of a male or female super soldier trying to figure out why everything on your space ship went to hell while you took a cryo-nap. Helping you along this journey is the only other survivor you know of, Dr. Wagner. The basic plot is reletively predictable, but is a bucket of fun either way. Especially with the wide variety of weapons at your disposal.\n\nDead Effect was supposed to feature a co-op mode, however, BadFly bit of more than they could chew with that feature and the idea has since been scrapped for Dead Effect. An honest mistake that has been apologized for a number of times already. Dead Effect 2 is in the works and co-op is being kept in mind for debut.\n\nAll in all for the developer's first game, it's a bit rough around the edges, but more than worth the $5 price tag.","April 9, 2015","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I just finished it and it's not good. At all.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a port of a mobile game that was originally designed to have microtransactions in it. The port is not great. On my GTX970, the frame rate frequently drops when there are a lot of enemies around. The sound is also improperly mixed, with the music overpowering all the speech and the volume sliders literally don't work. The graphics are B-grade but this is an inexpensive game and considering the price, they look decent with strong colours and nice lighting. This actually would look pretty impressive on a mobile device.\n\nThe microtransactions have been removed but the secondary "gold" currency which is used to buy better weapons and an optional automatic healing device is still present, gold it just randomly dropped from enemies now. It's not obnoxious but it feels like a shoehorned design.\n\nThe rest of the game is pretty awful. The voice acting are firmly in the "so bad it's kind of good" camp which I actually can respect when it's done well but the story and writing are absolutely abysmal and the ending is literally a screen of text thanking you for beating the game and saying more is coming soon. The combat feels pretty good with a varied selection of weapons but upgrades require so much in-game currency that you'll probably just focus on one or two, made more necessary by the bias towards certain types of ammo drops. The enemies run the gamut of usual zombie varieties but some of them (such as the soldiers that throw grenades) are cheaply placed in levels so that you'll frequently die unexpectedly. Since respawning costs in-game money, this is really frustrating.\n\nThere was potential for this to be a good B-grade shooter which can still be fun but this was clearly a mobile game first and it didn't make the transition well.

Like D3, it takes place on a space station that has been overrun with Space Zombies. You, the Grizzled Space Marine, must stop them with your Space Guns and Space Grenades. There is much KERPLOWing and KERPLOOPing as zombie parts fly, and explosive things go KABOOM. Along the way, you pick up PDAs which tell the story of the Dumb Scientists who started the whole mess. Eventually you face off against The Big Bad Guy, and then... it just kinda ends.\n\nThe main difference between "Dead Effect" and D3 (other than the former's much shorter runtime) is the nature of the combat. In D3, you were faced with a steady trickle of monsters that would pop out of nowhere and attack from a distance with pistols, fireballs, etc. By contrast, "Dead Effect" basically repeats one combat scenario over and over again:\n\n1. You open a door\n2. You see a group of 20 slow-moving zombies start shuffling toward you\n3. You pick out the one zombie holding a grenade and shoot him first (optional, but recommended)\n4. You walk backwards and pump shotgun blasts at the rest as they stumble uselessly in your direction, since they aren't capable of ranged attacks\n5. You celebrate victory\n\nI'm really not exaggerating; that's pretty much the whole game. Personally, I found this to be quite fun in a mindless B-movie kind of way. But I could see how others could hate it with full justification.\n\nTL;DR: it's a boilerplate zombie shooter in space with repetitive combat. I found it to be oddly charming and competently made, and perfectly satisfactory as cheap fun. Others may (and do) hate it, and I don't begrudge them that. To each their own.","December 18, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the mobile version, and liked it back then, but this is a super upgrade when it comes to graphics and ambiance. The game is now perfect! It’s a space zombie shooter with doom 3 like graphics. The story is simple, the gaming mechanics are similar to other shooters, but what really makes this game special is the ambiance, really dark, scary ♥♥♥ zombies, and great dynamic shadows & lightning. The combination of the elements used to make this helps to create a nightmarish & enjoyable game. I really thinks this developer is doing a great job in porting this great mobile classic to PC with sweet new graphics. I can’t lie, this is a really good looking pc game, but it certainly isn’t trying to compete with games like DOOM 4, but it definitely seems very worthy of paying for such a great experience.","December 18, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too bad it feels like it was made in FPS Creator, but good it was made by someone who knew what they were doing. Having once owned FPS Creator, I recognize the bugs, such as the infamous tripped on a flat floor bug, the lag in highly populated areas, etc. Also recognize the zombie, weapons, and model packs. Not saying for sure it was, because optimizations seemed better, and scripting seems much better. Great work though with lighting, music, sound, and level design is pretty top-notch. Only thing I didn't like, so far, where are the barrels I can shoot and blow up the massive hordes of zombies this game has? Ack! Seriously this game is kind of hard on easy mode. Love it though. Despite other reviews, I like the computer voice...she's personable! It's the Russian guy who can't decide if he has a German accent or an Awnald accent....but it's not terrible by any means.

At first when I played the game I was thrown off that there was no jumping but over time I got used to it. Also the sprinting is more of thing you use to escape tight spots, not to use to really get around. Guns are not stupidly expensive and the levels arent insanely tough.

This genre has already been successfully attempted and mastered and this game brings very little to the table. You simply cannot contribute to a genre where AAA games will outdo you with graphics or gameplay.\n\nUpon reading the reviews it is a total joke that over 1k people rated this game positively.\n\n\nI bought this game for 1.35$ with leftover change in my steam account and I think I got what i paid for.\n\nThe interface sucks and is boring.\n\nThe game's engine looks dated and uninspiring. The gun models look flat and you start off coming out of a cryotube with arms outstretched. Who walks like that?\n\nThe zombies move in the same repetitive fashion. Feeling crowded? Simply run past them. It's that easy. The AI is beyond lame.\n\nThe music is alright and suits the ambience but the gameplay makes this game dead on arrival.\n\nThe controls are awkward and clunky. THERE IS NO JUMP KEY. Let's consider this for a second, shall we?\n\nYou are on a space ship in the dead of space. There are hostile undead roving hordes of dead roaming the ship.\nThere is cargo everywhere. You are running from one corridor to the next. Jumping and being able to jump would seem to the logical conclusion, especially when you encounter a crate in front of you. But in this game you cannot jump. There is no key map available for it. So if you are surrounded by zombies and death is imminent, if you slowly back into a crate measuring a foot in height you simply cannot jump this crate and will be mercilessly slaughtered.\n\nYour epitath will read, "Here lies John, in the vacuum of space on some cargo ship, DEAD and in pieces because he was unable to jump".\n\n\nWorth all 135 pennies I paid.","January 24","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You find credits in stages through out the game and you buy weapons, upgrades,ammo, and basically everything you would really need to fight an invasion of zombies. This game doesnt really have the best story its a nice story driven game from a indie dev though with somewhat exciting parts through out the game.  Is it worth 5$ yes its a nice decent single player game not the longest game its about 5hrs long and im sure you could beat it in 2 or 3 hours if you really tried.
