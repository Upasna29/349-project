This is a review of the game in early access, so take it with a pinch of salt – all features may be subject to change and improvements – the final product will certainly be better than what is currently on offer. With that being said, let’s get to the review proper.\n\nSuper Indie Karts should be pretty familiar to anyone who has ever played Mario Kart, Diddy King Racing, Sonic Drift etc. For the uninitiated however, in Super Indie Kart, you compete to come first place against seven other racers on wacky, themed courses filled with obstacles and power-ups. Those looking for a complex, robust driving game should bow out now – SIK doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but can capably hold its own with the kart racing series’ forerunners.\n\nArguably the most important aspect of a racing game should be its controls, and thankfully, SIK controls smoothly for the most part. Taking corners can be quite tricky at first, and the drift function seems to be primarily used for the boost it grants rather than helping to actually make corners. It can take a bit of getting used to for fans of modern racers, but once familiarised with the controls, timing boosts and jumps while dodging obstacles at high speed becomes second nature and a lot of fun. Best played with a controller.\n\nThe current roster boasts 26 characters, with a further 10 yet to be released making it a really meaty selection of potential racers. Unless you’re a devoted follower of the indie game scene, it’s likely that this will be your first time seeing a lot of these characters, and without knowing who they are and what game they come from, they can seem a little flat, with some characters looking particularly boring or out of place such as Elena or Cannabalt. However, for those in the know, seeing their favourite indie icons racing for victory is sure to be a treat. The overall character design is quite nice, and familiar or not, you’re sure to find a racer that suits you.\n\nThe courses at present are a mixed bag. Most look well designed with a nice variety in layout and style. The best courses I found where the ones with broad turns and plenty of opportunities for drift boosts. At their worst, the tracks are riddled with sharp, 90 degree turns and littered with annoying, seemingly randomly placed obstacles – I believe the developer plans to tone down these obstacles somewhat, and this would be a welcome boon to the flow of the races.\n\nGraphically, the game features bright, vibrant tones and quirky retro sprites, very reminiscent of its SNES era progenitor. All the tracks are displayed in a classic mode 7 style which is rarely seen and old school Mario Kart or F-Zero fans are sure to appreciate. There is also a screen filter option to make the game look as though it is running on an old CRT monitor with screen curvature and scanlines. This is a very nice feature that retro gamers are sure to enjoy and thankfully, it isn’t too distracting to the point where you’ll be at a disadvantage. The retro fan service continues with the option to replace in-game button prompts with SNES, and Playstation button icons – Super Indie Karts is anything but shy when it comes to its origins. The soundtrack is equally charming, featuring a variety of upbeat chip tunes – nothing too standout, but pleasant nonetheless.\n\nAt present the game is reasonably thin on content with only 15 available tracks, no multiplayer races and two newly added battle modes. These battle modes consist of the classic arena based combat mode where you attack by firing weapons, in addition to a Fist of Awesome inspired punch out mode where players swing for each other with giant boxing gloves mounted to their kart. While still very rough around the edges, these battle modes could prove promising and will likely be an enjoyable multiplayer experience. There are no unlockables yet meaning there is no incentive to racing beyond the race itself – If planning to buy this game anytime soon, be prepared for a brief experience.\n\nThere’s not much more to say about Super Indie Karts, in the brief time I spent playing I had exhausted most of the available content and without multiplayer I would be unlikely to revisit it again for a good while, as content slowly builds up. Super Indie Karts is an enjoyable experience and a solid kart racer in its own right, and when finished, should be a very fun, expansive party game. However, at the moment, the only incentive to buying this game is to support the devs and get early impression/give feedback. The game's current price wil be the same upon release, so my advice is to hold off on a purchase unless you’re desperate for some retro kart racing action.\n\nPros:\n+Great pixel graphics\n+Large roster of characters\n+Fun, classic kart racing.\n\nCons:\n-Thin on content\n-Lack of multiplayer\n\n\nTentative Score: 7/10\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 17, 2015","true","2.9"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","24","31","6","0"

It goes so fast that I can't even stop myself from comparing it to F-Zero more than Mario Kart. And that is BY FAR one of this game's strongest points.\n-A LOT of less known Indie Games could really get out there from this.\n-It's really quirky, especially those items!\n-Though i'm REALLY waiting for Carol to get into the roster, I'm enjoying playing as Lea from Cross Code and Tim Burr from Fists Of Awesome (Two games I don't know a thing about).\n\nCONS:\n-Something that you should have from the get-go of EVERY kart racer, even if it's in Early Access, TIME TRIALS, isn't playable at the moment.\n-Titus from Indie Assault is in the roster (This is a legit complaint, trust me I make games too (but not really indie games more or less fangames and parodies)).\n-The tracks are too short, even with 5 laps. 8 laps seems like a good number that could fix this.\n\n\nI'm really looking forward to this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/recommended/323670/","epeternally","Princess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/","2703 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSuper Indie Karts is one of those weird games that falls into the space of not good enough to give a solid recommendation but too enjoyable to be that negative about either. The biggest issue is that there's just not a lot to it. 32 courses are eventually promised with about half that number available now, and 3/4 of the forty-ish character roster already in the game. That shouldn't seem like a bad amount of content but being confined to a single player grand prix mode and forthcoming time trials with no firm promise of online play ever coming (local mp is definitely going to be in the game, though it isn't yet) doesn't really leave a lot to do. Especially since all of the tracks are so short that going through a four course set takes no time at all. Courses also feel largely the same, with the biggest defining factor being how many dickish opportunities for you to be thrown into a pit each one has. Generally far too many.\n\nIt doesn't play badly. The drifting mechanics very good and the kart handling, while a little bit slippery, is perfectly fine. It has a great sense of speed, though that contributes to a feeling of everything just being too chaotic, especially with how short the tracks are. It's hard to keep track of everything that's going on, I find myself rarely using power ups because I'm so focused on staying on the track. The power ups are standard Mario Kart fare, thankfully minus any blue shell type item. Nothing original but I appreciate that it doesn't have the bloated number of pickups that are in modern Mario Kart. This is a pretty bare essentials collection of missiles and boosts and that's not a bad thing, though it doesn't really lend itself to making memorable moments of doing cool stuff with power ups.\n\nThe music is great, albeit largely for being taken from other games. The art style is wildly inconsistent between characters and that really breaks any feeling of cohesion. Tracks at least generally match up with each other, though they're pretty boring visually without a lot of animation in the background. I'm not sure if this is just a matter of things not being finished, it feels like it is, but this may just be the state of things. Sound effects aren't noteworthy. They exist and they work but I wouldn't say it has great sound design.\n\nIf this was slated to be shipping with online multiplayer, I'd recommend it. The racing is definitely fun enough and I think that the nostalgia aspect, plus the pretty cool roster of indie characters, is enough to differentiate Super Indie Karts from Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, it's biggest competition. Not that it's anywhere near as good as Transformed but that's a very high bar. The thing is, that feature isn't promised. For me, and I think for a lot of people, local multiplayer isn't a situation that happens very often. Even more so with the fact that a monitor really isn't ideal for split screen and most people don't have their computer hooked up to their TV.\n\nThe other thing I'd really like to see here is mod support. Having community made characters and courses with Steam workshop support could really put this on the map. I think if that and online multiplayer came to fruition, this would be fantastic, and probably could even fetch a $20 price tag. But again, while the developer has expressed interest in possibly doing it somewhere down the line, it's not a feature that is actually planned.\n\nSuper Indie Karts is written in Unity, as is made abundantly clear by the "Unity Personal Edition" splash screen when the game starts, and technically it's so-so. The game looks pretty good, outside of the mentioned clashing styles, with a pretty nice faux mode 7 effect that evokes older games without being held back by their actual technical limitations. Only three resolutions seem to be supported, the highest one being 1920x1080, which isn't deal breaking but also isn't ideal. Native support for, at minimum, 1440p and 2160p is something that really should be included in any game coming out in 2015. Maybe this will be fixed down the line. I've had some framerate drops on an AMD Phenom 965 and GTX 760, nothing game breaking but noticeable. Doesn't evoke a feeling that this is tightly crafted on a technical level and I'd be wary of performance if you're on a laptop on lower end system.\n\nAll that's there now is a short single player kart racer that doesn't bring anything new to the table and suffers from art assets that don't mesh well together. It's got a world of potential and I am looking forward to seeing where it goes in the future, but would I recommend it? Not really. It's fine but it's not a game that I'm going to be telling friends about how they have to play this, and in less than two hours I already feel like I've basically seen what the game has to show me in its current state. I'd say check back once this is out of early access. The potential to be a great game is there but Super Indie Karts is still far enough from where it needs to be that you're definitely taking a risk buying now.","December 23, 2015","false","2.5"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","2"

I was kind of disappointed when it didn't make its goal at first. When the Kickstarter re-emerged, I decided to back it and was happy when it made it. The game itself boasts Mode 7-style tracks, which I like since Super Mario Kart is one of my favorite classic games and I like Mode 7 being utilized in various ways. The racers consist of original characters and characters from various indie games such as Teslagrad, the Adventures of Pip, and Runbow.\n\nCurrently, the game is in Beta and has several things missing (i.e. Time Trial, several cups, characters, etc.). Grand Prix  and Battle Mode are available for right now. Unfortunately, I only played Grand Prix since Battle Mode requires at least two players. Grand Prix consists of eight cups (five of them are playable) and three classes that have their own difficulty. Winning first place is the not the only objective here because you can collect Race Jewels and Golden Shrooms (which are similar to the Star item from Mario Kart series) to increase your overall rank for the cup.\n\nFor the Grand Prix gameplay, you race against seven CPU racers in high-speed races and you can hinder them with items such as melons or homing coconuts. You can also perform drifts for difficult turns and speed boosts. I enjoy the gameplay since I love to go fast and avoiding danger on the track. However, you have to be on your toes when you want to achieve the highest rank. Be prepared for the races as you the CPU racers will give it their all to take first place from you. It can be fun and frustrating, especially in later classes.\n\nThe graphics in the game is colorful and each character is sprited differently (some have a more 3d feel to them). There are 3d walls and 2d obstacles/hazards that can accommodate to the theme of each track as well. For Music/Sounds, I really enjoy the music of the game (especially Runbow Road), but the Golden Shroom theme playing at the same time as the current music is rather bothersome. Also, the voice grunting in the game is in most cases so-so. Doesn't really bother me, though. The controls are alright once you get the hang of it.\n\nIn conclusion, if you love classic wacky racers such as Super Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing and enjoy some of the indie games, then give this game a whirl. There will be news tracks, characters, and more in the future.","November 29, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Canabalt, Duck Game, Guacamelee, Freedom Planet, Adventures of Pip, Shutshimi, Teslagrad, and Runbow are the only games featured that I've even heard of. I mean, I'm sure that the developer for this game approached some of the more recognizable developers and got turned down, but even so, the roster is a little underwhelming.\n-In fact, it kinda seems like some of the characters are just there to fill roster space. I don't know what Toto Temple Deluxe is, but for some reason it gets four separate characters that each have their own character slot.\n-That's another thing: there's a really noticeable unbalance in how much representation each game gets, especially in terms of characters. The Toto Temple Deluxe thing I mentioned earlier is the most flagrant example, but there are other games that, in my opinion, probably should only have one character representing them. But I guess it's kinda too late to change that.","February 10","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The TV filter is nifty and makes me wonder what other filters might be added later for other nostalgia attempts. It does what it comes to do, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun. Looking forward to the new content coming and even the runbo track I hate made me laugh.\n\nLooking for another kart game that brings back the SNES style, enjoyed the other kart games like sonic's racing tittles? Well your next kart game has drifted into early access. Looking forward to playing this one online. Least I sure hope that online comes through. Everything else seems well under way, even the pitfalls of the game can be something to laugh at.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that it doesn't seem to suffer from trying to push the same racers unrealistically to winning, meaning you can indeed play the game's point system realistically for the cup win without getting first place every time. At least so far. Something I believe well worth mentioning with rubberbanding mechanics past.\n\nWhen you hit your speedy stride here, you feel that rush, even just starting with the 50cc, you're already having fun.\n\nIf I were to nit pick here, only a few of the characters I'm fond of so far, but there are still some there, and the sound ballancing feels like it needs a little work. That and though the control design as is, is more than functional, I want the ability to re map my controller. In this day and age, there's just no reason not to have the likes in the final product.\n\nDespite that, well worth the ten bucks, a steal if on sale, and a modern twist on a classic look with new track ideas that brings it's own flavor. This tittle is D bad friendly, yet analog ready.","January 10","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its current state as of this writing however is very work-in-progess as the stage count and character select are unfinished, and both time trials and online multiplayer are just currently absent\n\nWhat I feel will make or break this game for most are the indie games being highlighted here, which can be a very mixed bag. Absent are many "Indie Superstars", leaving Juan from Guacamelee as the highest profile name present, with some other notable characters like Carol Tea from Freedom Planet as a runner-up name the average consumer might have a chance of recognizing. I must stress the roster still isnt done, so there is a chance for "Big Indie" names like Shovel Knight, Skullgirls, or Shantae to possibly grace the game but I wouldn't recommend buying the game banking on the unknown.\n\nIts in a decent enough state for some good local fun, but hold off for now if you want to play online.","January 4","true","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"
