And I never recieved the meteors it promised when buying the monthly donor perk. Anyway it's fun for the first 5 minutes because they give you 500 or 1k meteors. (Basically gems from CoC) Anyway once you run out of those you come to realize how poorly and stupidly this game was put together. Now I know im going to have someone be like wait but you made in game purchaes! Yes... I did. I already have every game I want for the most part and my steam wallet is quite "deep" right now. So I thought hey! what can it hurt! So I bought it and only recieved half of what I paid for. The only thing I got was that golden frame on my profile picture. So overall no I don't recomend this game unless you want to waste 5 minutes.\n\nEDIT: (5/27/16) I spent 8.98 In total on this game not to mention a part of my life i'll never get back. And well I went to try and get a refund on steam. And the devs haven't even set up a refund option yet. So I'm left with a feeling of regret every time I scroll thought my library. Oh wait!

There are more games on the market that simply copy another successful game's style in order to sell well. But never have I ever seen a game that so shamelessly imitates another game, and that game in this case being Clash of Clans. Everything right down to the art style of this game is derived from Clash of Clans. On top of that, Age of Cavemen suffers from some several design flaws. Every time you launch the game, it gives you your "daily login reward", even if you have launched the game 40 times in one day. It's also extremely ugly and poorly optimized for modern PCs (I was running the game at 700 frames per second) and 50% of the gameplay is spent closing pop-ups advertising their Facebook and other such annoyances. When you attempt to exit the game, it even brings up a pop-up in hopes that you'll accidentally click on it! Also, the game can barely even be played without buying something with real currency, making me question if the free2play model can even work. Don't play this game. Do not support this developer by even downloading this game. It's not even one of those games where it is so bad that you get a little gag out of it; it's just purely lazy, corporate excrement.\n\n1/10 - Putrid","June 4","false","0.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Bunch of Liars, Lying Clash I call them. They're angry they're not winning anymore.  Clash has been bleeding gamers everywhere; through their eyes, bleeding through their whatever.  Cavemen makes pay to win great again.\n\nIn Clash you make these clans, they're not the best clans. They have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with you. They don't donate and hop clans. They don't donate then hop into your clan. They're dhoppists....And some, I assume are good clans.\n\nDon't get wrong I love Clash. Clash loves me. I do not repeat myself.  I do not repeat myself.  But I have a great relationship with Clash.  If these two companies weren't like family in gaming, perhaps they'd be man clashing in their caves.  Cavemen makes beautiful games. Big games. Huge games. Cavemen doesn't do small. There's no smallness here. Some people say the game is small and so something else must be small. I can guarantee you there is not a problem. I guarantee.\n\nAnd I build the best defence towers. Very tall towers. Like 100 a feet .  And I will make the cavemen build them. The beauty of pay to win is that I'm very rich.  I'm really rich.  I have like 10 billion meteorites. When I feel good it's 100 billion. But between 10 to 100 billion.  I'm really rich.  Private caves costs a lot of meteorites. You have to be wealthy in order to win at games, I'm sorry to say it.\n\nIf you play cavemen, you'll pay to win so much you'll be tired of winning by paying.\nMake pay to win great again.\nThanks Sweetie.","May 31","true","3.6"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","17","4","24","9","8"

On the other hand it's also similar to Battle Islands, which is one of my favorites.\n\nI like this one too. As with Battle Islands, there's a bit of a wait time when you upgrade your buildings... but you can offset that by using meteorites to speed things up. Meteorites can be earned in-game (at a glacial pace) or purchased with real money.  Your choice, of course.\n\nI think it's fun and I'm going to keep playing. If you don't like games with microtransactions you should probably avoid, but they're okay with me.\n\nAnd now I'm off to attack some more enemy bases.","May 24","true","12.7"," 7 of 109 people (6%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","6","7","109","5","0"
