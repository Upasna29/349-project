However, it would be made a whole lot better through the release of STEAM WORKSHOP for CUSTOM BUILT MAPS.

And THANK JEEBUS for that! If you think the trailer looks fun then you're going to enjoy the hell out of this game! The game looks gorgeous with it's bright colors, use of lighting and shadows, and sounds awesome with it's heart-pumping electronic soundtrack. The controls feel tight enough while running, jumping, one-legged hopping, crawling, and head-rolling, but just clumsy enough to feel like you're a zombie. I love all the ways Ed can get dismembered and still progress forward whether he's got no legs or he's just a head! The game ramps up in difficulty and pace rather quickly but you'll have no trouble adapting and learning from your mistakes. You will die a lot, but there are checkpoints that you can respawn at allowing you to keep momentum. If you've ever played Dark Souls, imagine this game as one giant Sen's Fortress... on acid... with clowns... It's ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying and a lot of fun!

McDunnough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calipanhead/","613 products in account","First off, just want to say I was brought here by Jim Sterling's positive review.\n\nI am really sick and tired of the whole zombie genre.  It has just been done so many times and with so little innovation in gameplay.  Well, this is it.  This is the zombie game nobody asked for but we always wanted.  "Ben and Ed" is one of the most charming and fun games I have played in quite a while.  It is a challenging 3D runner/platformer with a twist.  Ed (the zombie) can have his limbs procedurally knocked off from traps and blades.  What results is a hilarious game where you end up either crawling with no legs, hopping with one, or rolling as a lone head to the finish line.  The soundtrack is comprised of peppy 80's synth that reminds me of my mom's old exercise VHS tapes.  In a genre that has been dead (pun intended) "Ben and Ed" is a lively and fun indie game full of charm and originality.  I highly recommend it :)","December 12, 2015","true","6.7"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","43","52","5","0"

In each level, you will run, jump, and dodge various obstacles and traps such as spinning blades. Interestingly, you are able to lose all of your limbs and body, but as long as your head is intact, you are still able to proceed through the level by rolling your head! In addition, there are also challenging "boss" fights, the first (a gigantic robot clown) which took me about an hour and many many tries to beat!\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nChallenging platforming, although with infinite lives\nGetting some of your limbs sliced off is actually good strategy for beating some levels\nCollectibles on every level along with chickens to hunt\nLots of humor embedded in the game (Ed can also do funny "gestures")\nGreat soundtrack\n\nCons:\nLighting issues (certain dark areas are problematic)\nFirst boss is able to "lock" you down after he knocks you over leading to a forced restart everytime\n═══════════════════════════════════\n\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nBen and Ed is a very challenging 3-D platformer that will test your skills. Although there are a few minor issues that are easily fixable, the devs quickly respond to feedback and fixed a glitch I reported in less than a day. Well worth the price.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group reviews  here","December 10, 2015","true","2.2"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","40","57","4","0"

Landing on ur left foot instead of the right, can make u fall to x side, ultimately killing you. Problem is, u have no control over this. Your corpse sometimes have a bit more bounce than other times, having less bounce almost always ends in succes. This u cannot control either. Blades cut u in half regardless where u touch them, not just the sharp part. Just grazing a moving object can send u flying.\nThe simple things like getting severed by a laser feels unsatisfying, when that laser sometimes propels u forward, backward, left or right, like u were hit by a flying mace.\n\nThe game is definitely enjoyable, but it needs a LOT of tweaking.\n\nEdit.\nOverall it feels like a meh experience. The whole idea behind leaving ur limbs behind and dashing forward, untill u either finish or nothing remains, seems like a splendid and funny idea. It doesnt rly work in the game tho. Rather than running forward, u reset, because progress is no longer possible, simply cause u cant make the jump or cant dodge the income obstacles. Rendering one of the main selling points of the game completely useless.","December 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","32","51","5","0"

The levels are innovative and pretty different from each other and the physics are (most times) incredible. So I'd give it a 7/10.\nWhy just 7? Because I've got lagspikes so unbearable I often have to wait several seconds untill I go on. Which is espescially frustrating and gamebraking in situations where you have to catch up with a gameplay mechanic and can't take your time.

I played Super Meat Boy for hours and hours in a row and was always driven to finish the level, after literally dying thousands of times. And its the same with Ben and Ed. All you think is: "Oh, i got that far in the level and unlocked a lot of checkpoints. Lets finish it to unlock the next stage!" Quiet addictive...\n\nAs you progress in the game the levels are getting harder and harder to beat. Iam currently at level 8. Had to rage quit a couple of times, but after a few minutes of calming down i found myself starting the game once again, to beat this sucker. Still no luck though... ♥♥♥♥ YOU, SLUGGERFLY!!! :P\n\nThe game runs on Unreal Engine and is executed in a dark and surreal comic like artform, which i dig quiet a lot. The lighting effect are moody and almost disco like, accurately fitting the narrative of a fictional zombie tv game show in that manner. (a visual pleasure for all you weed smokers out there, too! not that i smoke any... *cough*) Same goes for the soundtrack. The minimal eletronic dance music from another era burns itself into your eardrums, so that you find yourself humming the title track and in my case the stage clear theme in silent moments. The controls are accurate and very snappy, which contributes to maneuvering Ed through the game world in an efficient way!\n\nIn conclusion I really like this game and iam looking forward to finish it, even if i have to i beat my display in the process! Iam sure you will see a bunch of awesome games by Sluggerfly in near future, because this is a good start to the world of indie game development...","December 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefinalizer/recommended/395200/","thefinalizer","Doomguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thefinalizer/","119 products in account","Ben and Ed is a first-person adventure game about a zombie called Ed and a child called Ben who become friends in some sort of dystopian future. Ben and Eds friendship doesn't last long as bith are kinapped by a sick gameshow owner called Hans Showmaster. Ed is then kept captive by Hans and must play in his gameshow, with the possibility of being reunited with Ben, who is also being kept captive by Hans.\n\nThe levels get progressively harder and more challenging, but also creepier and inventive. You play Ben and Ed as Ed the zombie. Since you're already dead, loosing a limb or two, or even them all; from being cut by giant swords, isn't a problem. You can roll around with just your head if you like.\n\nBen and Ed is a fun game to play, even getting squished, thrown 100 feet away or smashed by a giant hammer is funny. I haven't completed the game yet, but I do hope more detail on who Hans is gets revealed as you progress.\n\nOverall I think Ben and Ed is a unique, fun and interesting game. I can see myself playing it for a while, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, challanges and being kept on your toes.","December 9, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Usually I'm not a huge fan of plattformers, this game however is really enjoyable, especially since the humor in this game is pure gold!

After that, it hits some serious pitfalls.  You're tasked with running along very narrow paths, avoiding traps (sawblades, swinging obstacles) to make it between checkpoints.  It's not uncommon for these obstacles to come from behind the camera, making them very difficult and frustrating to try and avoid.  The player character easily ragdolls when hit and takes some time to recover.  When trying to negotiate narrow paths, this means any hit or mistake is usually your last, as you flop helplessly over the edge of the level.  This quickly becomes needlessly frustrating, and takes a lot away from a game with a great concept.  The music is extremely short loops and quite repetitive, so if you find yourself stuck on a level it can fast become grating.  Controllers are supported, but not in menus, and there's no remapping/control scheme guide.\n\nThere's a lot of sadly wasted potential in here, but I can't recommend this due to it's  poor execution, frustrating level design and lack of polish.","December 24, 2015","false","1.1"," 58 of 120 people (48%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","48","58","120","8","0"

Those screenshots got me really interested and I was excited to play the game myself when it dropped on Steam. I finally got the time and picked it up on sale for $7.99 and actually enjoyed the first couple of levels. Around the first Boss Level is when things turned sour. It became clear that the games controls were a bit too wonky for the platforming it expected. Also, the physics system is just unreliable. Sometimes I would find myself getting hit by a blade and simply falling down. Other times I would be hit and fly across the arena, meaning the whole dismemberment system wouldn't work. Being able to continue the level as a torso or reattach to my body was cool, but didn't matter if I was thrown across the level to a place where I was forced to restart.\n\nThe camera can also be frustrating. There are pendulum style obstacles which pose little threat when presented swinging side-to-side. But When they swing front-to-back the pendulum can get behind you and completely obscure your view. Essentially making those moment of blindness a crapshoot. Will you make it? Or will some other trap come out and annihilate you while you can't see?\n\n\nThis is a game I would have really loved to recommend. The premise is interesting and I really enjoyed the levels with pure platforming, rather than trap avoidance. But I just can't. I played for 80 minutes and probably only enjoyed myself for about 30 of those minutes. The only thing keeping me sane for the other 50 minutes was the game's surpsingly good soundtrack. Maybe another installment with more finely tuned controls and more dependable physics would have me recommending the game.","December 27, 2015","false","1.5"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","10","24","0","0"

It's very polished visually, but the controls feel both sluggish and yet flighty. Momentum is a huge part of this game, and yet platforming needs to be done in places where the player doesn't have room to judge their own speed. The ragdoll physics are attrocious, on the first boss in particular. My first ten minutes were tolerable at best, but facing the clown for 20 minutes was unbearable. It's shockwave attack affects the player while in the air, sending him or her into endless cycles of floating in the air. It was unplayable at worst, extremely enraging at best. Respawn points are not safe as well, leading to cycles of respawning into attack and dying immediately.\n\nTurning is very difficult, coordinating the camera is extremely difficult, momentum is incorporated and yet not accounted for in level design, and the ragdoll physics is much too intense. I feel genuinely bad writing this review, as I only cleared five of the six first stages, but the game was too unplayable. I could not complete the first level.\n\nI do not recommend this game and am also asking for a refund.","December 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","10","24","0","0"

Beyond the first few levels, the obstacles become too difficult due to either horrific camera angles, over exaggerated physics, or frankly impossible series of swinging arms, spinning sawblades, and platforms too small to successfully jump on.\n\nBeyond the difficulty and lack of realistic physics, the novelty of losing limbs is a worthless point. Many obstacles require you to have a full body to complete, so losing an arm or leg might as well kill you and restart you at a checkpoint anyway. Plus, reattaching to the body seems to be buggy anyway, and the torso usually just ragdolls as the head continues rolling.\n\nThis game is well thought out and has an excellent concept, but for now, it really isn't fun and I don't believe its worth playing or purchasing without some major fixes.","December 28, 2015","false","1.7"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","0"

It's not the gameplay mechanics that is the games biggest flaws. It's in the presentation. The music and level design.\n\nJumping right in. The level design for me fell mostly flat. The levels are just so boring. Even when the game tries to mix the variety up it's still just as boring. "Deadly lasers again!?" The levels themselves look drab and uninspired. There are lots of collectibles in the form of stacks of cans through out all the levels to knock over or "collect".\n\nThe music in the game is probably the most horrible aspect about the whole game. Each level consist of a generic techno/80's style synth song that seems like it's only 20 seconds long. When levels usually take around 15-30 minutes to complete depending on how good you are you will hear the same song over and over again. I usually turned the music off in a level after 2 or 3 minutes of hearing it.\n\nThe game does offer a decent challenge if that's what you're after. There a lot of times where you have to be really precise with your platforming. You will die quite a lot. There are "medals" for making it from checkpoint to checkpoint with all your limbs intact. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nIf you get an arm, leg, both arms, both legs, or even your head cut off you can still continue on. It does make the game even harder running on both arms just being an upper torso.\n\nAll in all it feels like the game could have been more than what it is. The gameplay isn't the worst around, but a lot more care could have been put into the design of the levels I feel. It's a 4 out of 10 game at best. Definitely not a game for me.","January 1","false","5.1"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"

First of all I had to refund it because of random lagspikes that occured and I just couldn't find a working fix for it. The idea of the game is really good and I was sort of hyped but I must admit that it wasn't what I thought it would be (putting aside those lag spikes). Funniest part of the game's idea is losing limbs and still going forward until you can't progress anymore, but in the end most of the time when a trap cuts your limb you  either go hyper ragdoll mode and fly off the platform or just i.e spinning blade itself throws you off instead of cutting anything. Also, movement was kind of too sensitive especially mid-air (lag spikes honestly made it unplayable).\n\nIt just got released so I hope they try to make movement  a bit smoother and perhaps make the blades actually cut something instead of being flat spinning hammer. It's quite cheap game so I sort of recommend at least trying it out. I believe they are going to do some tweaks to it. 6/10 in its current state perhaps 8/10 when they've fixed a thing or two.","December 9, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 40 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","8","40","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechmk1/recommended/395200/","mechmk1","MechMK1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechmk1/","238 products in account","See below for tl;dr\nSummaryBen and Ed is a platformer with a wide variety of stages. You play as Ed, a zombie, who wants to save his friend Ben. The game itself is split into stages, which you try to finish by getting to the exit. During the stages, various limbs may be torn from your body, which cause you to run with one leg, on your arms, or even just roll your head around.\n\nProsIn general, the artstyle is consistent and with a neat morbid touch. Nothing feels out of place, yet there is a lot of variety.\n\nThe levels are interesting and again with lots of variety. While they do keep the "gameshow touch", the devs managed to make each level feel unique and interesting.\n\nConsThe lighting in this game is terrible. In each platformer, you should have the ability to see what's ahead of you and be able to react to it. However, in Ben and Ed, the stages are often so dark (with a spotlight on the character), you cannot judge what's ahead of you. So it might very well be that, out of nowhere, you get hit by a cannonball and have to start over.\n\nThis fact sadly plays in with the notion that checkpoints in the game are very rare. You have to complete large portions without being able to "save", so you might be stuck at a certain point and just wait for your ragdoll to fall juuuuust right so it activates a checkpoint. I'm looking at you here, laser pit.\n\nEven more frustrating is the fact that its physics are a bit counter intuitive. Often hammers or similar barely grace you, yet send you flying across the stage. Other times you get knocked down from falling too hard and end up slowly sliding down a platform you should have had no problem landing on.\n\nThese three things make Ben and Ed feel arbitrary in either win or failure. "Winning" a stage feels more like "I finally glitched right", especially in the later stages.\n\nConclusion (aka. tl;dr)I wish steam reviews had a "neutral" option. I do recommend it if you can look past these screw ups, if you look for a challenge in a sense that you can do everything right and still fail. If you're easily frustrated, you might be better off with a different game.","March 29","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a games like this there needs to be a feeling of wanting to do better or try harder but all i feel was unfairness which made the levels just slugish.\n\nE.g, there is a level that you had to stay in the spot light and if you got knocked out or move out of the spot its a instant lazer death sentence. It would have been better if it wasnt a total instant death or even a miss or too which would make the player want to take more risks to take short cuts or collect the goodies when going though the level Aswell it wouldnt stop the flow of the levels.\n\nWith being a huge fan of 3D platformers & with all these pains I had alot of fun even if it got difficult too fast but there is alot of good and thought out level design.\n","March 1","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's quite a lot I can say about this. It would probably help If I sorted things into pros and cons\nPRO:\n-Controls\nThis game's controls are incredibly simple. WASD to run, shift to jog, turn with mouse, throw head with RMB, use with             E. Any doofus with a basic grasp of PC gaming can pick it up and play.\n-Gameplay\nFast-Paced and EXTREMELY challenging, this game is a pretty solid 3D platformer, with enough goofy, blood-spattered antics to provide a fun experience.\n-Graphics and Performance\nThis game looks great, with colorful semi-cartoonish visuals reminicent of Borderlands and runs smooth as butter even on my POS intel laptop.\nCONS:\n-Bugs\nYeah, this game is in need of a patch or two. I often caught myself pinned under a trap, not dead, but rendered completely immobile, or I ended up phasing through a wall and into a chasm. Not frequent enough to be a deal breaker, but still somewhat annoying.\n-Soundtrack and overall Sound design\nThis is the game's biggest weakness. Its repetitive techno soundtrack sounds 'meh." at first, but it gets real obnoxious real fast. There is also the issue with sound effects that last too long, or repeat far too frequently. I won't give away too much, but if you've played the game, you'll know what I mean when I say: "WILL SOMEONE SHUT THAT DAMN CLOWN UP?!"\n\nOverall, 7.5/10. Far from perfect, but a hell of a lot of fun. You get what you pay for with a $10 price tag, I guess.","February 17","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like it, nice soundtrack, fun and challenging gameplay. The only thing is such limited content, only 23 levels, there's 2 levels that don't even take more than 4 minutes to beat each. The game is only starting at 10$ though so it's still worth it but that's the main problem is it leaves you wanting more, most people I've heard from seem to feel the same way they keep suggesting to the developers of the game on the steam forum to include/implement some sort of steam workshop or level editor so the community can make more maps/levels to keep playing, which would be cool. Also, the developers are on the forums frequently to address issues within the game to supply answers updates and patches so that's a good thing. This game is still new I don't know how much more the devs will add to it but the other day there was a patch since it's around Christmas time and the player now has a red winter hat on which is cool =}. Not a bad experience with this game, just 1 level really irritated me, Rafting Coaster where u are on a platform that moves throughout the level but it moves so slow it makes attempts to get to next checkpoint take well over 5 minutes each, took forever to beat that level. The rest are great though, my favorite levels are Moonshine Deadzone and Ed Fillet.

I wish I could give this some sort of "Meh" score, simply because on a GTX 960 I cannot run this game on any settings without lag. The lack of optimization is appalling, when you throw your head you lag to hell, when you get to any point where there are too many traps (which is everywhere) you lag, there is barely a place you don't lag. I tried my absolute best to get through it and while I love the concept and what Sluggerfly was going for, I'm not so optimistic in optimization for this game coming soon. If you do want to get this game,  PLEASE  get this while it is on sale.","May 20","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076346059/recommended/395200/","76561198076346059","inside_joke","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076346059/","168 products in account","Ben and Ed, developed by Sluggerfly, is a third-person plat former unlike any other. It’s creative, unique, hilarious, challenging, and most of all, it’s hella fun.\n\nThe plot would make for an amazing cartoon on Adult Swim. Basically, the world has gone to ♥♥♥♥, and Ben, a young boy looking for happiness, befriends one of the neighborhood zombies, Ed. But it isn’t long until Hans, a big wig, millionaire and founder of the world’s hottest TV show, Rundead, kidnaps the duo. Ben is held captive, and if Ed wants to reunite with his friend and defeat Hans, he must defy death in the afterlife.\n\nSince Ben and Ed is a plat former, you can expect a serious amount of jumping, running, dodging, throwing, crawling, limping, bleeding, and decapitation. Since you play as a zombie, you can take quite a beating before kicking the bucket. Limbs will be lost, but not your spirit, and this provides players with an extremely entertaining gameplay mechanic. If your legs are snipped clean by an oversized scissor blade, there’s no need to panic! You can adapt by waddling about with your arms and hands. Same goes for the loss of any body part. Instant death is almost always common place in these sorts of games, but Ben and Ed throws in these comical and engaging methods of giving players a second chance. Crawling to the nearest checkpoint with nothing but your head and torso in contact is nerve-racking, to say the least.\n\nNot only that, but there’s a handful of boss fights to keep the action flowing. Speaking of action, it never relents. Each level is more daring and intense than the last, which is no small achievement. You will die… you will die many times, and many times more. But check points are placed at reasonable distances and I never felt cheated or at a disadvantage. Ben and Ed is not an easy game, but it is fair. When you ♥♥♥♥ up, YOU ♥♥♥♥ed up. There’s no one to blame but yourself for an embarrassing demise, and beating that level that had you pinned for over an hour… there’s no better feeling in the world. The motivation to save your best friend and defeat the bad guy in such a unique and original way enhances Ben and Ed’s overall entertainment value, and it really shines.\n\nBut gameplay and premise aren’t the only things done right. Graphics are top notch. I felt like I was trapped in some murderous child’s play box. The décor is spine chilling and ripe with pleasantly evil things to admire. Add in an awesome soundtrack and some silky smooth animations, and you’ve got yourself a pretty damn good video game.\n\nThis is the first positive review I’ve given on Steam without any negative comments involved. I tried to think of some criticism, I really did… but I can’t. Ben and Ed really is perfect in every sense of the word. With over 20 levels, bonus content, high scores and challenge stages, you really can’t go wrong with this title. It is plat forming done right. It is video games done right. End of story.","May 30","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
