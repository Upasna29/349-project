There's a few bugs that won't ever be fixed. As far as I know, the community is mostly dead. It's a pain in the rear to get started sometimes, and that seems to depend entirely on the alignment of the planets in relation to Will Wright's left buttock.\nThat said, when this truly wonderful game decides to work, it's really. freaking. fun.\nYou can make your own bizzare alien creatures, put stupid hats on them, build them spaceships to whiz around in, and blow stuff up. Including Earth.\nYou can make friends with, or eat, pretty damn near any creature you encounter in the first two-fifths of the game, and then start forming a society. Which can also be founded on either making friends, slaughtering enemies, or both. You then go on to play a simplified version of Sid Meier's Civilization, in which you get to make your own units, control the spice (AND THE UNIVERSE...no, that's later), and take over the world. After which, you can conquer the galaxy however you wish. Do you want to make friends with whatever alien races you encounter? Go right ahead! Is blowing them up and taking their stuff more your style? You can do that, too! Would you prefer to subvert your enemies through the power of capitalism, and buy their homeworlds RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER THEM? HECK YEAH!\nAlso there's some minor stuff about reaching the galactic core or whatever, but that doesn't matter much.\nYou can also visit alien worlds and go on exciting adventures created by other players.\nOr you could spend endless hours creating things yourself.\nAnyway, THIS GAME IS AMAZING YOU NEED IT","June 22, 2015","true","128.9"," 57 of 57 people (100%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","100","57","57","16","0"

All of those are epic. The cellular one is pretty cool as introduction of the game, but a little too short, the creature stage is very nice, I love it, this is RPG, then comes Tribal and Civilizations stages which are strategical gamemodes, they are pretty cool too, and the comes the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing best part of the game, the space stage, you are free to evolve your empire in an ENTIERE galaxy which contains more than 500 000 stars, and those stars contains between 1 and 8 planets (rocky and gas and satellites). The variety is so complex. You can encounter so many alien empires, you create your own creature along your history from Cell to Space captain. you create your own vehicules, buildings, villagers and spaceships, this is awesome.\nThere are some negative points though, the server are closed, EA abandonned this wonderful game, this is so sad.\nAlso, there are caracteristics for vehicules in Civilisation stage : speed, attack and health, that is not as customisable as in cilisation stage for the Space stage, too bad, I would have loved to see those in the space stage, but overall this is an amazing game with the biggest map ever and a very very very long gameplay.\nI have played it more than 300 hours as a non-steam game ! Play it ! it worths !!!\nI recommand particullary the Space stage if you like space and other stages if you like simulation, rpg and/or strategy.\nThe editor is very complete, you can customise what you want with lots of templates for vehicules, buildings and creatures.\nThere are lots of mods downloadables on the internet.\nVery long gameplay and amazing freedom\nPlayable adventures on different types of planets and different kind of adventures (discretion, attack, defense, quest etc...)\nFinally, I give the note of 9/10 to this game.","October 31, 2014","true","39.2"," 110 of 139 people (79%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","79","110","139","8","5"

You can even create your own galactic adventures and you can make creatures that show up as you play. Once you are finished with the creature stage it begins to become an RTS that is very well made. The Tribal stage is fun and you can either burn enemy tribes or become their friends. The civilization stage can be very fun but it is a bit short But you can buy other cities and nations or go to war and conquer the enemy cities or convert them using religous power. And then Space Stage where you have a entire galaxy to buy peoples stars and colonise planets and With this add-on you can do galactic adventures and make them.

With fun evolution mechanics, moments of truly feeling small, and the race for survival. This is one of the best stages.\n\nCreature Stage: You've left the ocean, and are given free reign to explore the planet! This mode is immensely fun as well. You have a small group of your own species and you go from nest to nest making friends, and EATING OTHERS!\nYou'll encounter random epic beasts, sudden space ships and meteor showers!\nA wonderful stage overall!\n\nTribal Stage: One of my least favorite stages if only for the dullness. While I understand it can be fun to have an RTS "Go destroy their tribe!" deal, I find this part bores me, and I just get through really quickly just so I can get to the next stage.\n\nCivilization Stage: OHho! Do you love Civilization? Do you love RTS games? Do you enjoy fighting 8 enemies at once all vying for the same planet!? THEN DO I HAVE A STAGE FOR YOU!\nMattering on how you've progressed, you're either a warmongering fighter with tanks, planes, and boats of mass destruction, a financial empire that's trying to buy out their enemies, or a religious zealotry trying to convert everyone!\nThis gamemode is amazing fun, and is really a better step-up from the Tribal stage.\nAlso, I love that the final ability for a Warmongering race is a mass of Nuclear Missles being launched at once.\n\nSpace Stage: You've done it!\nYou have progressed your species far enough that they've banded together to create a spacecraft that will explore the cosmos! This stage is vast, but I will admit that it does die out after a couple days. You go about spreading your species through  colonization pods, buying out other speicies systems, or completley annhilating them to make room for your own. There are some fun secrets here and collectibles, so you should have some time before you realize that the task of colonizing the entire galaxy is insane, and you go play something else.\n\nGalactic Adventures: Lets finish out with the final expansion. Galactic Adventures has you take the captain of your Space Stage ship and go on user-created adventures that will level them up. These really help add more content and increase the value and playtime of the game.","January 10","true","127.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","22","23","4","0"

THANK YOU.\nSPORE is an impressive game. In this game, you start out as a tiny cell (which really resembles zooplankton), where you eat plants or other cells/floating meat. You can call a mate and get to the cell editor, where you can create ANYTHING you can imagine. You evolve into a creature. This is easily the best stage. You can socialize with other species, or kill their faces. You can meet rogue and Epic creatures, supersized versions of regulars. You can add rogues and regular creatures to a pack, but Epics are off limits. You evolve into a tribe. This stage, and the civ stage are not so good, but still acceptable.\nThe Galactic God of sorts, (you), command the tribe. You can ally or kill off the tribes, as before. Civ stage. You capture "spice geysers", which produce "sporebucks", or "spucks". The sign for spucks are the same as the Simoleons, so Sims players may relate to that.  You can be religious, attacking civs with the Ways of Spode, military, which just nukes, or any other violent way to kill. Kinda in the middle are the ecomonists. They'll buy cities for big spucks, so that's always nice. After taking all 12 cities on the world, you evolve into the Space Stage! From here, you command your own ship, and with the GA expanison, you command your captain too. Beam down onto planets, infiltrate, prevent wars, stop invasions, you do it all! Your main goal is to reach the center of the galaxy, but around you is the imposing Grox Empire. They span 4000 systems, and kill you on sight. You can ally with them, which is dancing with the Devil. Everyone hates the Grox. They'll all declare war if you ally them, unless you have 200+ relationship points, which are bought with gifts, missions, trading, routes, etc.\nThat's all for the main concept. Now, for a little bit on Sporecasts and possibilities. Sporecasts are you, the user, and other's creations. Of course, you can just make critters, but there's millions of awesome creatures made and ready to play! Maxis made their share of critters, just to ensure no one runs out of little dudes. That's all for now. tl;dr: good game, good content, best bought when on a discount. do get the main SPORE game first, as galactic adventures is not usable without it.","December 31, 2013","true","127.7"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

Do you like making unholy abominations that God never intended to see the light of day? Do you like building cities, designing the buildings, terraforming then colonizing worlds? Do you ever dream about traversing black holes safely without being at the mercy of spaghettification? Have you ever wanted to start and end a star war with superior weaponry? Have you ever wanted to wage said star war with a hyper advanced, damn near endless cyborg race, but become so lazy that rather than engaging them in honorable space combat, you just destroy their planets completely, making the entire galaxy, even your allies hate you despite using it on the menace  that threatens to eradicate them as well as you? Then this game is for you.\n\nThis game is a complete package of God simulator, animal simulator, civilization simulator, and space captain simulator, each poorly executed but good enough to combine into a great game to spend your time on. You can create creatures, ranging from lowly cells to space-faring civilizations. You can design most aspects of that creature's civilization as well, such as buildings, vehicles (land, sea, AND air) and space ships. Each civ gets a different alignment and ability, depending on  the choices you made with them up to the space stage. One of your allies decline your deal to buy their planet (yes, you can buy planets out from under allies)? Play the correct way and you can just call in some space pirates to harass them,  or  ya know, convert their civilization to the great and mighty Spode  (lets be honest, this "Spode" they are  worshipping has to be  the great and mighty Gaben). Also, you can attempt to get to the center of the galaxy and discover a secret. It is a long and arduous journey, so be well prepared, well equipped, and have plenty of healing items and planet busters. Spoiler alert: what you find is unexpected, kind of hilarious, and really helpful...for a while. Also, community feature for sharing and uploading creations. There is also the portion of the game where you create a space captain to beam down to planets for missions created by you, players, or Maxis, but we don't talk about that. It's not that it's bad, its just that it isn't good.\n\nIf Maxis  does not make a sequel to this  game, then may Khorne smite them with the pain of a thousand ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-tearing brick poops.

With its seemingly infinite files and an interesting load screen. the references in the adventures, and the grox, and the galaxy. Setting a goal to destroy the grox and set a colony on EVERY single planet in existance, or to allie with the grox and destroy EVERY single planet in existance is a HUGE goal. To find the "third rock from sol" and setting a colony. Completing the all the acheivments. It is one heck of a game, and I'd say that this game is most certainly worth your time.

Unlike the original game, in Galactic Adventures you will be able to create worlds with advanced but easy-to-use tools. Simple, yet you can have a lot of fun messing around in the adventure creator. It also adds the adventures to be played in Space stage when you visit other planets, although it's not much fun. Creating is the best part of this game. If you feel bored when playing the original game, just jump into galactic adventures. I'll be honest, if you expect a game with good combat, awesome graphics and great voice acting, this is not the game for you. If you expect a game you can put time into and creating worlds you would have otherwise be good at drawing and writing to do, this is the game for you.\n\nDefinitely one of the best games I've played, before it was on steam as a kid and I loved it.

Previously during this stage you were mostly restricted to being a spaceship - which is kinda weird when you've spent so much time careful crafting the creatures that you're playing with and this was meant to address that.\n\nOn the plus side, it is nice to be able to play your creatures again and it does even potentially give you the ability to earn the super powers from the other factions (for example you could be militarily based, but earn a shaman super power) rather than just being restricted to one and some of the missions are kinda fun, although there is often a quite heavy focus on combat which is still not great and you don't have any equips for initially.\n\nThe down side though... It was a bit of a half arsed attempted by Maxis to cash in on user content and the amount of missions actually included with it by default seems to be rather small. Places will send you off to do a mission and when you arrive there you'll find it's a mission you have already played. Now at this point you can only progress by completing it again, but because you've already done it once you won't receive any experience for it. This won't stop other planets sending you on this mission again and again though. Player created content is frequently dross and the filtering system is largely unintuitive making it very hard to make sure you actually get any decent adventures.\n\nEach adventure also eats a planet. Did that planet have an expensive spice on it? Too bad. Is it contantly sending out signals to tell you there is a rare hidden there? Too bad. Once it's an adventure mission, even if it's a duplicate, it will sit there cutting off access to that planet forever. Since planets tend to generate them in nearby systems this can result in areas, especially around your starting systems becoming cluttered with unusable mission planets.\n\nGalactic Adventures is a great idea that was badly implemented and promptly dropped by the studio rather than being fixed. Whilst it definitely adds some much needed creature time to the space stage I don't feel it adds enough longevity to actually be worth it. If you already have Spore, pick it up during a sale if it goes decently low.","August 5, 2014","false","61.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/czarbomba/recommended/24720/","czarbomba","atomik_thunder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/czarbomba/","29 products in account","Gave a bad review for Spore, going to give another, different opinion on Galactic Adventures.\n\nReinstalled it awhile ago so that when I had relatives (children) visiting they would have something to play that wasn't A) age inappropriate and B) wouldn't ask me questions or have me complete a stage/quest/enemy every five minutes.  I don't mind helping but when a kid is basically having you play the entire game for them, that game is not for them.  Said kids were absolutely delighted by Spore and I realized what my issue with it was in the first place.\n\nSimply put, this is a game that doesn't know who it's target audience is.  Or maybe I misinterpreted who it's demographic is and said hey, you can make stuff, this game is for me.\n\nSpore / Galactic Adventures, is, a great game for kids (with some exceptions)... It's cartoony, whimsical, and they can flex their imaginations with the creature creation.  However, there are a few principles that a very young child will have difficulty grasping.  My neighbor's kid (a seven year old) loved the tide pool and loved the animal stage but once he got to the civilization stage it went south real fast.  So maybe nine or ten is the ideal age here.\n\nThat said, there is some absolute talent behind some of the player made creatures/vehicles etc and I'm going to take a guess that those folks are adults.  I had fun with the creation aspect of the game too.  This is where the game has it's identity crisis for me.  Some of it is appealing to adults, some of it is childish, but the whole of it appeals to neither at the same time.  Finally, the concept itself is a novel idea and one that I hope can be refined some day- in a different game.\n\nOnce that novelty has worn off, all that's left is a tedious cycle of traveling between planets, trading spice (literally the only thing you get to trade), looking at butt ugly creatures my neighbor's kid made (sorry, kiddo!), running home to defend against raiders, and terraforming- things that sound exciting at first and are exciting at first, and then get promptly beaten with a tediousness stick.","June 3, 2015","false","798.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was a bit disappointed when I found out that it was only a galaxy to explore.\n\nWhat do you do in Spore? You evolve your customizable species from a single cell stage to a technologically advanced species capable of interstellar space travel. But keep one thing in mind...\n\nYou are not alone...\n\nIn the galaxy, other aliens will be evolving on another habitable planet. They could be in creature, tribal, civilization or even in space stage. You can even communicate and buy items from them.\n\nWhen your in interstellar space, you can go to other solar systems and setup a colony on one of those planets or a gas giant moon.\n\nWhatever your species is, a carnivore, herbivore or omnivore, the amount of planets you can visit is a larger number than all stars in the galaxy.","October 1, 2014","true","73.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","1"

Its not worth it now as the world gets dull fast without all of the online features.","January 4, 2015","false","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That's not really a problem with the game, probably has more to do with my eyes or my inner ear or something, I'll just have to remember to take spaceflight in small doses.\n\nIn other words, 10/10, would risk vomiting again.","January 1, 2015","true","29.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Usually these wouldn't be available for anyone who didn't get the code back in like 2011, so I'm pretty privileged to have an account from 2015 with the registered parts. WHICH IS TERRIBLE. This should be made free for all, and this is one of the few downsides to Spore. The technical issues within this game, due to the fight on pirates is initially what ruined a lot of it's potential.\n\nSo it's a game you gotta take for what it is. There'll be no underwater stage, no female voice syncing no new patches and no cool new expansion packs in near (nor probably far) future, but at least the game has a hell of a lot of replayability, a lot of opportunities that relies on the player's creativity as well as opportunities for the player to make their own game within this game! It's gameception!\n\nI'd warmly suggest this for any person enjoying creative single-player simulation, exploring and adventuring.","February 26, 2015","true","217.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

The game community is expected to create their own adventures, props, planets, and everything else. Leveling up your captain is a joke and takes FOREVER to do. I think the thing I most dislike is the fact that every prop you make is made with the vehicle and building makers and as such considered by the game to be a ship or building. Want to make a fence or a signpost for your adventure? How about a bush or plate of spaghetti? You are now going to see just about every alien race you encounter using those items as their homes or ships. The other thing that gets me is that most of the adventures I have downloaded from online (I haven't done this in a year or two) do NOT work. Most are incomplete and look terrible.

But it includes fighting the Grox on the ground, escorting priests, sneaking into bases, stealing treasures, and other crap. I recommend this for the people with another world in their imagination, because this could be your world in your imagination. It sure was mine! Even for how much it costs totaled up with Spore (no expansions), it was worth all of the money. Buy it and see the wonders of these awesome 2008 graphics. Looks like it was made this year. Maxis, EA, I hope you will make another one even after 7 years. Or at least another expansion. It turns out that you only need to play one of your expansions.

Up? Pretty much all of it. Down? The fact there most likely will not be a sequel. Especially with this DLC, it adds much more depth to the entire Space Stage. Whilst I don't think it's worth spending $50 to get all the DLC, get it on sale, and you will not regret it. I have been playing the game on older computers since 2009, and I still play it today. Trust me when I say, the game is worth buying.\nPros: Amazingly fun even after multiple runs\nBrilliant to design creatures\nYou can attach giant versions of male genitalia and then share the results\nCons: Each stage could be more fleshed out\nNo sequel forthcoming\n9/10","December 21, 2014","true","40.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If your choosing on buying dlc for spore, Galatic adventures is the first you want because it adds Endless hours of gameplay. players shareing new adventures constantly so you will never be bored, with adventure gameplay.\nAnd whats amazing about spore and its dlcs is that they are so alive and fresh, the creativity people put into there creatures and adventures is amazing, spore really needs a comeback, this game saga has been running for 7 or 8 years and people are forgetting about it.\n\nWhen i first saw this game when i was 9 i played its demo called creature creator, I played it to the point where i really wanted the full experiance. So i asked my uncle to buy it for me, and when the game finished downloading and i opened it, the moment the game entered me into the spore universe i felt a huge burst of excitment, so i played for literally 16 hours straight. and then a couple days later i found out there is dlc to this. I thought wow so cool a galatic adventures expansion pack that i can play with my creature, i created and dedicated my gaming time spore. I beam down to planets and stop planatary wars from starting or recover missing keys. anything you name it i promise galatic adventures has it all.","July 11, 2015","true","196.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It returned to me as a surprise when I figured out that the only time you are allowed to do this in the space stage is when you take on an adventure mission.\n\nOther than all of that, this add on is rather interesting. You can make your own adventures and beam yourself down on those planets to snoop around and expand on what Spore once was. This part does not relate much to the expansion itself, but with this mod, you can also download a large variety of mods from the internet to change your Spore experience.

Plus, without being able to load multiple saves I have to do the whole thing all over again if I make a mistake. Seems like the only way to restart is to wait until you get beaten, which is truly bizarre. Not a terrible game by any means but this feature means I can't be bothered replaying it.

I don't care that the multiplayer servers have been shut down, it's just not a very good game.  Never in my life have I seen a game that was centered totally on sandboxy crafting that simultaneously made it obnoxiously and irrationally difficult to do so.\n\nGraphics are terrible, sounds are okay if you don't mind public domain animal noises.\n\nThe game is divided into five stages:  Cell, creature, tribal, civilization, and space.\n\nAs a small organism you eat bits of meat, other creatures, or plant particles in order to increase your DNA.  You get bigger, break into a larger aquatic biome, and do it again.  This stage is actually very quick, unless you want to be an omnivore, in which case you need the ONE mouth part that enables that behavior, and spend some time grinding whatever you haven't been eating.\n\nThe creature stage by far takes the longest.  This is the major developmental stage for your creatures, and all the parts are earned here.  The stage is basically nests of neutral creatures, nests of creatures that attack on sight, giant creatures you have almost no hope of defeating, bones to pick DNA parts from, and fruit.  So you make friends with other species or eat them, and tweak your creature's physiology as this is your last chance to do so.\n\nMany of the creature parts are purely cosmetic.  The ones that actually raise stats may not play nice with the other parts in terms of clipping or alignment.  I assume every creature was made with the in-game editor, and that I must be terribly bad at it since all my creatures looked like walking potatoes.  Hell, the first two races I made weren't even upright, the game is actually somewhat terrible at telling you these things.\n\nSide note:  who puts wings in a game like this and doesn't technically enable flying?  You flap, you glide.  Your AI pack members go higher than you - always, as if to mock you.  The game was designed this way.  What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•?\n\nThe tribal stage consists of half a dozen major tribes that arise from the masses of creatures.  You're given roughly 12 buildings/techs/instruments with which to make friends or destroy your enemies.  Again.\n\nThe civilization stage you finally get a proper city.  You can eventually have land, air, and sea vehicles.  One of each type.  You can design four buildings, including the city hall.  That's it.  AI is predictable, it's not even Civilization Lite.\n\nThe space stage held lots of promises of being really deep and cool, but honestly I only made it there once. I read later that there wasn't actually a lot of content for this stage, they were hoping people would make the bulk of the missions for them.   The whole game is a disappointing slog.\n\nMy tally:\n\n1st race:  Didn't know what I was doing.  Three hours into the game, it crashed.  I heard later that the game has a problem running on newer hardware.  Since Maxis FORGOT HOW TO PROGRAM AN AUTOSAVE, my entire race and progress was gone.\n\n2nd race:  I created an omnivore.  Or tried.  I made it to the creature stage, discovered I wasn't getting any of the appropriate mouth-parts.  Checked online, learned that to become an omnivore you have to do this in the CELLULAR stage, or not at all.\n\n3rd race:  I made the Krogan from Mass Effect.  Murdered everything in sight.  The civilization stage felt restrictive and obnoxiously difficult somehow, though dropping nukes was fun.  I actually made it to the space stage, and I got this feeling that there would be quite a bit more cool stuff if I wasn't slaughtering everything.  This restart's on me.\n\n4th race:  I made a true omnivore, got up to the creature stage.  Befriended everyone I could, enemies that attacked me became extinct.  Advanced to the tribal stage, discovered the game had classified me as a predator.  I'm sorry what?  So I reloaded, and spent the next TWO HOURS befriending THIRTY SPECIES, watching the same literal song and dance routines over.. and over.. and OVER again.  Advanced to the tribal stage, discovered I was now in the MIDDLE of the predator rating instead of buried in the deep end.\n\nFrom this, I infer that I would have to spend another two hours and befriend another thirty species to touch "middle-road".  I don't even think that many species can be on the planet.  I've also read somewhere that the parts you have equipped may adversely affect your alignment, so literally the ONLY THING the game has going for it still works against you.  No thanks.","November 29, 2015","false","20.0"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","5","13","3","0"

(You can get some pretty decent Adventures though if you're lucky)\nYou're also probably going to have to give your creature high stats on about everything and give them the ability to jump because most adventures don't support that and you'll probably get stuck on one step, That's also one thing you have to keep in mind if you want to make an adventure where anybody can play as ANY creature, or if they haven't god jump boosts yet or you should make a little warning about it at the beggining about Obstacles or parts they wont be able to beat without a certain feature.t\nIf you want to make an adventure you'll have to put alot of effort into it if you want everybody to like it, Which is a bad thing if you haven't got the time.\n\nTL;DR version: Upsides: A whole new way of playing Space Stage and the Ability to make adventures to entertain other users.\nDownsides: There's going to be alot of trash and I mean alot of trash, Not ALL adventures will be compatible with certain creatures so keep that in mind if your creature cannot fly or jump, You'll have to put some effort into an adventure if you want others to enjoy it, Which is a downside for people that are too busy.\n\n4/10","August 14, 2014","false","538.5"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

I cannot, however, recommend the game.\n\nThe reason i cannot do so is because EA does not properly support this product, from what I can tell.   Upon installing and running the first time, I was prompted to connect to my EA account.  That was simple enough.  The problem, however, is that the servers which handled authentication apparently were shut off some time ago,so you can't properly authenticate the game.    You'll get an error saying the code doesn't work, and if you try to use the CD key, it will say it is not valid.\n\nI tried a workaround by logging into EA's site and binding the key there, but that also doesnt' work.   It says it successfully bound to the account but doesn't connect in Steam. Contact with EA support is what gave me the information I've stated above.   The only thing I haven't tried is downloading Origin (security holes from what I've seen, so no) and then using that to obtain Spore via my linked account, separating it from Steam.\n\nThis game is entirely playable without registration, but there is no access to the creations of other players, which was a major benefit to Galactic Adventures (since it has a mission builder) as well as being able to reach new creatures for Spore that others created.\n\nI would wager this will also cause problems with downloading DLC and entering codes to activate it, as seems to be a major complaint on forums regarding this game.\n\nThe workaround is to call EA support (not email or online chat) and bounce through extensions until you get to someone who can MANUALLY ADD YOUR KEY TO THE ACTIVATION DATABASE.   It's just not worth it.    I'm reminded now why this is still the most pirated video game in history as of 2014.","December 21, 2014","false","49.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

With some practice and experimentation, I'm confident I could build quite a cute creature! The bug is an issue. I'll try it again in a while, and if my experience changes I'll edit this review.\n\nI bought the game and its expansions on sale. Again, it's based on a 2008 game, and I experienced the crash, which according to the forum posts from six years ago were somewhat common. I just can't recommend a game that crashes so early in the experience, unless you're willing to persevere through it.","January 1, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","2"

Two thirds of that is true, but this... This isn't even a game. This is just a bunch of mini games not worth anyones time but before you click that lame thumbs down button (yes you, 12 year olds that play this game or people that think this is "fun") l want you to know your killing yourself by playing this.\n\nI could recommend soo many other games it would make most heads spin. If you are looking at this review and thinking if you should buy this and think, "Yeah yeah crap and more crap, get to the point, is this fun to play truthfully or not?" than the answer your looking for is a really big no.\n\nIn my other review I talk about what I love in the base Spore game but this game kills it... I didn't recommend Spore (the real game) because EA is lazy to update the Spore website to make a account for you. This fails in the same way, you can't make a account plus its a lame set of mini games.\n\nAlso before I get the fanboy thumbs down of lame, think of it this way. I played this game on Origin for a painful, PAINFUL 100 hours so I know what this game is even if you think I'm being unfair.\n\nNot recommended for the simple fact its not fun, this is a chore. If you like chores to play as a game (which I really don't understand if you do) this is the game for you or if you hate yourself. (Also I'm in my 20's so a tween or younger would love this game, I guess?)\n\nAnyway its a 4 out of 10 on a really, really, really good day and a 2 out of 10 on a horrible day. Not even worth over the summer sale, pick up just Spore and the creature pack if you want to play the real thing.\n\n[NOT Recommended]","May 20, 2014","false","1.0"," 13 of 34 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","13","34","0","0"

One mission: Expand your empire and reach the center of the galaxy. Boooorrriiiinnnggg.. Until GA came around. It made it so you could make adventures, which, for me and other players, such as tklarenb, used as an advantage to make series, like Space Wars, and such. Sadly, a stage was removed during the beta. Equatic Stage. It came after Cell Stage. It looked fun too. Someone released a mod for Equatic Stage, but, it wasn't really like the actual stage. It was more like the Creature Stage with normal creatures, and the creatures had bubbles float up to the surface, making a blub sound. It IS all you can really do though. So people resulted to mods. Sadly, Steam installed Spore and GA to the wrong place, making it so you cannot use mods correctly. Luckily Origin has Spore and GA, where it was installed in the correct spot. Yay! Mods! More Parts!

You can customize your creature in any way you want, you can add hats or armour, or even change its body shape. I love making my own adventures, though sometimes it can get a little old. but one of the best features of the game is that nothing costs money ( except the game itself ), also, you dont need an account to do anything, except having friends.

A bit annoyed that I keep coming across the same adventures on the actual DLC when I speak to my allies in the game. But apart from that I'm loving the game and the creativity that has gone into it. Graphics aren't the best and their is some glitches that happen in the game that result in you needing to restart a lot of things tha you were doing. Less of a breaking game and more of a reload problem.\n\nOverall gameplay I'd give it a 9/10.

The tribal stage is up next, where you build up your societies assets and behavior. And then you go onto space.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beabosaur/recommended/24720/","Beabosaur","420SmokingWeedWithFreddieBenson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beabosaur/","183 products in account","Let me start off by saying I'm reviewing Galactic Adventures instead of regular Spore because I think Galactic Adventures provides the biggest experience, and it's pretty much the same thing as Spore but with the adventures. My opinion here can also be applied to normal Spore.\nGod, do I love Spore. Waaaaay too much. It's one of my most favorite games of all time, but at the same time, it's brought hate and anger not only upon myself, but upon my close friends.\nI know, I need to explain. It would seem that it's an unfair judgment to say this is one of my favorite games considering I only have 33 hours logged on it and I've only had it for a few weeks (at the time I'm writing this review), but I've owned the CD-ROM version since it came out, and I'm pretty sure I've spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours playing it. As someone who's soon to be 16 and grew up with a different era of games, this is one of the biggest games to define my childhood (considering I was about 9 or 10 when it came out). I got addicted to it, and sadly, my friends did, too. Every single friend I've shown Spore to, they got addicted to it, and it became the center of every friendship I had. Sadly, Spore wasn't multiplayer, so I had to constantly watch my friends play Spore when they came over. They weren't open to anything else, just Spore. It became incredibly boring and repetitive, and because of that, many fights broke out between me and my friends, which made me just hate Spore all the more. But at the same time, I loved it. When my friends would leave, I'd have Spore all to myself, and I'd play it constantly until another friend comes over and the cycle repeats. Sadly, I eventually lost my Spore CD, and for the longest time, I was at peace with my friends. We would actually do things together.\nThat is, until, Spore went on sale a few weeks ago. I remembered loving that game, so I bought it again, hoping my friends forgot about it. I logged into my old Spore account, and surely enough, everything was still there. It was all coming back to me; I couldn't help but shed a tear when I saw my old creations, my childhood. I was a little irritated when playing my old adventures since I was terrible at making them, not to mention I was terrible at spelling, but I saw it more as a joke than something to be embarrassed about. After looking over some old creations, I started a new game on the story mode, and I was instantly hooked again.\nAnd eventually, my friends got hooked again. They saw me playing it, they started playing it again, and I even have some new friends hooked to it. I thought the cycle stopped when I lost the Spore disc, but a cycle can never stop, it always repeats. As of this week, I got into a small argument with my friend over how we should do something else other than Spore, which made me realize this whole thing is getting worse. But at the same time, Spore is more fun than ever. It's the best game ever, it's the worst game ever.\nBut enough of what I believe makes it so great. From a non-personal standpoint, this game's still something to be enjoyed. The story mode has five stages to it, and each one is unique, which gives it a fresh experience. Each stage is fairly short, but replayable. Not to mention, a bigger variety of choices opens up when you chose to be friendly, neutral, or aggressive in each stage. It changes not only the way you play and the abilities you're given, but also what other think of you, so planning out your choices is necessary. Plus, the fact that you create the creature you play as is really cool. All of the possibilities makes each time you play story mode seem like a unique experience. Outside of creatures, you can also build vehicles, houses, and my favorite, adventures. Playing the adventures was a huge part of my experience playing Spore, and making them was just as fun.\nIt's pretty hard to look at Spore from a critical standpoint, because for me, there's not too much to say outside of the fact that what it does is really fun. It defined my childhood, and because of that, I've chosen to give it two different reviews: my own personal review, and a review from a critical standpoint.\nFrom a critical standpoint, I would give Spore a 9 out of 10, and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of games that offer a creative, unique experience.\nHowever, from a personal standpoint, I would give Spore a perfect 10 out of 10. I just hold it too close to my heart, and I've played it way too much to think it's not perfect.","March 30, 2014","true","55.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And surprisngly enough, with this DLC my normal spore has stopped crashing. All thanks to opening up this version of the game so far. Improving the length of time I can play as well. Had fun creating landsharks, bird frogs, and just plain old birdies to fly around with and see the would. A bit annoyed that I keep coming across the same adventures on the actual DLC when I speak to my allies in the game. But apart from that I'm loving the game and the creativity that has gone into it. Graphics aren't the best and their is some glitches that happen in the game that result in you needing to restart a lot of things tha you were doing. Less of a breaking game and more of a reload problem.\n\nOverall gameplay I'd give it a 9/10. But if you're someone that plays games for graphics and details then something more out of 7/10 would be for you.\n\nIts a great game either way.

One mission: Expand your empire and reach the center of the galaxy. Boooorrriiiinnnggg.. Until GA came around. It made it so you could make adventures, which, for me and other players, such as tklarenb, used as an advantage to make series, like Space Wars, and such. Sadly, a stage was removed during the beta. Equatic Stage. It came after Cell Stage. It looked fun too. Someone released a mod for Equatic Stage, but, it wasn't really like the actual stage. It was more like the Creature Stage with normal creatures, and the creatures had bubbles float up to the surface, making a blub sound. It IS all you can really do though. So people resulted to mods. Sadly, Steam installed Spore and GA to the wrong place, making it so you cannot use mods correctly. Luckily Origin has Spore and GA, where it was installed in the correct spot. Yay! Mods! More Parts!

If all the YouTubers playing it hasn't spoken for this game already, then I guess I will.\n\nSpore is a game where you evolve your creature into sentience, where you can explore the galaxy. Galactic Adventures expands onto the space age, adding things like quests and a way to make your captains stronger. It's really a lot of fun, and you can go on it forever. I'm at a hundred hours and I'm about to put some more in right now. The graphics are still fairly good, even by today's standards. There are a few problems with it and bugs with it. If your going to play, be aware of this: Don't make your creature too complex because you need space to add gear to your captain.

Graphics aren't the best and their is some glitches that happen in the game that result in you needing to restart a lot of things tha you were doing.

As you would come to expect from Spore, you can of course create your own missions in the Adventure Creator, and share them with other Spore players to play and enjoy. Again, as it adds another level of depth to the original Spore and Spore IS required in order to play Galactic Adventures. The going price is $20, which is more feasible than the Creepy and Cute Parts Pack as this adds more than just parts, but a new layer of fun, and could honestly be enjoyable as a stand-alone game for those that do not wish the same level of micro-management that people who are well into the Space Stage in Spore. If you think $20 is too steep, or want to have it all, wait for a sale!","July 3, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love revisiting this game every few months, even though I grew tired of playing it daily a long time ago. It is a real shame that EA shuns this game and it's community because the last remaining people of the once thriving game community are still there and still producing amazing things.

One, the servers are very unstable; you have to re-login everytime after you exit the creator and want to share your creation, two, the game crashes very often, especially when the game accidentally downloads a Creepy and Cute creature, it doesn't even show that you don't have that DLC! There could've been more parts, I've seen Maxis cells have parts that players can't access, which is very bizarre. In addition, I would love to see a sequel of this game; the enhancements, additions, replacements, and removal of issues could be a lot better. I guarantee that if you ask every player that owns Spore, if you asked them if they would like a Spore 2, over 90% would say yes.  Overall, this DLC allows you to install mods, create adventures, I'm glad I chose to get this DLC first. Adventure creating is time-consuming, but it's worth it in the end.

One, the servers are very unstable; you have to re-login everytime after you exit the creator and want to share your creation, two, the game crashes very often, especially when the game accidentally downloads a Creepy and Cute creature, it doesn't even show that you don't have that DLC! There could've been more parts, I've seen Maxis cells have parts that players can't access, which is very bizarre. In addition, I would love to see a sequel of this game; the enhancements, additions, replacements, and removal of issues could be a lot better. I guarantee that if you ask every player that owns Spore, if you asked them if they would like a Spore 2, over 90% would say yes.  Overall, this DLC allows you to install mods, create adventures, I'm glad I chose to get this DLC first. Adventure creating is time-consuming, but it's worth it in the end. That is the end of this review, I highly recommend this DLC and game, and check out my guide on Adventure creating!","December 13, 2015","true","898.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Starting out as a microscopic organism and evolving your way towards intelligence, all the while developing your species the way you want: an insect, a bird, a reptile, or a totally bizarre hybrid of 2 or more different animal types, say, a giant spider-like creature with a shark mouth and bird wings.\n\nAlthough the gameplay may not be very spectacular, being able to create almost any creature, building, vehicle, and spaceship your mind can possibly conceive is the truly greatest part of Spore. Spore's online functions no longer work, But i personally think it's much better to play Spore without downloading User Generated Content. Especially since default/Maxis creations often always look so much better than user made content, which a great majority are usually just a random mess of parts, horrible-looking/poorly-made creatures, giant ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• monsters, creatures with massively oversized (and sometimes spikey) genitalia, or OP creatures with all possible stats at maximum.","October 2, 2015","true","304.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But still GET THIS GAME NOW it's...impossible to put it into words from me...and it will NOT be updated ever after they left spore for darkspore, they left it where it was and darkspore failed so thats when the spore franchise died in the void...but you can still see the cracks edges and beauty behind the distractions...so please get this game it will change your life for the good...if your not a stubborn brat.
