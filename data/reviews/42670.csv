"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MidirCuRoi/recommended/42670/","MidirCuRoi","Midir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MidirCuRoi/","454 products in account","Singularity is something of an underappreciated FPS from a somewhat underappreciated developer. Having already put out classics like Heretic, Hexen and Jedi Knight II, Raven again went on a solo effort with Singularity in 2010 and it was largely deemed 'pretty good' by reviewers. However, I think it's much more than that. Although hamstringed a little by a few modern FPS conventions, Singularity does a great job of feeling like a classic shooter, ending up somewhere awkward between Serious Sam and Call of Duty.\n\nTo its merit however, the enemies are smart and strong despite being a little cliché, the weapons all have a lot of punch and character, even if they're a machine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, etc. and there's many secrets, upgrades and places to explore despite being a mostly linear game. In short, Raven seemed to want to make this game much more than the sum of its parts, and in my eyes, they completely succeeded. The time manipulation mechanic, despite being vital to progress, seems more like icing on the cake than a core game mechanic however, so don't expect anything more spectacular than an amazing FPS with some additional superpowers!\n\nAverage Game Length? I took around 8 hours to get through the story on the hardest setting, it could take more or less depending on your skill or desire to be a completionist.\n\nA Bit Like? TimeShift, BioShock\n\nIs It Fun? The TMD provides some serious fun, the story is engaging and the weapons make mincemeat out of your enemies, a big yes.\n\nWorth The Price? £14.99 is pretty much half the price of a retail title, fitting considering you'll be lucky to get a multiplayer game going given the game's age and lack of popularity. For the price, the solo campaign is more than worth it although consider carefully that that's all you'll be getting out of it if you're on the fence.","November 26, 2013","true","8.2"," 159 of 166 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","159","166","0","0"

It doesn't provide anything new but it does make the game more interesting particularly when you travel between the past and present and see the changes in the environment.\n\n+ Good atmosphere featuring a post apocalyptic setting\n\n+ Creative weapons that feel great to use and can be upgraded by finding upgrade kits scattered throughout the levels.\n\n+ In addition to weapon upgrades, you will find blueprints and experience to upgrade your character. It provides a nice rpg element to the game.\n\n+ Good sense of pacing - The levels feel different, the gameplay changes up every once in a while, it never feels like you're doing the same thing over and over again despite shooting down hordes of enemies.\n\n+ Despite the linear nature of the game and the levels, exploration is heavily rewarded in the form of experience.\n\n+ The main premise of the game is that you are given a time manipulation device used to age/renew objects for some light puzzle solving. It's a good premise but I never felt like they fully utilized it.\n\n+ Nice boss battles\n\n+ Good buildup to the end of the game and a solid ending\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nThe graphics even for its time doesn't really stand out, textures are very bland.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- no sub title option\n\n- audio bug that needs to be fixed (check forum for soultion)\n\n- Multiplayer is dead\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game borrows different ideas from different games and puts it all together in one satisfying package. This is a very underrated game that deserved more success, too bad Activision thought differently and sent it out to die upon release. If you are looking for a FPS game and still haven't gotten Singularity then do yourself a favor and pick it up, you won't regret it.\n","June 24, 2015","true","6.0"," 64 of 67 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","64","67","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coffee009/recommended/42670/","Coffee009","Coffee009","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coffee009/","437 products in account","Singularity, Singularity Singularity, what a gem of a game. Alright, I am not going to lie, I played this at a friends house and did not know what to expect, other than the fact the reviews were meh and the game looked cool. I have to admit, I REALLY like this game. Like, I liked it more than Bioshock Infinite.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is very fun and straight forward, the gunplay is intense and satisfying, you get a cool device that supports you in fights and puzzles, and while linear, you are rewarded well for exploring. You get the standard FPS arsenal with some extra twists, a revolver, a assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle (which slows down time when scoped), a rifle which fires spikes into your enemies and explodes on them, a grenade launcher that allows you to control the grenades, and a minigun. Two more weapons you get are limited in ammo but fun as hell to use, these are the rocket launcher (self explanatory) and the seeker rifle, which when fired, allows you to control the bullet which explodes on enemies. Weapons can be upgraded throughout the game to level up damage, mag size or reload speed, so you can pick your favorite gun and when tougher foes appear, it wont become useless. Now the TMD you get is a nifty little device, it allows you to control time in your advantage, so you can use it to solve puzzles, pick up useful items and bring them to you (like the gravity gun in Half Life), age enemies to the point they are dust, or change the environment (mostly used for puzzles, or to get extra goodies such as health and ammo) I did enjoy the gameplay more than Bioshock Infinite, since the games play VERY similarly, but in Singularity I find the upgrades for my guns and character a lot more fun then in Infinite, and the fact that the game has better ammo economy then in Infinite, and while I love myself a 'oh sh!t' situation, Infinite hardly gave me any ammo to work with, most weapons just carried a spare clip or two, while in Singularity you are given enough ammo to last a firefight or two, but its enough to where you should think about what you are using. I know it may be a small part of the game to nitpick but lack of ammo can really slow down the pace of a game. (also, this game can be REALLY hard at some points, not frustrating hard but challenging, this is on the normal difficulty too)\n\n(The game took me 8 hours to beat my first time playing it on the Xbox 360, then 5 hours through playing it on the PC, I am judging this game only on single player, as I have yet to play multiplayer)\n\nGraphics: The graphics get the job done, they look pretty damn good like any other game nowadays, explosions are magnificent and the sci-fi elements are colorful and cool to look at. Not much to say honestly, other then some areas where textures take a second to appear or kinda mess up but that is kind a small complaint from me.\n\nSound: Same as in the graphics, not much to say really, the weapons sound powerful and the voice acting gets the job done. Also a nice shoutout to some creepy atmospheric sounds you hear when the game gets creepier.\n\nStory: While the story is not the best, the story kept me interested through the whole game, with a cool ending to boot. The story in a nutshell is you are sent to a Russian island of Katorga 12 to investigate some weird crap going down, your helicopter is shot down, and you are left to find your friends and gtfo the island, but some more crap complicates with a huge Singularity that has been on the island for quite some time that has been mutating people and creating rifts in time. Backstory on the island and what has been going on is told through notes to be found, writing on walls and tape recorders which are fairly interesting to listen to (Although I will complain they lack subtitles) The things you find that give you story gives the story a good amount of life as you hear or read what the people think as the Singularity fails and the mutants and military take action. Like I said, the story may not be the best, but it is interesting and fun to go through. The game does remind me of Bioshock Infinite like I said before, with the game playing very much like it, the audio logs and time travel, but honestly I though the time travel parts and bits of the story were done better in Singularity)\n\nConclusion: Honestly, if you want a fun FPS adventure, give this game a try. I know it did not review the best and not everyone has heard of it, but I find it as a nice little gem. The story is a nice medium length and interesting, and I liked the gameplay a lot. I'll give this game a 9/10, the story could be better, and the graphics kinda mess up at points, but I really enjoyed myself, I even played the game twice through (kinda back to back) because I liked it so much.\n\nEDIT: I strongly recommend you play on hard for your first play through, you progress through the game but enemies tend to fall off, but on hard the game stays consistent with your upgrades and provides a mostly fair challenge.","December 2, 2013","true","11.7"," 64 of 75 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","64","75","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/42670/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Singularity is a FPS game that takes place in a small Russian controlled island, where they conduct dangerous experiments involving a new element called E-99. This is triggered by their fear of America's knowledge of Atomic Energy and in that island they found an element that greatly surpasses that power. The problems arise due to the Russian's overworking everyone on the island and with everyone handling a potentially dangerous new source of energy, an accident inevitably happens. That is when you, an American soldier named Renko and a second team are sent in to investigate. Before you can land, a shock-wave causes both helicopters to go out of control and leaves you as the only known survivor. You land in a small abandoned dock village and make your way into a building full of old timey Russian propaganda, map of the island's facilities and a statue of Joseph Stalin's head. Another shock-wave appears and suddenly the room is full of people and on fire. As you try to make your way out of the crumbling building, you rescue a man from death. The shock-wave wave reappears and you are now by yourself and notice that the statue of Stalin's head is now replaced with that of the man you saved. This is where our adventure truly begins.\n\nThe environments are now off somehow, you can't put your finger on why but you know you are in danger. The opening scene has amazing atmosphere and a lingering sense of dread since you are unarmed. You go through quite a bit being unarmed and the tension of not knowing what is out there is used very effectively. Ghosts appear from time to time that show the last moments of the deceased and the stories of what happened to your surroundings. This game does a great job at pulling you in and getting you interested in the twisted world you find yourself in. Eventually you do get a pistol to defend yourself from the horrors that await, but it is very weak and there is limited ammo to be had. How I wish the game would have stayed this way, but atlas you run into both an assault rifle and a shotgun in quick succession, immediately destroying any fear you may have of what lurks in the shadows since you are now armed to the teeth with powerful weapons. That issue only worsens as you are granted more and more powerful weapons as the story goes on. You can only carry two weapons of any type at a time but ammo is very frequent and I never found myself lacking in ammo. Weapon kits are scattered about that allow you to upgrade your already powerful weapons. This game got very easy, real fast on the Normal difficulty. If you have decent experience with the genre or want to maintain the horror aspect, I would recommend going for hard the first time through.\n\nBesides your weapons, you will also be able to upgrade yourself with E-99 to allow you to run longer, hold your breath underwater longer and much more. Well since the fact that you being able to manipulate time is the game's first selling point I suppose it's not a spoiler to say that you will have other-worldly powers that you can also upgrade. These are a very nice addition to the game and gives you many more options during fights such as aging people into corpses or tossing an explosive your enemies’ way to name a few. Your powers are not unlimited however and are reliant on energy which slowly refills over time. It does add to the problem of being an overpowered killing machine with no need to fear anything, but it is a ton of fun to freeze time around a group of enemies, shooting them all in the face and unfreezing time before they knew what hit them. Thankfully one feature that helps alleviate you feeling like you can't be killed is that your health does not regenerate. If you are careless in fights your health will whittle down and you will run the risk of dying by what is usually a laugh-worthy attempt at killing Renko the Space Wizard. Health is recovered via syringes laying around that are used on the spot or health kits that you can carry around, up to five at the start. Health kits do have an animation of wrapping your wound before your health is regenerated making you an easy target for enemies.\n\nThat is not the only old school feature Singularity has. Shooting without using iron-sights is a viable option for combat and allows you to immerse yourself in the environments instead of having your face pressed up against the iron-sights just in case an enemy appears. The levels are fairly open ended and with the combination of health kits, ammo, weapon kits and E-99 scattered about for upgrades, the temptation of exploring off the beaten path is great. This works far better to get us to explore creepy areas that will probably have something inside waiting to bite our faces off ,than having a random collectible that only completionists care about like most games coming out around that time would have had. Outside of useful items there are also notes and audio logs scattered about that add information to the events that have occurred in the game. The overall story of Singularity is fairly interesting but really lags during the middle of the game, it does pick up again near the end thankfully. For whatever reason this game does not have an option for subtitles, which is both very annoying and odd.\n\nThat brings me to the biggest issue with this game. It is very common for users (myself included) to have no sound whatsoever until you go through this  workaround. That fixed the issue of there being no sound whatsoever, but cutscenes were still far too quite. With the lack of subtitles and being unable to hear what people are saying in cutscenes, even with my headphones at their loudest, I had no idea what happened in the ending of the game due to it. There are several endings and it is a shame that I had to go out of my way to search for mine on Youtube. Once you finish the game, there is no option to start the game over with any of the stuff you have unlocked and the multiplayer is also dead, which I sadly had no way of experiencing. There are no motives for replaying the game other than selecting a higher difficulty setting. It took me 8 hours to complete the game, so standard time for games of this genre and I left pleased with the experience but the lack of anything else to do may be a turn off to some. That aside, graphics are still decent considering the title is half a decade old and environments have a lot of cool yet useless interactivity like messing with phones, sinks and microphones. Enemy variety is decent enough and has you facing both humans and creatures that can be far bigger than you. Humans end up being far more dangerous than most creatures as they have quite an aim and effectively use cover.\n\nBoss fights are tense and feature the aforementioned giant creatures that will quickly murder you if you don't discover their attack pattern and weaknesses. Best of all there are no Quick Time Events to be found here. Your movement speed does hamper the enjoyment a bit since like most modern FPS games you move around at a snail’s pace and are only able to sprint for a few seconds. It's not all fighting though, you will come across an occasional simplistic puzzle or two every once in a while. One other modern aspect is that you will not be able to backtrack, so if you leave a ammo crate hoping to retrieve it later on when you need it, you will be unable to since doors inexplicably close and seal shut behind you. When all is said and done however, it is a nice blend of both the old school health system & useful rewards for exploration, as well as newer features of the genre such as story and upgrade systems. While not the horror game it could have been, it is a fun journey with a interesting story to tell. Singularity is a game fans of the genre looking for a single player experience will more likely than not enjoy, as long as they don't mind fixing the audio issue that may occur.","November 4, 2015","true","8.0"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","57","65","7","0"

I wont mention the story in case of any spoilers but it can be confusing but is really intresting and mostly well thought out. Upgrades are maybe a bit too simple to the point where I feel like there is massive room of improvement, you can only have 1 "perk" equipt which you buy using "E99 tech" as currency though you can use 2 later on ....but in all honestly alot of the perks are mostly useless, With weapon upgrades I can say the same too as all the weapons have the same minor damage, reload speed and magazine capacity upgrades that I tend to forget its even in the game. Lastly, there are a fair amount of weapons in the game....but again it feels like everything except shotgun + assault rifle is useless or at least a dowgrade but they can be fun to try out or mess around with.\n\nMinor picky ranting aside its an amazing FPS with very satisfying combat that I highly recommend getting, I wish I found it sooner! <3","November 3, 2015","true","7.1"," 58 of 67 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","58","67","7","0"

The game is almost shamelessly derivative, taking the both the style and character building of BioShock, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2, and throwing in a few nods to F.E.A.R. However, this mish-mash of other games' ideas is by no means a bad thing. If anything, Singularity manages to almost play as a "best of" collection of FPS trappings, the ultimate compilation of cool gimmicks and toys seen in the genre over the past five years.","September 10, 2014","true","6.4"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","34","45","0","0"

It's a solid shooter that riffs on BioShock's environment storytelling but with a little less depth, and has an innovative time-manipulation mechanic that's sadly under-used, mostly reduced to a lock-and-key mechanic. But there's also some great level design and fun weapons to play with, so Singularity is definitely worth your time.\n\nStill available on the US store, but sadly not on the AU store at the moment, which is a shame.","January 3, 2015","true","13.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/recommended/42670/","dylanai","Luminaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dylanai/","500 products in account","While it's reminiscent of many other games, Singularity is greater than the sum of its oft-borrowed parts. The time & space manipulation in puzzle solving has a Portal-esque feel to it, the gunplay and sci-fi elements are evocative of the Half-Life series, and the alternate reality's sprawling landscapes filled with intricate details and satirical propaganda clearly show that BioShock rubbed off on the developers. In fact, the Time Manipulation Device (TMD) employed by the game is essentially a Plasmid from BioShock – equipped on your hand, you'll use it to do things like reverse or speed up the age of items and enemies to bring variety to combat and navigate the devastated, apocalyptic terrain.\n\nThough Singularity is certainly guilty of taking more than a few elements from other games, it puts its own spin on those elements well and creates enough of an original feel to consider it a legitimately good game in and of itself, making the experience an entertaining entry in the first-person shooter genre. The notes, recordings, and projector footage you find from the past (again, sound familiar?) range from amusing to frightening, and help to further illustrate the game's 1955 & 2010 versions of Russia which you jump to and from in order to rewrite history and correct time travel paradoxes. The consistently thick, tense atmosphere aside, this is the game's strongest asset, I feel, and could've been explored more thoroughly. This and its disappointing length are its greatest flaws, though the fact that the majority of players find the game too short shows just how enjoyable it is. When it was over, I wanted more of it, and I intend on a second playthrough – something the game encourages, as the plot twist at the conclusion recontextualizes the events preceding it.\n\nSingularity isn't the most original or creative game, and it grazes the surface of deeper themes (the illusion of free will, the responsibility scientists have to mankind) in favor of maintaining a breakneck pace, but it does so many things right that its flaws are forgiveable and, in the grand scheme of things, minor. I consider this a must play for anyone who enjoys action or first-person shooter games, and especially the ones I mentioned in this review as well as others in that vein.","May 5, 2015","true","25.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

It sets the player in a timeline where the Soviet Union discovered a new compound under the designation "E99", but something goes awry and leaves the island a ghost town for decades.\n\nThe only faults I see with this game that could have been ironed out is its difficulty. The game is too easy to me and a few others, and feels afraid to throw a challenge. Another fault I noticed is the music is too climatic for a title like this. In my personal opinion, if you want to get the best out of this game, cram that music slider all the way to the left.\n\nWhen this game goes on sale, I think you should pick it up.

The graphics may have aged with some textures not really looking great - this though really matters very little when you encross yourself in it's story whihch is told through recordings and notes scattered throughout the desolate and forgotten environment. There are many mini stories which where for e.g. you come across three dead bodies and suddenly you are transported into a vision of the past where you get to witness the final moments of these sorry dead folk. It really pulls you into the environment.\n\nThe excellent weapon play is really exiting with your standard Pistol, Assault, Shotguns, Snipers, Grenade Launchers with some additional old favourites like the "Gatling" style Autocannon and the Spikeshot which reminds me of the half life 2 crossbow but has explosive spikes, all of  which can be upgraded - add to this nicely imagined power houses like the Seeker Rifle and the exquisite TMD which can age and de-age items, phase shift and pulse pound your enemies among other things. It really is a completely experience where your imagination lets you run free when getting into gun fights. I for mone thoroughly enjoyed using the TMD to catch rockets and grenades fired by the enemy and launch these back as payback (another huge reminder of the Half Life 2 Gravity Gun) - alkso enjoyable is capturing enemies in a time buddle and unleashing a volley of rounds into each ones head - wait for the time to run  out and enjoy their heads explode\n\nGames this reminded me of are - Wolfenstein, Half Life, Bioshock, Fear, Red Faction (with the destroying and repairing environments with the TMD and Pulse to see where you go) as well as Dead Space. It honestly has it all and is really worth the $29 if you can afford it and feel like a game which will thrill you for the 12 odd hours of game play.","January 2, 2015","true","15.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Please rate this review if it helped! :)\n\n►Overview:\n\nInteresting and fun, but relatively short. Considering this game was released in 2010, the graphics are really nice, and the map doesn't feel like you're going down the same path over and over again. Definitely worth a play, as it stands alone from the rest of today's cloned junk. Just be prepared to listen to a number of audio recordings and read notes if you want to get the most out of the lore.\n\n►Full review:\n\nAt first I thought this was an awesome looking horror game, but it soon became apparent that it is indeed a shooter (The start of the game is more slow-paced and scary, which other horror/jump-scare moments spread throughout)\nAlthough short and sweet (Only took about 7 hours, which included time spent looking around the map as well as cleaning tea out of my keyboard), this game has a lot of lore and information stuffed into it's gripping single-player storyline. It's one of those games that actually makes you think about what's happening, rather than just going around shooting stuff 'because why the hell not?' - No, this game was clearly thought out, and requires the player to make a choice that will change history just before the ending of the game.\n\nPros:\n▪ Interesting storyline that makes the player think about what they're doing and why.\n▪ Well-designed map with hidden rooms that ARE ACTUALLY WORTH DISCOVERING (and sometimes really fun to get in to)\n▪ The general layout of the levels is nice. The scenery as well as structures are often detailed and pretty to look at (So when you're not getting slapped in the face by mutants or shot at by angry Russians, take a look around!)\n▪ Ammo isn't *that* common during SOME parts of the game, which requries you to change weapons often, so you're not stuck using the same assault rifle the entire time.\n▪ Special weapons that have unique uses are extremely fun to use at first, such as the Seeker.\n▪ Fair amount of weapons, that can be re-accessed from a weapon's locker, or picked up.\n▪ Neat upgrade system for weapons, powers and player upgrades.\n▪ Although simple, looting feels fun.\n▪ In my opinion, a great ending that wraps up loose ends.\n\nCons:\n▫ Some parts of the game felt boring or uninteresting. But I guess every game has those moments.\n▫ NO ACHIEVEMENTS.\n▫ Chances are you'll end up using just one gun about three quarters of the way through the game, right up until the end. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it just makes all the other guns look useless. Guess you could do what I did, and just not use it d:\n▫ Linear storyline path; meaning there aren't different ways to approach a situation. You'll just end up going in guns blazing.","April 16","true","6.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I bought it on steam few months ago and decided to replay it, and there's no wonder i liked it even more.\nFirst off, the gameplay mechanics are very interesting and well executed. Making ♥♥♥♥ crumble with TMD glove is great, and on the other hand you have around 10 weapons to choose in the game, and design of them is pretty good i would say. Atmosphere is good overall, there is noise all the time, you hear wind blows outside and moving ♥♥♥♥, you hear monsters eating corpses and that makes you feel frighten. So like i said, good atmosphere overall, from the point of sound at least. The design of environment does not fall behind either. First act of the game stands out on that point especially. I'm not saying that the second act is bad with environment design, just that the first is a little better in my opinion. Destroyed Kathorka 12 island looks very creepy. For example, at the beginning of the game there's a primary school made for children whose parents came to work on Kathorka, which was destroyed and left to rot with rest of the island. You can find tape recordings all over the place. Some of them are from the period before the catastrophe, and some are after. Number of recordings makes you feel bad for people left to die there, you hear them talking about 'waiting for help to arrive' and then realize, that corpse lying by recorder is the person which recorded it on the first place.\nThe story is good, it has a good plot, interesting details and multiple endings (which is great). I won't get further into the story 'cause of spoilers...\nAt the end 7.5/10 for me, maybe even 8/10, but game has a few cons, and one of them is 6 hours campaign, which is short as long as i'm concerned. Short but really enjoyable experience.","May 22","true","6.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Might even be a better deal at Xmas sale but needed a new game to play now and it fit the bill. Can only carry 2 weapons which is a change compared to carrying everything there is and does add a challenge that way also need to watch ammo use which is nice. Will do an update further on in gameplay but good so far.\nDefinitely worth the $8.50 I paid on sale. Played om Easy mode for 1st play to learn the game. Next game I step it up.

And the machinery design is just amazing, remember the TMD upgrading process?\nAlso the story... I took some time to clear the timelines after finishing the game, and found out that the there're some major paradoxes, I always like paradox settings.\n\nI can see singularity had borrowed a lot from Bioshock, but I don't think the story was told in a good way like Bioshock. The characters are just stereotype, they come and go and talk, just to get me moving in the  game.  There's just one villain has a name. If you break down the story and see it for yourself, you'll realize it's something big. I hope i can say this is a great story, but it's just an interesting one.\n\nAnd come on~~~If by killing Demichev can solve the problem, why can't I just kill him in the past, why must I kill myself in the past if I can simply shoot Demichev in the head. I've shot Demicev 2 times in the head, and the last time I did it, he's still alive and talking!!! Then he even stood himself up and continued talking!!!...Totally ruins the ending.\n\nOther Cons!\nThe save system really sucks!!!!!!!!!! Especially in the first 1/3 of the game, some people would probably quit due to this, Autosave is understandable, lots of games use autosave. But singularity just saves in wrong places all the time!!! It's like the checkpoints are just placed there without much consideration.\n\nE-99 money, story notes, records, upgrade systems, they all pops up now and then to "invite" you to interact with them. But lots of those moments, while I was interacting with them, then the combat started, so I had to quit reading/upgrading, because there wasn't a pause in game when you're reading/upgrading.\n\nThe puzzles are made for the TMD, so that you can use the TMD.\n\nAll in all, I still finished the game, some moments were enjoyable, the story kept me thinking after the ending, so I would say this is a good game, a rare one indeed! If you like half-life 2 and Bioshock 1&2, you should try this one,","May 27, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

At first it seems like your ordinary "Kill all bad guys" story like in other shooters or action movies, but the story is really interesting, especially later in the game plus there are three endings!\n\nBasically it´s an ordinary shooter, but the TMD gives you powers like turning back the time for a rusted explosive barrell. A few seconds later you have a brand new explosive barrel which you can throw at your enemies.\nThe TMD is also used for some riddles, which aren´t really hard but bring some variety in the game.\n\nThe arsenal is nothing fancy at the beginning, you have your pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, etc.\n\nBut two guns are really cool: The grenade launcher where you can fire a regular grenade which explodes a few seconds later or you can steer it while it´s rolling over the floor.\nThen there is the rifle where you can steer the bullet, which is also pretty funny.\n\nThe gore system is high. Raven Software made two of the most violent games in gaming history: Soldier of Fortune 1+2.\nSingularity is also gory, but not as much as SOF1+2. You can shoot of limps from the enemies and the human enemies suffer when you cripple them, but they die very fast and the gameplay is about as fast as in SOF1, so you really don't notice how much pain you´re causing. :D\n\nOverall Singularity is a very fun shooter and like Mark from the "Classic Game Room" always says:\n\nHighly recommended!","May 8, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a story-driven shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on changing your environment - beside the conventional weapons (pistol, rifle etc.) you have the so-called Time Manipulation Device at your disposal, a device which enables you to modify your surroundings. You can repair objects which is necessary to progress in the story or simply use this device to stun or kill your enemies. It is a nice touch as the device comes handy when in a firefight.\n\nThere is not much to say about Singularity. It is an OK shooter - nothing special but there's nothing wrong with it. I played it years ago and its multiplayer mode was already dead so if you pick this one up do it only for its story-drive single player option. The game looks good and runs smoothly at 60 FPS thanks to the good old Unreal Engine 3 so you won't have any technical issues with it.

Half-Life meets Bioshock meets  Timesplitters: Future Perfect meets F.E.A.R meets C&C Red Alert meets Wolfenstein meets Timeshift meets Lost. The result isn't terribly original, but it's amazingly fun.\n\nThe game constantly surprises with a change in gameplay and mood every 15 minutes. Unlike Duke Nukem Forever, it actually does a good job of blending "old skool" gameplay with modern game design.\n\nPro tip 1: weapon lockers allow you to swap weapons, not just upgrade them. Pro tip 2: the upgrades for the "Deadlock" time-freezing bubble are incredibly overpowered and yet suprisingly cheap, so unless you want to make the game very easy, don't upgrade Deadlock, or at most only upgrade it once. Pro tip 3: if you have Windows 7 and the audio seems quiet, one solution is to Alt Tab out of the game, go into your volume controls, find the entry for SIngularity and boost the volulme.","July 5, 2011","true","51.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

In short, I liked it. The gameplay is good and the story kept me interested. Especially some of the flashbacks are quite dramatic and add to the story. The game allows to develop yourself and your weapons in different ways, which allows for some creativy in how to fight. However, if you use a specific weapon and ability, the game has its moments, but never becomes really difficult, even played on difficulty hard.

This game holds up well 4 years after its release. It's a solid Linear FPS experience, felt like a mix of Bioshock and Metro 2033 in terms of game feel and atmosphere. Time-manipulating powers were different and varied enough to keep me mentally engaged through puzzle-solving and combat. I should note that if you aren't quick on your feet in combat you can get overwhelmed pretty easily, so use of guns and TMD effectively is a must. Story was probably the highlight for me, it was intriguing (though it was basically powerhungry white men vying for power, the events that took place were fantastic).\n\nWould recommend for single-player, haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\nP.S.\nAt the time of my review this game is on sale on Amazon for $7.50, which is significantly less than what steam lists it for, so if you want a good deal on a good video game this is a great opportunity.","April 23, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/recommended/42670/","RunningShovel","Shovel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningShovel/","231 products in account","Singularity: Good Video Games.\n\nLet's talk about what made me happy:\n\nPride of place in an FPS: Weapons. They are your primary means of interacting with other entities, and damn are they nice. Many of them are neat spins on regular ol' bread and butter guns, and that's okay, but the look and feel of some guns is just great. The minigun has brake pads around the barrel. The shotgun has this neat locking top pump action. The rifle has a fan that spins as you fire. The Railgun has a timed delay explosive charge. Aside from looking neato frito, they all feel damn great and tear guys up very nicely. The other side of this is the TMD, which has powers and upgrades meted out to it through the course of the game and is great fun to oof at when you hit dudes with it. Seriously I was apologizing to AI for blowing them off their shins and leaving the feet standing. It's pretty grisly.\n\nSpeaking of AI, the enemies are neat too. You have monsters and tough monsters and soldiers and tough soldiers, but that's boiling things right down to sump. They all have their neat features,  You can shoot limbs off the creatures and they'll keep coming, sometimes even after they're ostensibly dead. Soldiers will hide behind bigger dudes and try and flank you, though it's standard tactics it's still fun to play with. Between monsters and soldiers, there's a nice gamut of enemies, but though the groups have a nice variety within themselves, it's the way they're placed through the game that's cool. You'll be fighting some monsters and suddenly soldiers will drop in on cleanup, or the guy you're shooting will be clawed from behind, and infighting hell breaks loose either way. It's always fun to be the one in the eye of the storm, and Singularity does it wonderfully.\n\nLet's talk design elements real quick, since Singularity has a bunch I really like. Found Story? Check. Audio logs, notes, interactive items, flashbacks, secrets, all of the good stuff. Oh, what's that, you want wordless little vignettes? You got them too. If you like exploring the world in your FPSs and being rewarded for that with tidbits, you'll feel right at home. Tagging -horror onto your game's genre might have been the "in" thing, but Singularity does the horror elements right. The opening hour or so is filled with jumps and scares, but not jumpscares. You're dropped here and there's noises and movement and OH GOD WHAT IS THAT KILL IT ♥♥♥♥. Give it another couple of hours and you'll be topping those guys left and right, but there's howls in the distance that make you a little uneasy. Most mutant enemies go through this cycle of unknown-scary-identified-understood-kill with impunity. You'll get to know their weaknessess and strategies, but not before feeling a little uneasy that you don't. Another thing I'd like to touch real quick is the set pieces, the kind of ones where you'll be talking about games to a friend and you'll say "Remember that one mission in Singularity, on the bridge, when you-" and they'll go "Yeaahhhh, that was so good!" They're money, all I need to say.\n\n+\nFantastic design all around\nNeat writing and backstory\nMemorable encounters throughout, including bosses\nHeaps of little unf-worthy touches\n\n-\nSome genericity in places (playing it safe?)\nGets progressively linear-er\nPhase Ticks and Sewers\nExpensive as hell for it's age\n\nSingularity is worth playing through if only to get a crash course in what FPS games in the mid-2000s were like, since it cribs stuff from all it's neighbours while managing to remain it's own beast and being very good for it. It also layers some of it's own stuff on top of that, and is, in general, very good.

But the biggest flaw that the game has is that is REALLY REALLY easy, even on hard.  I mean your character starts cartoonishly overpowered. I never once felt in danger of dieing in straightforward gunplay / monster combat. Ammos and full healths in  abundance in every room (both stackable and on the spot full health pickups). Enemies are predictable and weak, but boy there sure are a lot of them. Even the boss monsters die really easily under the thrall the extreme powers weild ( and you're given really early in the game too).\n\nPowers like a indestructible bullet Shield, a melee weapon that literally blows the limbs off of people and send them flying 20 yards back  (fun a hell to use and never gets old by the way)  and the guns that you are so very powerful and accurate so it doesn't take long to feel like an unstoppable one man army. I almost feel bad for the guys that are in your way because they have ZERO chance of killing you unless it's some kind of cheesy scripted jump-scare moment (there are a few of them along the way) where a monster leaps out.\n\nOne thing that's kind of cool about Singularity is that it's just plain fun game. It does not require a whole lot of thought to play it you just turn it on: Let Yourself have, fun and basically when you're done playing you turn it right off and you're on to other things in your life. There's no level system there's no crafting there's no super huge skill tree that you need to be worried about hitting the finer points of so your guy can be sweet enough to beat a particular boss and or pack of enemies.  For some people that might sound like a real big turn-off; but for me I actually enjoy a good pure no BS first person shooter.\n\nThis review is being written in spring 2016 and just so you know the online portion of the game is a ghost town. So you're basically buying it for the single-player only.\n\nIn the final review I give it a nice solid B minus (83/100),  Good but not great. Nice graphics and shoud, lots of fun and cool weapons, and powers, some neat enemies, in the challenge department the game is flat as hell, but at the end of the day is a solid, well-made, and enjoyable game.\n\nIf you just casual gamer or a novice first person shooter (some one without any hardcore MP triger time) or a fan of games like bio-shot and there ilk, the you'll want to pick this one up and.\n\nStart to finish the game will take you about 12 to 15 hours to complete, if you're slow and steady in your progression. I would suggest buying it on sale during the next winter or summer sale when it’s marked down 50 percent or more.","March 11","true","26.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That was my opinion at the time of it's release in 2010, and it hasn't changed since.\n\nYou know how (whisper it) some of the "classics" like 'Halflife 2' / 'Bioshock' actually have slightly crappy gunplay (despite other great gameplay mechanics), or titles like 'Halo' have great shooting but little in the way of exciting setpieces - wouldn't it be good if there was a game with great shooting, great gameplay mechanics and exciting setpieces?\n\nThat's where 'Singularity' comes in - I would say it has it all, but, um, I'd be lying if I said the story was all that....Everything else is superb.\n\nFunky weapons? Check!\n\nPerhaps you'd like a sniper rifle that slows down time, and makes for super satisfyingly gory headshots (the game is an 18 rating for it's violence) - it's a gun nicked from 'Resistance' on the playstation, but that's a moot point for pc owners.\n\nPerhaps you'd like a gun that allows you to steer it's bullets, and also does it in slow mo, so once again the effect is rather brutal as limbs gets separated, and heads explode - nasty!\n\nMaybe you'd prefer a railgun that lets you shoot through walls? Like most of the weapons they aren't totally unique (Red Faction had a gun like this, for example) but rarely has a game had such delightful "toys" all under one roof - or at least a game that doesn't have 'Wolfenstein' in the title......\n\nThen there's the standard weapons - pistol / shotgun / machine gun / heavy machine gun, that are all very satisfying thanks to a slick, hefty feel to them, and the afore mentioned viceral results.\n\nThen 'Singularity' adds in even more - in the form of a device called "The TMD" (time manipulation device) which does the obvious thing of, err, manipulating time.\n\nWould you like a time dilation barrier that stops projectiles and enemies in their tracks? Or to rapidly age enemies, or cover in the environment, into dust? The TMD also has a blast effect that knocks down enemies to provide a bit of breathing room, and can also pick up objects / enemies and launch them.\n\nAnd, yes! - that is exactly like the gravity gun from Halflife2.....I'm not gonna lie and pretend that 'Singularity' doesn't crib from just about every decent FPS ever made, but it does so with a skillfulness that many games lack. All those weapons and gameplay mechanics are beautifully executed, and the pacing and the feel of the game is flawless.\n\nIt has spooky setpieces, blazing gun battles, and tense wave based standoffs - the only FPS staple it doesn't do is onrails vehicle sections, and I don't suppose many fans would miss those bits. The boss battles aren't hugely epic, but are satisfyingly tricky, and there isn't too many throughout - maybe four at most. There's also little puzzle bits, which whilst not especially taxing or varied, are nice enough diversions.\n\nStorywise it's all quite competent, and the voice acting / performances are all well done. But it lacks a little something in that department  to elevate it upto the likes of HL2 / Bioshock / New Order. Overall it's certainly much more fun to play than the various COD's / Battlefield's that have been released over the years. I already played it on Xbox 360, and was just going to have a quick look at the pc version to see how the graphics were - 6 hours later I had to make myself stop playing it!\n\nMy previous playthrough clocked up around ten hours on the hardest difficulty, so it's not hugely long to get through - but there's no filler or duff bits, so for me the quality makes it worthwhile. At around £15 (when not on sale) I'd still say it's a bargain, and it looks fairly reasonable too - there's not many graphical options, though I doubt it would tax most modern graphics cards anyway.","March 30","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a shame as in the end I wasn't really excited when presented with a new time control ability - it just felt like another weapon that I had collected.\nThe enemy A.I is not one of it's high points, infact there were several occassions where I had to basically jump about infront of enemies to get them to interact with me. This was not that big a deal though as the level design is very linear which means that the majority of enemy interactions are heavily scripted and this works well enough!!\n\nHaving said all this I still recommend this game to you as I had fun with it in the way that one would watching a fun action movie. The developers did a fantastic job in delivering a great sense of atmosphere. At times moments were built to a high level of scary tension which did give me a fright!\n\nThis game had a lot of potential which perhaps could have been lived up to in a sequel but alas 6 years have passed since it's release so it looks like one will never materialise.\n\n","April 10","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The plot of the story is unique and takes place during 1955 and in 2010 (Time manipulation). This game is a good mix between Bioshock, Half-Life and Quake with the atmosphere, creatures and gameplay. This has more of an old-school shooter feel to it, which I liked a lot. If you want a great game with fun gameplay and a really good story that will catch you off guard get Singularity. I might even have to play through this again. Oh yeah, did I mention this has three different endings you can experience? Play through all three endings and you will understand the outcome of what it would be like after each ending.

The game is a good length, has a solid story, a hand-full of strong characters and a nice variety of combat.  The game undoubtedly feels like a side project but a finished one!  It  might not have the detail and love that one would expect in a CoD game, but I was impressed with Activision's ability to begin and end a story with the time that was given.\n\nThe game takes many ques from other games.  While Singularity might not bring anything new to the table, it does bring a well blended action fps for any gamer to enjoy.  Nothing is taken too far with this game.  There is a good number of different enemy types, but not so many that the player isn't able to learn how to combat them before the game is over.  Also, there are at least ten weapons to choose from -- most of which can be upgraded and changed out at weapon stations.\n\nThe "TMD" device that the player is given adds a shocking amount of combat options.  The different uses of weapons and "TMD" abilities with the added upgrading and leveling system could make for another good play-though -- maybe two.  Unfortunately, the fights are scripted, and that takes a bit from the replays.\n\nOver all, the game gets a good review because it feels "humble."  It isn't a ground breaking or epic title, and it does not try to be.  The game gives the player a gripping intro, good progression and good old fashioned boss fights!\n\nNote: $30 would have been spot on the day this game came out.

Highly recommend\n\nSet in a "somewhat postapocalyptic" soviet environment this is a classic First person shooter with some "super-powers" added besides the usual guns. Gameplay is reminiscent of Bioshock, while the setting and atmosphere are close to Metro 2033.\nYou play as an american soldier sent to investigate closed down and abandoned Soviet facility, where you uncover mistery E99 element and events follow.\nWhat I really liked about the game:\n-The gameplay is very solid. You have good amount of different, well-designed weapons (the game keeps giving you new ones right until the end, that way it keeps things interesting). Also you have some superpowers (not from beginning but quite early into the game you get your first one) and the list of the things you can do grows. Timeshift bubble, aging opponents, impulsing all around you, telekinesis. All that good stuff. Overall, the shooting part is fun and makes you feel like a bad-♥♥♥. The 'puzzles' won't take\n-The setting. Very gruesome, graphic. Reminiscent of Metro but more "paranormal" stuff.\nWhat is not particularly great but holds up:\n-The story. It's pretty linear and straightforward for a game about time-travel and altering history/future, but still it is enjoyable and grips you until the end. The game even has 3 endings, but they are basically the same, just different cut-scenes in the end and you can replay last 1 minute of the game to see them all.\nWhat I disliked:\n-For a game that's been out for like 2 years already there's too many bugs. I've had to restart the game around 5 times due to game-breaking bugs (NPCs stuck or disappearing, doors not opening e.t.c) and the thing is - I've wasted good amount of time in each of those instances to figure out that something is wrong. Once there was a sequence where a girl opened some door and I needed to defend her from monsters. Well, the thing got stuck and the monsters spawned endlessly and I couldn't undestand that something is wrong until I wasted all my bullets, medkits, e99 energy and they just killed me (I wasted around 10-15 minutes I think) and after restart the process ended in like 3 monsters and 15 seconds.\n\nAll in all, solid title. Recommend to play it if you like shooters, enjoyed Metro 2033 and/or Bioshock.","November 18, 2014","true","35.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As a few games released around 2010, it's a troubled PC port, it takes a few tweaks to the registry to make it running at higher resolutions and it needs Widescreen Fixer to adjust the FOV, but the texture streaming bug still persist (you need to restart the game every hour or so) . Although a few guns lack weight it is a pretty entertainment 6 hour game, with upgradable guns and skills and old school medkit health system.\n\nPS: Multiplayer can still be played i believe (could not find 6 people to play with).","May 23, 2015","true","7.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

First 5 minuites feel like call of duty until it slowly turns into something way more unique.\n\nEdit after finishing:\n\nDeffinitly worth $10, gameplay is pretty good, graphics are good for it's time (somewhat better than mw1), with a futuristic yet old style you usually only see in games like fallout 3.  Gameplay is mostly the standard shooter, but very satisfying, and has a number of gadgets and gameplay mechanics, playing with time, that you don't normally see.\n\nThere's  definitly some challenge to be had, it's probably an 8 hour game if you rush through it on easy though.  There are multiple endings, but not very much in the way of player choice (Still more than bioshock infinite).  The weapons are nice, and feel great, though gun specific upgrades are limited to damage, reload speed, and clip size.  You can uprade other charecter stats, though most of the good upgrades come too late in the game to be all that useful.","November 25, 2013","true","19.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Most of those hidden goodies are E99, the main currency of the game and the major plot device of it too. The human enemies have a decent enough A.I. and the non-human enemies tend to rush you like a giant bullet sponge.\n\nThe weapons are all the general FPS weapons; pistol, shotgun, rifle, sniper rifle, and rocket launcher are all there. There is one weapon, the Seeker, that allows you to control the flight path of the bullet while slowing down time. Like the killshots in the game Nazi Zombie Army, the Seeker lets you lay out a plan of attack. The Seeker is also the closest you'll come to actually controlling time.\n\nThe device used to control time feels underwhelming and pigeon-holed into a few uses. It eventually has two upgradeable powers, the ability to send out a pulse to hurt and push back enemies and a time bubble that greatly slows down anything caught in it that isn't you. For the bubble your bullets will go slow and so will enemy fire, but it will still be moving and able to cause damage. Exploding barrels (I mentioned this game hit all the FPS benchmarks didn't I?) don't explode until after the effect of the time bubble has ended. The pulse is essentially useless, even when at the end <spoilers> the device becomes "uber" and can rip off the limbs of unarmed enemies, the actual distance the pulse reaches is so small unless something is right next to you, it won't help.\n\nHowever the game has a great amount of detail and production and is similar to Bioshock both in style and mechanics so I do recommend it.","May 9, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ever since then I've longed to get back to the game and finish it. As time progressed though, I started to think to myself that the game wasn't that great, and I was just imagining it as some sort of contender Half-Life 2; the singleplayer FPS king. Fast forward to present time, when I found it on sale and instantly bought it, eager to relive the memories. I was ready to get dissapointed and my expectations were actually quite low, but as soon as I booted it up I realized that I hadn't imagined anything; the game is just as incredible as I remembered.\n\nYou start the game in the boots of Nathaniel Renko, Captain in the U.S. military, on a mission to the remote island of 'Kartorga 12', which, in the 1950's, had been home to various scientific experiments conducted by the Soviet Union. After a terrible crash due to some unexplainable explosion, you quickly realize that said experiments hadn't really gone according to plan and 'Katorga 12' wasn't quite the Soviet Utopia it was advertised to be in the 50's...\n\nWhat follows is an incredible journey with amazing looking vistas, interesting characters and mechanics that, to this day, feel fresh. A game that rivals games like Half-Life 2 and Bioshock in atmospheric, story driven FPS's. It might not have the utmost polish, like HL2, but nothing that gets in the way of what this game does best; atmosphere.\nTechinically, compared to new games (i.e. BF4, Crysis 3) the game might look a little bit dated (in 2014), but the graphical design makes the game still look incredible, with some of my most memorable locations in video gaming.\nAs far as sound design goes, the developers has worked wonders, the score is just right and every weapon sounds just like you want them to; powerful and distinctful. If there is something to complain about it's that the voice acting can, on some lines be, a bit cringe-y, but for the most part it does the job well and even the Russian accents sound believable for the most part.\n\nEven though is game is several years old, the mechanics used still feel fresh and like something new. Without spoilering, you can manipulate the environment to quite a big degree which keeps the combat feeling fresh and it ties in very, very nicely with the story and story telling.\n\nIn the end; if you're a fan of story driven games, don't mind a good FPS or enjoy post apocalyptic stories like Fallout or Metro 2033/Last Light, you should definately give Singularity a chance. It might be a couple of years old, but it still holds up very well and is one of the most underated games ever made.\n\nWARNING: The PC port is unfortunately absolutely ♥♥♥♥ though. BUT, it is fixable, at least to a degree. The game runs fine at my system (AMD FX-8350 4,0GHz, AMD R9 290, 8GB RAM) with over 60 frames per second during the whole game at 1920x1080p, with everything on. There are not many graphical options to speak of tough, so it might not be tailorable to your computer, if you're running a lower end rig.\nThe FOV was the biggest problem for me though, with it being locked to console FOV (~60). This is however semi-fixable with a great program called "Flawless Widescreen". Be warned though, increasing the FOV causes the playable characters arms to clip, making you be able to see thru them at the bottom of your screen while using some weapons and during some events.

Essentially, Singularity is a popcorn shooter with fluid non-stop combat, lots of enemies, a great story, a lengthy singleplayer campaign and a neat RPG-lite character building system that borrows from System Shock/Bioshock without completely ripping them off.\n\nYour average shooter fan won't like Singularity since it speaks more to the 90s gamers out there, so be warned if you're expecting something modern. That being said, If you want a solid FPS with a clever gimmick, an entertaining story and some great level design....here you go.

The gameplay is very linear and time manipulation powers more restrictive than I would have liked, and you quickly overpower your enemies even on harder difficulty.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/recommended/42670/","Azundris","Azundris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/","247 products in account","Well, that was satisfying. This game liberally embraces and extends, and everything it copies, it makes better.\nAt times, it looks like Fallout3 without the silliness (it also lets you inspect a metric ton of flavor notes and recordings); it has a bit of a Half-Life 2 feel ("scifi settings + mute protagonist + gravity gun equivalent"), but much better pacing (and you don't want to kill the Alyx equivalent), and because of the whole "time" shtick, you justifiably get bullet time (as a slowdown with the regular sniper gun, and as a harder to explain, but immensely satisfying "slowdown + bulletcam + bullet control that lets you bend the path of the bullet around obstacles and corners" with the experimental sniper rifle, the "Seeker."), and of course the combination of "spookiness, Russia, anomalies" suggests comparisons with the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.\nOther than that, it has a late '80s/early '90s flair to it; nihilistic scifi played straight, by the numbers shooter with solid mechanics, etc.\nAs for the "time manipulation device", that's a really nice addition to the game that sets it apart. While you can only use it to time travel when you find a "rift" (at which point you can travel back to the time it was created), you can use the TMD to age/youth objects (and later enemies) quite often, sometimes in the context of simple but satisfying puzzles. Some reviews imply that the TMD is under-utilized (making me expect something like Remember Me where they made a big deal out of the memory remixing which then only appears in the game four or five times) -- not so. Or arguably, so but only if you look only at time travel and ignore object manipulation.\n\nThings to consider:\n\n- The game isn't that long and can be finished within a day / two evenings. I appreciate manageable commitment in a game; you may not. (Even then the sale price of around $3 is more than fair.)\n\n- The number of enemy types is somewhat limited. I find that to usually make a setting more believable, you may find it repetitive.\n\n- The number of boss fights is also very limited (but at least one of them has a nice setup, even if the actual fight is a bit by the numbers).\n\n- The game feels extremely linear. It's not outright painful (a la "I am alive"), but it's quite noticeable. Sure, it could be argued that that goes for all non-sandboxy games and that after the paradigm shift of open world, there's no satisfactory going back, but we don't even see much in the way of DN3D's "do you want to take the left or the right air vent / the vent or the regular corridor to get to the same place" kind of thing that doesn't slow the game down. On the upside this doesn't just go for maps, but for the plot as well: this means no side-quests (on which I've OD'd a bit), and the main plot uses that thing very sparingly where you're trying to do something, then it turns out you'll have to achieve a prerequisite first, then while trying to do that, you'll end up with a prerequisite for the prerequisite, et cetera ad nauseam, and instead of achieving objectives, you have a stack of half-finished objectives ten deep. So yeah, Singularity mostly avoids that, doesn't stack objectives too deeply when it stacks them, and the objectives they give you tend to feel justified rather than forced or an interruption.\n\n- This is a 2010 game, so the graphics are mildly dated, but I found them fit for purpose. I have no regrets. Your mileage may vary. On the plus side, even though the game is mildly scary in the beginning (it's night, you have no or no good weapons, and you don't know what you're up against -- or worse, you've found out what you're up against, but still don't have anything decent to defend yourself with), it never stoops to the whole "It's scary only because you can't see ♥♥♥♥" level. (If I never have to see a flashlight again, especially one that only illuminates 1/8 of the screen, it'll be too soon. If I pay for a whole game, 1/8 won't do.)\n\n- No Steam achievements. :( This is particularly sad as the console versions are said to have achievements/trophies.\n\n- I started this instead of surfing when my net went down. Game would freeze for a second every few seconds until net came back, not sure whether "always online" requirement, or initial activation, or what. Research this if that sort of thing is incompatible with your setup or principles.\n\n- I wouldn't have minded the option of a female avatar. Seeing as we're pretty much dealing with a mute protagonist here, it's not like it would've incurred much extra cost for voice work. In fact as we pretty much never see our avatar, it may not matter much, but then as we pretty much never see our avatar, it would've been all the easier to implement, simply by not making references at all and just calling you Captain, Renko, or a combination thereof.\n\n- There's multi-player (which I haven't tried), but no co-op.\n\n- No proper saves ("When you want, where you want, however many you want"). Game auto-saves fairly often so even if things go wrong, you rarely lose much progress, but obviously this way, you can't replay "just that bit you really liked" or show your friend "that super cool scene" to get them to buy the game too, so as in all other games with that defect, the developers are idiots for limiting replay value and word of mouth.\n\nVERDICT\n\nVery solid single player experience; hard to beat at current price point. If linearity doesn't put you off gameplay wise, or the lack of proper saves, female avatars, and possibly an always-on requirement doesn't politics-wise, go for it!","May 7, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Although you breeze through it in 5 hours and it's not very hard (unbalanced even - if you use the time slowdown sphere and some tmp upgrades you can just run through most parts). It starts off quite weak but once you get a hold of the TMP it gets really good. The story is rather straightforward but I have to say that I really enjoyed it and it was refreshing to play a linear FPS that was this entertaining.\n\nSingularity really resembles half life in quite a few ways and it is really good in teaching you the mechanics. The controls are also really intuitive/good (except the default bind for healing)\n\n\nmy issues:\nOne note on mechanical side - I lost a lot of E99 money because in tmp you actually have to equip something to the slot. I missed that and treated it as other upgrades so I had a ton of upgrades for tmp that did not work and I spent the currency for.\n\nThe lore is expanded via notes and tapes but there could be more of the "show, don't tell" visual narrative.\n\nOverall it seemed like there was more potential than what the game showed and the puzzles could include more variations (i,e, you need to use the grenade launcher exactly once and then forget about it, modifying time in later sections is mostly used for opening boxes and restoring tape recorders compared to strong first half where it was used for various objects, turning soldiers into husks was fun but rather inefficient shortly after it was introduced etc).","April 12","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can get it at 75% off, then it is well worth your money.\n\nTo me, Singularity feels like a blend of ideas and influences from other FPS games, but it is done very well, and the end product does feel like a game of it's own, and it makes this multiple directions work well.\n\nYou play as a US soldier sent to investigate an energy surge on an island off the coast of Russia where secret experiments were performed with the fictional mineral E-99, until a massive explosion destroyed the island in the 50's. Once there, another energy surge sends you to the past, and once you return, you realize that you changed the present and that Russia rules the world. From there on, you try to fix the present by once again changing the past.\nThe story wants to be complex, but ends up being relatively simple and kind of falls flat, with the twist not really being a twist(and can easily be deduced 5 minutes into the game), which is revealed a moment before the final decision which leads to 3 different endings which all felt rushed and cobbled together, and none felt like a satisfactory end to the story. Still, I did enjoy it most of the time, especially when it hinted at something more intruging that the straightforward route it ended up taking.\n\nGraphically and visually, the game felt a lot like Bioshock to me. It doesn't resemble the environments of Bioshock, but the overall atmosphere of you in a place where something bad happened prior to your arrival and the way it uses environmental storytelling with audio recordings, notes, and movies you can find felt a lot like how I explored Rapture. The HUD is almost a direct copy of Bioshock's, the best way to describe it would be to call it "Bioshock with a slightly different skin". The island design is pretty good, and I enjoyed exploring it for upgrade materials almost just as much as I did in Rapture.\nAlso the game frequently sends you back in time, so you get to explore the environments both now and in the 50's before the xplosion, similar to the principle used in Prince of Persia Warrior Within.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is where the game shines, and again, feels a lot like Bioshock, with a pinch of FEAR in the mix. You have a decent arsenal of guns, all of which can be upgraded with tech found on the way. You can also upgrade yourself, gaining increased health and other perks, some of which are very unbalanced and can potential break the game flow.\nYou can carry two guns at a time, and can pick up weapons and ammo from fallen enemies, as well as change your loadout at predestined locations. Some weapons offer you the ability to slow-down time while you aim, though this does not last long and has to recharge before being used again.\nYou are also given a TMD(time manipulation device) which grants you a small array of time powers used to solve simple, yet clever puzzles and aid you in combat. You can age your opponents to dust, freeze everything in an area, or create a large energy pulse to knock them back. Also, the TMD has all the capabilites of Half-Life 2's gravity gun, allowing you to throw explosive barrels at enemies or catch their grenades mid-air and return them.\nThe gunplay feels great, and the powers add enough variety to keep things interesting as you gun down russian soldiers and various mutants, though there were some enemy types which were really annoying, which is the only issue I have with the gameplay.\n\nOverall, the game is relatively short, lasting about 3-5 hours depending on you speed, but very enjoyable experience. I do feel they could have done a little more with the game, especially in terms of the story and it rushed ending, but still, I would recommend buying the game if you can get it at a discount.","April 27","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a creepy atmosphere at the start and although the game focusses more on action overall it still has a dark and threatening atmopshere in some levels. Additional to that you also find notes and audiotapes throughout the game, which provides you with background information about Katorga 12.The developers made a good job to keep that time travel theme in your mind. During your journey you will see visions of former citizens of the island how they talked to eacxh other or you see the scene of their death.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty fun and besides the standard shooter weapons there are also some sci-fi guns like the Seeker, which allows you to control your bullets after a shot. The Singularity powers are also fun to use. I have to agree that there are not much of them, which gets compensated by the fact that every enemy reacts different to your aging ability and the "time sphere" can be used in an agressive or defensive way.\n\nIn short I can say if you liked Bioshock and FEAR I think you will have fun with this game as well. And if you are concerned about the time in which Singualirty play you don't need to worry. The game is set in 2010, but you also make some short trips to 1955 and fight WW 2 Soviets.","July 3, 2014","true","7.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/real_nightmare/recommended/42670/","real_nightmare","Nightmare!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/real_nightmare/","110 products in account","Singularity is simply a great game.\n\nRaven's last real try at producing a stand alone title, Singularity is also one of their few IP-owned properties and it shows.  Unlike 2009's Wolfenstein, which was bland, drab and uninspired, Singularity is a vibrant game that shows love/thought in every facet of its construction.  Possessed of a *great* story that gives you several plot twists and a beautifully unique theme/aesthetic, Singularity beats most other FPS story elements hands down, creating a living, breathing and interesting universe.\n\nGameplay isn't to be outdone by Singularity's story, however, as the game runs on modest stystems, looks good, has genuine ambiance and great set piece design.  The game has a unique aesthetic and much like other games, including Deus Ex or Bioshock, creates a unique visual identity for itself.  Scary moments abound, of both the jump scare and creepy varieties and the game has excellent weapon variety with good punch/heft/feel.\n\nThe show-stopper, however, is the TMD (time manipulation device) which is a glove that allows you to do a variety of things.  Shove enemies back with a forceful pulse, age/de-age objects so that they change shape, age enemies to either kill or mutate them into monstrosities that fight by your side, open portals, levitate/hurl a variety of objects and other powers, all allow you to manipulate a physical world to solve a variety of problems.  Upgrade weapons, your TMD, and even yourself to customize your playthrough in the way that best fits your style.\n\nThe game has a staggering attention to detail in the campaign but the title is quite short, with most players finishing it in under 10 hours.  That said, the game has multiplayer!  While the community is dead, the multiplayer is pure gold and that's a shame.  Deathmatch or team deatchmatch seem like simplistic options but team deathmatch offers a Left 4 Dead  1/2 asymmetrical gameplay style that pits powered humans against Katorga 12 creatures.  Humans can wield a variety of weapons and employ a small handful of skills/perks but may also choose of one of four classes that confer either teleporational capabilities, healing skills, improved durability/melee or the ability to turn invisible.\n\nThe monsters are even better!  Played in third person, your options include a phase-shifting brawler, a crafty spiderling(phase tick) which can climb over almost any obstacle in the map(yes, he can run on the ceilings!) and detonates himself kamikaze style(or takes control of enemies) and a giant arachnid tank that fires grenades.  Perhaps the best monstrous class, though, is the Revert which is a slow but tough mutant that burps up mines and vomits a putridly hilarious and voluminous torrent of toxic sludge.\n\nFrom every possible facet, this game is a pure winner.  Its lack of success is mostly attributable to Raven's lack of a reputation and its publisher's failure to advertise the game on release.  While it may not be worth 30 or 40 dollars, if you can get this game for half that, it's a worthwhile FPS classic that I would place on the shelf next to the best examples of the genre.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n9/10.","August 2, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now for the real review. How I first heard of this game was when I googled "games similiar to The Last Of Us on pc". Now you may wonder, what does this game have to do with The Last Of Us? Its not even Post Apocalyptic. While this is true what I believe the answer is both are Story Driven games. So once I read about the game, I became interested in the concept, the idea, of the TMD and the Singularity. I also want to add I thought I was fighting Nazis which to me would be cliche but you actually fight soviets. So anyways, if you enjoy Story Driven FPS and enjoy The Last Of Us, this is a must play. Half Life 2 may be classic, but this game surpasses that. So go buy this game and fight the past to save the future!

I really hated some sections though- like the Time Leeches, but the gameplay and story are pretty mindless fun that's enough to sink your teeth into for a few hours. The atmosphere is very unique but also very strange. It also has no bullet time- aside from a bullettime sniper scope that only works for that weapon. The game, in case you can't tell from the screenshots, has a gauntlet that reverses and speeds up time and blasts things and such. The guns are okay, the enemies are interesting and hard, but the art style and the havoc you can cause is simply a blast to play. The levels have a ton of exploration and are some of the highlights of the game. If you wade through the rather stupid beginning levels things get pretty serious- the messages you see on the wall (pulled through another time period) give you bizarre warnings like "DON'T TRUST THAT LADY YOU'RE FOLLOWING" and make you freaked out. You can turn people into time mutants and watch their friends flip the hell out. I think it's a great title.

Some ppl call it hidden gem, masterpiece, etc. but to be honest it is somewhat average FPS with some interesting ideas here and there.\nI'm not someone who would care much about graphics but I think they were not considered very good even when this game came out, as I mentioned textures are pretty bad.\nThe story, yes it has one, is vaguely interesting at least at first glance. But later on it slowly slips into swamp of time travelling bullcrap so I wouldn't say it's good. Maybe I'm just biased because I don't like time-travelling/alternate dimensions stuff. It actually features 3 different endings, none of them is particullary interesting and the one which could be considered a good ending doesn't make any sense due to involved paradoxes that are presented to you, Red Dwarf's ep. "Ouroboros" makes more sense and is more entertaining.\n\nShooting itself is ok, nothing to write home about. Your arsenal consists of standart pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle, etc. There are few interesting pieces like rifle with homing bullets, which isn't standart arm since it is given to you only in certain parts of the game, or a grenade launcher with RC-like grenades (cool idea but sadly I didn't find it any good).\nYou can also upgrade your weapons as long as you find weapon kits, but the impact of said upgrades is hardly noticeable, well you will obviously notice increased clip size but you don't really need increased dmg or reload speed. And I almost forgot that you can only carry 2 weapons at a time, personally I ended up using AR and minigun, this fact makes gimmicky weapons like that grenade launcher much less desireable.\n\nThe game also has it's currency scattered throughout lvls, it's called E99 tech. It's spend on character upgrades, these are somewhat more impactful then weapon upgrades, or you can buy ammo with it but it's unlikely that you will ever find yourself low on ammo.\n\nWhat else? Oh right, Singularity's signature TMD. You can use it on enemies with various effects. It's used to solve ehm "puzzle" for the lack of better description and you can also use it to trivialize every enemy encounter once you aquire ability to make time-slowing bubble. This leads me to the fact that the game isn't difficult at all. Enemy soldiers have potatoe aim and you can easily avoid almost any attack from creatures. There is just one part which gave me a bit of trouble, it featured suicidal bugs.\n\nOverall it's slightly above average shooter, but only because few good ideas and the freighter level I really liked. It took me roughly 10 hour to beat on the highest difficulty.\n\nBuy it when it's on sale if you want to play FPS and can't think of any better than this one.

It is a short but lot of fun game and a very well made shooter.\nNice gamemechanics and puzzles that are easy to solve but fun to experience.\nEnvironment, weapon and enemy designs are very well made and the setting of this game feels fitting and plausible.\nThe weapon upgrade system is well made and rewards the player for spending time to search for upgrade points.\nThe game is very short though and therefore not worth more than 10$ in my opinion. It does not really offer any replay value dispite having multiple endings and is absurdly easy even on the highest difficulty setting so it does not offer any kind of challenge.\n\nThe story is a mess... it's all about time traveling, is filled with plot holes, does not make any sense and struggles with its own identity.\n\nSee time travel stories are either:\n1, you create an alternate timeline because you are able to change the past\nor\n2, there is no way to change the past because all the events have to happen in order to create the timeline you know\n\nthis game wants to be both... for whatever reason.\nSome lore elements of the world you play in are actually very interesting and provide you with nice detail, but the core of it is confusing and without logic.\n\nIf you can forgive this game for the strange time travel story and all the mistakes it contains you are left with a very well made but sadly way to easy shooter that is actually a lot of fun to play at least once.\nIt should take you 3-5 hours for your first playthrough.

There's nothing quite like anihilating a room full of soldies with a sniper rifle that lets you steer bullets.\n\nThe game has a really creepy atmosphere. Dried out corpses are all over the place, and once in a while you get a time shift into back when they were still alive and see their suffering. You fight against monsters who used to be humans but got messed up by time radiation. You also fight against modern day soldiers. You also fight against 1950s soldiers.\n\nYou have a TMD, a special device that lets you age things (or soldiers) or revert old things back to new, among other things, like shooting time-slowing bubbles. There are quite a few "puzzles" where you have to think how to age or unage containers and power boxes, among other things, to get further.\n\nThe story... I wasn't really following it. It felt like some scientist was just telling me what to do (similar to Half-Life) and I just trudged along. I kept thinking he was about to screw me over the entire time. But the impact of what a time-altering technology in the wrong hands can do is tangible throughout the game.\n\nSo if you can handle feeling the dread of inexorable death waiting for you around the corner as you watch things decay, this game is for you!\n\nP.S.: the game is ancient, so for obvious reasons the multiplayer is dead.

You slow down time. You freeze time. You have a highly advanced piece of kit that allows you to break things and repair them again (not a spanner). Press a different button and you can lift things, use them as shields and throw them at bad people. Did you say Gravity Gun?\nGraphics are courtesy of Unreal 3 for the last console gen, which means bad. Hardly any detail and lo-res shaders like everything is smeared with vaseline. There are no settings to turn up.\nThe plot is also gibberish. You go forward in time, you go back in time. You shoot a man in the head then he starts having a conversation about causality, so you have to shoot him again. It's almost as bad as Bioshock Infinite. Almost.\nStill, the big spiders were nice, the guns were alright and it was £2.50, so that's a thumbs up.\n5/10.","May 31","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Feels about as long as Bioshock 2.\n\nAlthough the game feels like a mix of BioShock, Metro, Prey,  It stands on its own very well.\n\nIt features game play that slowly takes you through the start, explains the story and builds to full on combat,  The sound design is top notch and should be played with headphones to experience all it has to offer.\nCreepy atmosphere to start, detailed world, time travel, ever changing environments, action, suspense, puzzles, killing, weapon upgrades and mods, lots of hidden items to find, good story, great sound design, smooth controls. It's a game you enjoy taking your time to explore and play.\nYes, it's linear game play, but the design makes you forget about it. There are extra rooms and areas to explore to find money, ammo, health packs etc.\n\nThe only CONS I can think of\n\n1. Too short Only about 12 hours\n2. No trading Cards\n3. No Mele combat abilities.\n4. Few weapons\n\nIt's a fun game and I enjoyed it so much I finished it in under 12 hours. Only a few gams have been able to suck me in to complete them and Singularity is one of them.","July 4, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

All i can say is thaqt this game is immencely enjoyable from start to finish; I it is one of the only game which has kept me entertained and intrigued throughout. Seriously there is rarely a dull moment in it, mainly I think because you're always slightly scared and creeped out by this mysterious island of Katorga-12 where it is set. Mind you this is no horror game, but it will give a nice dose scares throughout which will keep your toes most of the way through.\n\nOf course game can be frustrated sometimes when trying to work out puzzels, and a couple of enemy's may halt your progress for longer than is ideal, but still it rarely slows down with the action and intresting story.\n\nMy recommendation is:\n\nIf you want a game which tries something different, and gives a sort of breath of fresh air, pick it up when it's on sale, as £15 is a bit on the steep side. But is you want something fun to play, then just pick it up if you feel like it.","September 6, 2014","true","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The game itself revolves around the main character polluting the past and corrupting the future, obviously for spoiler reasons I won't say anymore about the story other than that. One of the biggest draws for me was the secrets. The secrets in this game feel very much like Bioshock. The customization reminds me so much of Dead Space, both of these, the secrets and customization, are NOT complaints. This game also has puzzles much like in Half Life 2 and the games special tool, the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) is used to solve many of them, this does lead into one of my biggest complaints about the game, when you press F the TMD displays foot prints on where to go next if you are lost, while nice, this ability has no drawbacks to prevent you from constantly using it, basically trivilizing one of the gimmicks this game has to offer just by pressing F. Pressing F also leads into my next point, control options and video options. This game has basically none of either, you can change a few basic controls but things like reloading are tied into the USE button as well, so things get very confusing, very quickly. Lastly, I would like to talk about general game design. In terms of actual character design and appearence everyone felt very generic, this is actually a bit ok though as the story itself is a big enough draw to keep you going, rather than the characters, who themselves have great personalities, just terrible designs. In terms of boss design, the few bosses this game has are ♥♥♥♥ing sweet, they all are very different and they are really fun, one of the ones in mid game felt very unique, I won't spoil it, but it involves a train.\n\n10/10 - Despite the flaws, most specifically its length, the unique story, gameplay, and the time travel gimmicks help keep this game at the top of my list, I highly recommend this to lots of people, not very often a give a game a 10!","June 21, 2014","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has taken a lot of elements from Half-Life 2, Dead Space, Resident Evil 4, and combined them really well into a game based on time travel and the Cold War.\nComplete with character and weapon upgrades, the ability to physically pick up and move items, the ability to age certain objects around you, and special abilities (such as instantly aging someone to death, or mutating a soldier into a disgusting creature, which will instantly attack other enemy soldiers).\n\nThe engine is decent, it's clearly a console port, as the options are very limited, but it all looks fine and runs perfectly smoothly. The sound effects and music are great, and the weapons range from generic assault rifle and shotgun, to a sniper rifle that lets you move the bullet around in real time (like the Redeemer in Unreal Tournament). Which means you can snipe someone in the back of the head, despite being in front of them, and behind cover.\nIt also features a grenade launch, which lets you manually control the grenade, almost like a remote control car (that blows up!).\n\nThe plot is really impressive, with plenty of great time travel elements, horror, and decent characters.\n\nI really highly recommend getting this game. The only downside is that the game is very short (about 10 hours), so you may want to wait for it to go on sale. It does have a multi-player mode though, which may extend the lifespan.","November 27, 2015","true","18.7"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

FPS is locked to 75 (Which isn't really a problem since 60 fps is plenty in my opinion, but it's still just unnessecary)\nAlso there's no subtitles, or way to change the fov, and the fov is REALLY bad, locked in at around 65, it's impossible to see anything in front of you unless you're 2 or 3 feet away from it. Also the game itself is just boring and bland, the guns have no impact or recoil (And whenever they do the recoil moves my aim down....... DOWN! FREAKING DOWN!) and the hit detection is horrible (I shotgun a "zombie" to the head, it doesn't die so i shoot it again, and it dies normally, later i shotgunned a "zombie" to the torso, it died instantly and it's head exploded) As far as time manipulation goes it's just used to fix broken stairs and walls so it's just a "Coninue Playing" button. You can also use it on enemies by making them older which is just a "Press button and they die instantly" button. Not that it's even needed since the game is VERY easy. the only good thing about this game is the graphics, which look really good, especially for 2010. Thanks to the good graphics the atmosphere is good too, but that's where the quality stuff ends.\nOverall the game is generic, boring, and to top it all off the PC port is abysmal.\n1/5 (Hey, atleast it's not a 0/5) :P","April 16","false","0.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

First of all the hit detection is off, I blast enemies with weapons and unless im either using a sniper only time that i actual kill normally is in CQ.  The russion version magnum cant shoot crap outside of 5 to 6 meters otherwise I just make my target dance around but thats it, wasted two clips on a single russion soldier with no armor and all that happen was he flinched a few times and went right back so shooting me after i pumped clip after clip into him.  Story is interesting but still am working my way through it.  The time effect ability with objects is pretty cool, especially when it has you take a destroyed box and move it, regen it to make a portable staircase, then destroy it again and plop it under a half closed door and regen it again to make an entrance is pretty good.  Visuals are obviously dated, its a 6 year old game so that makes sense but it does its job well.  The game does the background introduction very bioshocky which is a nice touch but feels copied.  Random tape recorders and projection screens literally are pulled straight from Bioshock as if they blatantly stole their ideas!

I will categorize my praise and critisism as far as possible - hopefully without losing focus.\n\nGame menue - Skip if not interested. But it gives you an initial idea of how lazy this port was.\na) Graphics\nIn the graphics menue you will be surprised to find only a choice of resolutions which will all leave your view narrow. With no option to manipulate FOV, since it is not for you to change, this sensation intensifies and gives even me headaches. And I honestly never had problems with FOV before this game - never felt I needed a slider. Additionally, you are able to change minor settings (depth of field, bloo, "high quality decals" - I'll get into this later) which are merely cosmetic but the developers do not seem to trust you with relevant stuff like AA or filtering. You can change your Vsync option, though.\nb) Audio\nYou will be faced by two possibilities: change your SFX and music volume. That's it. No way turning on subtitles, no choice of sound quality whatsoever. This is just poor!\nc) Controls\nWhile you are able to change certain buttons, you will find yourself in the situation, that *reload* and *use* are assigned to one and the same button. No way of changing that. I am asking: Why? We own keyboards with more buttons than only 12. Laziness strikes again! There also seems to be a rudimental port option featuring aim assist. Other than that, there is no way to lie down or to check a box if you want to be in ironsights permanently or while clicking the RMB.\n\nGame world\nFirst of all, I have to mention the horrible texture work all over the game,  especially when you're in the year 2010 and see abandoned structures . This and the fact that some textures are not in place at all makes me furious about the obviously lazy devs. I would, without joking, compare those textures to Half Life 1, which came out in 1998! Remember, that Singularity came out a few months after Metro 2033 in 2010. Neither from an atmospheric nor a graphical aspect I can't understand people who compare those games. They have nothing in common. In fact, it is an insult for the devs of A4 Games.\nI mean, Singularity has its atmospheric peaks here and there ( e.g. research labs, bug's layer ) but they are immediately destroyed by following "level design choices". I am talking about absent dynamic lights or objects (not even a flashlight,  which every modern soldier should have ), washed-out sky textures, which look frozen and unreal and cheap weather effects (e.g. rain).\nIt's the same with the leveldesign. It is okay for the most part, nothing extraordinary. But there are so many moments where you will encounter unfinished structures and missing details (e.g. cut-off cables stop mid air and aren't modelled correctly). Unfortunately, there is some kind of physics engine, which is presented rarely. But when you encounter it, boxes will be flying around if you touch them or objects will get stuck and so on. It is super frustrating and happens at random! Other objects, like curbs, debris, bunsen burner nets, door handles, etc block you constantly. Mid-fight this is deadly and overall it is very disturbing to just get stuck in the middle of a room. You will get stuck randomly 1/3 rooms on average.\nThis brings me to the games linearity (LOTS of poorly scripted events though), which does not have to be a bad thing. But this games crams it so far down your throat, that you just want to spit out. Invisible walls every other step, you aren't allowed to jump simple obstacles (like railings), there is no back tracking (doors magically close, invisible walls appear, etc) and there is massive hand holding, when following a fellow NPC. Just terrible and annoying. Unexcusable. On the other hand, you might be allowed to wander off the trail for a few paces: Take a corridor with several doors and one additional opens up for you to have ammo, health or E99 (coming to that later). So, searching in a very limited fashion is rewarded and present.\n\nFighting/Guns/Enemies\nThe game is a FPS in a classic fashion which has a focus on arcade gameplay (lots of medipacks, ammunition, buffs, guns, loads of enemies) that reminded me of Serious Sam and Wolfenstein at moments (just the arcade aspect!). If this was executed well, I would not have a problem with that. But the main thing that is terrible, is the KI. Enemies move as slow as if they were in slow motion, they run into walls for seconds and can see you through same. Why  soldiers from 1955 have the same guns as soldiers from 2010  will stay a mystery to me. Many enemies ( mutants and monsters ) are literally bullet sponges, including bosses - this is just something you should avoid, except for boss fights. They spice up the gameplay!\nAt least there is variation in enemy design (at least optically), but fighting feels dull. You can wait in any corner you like for enemies to approach and pick them off one by one (dying animations do not vary a lot with most enemies) without being in real danger. It only gets dangerous when you need to heal, because you will slow down even more (yes, sprinting feels like you are dragging your boots through mud) and only heal 33% of your helath with a forevertaking animation, often leading to death by default.\nBesides standard guns (shotgun, pistol, assault rifle, etc), there are specials. One of which is the time traveling glove (see below) nourished with  newly discovered  atoms (called E99), which also serve as a means of payment for upgrades. Yes, you actually can upgrade yourself (health boost, accuracy, etc - also from blueprints you find) and your guns, which is an admirable system, although it has been in games (Dead Space) before. But a nice feature nonetheless. Unfortunately, weapon sounds and animations are not at the technical level of 2010 when the game came out and sound/look just awful (again: HL1 like).\n\nStory - pretty much a spoiler!\nThe idea of time travelling has been done, of course, but I don't think, there was ever an approach comparable to this game. It is a great idea with nice implementations like portals (rip in the space-time continuum) and even little puzzles. Not like in Portal or Talos Principle of course, but I wished for something more like Half Life 2, since your time traveling glove can lift objects, drain enemies lifes, push them away, etc. Speaking of the "push effect" (basically an EMP) I need to say that it feels just so weak. Humans are pulverised into pieces which is surprising and satisfying, but mutants and monsters are merely pushed away a few meters. This is disappointing to say the least. The story in its entirety feels urged and flimsy. The voice acting does its part, because the actors often exeggarate and overemphasize their speaking parts. Stuff like letters, protocols, tape recorders or even movies try to keep the player interested but fail most of the time. The movies are the only thing interesting and even funny to an extent.\n\nNow the tough question after all that what feels like negative superiority. Would I recommend it? There is just so much clunky mechanics and minor mistakes combined with visible laziness that adds up to an infuriating melting pot of emotions. On the other hand, if you are only out for mindless and average designed FPS action, this might be something for you. As I expected more of this game, especially because of its praise in magazines and by other players, I can not recommend it. There is just too much missing, which I saw in games like Metro 2033, Half Life 2 or other story driven experiences with a character of linearity. I am not gonna put points on this game, because interest of players might differ too much.","October 29, 2015","false","3.4"," 10 of 30 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","10","30","0","0"

Otherwise it is generic and derivitive but could have been worth a play through and maybe even a hidden gem.  But the save situation makes it not worth the aggrivation.","September 7, 2015","false","7.4"," 10 of 30 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","10","30","0","0"

It kind of feels like a Metro/CoD mashup with too low a budget for any hope of living up to Metro's immersion or CoD's replayability. The combat is unrefined, NPCs are glitchy, weapons are unsatisfying, graphics are downright bad and moving your camera in a normal fashion expected of FPS gameplay might just give you a migraine. That last part could have just been me. I get what they were going for, but sadly this game is exactly what you'd expect based on the trailer and screenshots. If you're into playing an FPS a day, this one might be worth it, assuming it's cheap as heck. In general, though, SIngularity ain't worth your time. Oh, I almost forgot. At exactly 69 minutes into it I experienced a game breaking glitch that would have required me to restart the game since the "reload checkpoint" option didn't take me back far enough. I might have tried again but I decided 69 minutes fit well as Singularity's epitaph in my library.","March 30","false","1.2"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

In the beginning you are given a knife, as you are given in all modern FPS's, but a few hours in the knife is removed and replaced with an Ironman style repulsor hand thing.  Sounds cool, right?  Not if the repulsor has a recharge delay and can only be used 3 times.  WIthin minutes of losing the knife I wanted it back.

It looks nice, it plays smoothly on my less-than-stellar machine, and it has a decent alternate history story like the recent Wolfenstein game.

Singularity's first person shooting mechanics are by and large influenced by Call of Duty with a hint of old-school flair. The time powers are largely bits of Bioshock dressed up with a time-travel vibe. System Shock 2 did its ghosts the same way Singularity does its ghosts. But the problem is with all these lock, stock, and barrel 'inspirations' is that the developers didn't bother to see what made them work, and so the game turns into a ♥♥♥♥ing mishmash of things that don't really work well together.\n\nThere's all these cool weapons! But I ended up sticking with the assault rifle/shotgun duo because they are the most expedient at killing soldiers with guns/melee-focused brutes. There's an awful pistol, but I jumped away from that as soon as I got the assault rifle. There's a sniper rifle that acts like the one from Bulletstorm, but you can't store it in your weapon locker for some ludicrous ♥♥♥♥ing reason. There's a railgun with exploding rounds that's way less accurate than a standard railgun. There's a grenade launcher that you can secondary-fire to take manual control of the grenade, but Jesus Christ, I didn't spend all this time in Quake bouncing grenades off of walls and into ugly faces to be nannied by my own gun! These are all weapons with solutions in search of problems that never really materialize.\n\nWhile this game tries to innovate, it drops the ball in areas where it really shouldn't have. The game is adept at giving you a bunch of help messages and then being completely useless at pointing out exactly where you have to go! Audio logs are 'revolutionized', in that you have to wait in front of an audio log in order to hear it all, which breaks the flow of the game quite a lot. For a game focused around fast-paced running and gunning, it sure has a lot of ♥♥♥♥ing long-winded memos strewn around the place! And they're all information-and-flavor-light variants on "Something weird happened, technobabble technobabble technobabble, ow a mutant ate my arm, humans are the real monsters", etc., etc. The game sure has problems telling its own story, burdening down the player with a half-hour's worth of boring, poorly paced and told exposition before the player finally gets to shoot something. But since nobody pays attention to the story, let's focus on the real problem: The difficulty curve. Bioshock, the game that Singularity is drawing little hearts around in its notebook at school, has a proper difficulty curve and it requires you to stay competitive by ingesting plasmids and upgrading them. And by doing that, you slowly become one of the lunatics of the underwater insane asylum. Singularity, on the other hand, has a flat difficulty curve and its upgrades are just token bonuses. You are still the same old American Kick-♥♥♥ SuperCool Super Marine that's getting all the MLG 360 NOSCOPE HEADSHOTS, but you can choose to shave a fraction of a tenth off of your reload time on your shotgun. But if you don't choose to, no biggie! Just plug away! No stakes to raise, you're doing good! Everything is fine, just plug away until your shift's over!\n\nSingularity is a competent game, but it tries to be other games without understanding how those games became their own thing, and then subsequently fails to become its own thing. It's yet another plodding, mediocre mess from the fine folks at Raven Software.","September 6, 2015","false","5.9"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","7","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rgodlike/recommended/42670/","Rgodlike","Archduke Pebbles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rgodlike/","703 products in account","It's a decent game, but it has a lot of technical problems and is missing some key features. If you liked Half Life 2, Bioshock and Timeshift, but for some reason don't want to play them again, you could buy Singularity. I would say it's not a good game, but a fun game. 4/10.\n\nLet's start with the bad. There are no subtitles. Just none, at all. Considering there are usually a lot of sounds and music in the background, and all characters speak with a Russian accent, this is a gigantic problem. Also, it's just rediculous for a game from 2010 to not have subtitles.\n\nThe second problem are the options. There barely are any graphical options, and even less for audio options. The lack of the latter makes the subtitle problem even worse; you can't just lower the SFX or Music so you would hear the voices better.\n\nThe graphical options might be a result from a (bad) port. Another minor result of this might be a problem with the controls. In the beginning of the game, you can use a melee attack. However, at some point you get a new power, which is binded to the melee key, and from this moment you can no longer use your melee attack. My guess would be that it's because it was the same button on console, they made it the same button on PC as well. This sucks, since the new power you get on that button is vastly inferior to your regular melee attack.\nAnother control-related problem is the Use/Reload key. For some reason, they put both on the same key, and you can't change that. That means that you either don't have E as Use key, or the R as Reload. You get used to this quickly, but there is still no reason for this to be inconvienent.\n\nThe graphical options are bad, and possibly as a result, so are the actual graphics. The style is OK, but the texture quality is decent for the best objects, and it's terrible for some. There are some other problems that bothered me in the beginning, but I got used to fairly quick One of them was animations that would get interrupted by other animations, making it look rediculous. For instance, the recoil animation on your pistol is actually longer than the minimum time between shots, resulting the in recoiling animation ending halfway to display the shooting animation. They either should have made the animations as long as the action that they belong to, or they should have made them go over in eachother better.\nAnother graphical problem is a minor problem with a specific weapon: You are sort of invisible. There is a special weapon that lets you guide a bullet, and it uses a bulled-mounted camera to do so. If you turn the bullet 180 degrees, and look at the position that your character is standing, there is nothing there. Nothing at all. In the meantime, your enemies do see you and keep firing at you. This looks rather rediculous; the enemies fire at thin air...\n\nThat were most of the big complaints. It's quite a list, and it's the reason I would never call this a good game. I did however finish the game, and most of the time spent I enjoyed myself. That means there must some redeeming qualies.\n\nActually, there is one. The gunplay. It's a shooter, and in the end the most important part is the combat. Which is very enjoyable. There are quite some weapons and they vary greatly. That is, however the only good part, and it's still not perfect. There are many weapons, but I used most of them only for a little while, before realizing it's vastly inferior to my main weapon: the Shotgun. It's so strong that it kills almost all enemies in one shot. With your sprint you are fast enough to avoid most damage, get up close, and one-hit them. This is fun, but it also means that it's not possible without thinking "This is so much weaker than the Shotgun" on most other weapons. The only other 2 weapons that I used sometimes were the Sniper and the Minigun, both to deal with enemies from afar.\n\nApart from the gunplay, there's not much to the gameplay. You can use Time-powers in combat, but it's pointless. Depending on the enemy, it's either a useless slow, or an instant kill, and even if it's an instant kill it costs a ton of energy (you can only do this twice in a row, three with upgrades I guess), while you could also just use your shotgun for the same effect. I never had any ammo problems while I did have energy problems, and this is while I always used guns and very rarely the energy powers.\n\nThe story is enjoyable, but predictable and full of plotholes and half-explained events. For instance, there are some occasions that you change things in the past that change the future (in big and small ways). The problem is that all characters seem to know this while there is no way they could know. The explanation they give has to do with leaving notes, but it makes no sense, and it would imply that everyone believes something because it's written on a wall somewhere. Another big problem with the story is a spoiler for the ending, so skip it if you want to.  In the end the big reveal is that you are the one who changed the past and messed up the world. You saved some scientist from a burning building, and the scientist became a Russian dictator controlling the world. They act like it's a big reveal, but it's glaringly obvious and if you payed any attention to the game you would have know it an hour in. That's not the only problem: the 'solution' they give for this problem is that you go back in time to when you save this scientist, and kill YOURSELF. So you can't just kill the scientist (for no reason whatsoever) and have to kill yourself from the past, creating a time paradox (aka plothole).  That were just some examples of mistakes in the story, and overall I would say this makes the story very forgettable.\n\nThere are some more problems related to both story and gameplay. The first is the Time-Slow thing you can do while zoomed in with the Sniper. It's quite fun, but for some reason you can use this before you character ever comes in contact with Time-altering powers. It is a real Time power, and not just holding your breath or something, since it's called something like Time Dialation. There is no explanation given for this, whatsoever.\n\nThe last thing I want to point out is the pointless use of the time altering power on objects. You can make objects yourger and older, which is used for puzzles and hidden areas. It's quite fun, but you can also use it on ammo chests, audio logs and stairs, in which case it's often just pointless waiting. If you find an audio log, instead of just listening to it, you have to repair it by making it new again (i.e. press the Q button) and wait for the animation. The same with ammo chests, and stairs; you just have to wait a second before you can use the object. The idea is fun, but if you have to wait a second before using any object it's just tedious and annoying.\n\nSo overall, there's not much to this game. Nothing is exceptional, and the fun part (the shooting) get's harder to enjoy because of missing features and technical problems. In general, I think a 2010 game by Raven, published by Activision should have been much better, and it's just unacceptable to not have subtitles in this day and age. The concept was OK, and if they put a bit more time and effort in, I think it could be a very good shooter. Alas, now it's just a below-mediocore shooter. The only reason to buy this would be if all the things below are true:\n1. It's on sale for $5 or less.\n2. You really liked Half Life 2, but have no desire to play it again.\n3. You really liked Bioshock, but have no desire to play it again.\n4. You really liked Timeshift, but have no desire to play it again.\n5. You don't like to listen to music while playing games (since if you do you won't hear a word from the story)\n6. You know you can get over major and minor problems in graphics, contols, and desing for the sake of enjoyable shooting.","July 27, 2014","false","10.3"," 12 of 42 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","12","42","0","0"

The ability to selective age objects, create time warp felds, slow down time when scoping, and use telekinesis opened up a lot of cool gameplay doors. These aren't, perhaps, new features - other games have tried it out before. But this game makes an effort to let you interact with tons of environmental objects, which is nice - it turned an otherwise standard shooter experience into something that felt pretty interactive.\n\nBut the game's flaws outrank the fun. In order to get the sound to work, you need to disable any recording devices in Windows. The sensitivity bar won't allow you to go lower than a certain amount (which is still way too high), so instead of trying to find a config file, I just halved the DPI on my mouse. The FOV is artifically low (we're talking probably 65, here) so you get a claustrophobic sense of the world.\n\nI might have been able to forgive these shortcomings (and I did, for a few hours), but the real killer was the unbalanced gameplay. I handled giant mutants, blinking mutants, hordes of russians, and twisted undead with no problem. But at a specific point in the game, you're placed into the position of dealing with enemies who kill you in 2-3 shots, and which you're unable to really fight back against. The swarm of suicide bugs who, with three different hits, will kill you. The blade-armed assassin mutant who could take a literal dozen sniper shots to the head (!!) without being visibly damaged. These encounters took about half an hour to get past (a long time to spend in one encounter), with lots of frustration. And worst, they're surrounded by other no-problem encounters. I had thought to crank down the difficulty and cheese my way through these speedbumps, but you can't even do that.\n\nAdd that to the game's general low-res appearance, uninteresting environments (someone said it was all brown - that's true), and unsatisfying sound; and the result was that I simply couldn't find a reason to continue playing.","November 28, 2014","false","2.5"," 8 of 33 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","8","33","0","0"

First reason why not to buy this trash, the mentioned "time manipluation device" is one of the most annoying things in this game. second reason with your tmd you go though with your "advanced weapony" that basically is on every human enemy in the game after and before you save the doctor. The main reason you would play this game is downcast by the fact that it is used in the most agrivating way, say you come across your typical copy and paste garage door that you open with what? Oh yah a crate you have to use your time powers to get this mighty crate to place under the garage when you can clearly just go under this got me stuck at the begging of the game for some time and I was supposed to open it with a crate I thought you would look for a button or something, later on things get "explained" to you. The save are so bad I wish there was a save slot where I could save myself (I dont save often in games so I suffer from this but this is unbearable) lets explain so I was fighting a mini-boss so I died a couple times as you would expect but where I respawned was the bad part that mini-boss wasnt too hard but I had to redo a puzzle and rewatch a cutscene before i could fight it again. Still reading good, im about done now, so you are forced to forced to build your relationship with a girl with a gun who has you shoot everything for her she gets kidnapped and you rescue her with a minigun. later you fight a boss with said minigun and I havent got passed that part nor do I care but for the being able to have more reasons to hate this game and tell you not to buy this garabe that your friends actvision who shouldn't make singleplayer games made for your displeasure! well turns out in this game you have to equipe your upgrade so basically all your first upgrades are useless you only need one!","May 7, 2014","false","8.5"," 4 of 24 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","24","0","0"

It starts out reminiscent of Bioshock, where you are in a facility where something has gone wrong and you only have notes and film projectors and such to seemingly place together the story. However, you then are introduced to the time travel mechanic and the game becomes a lot more plot heavy and "shootbang".  There's about a 2 hour interlude of sorts where everything slows down and there's a drastic darker tonal shift which makes the game resemble something more like Metro 2033. I suppose it's interesting to have a game that blends different styles together but instead of being its own thing, Singularity ends up just seeming rather incoherent. There's also plenty of sections where you are simply running down corridors and shooting up nameless goons, where it really doesn't resemble anything other than maybe Call of Duty, only without any real spectacle.\n\nThe weapons are interesting, but I ended up using the assault rifle 90% of the time. Sure, I suppose you can say it's up to the play to spice up their loadout, but none of the enemies really suggested that anything else would have been a better option. The vigor/plasmid type powers are actually pretty cool and, unlike Bioshock Infinite, I found it pretty cool to not only rely on gunplay, but to also use the TMD abilities in the firefights as well.\n\nThere's really only 2, maybe 2.5 "boss fights" in the game, which are interesting enough. The game doesn't look the greatest and there are a lot of bad bad textures.\n\nSo if you've already played all of the Bioshock games and the Metro games and you want something vaguely similar and have a few days to spend on it, sure, grab this. Otherwise I can't really recommend it over any of those.","January 18, 2014","false","12.7"," 10 of 38 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","10","38","0","1"

So Russia is involed.\n\nSo, you're a black ops agent in an op in Russia and you decided to save a guy in the past. The butterfly effect therefore tells you to bend over and bow down to the soviet union as this new element, Adam- I mean, E99, has time manipulation abilities. You use your plasmids- I mean TMD, to freeze people and shoot them, age them, turn them into monsters, or teleketically grab objects to improve your abilities. You find shiney metal "Power to the People"- I mean, weapon boxes, to upgrade your weapon that absolutely no one has heard of, but are remarkable similar to the AK-47, a shotgun, a rail gun, a sniper, and other guns.\n\nThe game is very liniar and eventually leads to a paradox that is just absolutely looked over. I'm sure there's multiple endings but the one I got was "You killed the Russian leader and the guy that was helping you.

You will have to find a way to correct the past (Cold War), so that your future (Post Apocaliptic Cold War) will turn out great and then your present (Today i hope) will be fine! which makes this plot kind of messy!\n\nThe Soviets antagonists are the  "Rambo III movie" type: super heavy accent, shoot to miss first, and ask no questions later, well... 'cause they haven't got any!\n\nThe game is linear , but the annoying kind of linear, like you can't jump over a rock with the height of your knees, invisible barriers and debris who push you away from interesting sets. Mid game allies also are the only ones who can open certain doors. The soldier enemies have a set clock agenda to when to strike, some rush and then stay... and stay, until they are gun down!\n\nThe female ally is a rip-off of Alyx from Half-Life 2, only eastern european, the doctor is the typical unconscious scientist (seen many times in James Bond Movies and Mission Impossible 2) who never thought the thing he created could possibly mess the world more than the Cold War itself!

Singularity has a lot of interesting ideas, but takes advantage of none of them. The game's big gimmick, the TMD, is nothing more than a contextual extra "use" key. While it has other abilities to use against enemies, none of them I encountered were entirely necessary to use. This is mostly because the game's assault rifle is the greatest weapon ever created in the history gaming. With plentiful ammo, high accuracy, low recoil, and able to take out most common enemies with one headshot, there is no real reason to use any other weapon. It's effectiveness causes the novelty of the games "unique" weapons to wear off very fast. Sure, you can use the gun that allows you to guide bullets into enemies around cover, or slightly out of your line of sight. But in the time it takes for you to guide that bullet into a single enemy, you can kill that same enemy and his 5 comrades, and the rest of his reinforcements in the same amount of time with that godlike assault rifle. There is nothing else to the gunplay, just shoot them in the face with the AR and gg. You can't even throw grenades. You'll find more depth in a CoD game, which is an impressive feat I must admit.\n\nBeyond the boring gunplay there is not much else of merit. The story suffers the same logical inconsistencies of any story involving time travel. My favorite part was going back in time to stop the evil Russian general from killing the good scientist, and after bursting into the room, unloading 10+ bullets into his face and blasting him through the window several stories above the ground, he ends up surviving and going on to rule the world. ♥♥♥♥in Russians man. The characters are dull cliches ripped off from other, better games. The evil general, the good scientist, and the random woman helping you are basically the Russian copies of Dr. Breen, Dr. Kleiner, and Alyx from HL2. There's also the incredibly generic soldier buddy that you'll find by the dozens in any CoD game. You spend about the first 30 minutes of the game with him until he gets shot in the face by the general because he's a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥. This of course is after you get randomly sent back in time and accidentally save the general because you're a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ as well. The only interesting attribute of any of them was the well modelled ♥♥♥ of the woman, but I digress...\n\nOverall, Singularity is an incredibly bland shooter with some well conceptualized yet poorly executed ideas. If you absolutely must try it however, or you think I'm full of ♥♥♥♥, at the very least wait to buy it when it's on sale for $5 or less.","February 27, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","3","24","0","0"

However, the further I got, the less I liked it. The reason why I don't like it is because it tries to be several different games at once.

In fact, I was so bored by the game that by the time I got to the end, I didn't even care what happened to any of the characters anymore.

The premise of the game is completely awesome, at least for me, as I like time travel stuff.

The plot and story is great and is really fun to discover the various twists of what really happened although I cant go into to much detail without spoiling the story.\n\nThe TMD device is fun and interesting but is really underused, there just isnt enough to do with it and the upgrade system although useful is not relevant enough that you can just bypass it totally.  Ammo is never an issue as there is just endless boxes and crates with ammo, similarly with med kids you will never run out they seem to be around every single corner and you can carry 5 with you (more with upgrades) so its really almost impossible to die or be stuck in a situation where you creep around with almost zero health praying for a med kid.\n\nWeapon loadout is varied although once you find your favorite weapon you will probably stick to it for most of the game.\n\n","May 19, 2011","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You're given a few puzzles to solve and while at first it may seem fun, the gimmick quickly wears thin. The problem is that much of the game mechanic's potential stays untapped. There are about two different puzzles that are recycled throughout. So much could have been done to make this a thinking man's game, but alas, I can only brand Singularity as another generic shooter.\n\nGrade: B","May 31, 2011","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People who used to live there abandoned their normal lives for good, leaving papers on the tables, schools are full of children drawnings and kitchens are still filled with canned food and pots. It's a wonderful game, full of places to explore and learn about what happened in the island, and Singularity really rewards exploration, so please, don't rush while playing this game, take your time because you'll be rewarded with secrets that only the devs at Raven could have done so well. Most of the plot is explained by notes you find scattered around the buildings and audio logs. Some are well hidden, requiring even a bit of thinking before you can reach them, which I myself think it's just awesome. This is a feature that you'll find in Bioshock, but in Singularity I find it particularly better, because the voice acting is just perfect (at the beggining of the game you'll hear some audio logs made by the children themselves, trust me, it'll give you some chills). There is a couple more features that will bring Bioshock to mind, for instance the way you collect items in the game: you must interact with them pressing a key, only ammo you can actually pick up running above them; the health system isn't regenerative as in most shooters, you must collect aid packs to use later pressing another key, as with Bioshock.\n\nSingularity has kind of the same pace as Bioshock, that is having you searching the place for clues, secrets and items, then entering in some fire-fights. During the action scenes you can use a very well selected variety of weapons, and it doesn't limit itself with the everyday shotgun and machine gun: you have weapons that let you literaly guide the bullet, and even a grenade launcher that let you "drive" the grenade around the environment; even the usual sniper rifle has a feature that let you slow down time to aim well at your targets. Unlike in Bioshock, in Singularity you really feel the 'oomph' of the weapons, they aren't just pea shooters and the enemies aren't bullet sponges who just loves to break your immersion. I wouldn't call Singularity a shooter, because it has more to offer; but when you have to shoot somebody, it does well, with solid shooter mechanics, reload animations and weapon upgrades.\n\nThe main feature of the game is presented by the Time Manipulating Device, or TMD, which works as a glove that you wear in your left hand. With it, you can solve puzzles buy aging and renewing some objects, like crates, stairs and machinery. As you progress within that game, you can upgrade it with new powers, just like you do with the plasmids found in Bioshock, but as I said, Singularity has its own charm, it only takes inspiration in Bioshock, although sometimes I felt as it was the other way around, because everything Singularity does, it does better than Bioshock. These new powers let you launch pulse explosions, create bubbles that stops time within it, age enemies until they're just a pile of dust and manipulate objects just like the Gravity Gun (again, Half-Life 2).\n\nSingularity has a total of three endings that conclude the narrative in three awesome and distinct ways, that you would finish in something like 8 hours or so.\n\nSounds\n\nEverything in this game sounds good: the voice acting, gun shots, explosions, the russian lines spoken by some enemies, the soundtrack that changes accordingly... It's everything well done.\n\nTechnically\n\nI saw some people saying it runs badly, but it is one of those games that was completely polished and well optimized; I could reach 120fps (it doesn't have fps limit as most games out there), and my PC is kind of mid range: i5 2400 3.10GHz, 8GB ram, Windows 7 64bits and a GTX650 1GB.\n\nSo, if you are the kind of gamer who likes plot oriented games, with a good shooting mechanics and full of out of the ordinary places to explore, just like Half-Life and Bioshock, you definitely should give SIngularity a go. But don't expect a rip off, because this game was well done, it has all of the Raven style that old gamers love and it's really one of its kind.","May 14, 2014","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Last year's Wolfenstein was a bit tedious after you got into the meat of the game, yet was still quite entertaining to me. Starting Singularity, I was immediately captivated and interested in where the story was heading, invoking a cheesy albeit charming science-fiction-B-movie feel. The pacing is great and the game mechanics heavily remind me of a hybrid of Half-Life 2 and Bioshock. I was honestly taken aback by how much I liked this game, though the $50 pricetag is steep for a June 2010 release (I bought it in October for the full $60!).

I liked the look of it when it released in 2010 but could never bring myself to buy it at full price. I picked it up on sale from Steam for about $8 and for that price is it probably worth it.\n\nThe Singularity isn't a bad game in any way but it relies to much on being derivative of it's peers and often makes the classic modern FPS mistake of using a brown color pallet and heavy industrial level design.\n\nThe shooting itself is good if not great, the enemies are varied (shades of Doom, Wolfenstein, Half Life and even COD can be seen here) and weapons and your TMD (read Half life 2 gravity gun mix with some other stuff) can be upgraded. Towards the end of the game you can do some really neat things with your TMD/weapon combos that keep combat fun and lively.\n\nThe story is a little convoluted and the characters are muddy. Much like the TMD rips off Half Life 2's gravity gun in some respects so the cast here are retreads of the characters in the older game. The female lead is a poor man's Alyx Vance but does a serviceable job guiding you through the story. I just had a hard time connecting with the characters, although I will say the multiple endings to the game is a nice touch!\n\nThe TMD does also allow for some minor puzzle elements that can initially seem taxing but once you have seen one of about the 3 or 4 puzzles that are used through the game you can quickly identify and solve them. In the end what strikes you as an “oh wow nice touch” trick the first time ends up feeling played about by the 25th.\n\nThis leads me onto my biggest gripe with the game: the level design. The Singularity has some amazing potential and wastes it utterly with brown industrial environ after brown industrial environ. The levels set in the past are, varied, bright, colorful and full of unique little touches that made me want to explore this cold war era lab (it really reminded me of half life 1, a living breathing facility I wanted to inhabit not just visit). It is a crying shame that you never visit them for more than 10 minutes at a time. These levels are also filled with Russian soliders that act half way intelligently and are fun to fight. The modern levels by contrast are by the numbers brown boxes that remind me of quake 1 or painkiller with less character. The enemies that inhabit them are varied and some are fun to fight but too many simply charge at you. Once you acquire some decent weapons and TMD upgrades they become a chore to fight.\n\nThe split between old and modern sums up the Singularity well for every good moment there is something dull and bland. A unique feature or moment here is followed by a dull 30 minute sepia section shortly after. If only Raven had stuck to using the 50's setting throughout the game we may have had a truly unique and classic game on our hands. It's still a decent shooter and well worth a blast through if you can get it for under $10 but I came away feeling happy I played it but sad that it wasn't as good as it could have been.\n\n7/10\n","May 4, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puzzles are nto stupid hard btu nto really easy either and there are not too many of them either.\n\n-Gun sounds need more work. Not very punchy sounding. The Magnum style gun in particular and the sniper rifle.\n-A bit short hwoever if you want a short game this is perfect. I completed it in 7 hours. I explored everywhere as well.\n-Gun's could have been a bit more interesting. Mabe a secondary ability on the autocannon would have been nice adn the shotgun.\n-Progression system and weapon upgrades are very boring. Would have liked to have seen some E-99 infused guns like the autocannon rounds fired E-99 shells, fires slower but packs a hell of a punch. That would have been cool.\n-No side quests.\n-Linear game but encourages exploration.\n-Difficulty is a strange one. I would have liked to have seen a setting between Medium and Hard. Hard is stupid difficult and Medium is just too easy.\n\nThere arfe probably more pro's and con's but I cannot think of them all.\n\nI decided to give it a score in the end but at the end so you ahve to read it all......hahahah.\n\nI give it an above average of 6/10. In comaprison I would give BF4 a 5/10 so thats pretty good. Average is a 5 and this game is not average in anything. An overall great game if I am honest and is great value for only £2 soemthing.\n\nEdit\n\nThe game is a great PC port. There are a descent amount of settings. Nice sound assets other then the guns. Frame rate is wanderful. FOV seems to be ok with this game in retrospect I play all my games at at least 95-100 if I can.

I read a lot about this game. Like there is a huge budget for this game and there were worries that it wouldn't sell that well.\n\nThe story\nThe game is about a secret Soviet weapon that has been fueled by an element called E99. That can be used to temper with time on a very local scale. It is travelling foreward and backwards in time that eventually clears the reasons and causes of all the troubles and combat you are in. There are some good suprises in the story and some very good "shock and awe" moments. I really enjoyed it all I must admit. I couldn't really stop playing till the end of the story and thus the game.\n\nThe theme "time travel" always fascinated me from the time I saw the movie and read the book Time Machine by Orson Wells. So that of time travel is a very big plus or pro for me.\n\nWay of telling\nThe story telling is being done with ocassional cutscenes that reminded me of Call Of Duty in a way. You start out with a search of a secret Soviet base on an remote island close to the Russian border. You search the base or island I must say for clues what happened in the past and why there such strange mutated creatures roaming around the island? This gave me the feeling of the game Stalker where a nuclear accident also created strange mutations among the wildlife or even to the human inhabitants. Ocassionally you see ghosts from the past acting out scenes of mayhem that happened years ago. Those scenes reminded me of the game FEAR somehow. Where you also had flashbacks via ghostly like scenes. That sented chills down my spine.\n\nFilm and sound footage\nThe story is good and even backed up with some very amusing films and sound footage that have been scattered around the base. Those recordings you can listen to or even see in film projectors still functioning at the base. Most of the time the have that eerie looking sound or damaged footage of aging of some other violent event.\n\nGraphics and sounds\nThe graphics are superb and the sounds are very well done. Although the story is very amusing to say the least. It also makes the maps a little linear in a way. There is no free roaming around the maps like you can with so many roleplaying games. But do not let that spoil the fun. There are still plenty of places to search for loot like ammo and the E99 fuel metals.\n\nYou have to find certain characters in the game. Get this tool or this element find it take it somewhere and all backed up by a more or less logical story line. Do I recommend it? Oh yes you should try this game if you like the elements of timetravel and some scary horror moments in a game.\n\nA game for mature players\nSo I must add this game is for the mature players that like some gory scenes from time to time. There are a lot of dead corpses  some even impaled (like in games like Doom) and bloodbaths. When you shoot enemies they lose limps and other body parts by the impact of the bullets. There is even an time weapon where you can "age" people very fast.\n\nA very good game & get it if you can\nSo be warned or informed what ever you like. This is a good well done game. You can see there has been put a lot of effort in this game. So I do recommend this game. Go for it if you like the things mentioned above.","May 5, 2014","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me about 8 hours to complete and I enjoyed the gameplay. I was probably about two hours in before the game picked up so if you're feeling bored at first, don't be too discouraged to continue on. You're given the Time Distortion Device and are able to upgrade it throughout the game. The TMD lets you solve puzzles and perform combination attacks on enemies. The combat was fun and the boss fights were also fun; you're given at least a couple options for killing things so it is entertaining in that aspect. There are notes to read and audio logs to listen to throughout the game that will help fill in the story.\n\nI enjoyed the audio and the graphics were decent but consider that this game was made in 2010 so the visuals aren't just awesome. There is no anti-aliasing setting in the game's options but you can simply override that in the NVIDIA Control Panel and it should work. I likely won't replay the game since I read everything the first time through, but it was worth the sale price.","June 30, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thnikaman42/recommended/42670/","Thnikaman42","Brave Sir Robin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thnikaman42/","300 products in account","Short Answer\n\nShould you buy it - $30 is a little bit much for a four year old game but it is a good game and if you really like FPS's, Yes\nShould you buy it on sale - Absolutely\n\nLong Answer\n\nSingularity is a standard FPS with just a little bit more that sets it above the norm.\n\nVisuals : The visuals in the game wont destroy your graphics card or anything but it does tax it a little bit. The scenery and set pieces look very nice, sometimes really pretty. There is no reuse of areas that I can tell ( aka same corridor syndrome ) and you will get a good feeling of progression ( you can visually see getting closer to your goal). The enemies look nice but dont change much in the looks area but at least you dont get the same guy but his time hes red! Overall - Good looking game that helps to visually immerse you into the world.\n\nStory and Setting : (Spoiler Free) The setting is an Island off the coast of Russia that has some dirty little secrets and as a US special forces soldier you have to infiltrate the island and find out what is going on. As a base story it is just like most of the other FPS games out there but Singularity adds a nice twist on the basic formula that makes it feel new and refreshing. Overall - The story wont break the bank on amazing plots but it will engage you very well and help to keep you playing to find out what happens next.\n\nGameplay : This is were the game really sets itself above a normal FPS. It has a slight rpg feel with upgradeable weapons and skill selecting although neither is a game changer or breaker. It has good gun play and the powers that you use are fun and work well but what this game does really well is that it lets you play the way you want to. No, there is no stealth or anything like that, it is all action and if something is in your way it has to die but the game gives you incredible freedom on how it dies.   You can play and complete this entire game with nothing but guns or once you get your powers you can complete the entire game with those. It never limits you and it gives you plenty of ammo or easily throwable items no matter which way you want to play. Overall - The gameplay is great and gives you a great feel of freedom that never tells you how you should play it\n\nReplayability : While the story does give this game a little bit of replay ( you might want to play again just to see all the clues you didnt understand in the first playthrough ) and the gameplay lets you play it again in differnet ways, there is really no reason to play it more than a few times.\n\nPersonal overall enjoyment - This game was a good change of pace to me for normal FPS's. I enjoyed playing the game and was glad of the purchase I made. I will probably play it again sometime down the line and have no problem recommending it as a good game.","July 2, 2014","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Content is laughable, 8 hours played to complete the game doing everything possible on the hardest difficulty (still laughably easy).

It is very story driven and in my oppinion never got boring during the singleplayer campaign. The ending of the game is fabulous, and the whole time-manipulation part of the combat is just endless amounts of fun! Especially since every time the Time manipulation device gets boring to play with, the story naturally implements some upgrading of the TMD to make it do something new, or do everything better. I can't even begin to describe how awesome I think this game is.\nThe only downside is the multiplayer part, which probably would be loads of fun, but since noone seems to be playing it you won't even be able to try a single match of abberations vs soldiers.\nAll in all, event tho the multiplayer is empty of people - the singleplayer part makes this a 9/10 game.\n","December 22, 2011","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It won't win awards or get great acclaim, but it is hugely entertaining.\nThe shooter mechanics are solid, the guns feel suitably meaty and the enemy impact is satisfying. The story is very interesting, the time travel aspects and "ghosts of the past" give haunting views of the events on Katorga 12, much improving the now standard notes and recordings way of telling the story.

Nice items are placed in action sequence areas, forcing you to stop combat to collect them.\n\nAnd yet the combat is gleeful. Every gun is ridiculously strong, but enemies still swarm well enough to make hard mode challenging. The sniper rifle one-shots everything no matter where you hit and lets you slow time.

The aesthetic is great, there's a small but varied set of weapons, and an upgrade system with several different perks. I can't really describe it in any other way, but this game is FUN. I love a bunch of triple-A titles, but sometimes I'm not in the mood to play them. This game is fun any time of the day, it's just a blast.

Story is… well shooter story material, interesting but nothing to write home about. The suspense at the beginning of the game is well done. Time manipulation is interesting yet straightforward.\n\nCons- suspense cuts out very quickly after the enemies change, but combat picks up a bit. Time “puzzles” are very simple.

Yes, the story is not *that* original. And yes, in normal difficulty the game throws medipacks and ammo at you continously so that you never need to worry. There are some easy-to-solve switch puzzles that make for rather quiet situations, followed by explosive killfests with mangled bodies flying around. The weapons are awesome, especially the "experimental" stuff like the steerable bullet that make your targets explode in a fountain of flesh and blood. Very satisfying :)\n\nAlthough the story isn't outstanding, it is brilliantly told! Scripted events, explosions, dialogues, story twists... the Half Life-Formula is working great. The level design is good enough to let you dive into the world - which is disturbed by invisible walls you often walk into.\n\nOverall I was entertained from start to end - and that is what I want when I play a science fiction FPS ;)","June 24, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game doesn't support proper widescreen video resolutions and comes with some serious sound issues. When you get to actually playing the game you'll find the weapon selection lackluster, with a few exceptions. The upgrade functionality feels tacked on and many of the enemies are more annonyances than anything else. The time manipulation mechanic is okay, but I feel they could have done more with it. Multiplayer is a crapshoot and dead.\n\nEven so, Singularity does have some redeeming qualities. The story is a real head spinner with 3 seperate endings; although which one you get has nothing to do with your actions throughout the game and instead comes down to one decision at the very end of the game. The plot will have you guessing to the end, and then some. Some of the set peices throughout the story are really amazing, and the boss fights stand out as high points.\n\nOverall, I'd give it 5/10.

The story was great and kept me wanting to see what happens next with many twists and random time rifts.  The TMD added a pretty good side to combat and allowed many abilities of slowing down enemies, impulse attacks, and later allowed you to turn soldiers into monsters which adds a three way battle technique.  The game took me roughly 6 hours to complete while looking into every corner for every secret and listening to every tape recorder and reading every note I found, so it is relativiley short for a single player based game.  There is a multiplayer but I have yet to try it.  I would reccomend this game if you enjoyed Half Life or metro games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pottypie/recommended/42670/","pottypie","Capt. Pottypie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pottypie/","315 products in account","Okay. I am going to start this out by saying something: THIS IS A HORROR GAME.\n\nI personally picked it up because I enjoy games with interesting twists, like using time in combat. Nowhere said that this game is scarey. It ♥♥♥♥ing is.\n\nThat said, lets review:\n\nTHE GOOD:\nTime and combat work very well together, you can (once you get the right upgrades) slow/nearly stop time, blast people's legs, arms and heads off, age/reduce in age objects, people, and mutants, as well as shoot them up with a big ♥♥♥ shotgun, or whatever else you fancy.\nIf the game is meant to do horror, it does it well (for me), with various jumpscares that are very nicely implimented (ie. scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of you since you don't expect them), and the atmosphere is one of uncomfortable ruins.\nThe shooting works. You shoot people, if you shoot them enough, they die. The guns sound quite weak, which is normal for modern shooters, but people react to some extent when shot (especially with the shotgun)\nBasic upgrade system for guns, with some customisation for your time powers, and various perks you can get.\nNew mechanics are added constantly through the game, so you never feel like your game is stagnating.\nAlthough the game is completely linear in its story until the end (2 endings and a 'hidden' ending), there are plenty of areas to explore that can add 1-3 hours onto the game (its about 6 hours if you just follow the footsteps)\n\nTHE BAD\nThe plot is a little hard to follow at times, and there are some questions at the end I just want answering, and don't seem to be answered. I won't leave them here as they WILL spoil the game for you.\nThe AI is a little off. People with guns will generally either stay where they are (which is typically in the middle of a corridor with no cover) or just run to their set position and start firing. Mutants just run towards you on the shortest trajectory.\nNot many bosses as such, only a couple of points where you meet more powerful mutants that are annoying to kill. To make up for that, you have a couple of timed RUN AWAY sequences. Yay.\nOne of the time powers is really annoying to set off, as it involves pressing the button for another power twice quickly, which rarely works. I guess this is probably a legacy from consoles, where you have about 8 buttons for everything.\nThe description on the store page isn't quite telling the truth. You do no 'travel seamlessly between 1955 and 2010'. The game pretty much orders you into a rift so you can go back in time, do something to alter the future, then go back into the present to carry on as normal. You don't get the choice of when you want to go back, you just have to.\n\nThe Ugly\nThe graphics are quickly aging, and not terribly gracefully.\nThose mutants are not going to win any beauty contests any time soon.\n\nOverall score: 74/100. If you like horror FPS games, pick it up, if not, then its probably for the best to leave it. I got it on sale and it was well worth the cost, even if it did leave me with a couple of nights when I regretted playing it in the evening.","May 18, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely worth playing again. Story revolves around a newly discovered (ficticious) element, e99, and the island Katorga-12 where it is exclusively found. E99 holds enormous energetic potential, but is unstable, mutates organic life, and distorts time where it abounds. You are a captain in the u.s. military sent to the island; thought abandoned, to investigate an energy signature which is blinding u.s. spy satelittes. Upon arriving, a temporal wake engulfs you, sending you back in time to 1955. There you find yourself in the same lab facility as it burns. Without hesitation, you rescue a scientist, Demichev. Only before a 2nd temporal wake brings you back to 2010. Demichev was one of two lead scientists heading research into the element and its application. He will continue recklessly pursuing his controversial research without regard for life. His research results in the development and collapse of the singularity, it kills 1000s instantly and mutates any remaning survivors on the island. The result is a paranormal, atemporal mess, torn by violence. Failing to be disuaded, Demichev develops e99 weaponry and quickly rises to power, empowering Russia to conquer the world. The game is primarily about restoring the timeline, but throughout the game you encounter cryptic warnings, written in messages only you can reveal. Perhaps left by a future-you? or by MIR-12? A mysterious organization with knowlecge they couldn't possibly posess, and whose intentions are unclear. As far as enemies, the mutant survivors of the island, warped by the energy of singularity collapse are almost alien. They move incredibly fast, in and out of phase, or can teleport. Others have heightened hearing, but are blind. Still others have become incredibly large. Temporal rifts frequent the game where you can witness events in the past occuring concurrently with the present; revealing the tragic deaths of the inhabitants. Recordings also build this story and reveal what happened in the time since you traveled to 1955. Mostly detailing the exodus of survivors and their horrific deaths attempting to leave. Weapons are also e99 based. Guided rounds, sniper that can slow down time for precise shots, and standard-shooter semi-auto shotgun, assault rifle, and minigun. The most fun is with your TMD, a device you are led to early in the game which embues you with great power. You can create time manipulation fields that age/rejuvenate items or people/mutants, timelocks which freeze time, you can pull things between time-periods, and jump between the years 1955 and 2010. Futher more, you can unleash a blast of energy from your palm that will send enemies flying or will rip them apart. Graphics were out of date even for it's time, but it's just bloody fun to play. And the story line is eery, but enjoyable. Short, but worth your attention, especially if you're into paranormal or sci-fi horror games. Fans of the metro or STALKER series would enjoy, although the feel is much more arcade.","August 24, 2014","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked the look of it when it released in 2010 but could never bring myself to buy it at full price. I picked it up on sale from Steam for about $8 and for that price is it probably worth it.\n\nThe Singularity isn't a bad game in any way but it relies to much on being derivative of it's peers and often makes the classic modern FPS mistake of using a brown color pallet and heavy industrial level design.\n\nThe shooting itself is good if not great, the enemies are varied (shades of Doom, Wolfenstein, Half Life and even COD can be seen here) and weapons and your TMD (read Half life 2 gravity gun mix with some other stuff) can be upgraded. Towards the end of the game you can do some really neat things with your TMD/weapon combos that keep combat fun and lively.\n\nThe story is a little convoluted and the characters are muddy. Much like the TMD rips off Half Life 2's gravity gun in some respects so the cast here are retreads of the characters in the older game. The female lead is a poor man's Alyx Vance but does a serviceable job guiding you through the story. I just had a hard time connecting with the characters, although I will say the multiple endings to the game is a nice touch!\n\nThe TMD does also allow for some minor puzzle elements that can initially seem taxing but once you have seen one of about the 3 or 4 puzzles that are used through the game you can quickly identify and solve them. In the end what strikes you as an “oh wow nice touch” trick the first time ends up feeling played about by the 25th.\n\nThis leads me onto my biggest gripe with the game: the level design. The Singularity has some amazing potential and wastes it utterly with brown industrial environ after brown industrial environ. The levels set in the past are, varied, bright, colorful and full of unique little touches that made me want to explore this cold war era lab (it really reminded me of half life 1, a living breathing facility I wanted to inhabit not just visit). It is a crying shame that you never visit them for more than 10 minutes at a time. These levels are also filled with Russian soliders that act half way intelligently and are fun to fight. The modern levels by contrast are by the numbers brown boxes that remind me of quake 1 or painkiller with less character. The enemies that inhabit them are varied and some are fun to fight but too many simply charge at you. Once you acquire some decent weapons and TMD upgrades they become a chore to fight.\n\nThe split between old and modern sums up the Singularity well for every good moment there is something dull and bland. A unique feature or moment here is followed by a dull 30 minute sepia section shortly after. If only Raven had stuck to using the 50's setting throughout the game we may have had a truly unique and classic game on our hands. It's still a decent shooter and well worth a blast through if you can get it for under $10 but I came away feeling happy I played it but sad that it wasn't as good as it could have been.\n\n7/10\n","May 4, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am surprised it was published by Activision as all they really do now is COD. A much better shooter than COD has ever been and liekly ever will be. Shame we didn't get a sequel. I am not going to give it a score but I will give it pro's and cons.\n\n+Nice lighting effects and pretty descent graphics esspecially for it's time.\n+Nice fairly original story\n+Fairly interesting characters\n+Good monster and enemy design\n+Fairly interestign guns\n+Nice not in-your face progression\n+Good level design, also good puzzle design. Puzzles are nto stupid hard btu nto really easy either and there are not too many of them either.\n\n-Gun sounds need more work. Not very punchy sounding. The Magnum style gun in particular and the sniper rifle.\n-A bit short hwoever if you want a short game this is perfect. I completed it in 7 hours. I explored everywhere as well.\n-Gun's could have been a bit more interesting. Mabe a secondary ability on the autocannon would have been nice adn the shotgun.\n-Progression system and weapon upgrades are very boring. Would have liked to have seen some E-99 infused guns like the autocannon rounds fired E-99 shells, fires slower but packs a hell of a punch. That would have been cool.\n-No side quests.\n-Linear game but encourages exploration.\n-Difficulty is a strange one. I would have liked to have seen a setting between Medium and Hard. Hard is stupid difficult and Medium is just too easy.\n\nThere arfe probably more pro's and con's but I cannot think of them all.\n\nI decided to give it a score in the end but at the end so you ahve to read it all......hahahah.\n\nI give it an above average of 6/10. In comaprison I would give BF4 a 5/10 so thats pretty good. Average is a 5 and this game is not average in anything. An overall great game if I am honest and is great value for only £2 soemthing.\n\nEdit\n\nThe game is a great PC port. There are a descent amount of settings. Nice sound assets other then the guns. Frame rate is wanderful. FOV seems to be ok with this game in retrospect I play all my games at at least 95-100 if I can. This game is probably 80 around that but it feels very pleasant to play for me.","May 6, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a much better shooter than Bioshock infinite though except the fact that the world of Bioshock is truly special. Singularity also goes down the horror and atmosphere route quite effectively.\n\nThe graphics of this game on the other hand are really good despite its age, except that it can be a tad bit "brown" even though it suits the setting. It is a quality game with great detail and animation.\nThe only big negative (which can be fixed quite easily) is that the FOV is truly awful and can't be changed in the game itself. I guess the game was developed with a consoles in mind. I would say it is actually unplayable unless you fix this. I installed "flawless windescreen", a free program who easily remedies the problem. There might be other ways as well. Really, don't play this game without the fix.\n\nA truly great game that for some reason seems to have gone a bit under the radar.

The only reason I bought was the 75% Sale and ohhh I'm happy I did. From the beging of the game and about 1-2 hours in the game looks and feels like a normal FFS game. But once you get the singularity glow things starts to become awesome. The story it self becomes better and better the longer you play.\n\nGood things:\n- Nice weaponds and powers\n- The story becomes better and better\n- There are multiple endings\n- It's a fair balanced to weaponds and powers, as well as the enemies\n- I would buy this even if it was not on sale\n- Once you have finished the game you can only press continue and from there you can chose a diffent ending\n\nBad things:\n- It takes about 1 hour before the game becomes good (not just a FFS game)\n- It starts out weird and feels a little like a survival horror game before you get your first gun\n- The bosses was to easy to kill, never died once on a sing boss but have died to normal enemies\n- To few bosses, only 2\n\nSummary:\nA nice short game, about 6 hours for me. Good in story wise and athe powers are cool but still need a little skill to use them well.

It may not be quite as good as any of those games, but it's well worth your time to play through. The story is very solid, combining historical and sci-fi elements seemlessly.

I played it out in one sitting, which should say enough on its own. Singularity is basically a mix of Wolfenstein and Half-Life with an obvious flavor of Timeshift and some distinct Dead Space aftertastes.\n\nIt is a linear game, but it shines and confuses just enough to actually give you the ability to miss things because you wander down the corridor that you think is the 'side room' and it turns out to be the next section which prevents you from heading back. (The save points are killer for us completionists in that way.) The huge amount of world-building, be it through notes and projectors of varying kinds, or even the outright 'experience' as only a time-travel game can.. it all makes for a highly enjoyable and engaging experience.\n\nMy biggest complaint is probably the fact that whenever the game tosses you a special weapon with a 'you will need this', you know that you are in for a lot of pain. Not because of the crazy battles, but rather because those special weapons tend to be so damn awkward compared to more conventional stuff that I just keep dying when using them. Having been trained by those moments to love my regular weapons, I ended up specializing in my two favorites and avoided everything else like the plague. (I liked one or two other weapons too, but you can only carry two weapons with you, so why waste time and effort upgrading those other weapons?) Regardless, there is plenty of variety in the terrain allowing most of those weapons to find some times to shine, although actually having the right weapon in the right situation is a rarity outside of those moments where the game literally feeds you the gun in question. Throw in the ever developing time-related mechanics and it is definitely more than yet another shooter.\n\nI'd probably give it a 9/10.","March 22","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also prefer my shooting games to have something quirky or fun or special to set them apart from all the other shooting games. I bought Singularity and it delivered, for the most part, at least.\n\nSingularity is a very basic shooter. It's story is nothing really special (it's a very predictable time-traveling mess), the voice acting is standard, the guns are regular guns (except for the seeker, which the game occasionally hands you so you can have some fun) and the enemies are russians who shoot you and mutants that slash, punch and bite you.\n\nSo what sets this game apart?\n\nThe TIME MANIPULATION DEVICE! While the game occasionally seems to forget that the thing exists, and while the mechanics on which it operates (story-wise) are confusing as hell and while it's mostly just a gravity gun with a "kill enemy" function, it DOES set Singularity apart from all the other shooters. An enemy giving you trouble? Age him/it to dust! A bunch of soldiers giving you trouble? Revert a couple of them into feral mutants and watch the madness. The TMD also allows for some fun puzzle design, which is a bonus as far as I am concerned.\n\nSingularity is not a long game and it's not the best game there is, but it's competent and well worth a few bucks and an evening or two.\n\n\nPlaytime: 5+ hours (single playthrough)\n\nRatings (1-10)\nVisual: 7\nAudio: 7\nStory: 5\nGameplay: 8\nOverall: 7","July 20, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few years later, with Borderlands 2 and Mass Effect under my belt, I found the game suggested in my steam queue, and purchased it the next time it went on sale. I was surprised to find that the game had aged well, and was solid.\nThe meat of the game is in the gameplay. Singularity takes a solid shooter base, and adds interesting time-manipulation mechanics to the combat. Enemies are varied and interesting, and different tactics are required to deal with them. The standard arsenal of pistol, machine gun, shotgun, and sniper rifle are augmented with a few other interesting and appropriately scifi weapons, which you can upgrade.\nThe setting is an island named Katorga-12, a secret soviet research facility. The levels are well designed, and full of personality. There are lots of notes to read, and audio recordings to give you a look into the history of the island. Little details all over the place create an immersive experience that encourages exploring every nook and cranny. Periodic puzzle sections provide a pleasant change of pace without being too difficult, and "thinking with portals" (as it were) provides access to extra goodies.\nThat being said, the game, like most FPSs, is extremely linear. Despite the themes of time travel and choice-consequence, you have no real say in how the story plays out, save for the 3-ish choices you have right at the end. This is frustrating, especially as you find messages all over calling your actions into question. I spent the whole game looking for a fork-in-the-road, and there isn't any.\nLikes:\n- Solid game-play, suitably varied\n- Well-built levels that are both lovely to look at and fun to explore.\n- Intriguing, timey-wimey lore\nDislikes:\n- Linear levels\n- Linear Narrative\n- Spooky tutorial levels!\n- Short length","December 22, 2015","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A variety of weapons was nice to see, but the weapons system could've been better handeled--specifically the upgrades.  Rather than having upgrades to counter the weaknesses that the weapons all had, each weapon unfortunately all had the same upgrades of Clip Capacity (hold more ammo overall), Reload Speed, and Damage.  The system could've easily taken into account the charge factor for the railgun and decreased the amount of time that it took to charge, for instance, or it could've given the grenade launcher a higher range--different upgrades depending on the weapon, to overcome the respective weapon's weaknesses.  It was also nice to see a variety of enemies.\n\nThe overall singleplayer campaign is roughly 10 hours long, but it is an interesting game, and I certainly recommend it if you can overlook its flaws.  I'd give it an 8/10, only because of the seemingly lazy implementation of weapons upgrades (as opposed to character upgrades), and that they could've fleshed out the characters a bit more and made you actually feel some sort of sentiment or attachment to said characters.  Also, the suicide-bombing swarm bug enemies (I think they were called Phase Ticks).  Seriously, screw those guys.","January 7","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only decided to try this game once i  saw it on a top 10 hidden gems countdown. I did enjoy my time with the game but i do have a few problems with it that may ruin the game for some people. For starters the game is a measly 5 hours long with little replay value. Yes the game dose have multiple endings but the game saves your progress right before your chose what ending you will get. My next problem is the difficulty. The game in my opinion was way to easy. The tmd made combat interesting but it also made you unstoppable. And the amount of medkits you get are insane. there were many times where i would pass up on 5 in one room because i was maxed out. I only died once and stood there and let 5 monsters chomp on me while i spun around. The few bosses that are there honestly just feel like normal enemies with giant ♥♥♥♥ me blisters on them. The only thing that stuck out in my mind was the weapon selection. you have your basics like a revolver, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. But then you start getting guns like the spikeshot that is a railgun with a delay or a grenade launcher that has grenades that you can move on your own. However you are limited to two guns that you can carry except for super weapons. I went through most of the game with the assault rife as my primary for most of the game. and if the is a situation where you can use a gun to its fullest there is convinently a dead body with on laying right in front of you. The super weapons bring the most flavor to the table. The seeker fires an explosive round that you can control in a cool bullet time scene. And then there is a rocket launcher. Ok they may have run out of ideas at that point. The game is fun however and if you looking to kill some time (no pun intended) i recommend picking this game up only on a sale though.","May 6, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself on the edge of my chair enjoying a great narrative about time travel and how you can re-write the past to change the future.\nDont worry about this game aging poorly either cause I played all of it recently in 2015, and still found this game more than acceptable (coming from a guy who loves graphics a lot).

After that a lot of things start to happen kinda without explanation. So I strongly feel that this game was rushed at the end and that the game kinda suffered for it, this is something I will come back to several times in this review.\n\nCharactersYou yourself is much like a Gordon Freeman, voiceless and even faceless in this game. I honestly think this is a bit of a shame, they could have made the story more intriguing and interesting if they character you were playing had feelings and thoughts on the situation. The other characters are pretty standard. There's the good guy, bad guy and the cute girl, these are the three NPC characters you interact with pretty much. They're not well written and you don't care about them but they do their part. Perhaps if the game wasn't rushed this wouldn't have happened.\n\nenemies, weapons and powersThe enemy design is really cool in this game, the monsters are scary, gross and challenging to kill. They do lack a bit of variety so you won't see to many different kind of enemies. But the game isn't super long so it's okay. In between fighting monsters you will be shooting at Russians, they are standard NPC's with guns, not much to discuss there.\n\nThe weapons in this game feel great, look great feel very balanced. The problem I have with them is that there are like 6-7 weapons in total at the end of the game, and I only touched the first three because the others were just introduced to damn late and you have already spent so much upgrade points on the early weapons that it doesn't feel worth it switching to the new ones, this might be a side effect of the game being rushed as well. The weapon upgrade system leaves a lot to wish for, each weapons needs 9 points to be fully upgraded. I'm not even sure if I find a total of 20 upgrade points through the whole game.\n\nThe powers are probably what carries this game, You have a device on your arm with lets you age specific objects in the world, stop time in an area, levitate and throw objects (kinda like HL2 gravity gun). It's just a ton of fun and the effects look fantastic. They come up with some interesting puzzles with it as well.\n\nDifficulty and upgradesMuch like most games this game lets you choose between easy, medium and hard difficulty. I tried normal on my first play-through and I honestly don't think I died a single time. I'm now playing it again on hard and I still have a very easy time. I can play through some parts without any problem and then die seven times in a row in the next area, so the difficulty level feels a bit unbalanced.\n\nYou can also purchase upgrades for you character and your "gravity gun" in this game, which I think is really fun, The bad part is that you have to find the blueprint for the upgrade in the world and they're sometimes a bit hidden. Meaning that you could potentially miss out on some essential upgrades for you character simply because you didn't look around the room enough. They also don't give you enough points here to upgrade everything but that's fine, it makes you have to choose what to prioritize and what you feel is more important to you.\n\nConclusionThis review might have sound really negative overall but don't get me wrong, I genuinely enjoyed this game a lot and would recommend it to anyone. If you play this game you won't get mad or irritated at all the bad traits I've pointed out, rather you will acknowledge them and perhaps, like me, realize that this game with a bit more time and polishing could easily have been a 10/10.","June 20, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was roughly 5 or 6 years ago.  To this day, this game is one of the most fun FPS games I've played in a while.  Interacting with your environment by manipulating time was an awesome concept, and it's executed extremely well in Singularity.  That, coupled with your very Bioshock-like grab-bag of powers like pseudo Telekinesis and the ability to slow down time in a certain radius and it makes for very refreshing gameplay.\n\nAlso, I can honestly say that I haven't had as much fun playing a weapon any game as I have playing with the Seeker.

Combat is fluid and frantic but is not constant nor does it swamp all other aspects of the game. There are plenty of moments to just look around and feel the atmosphere of the game which really allows for deep immersion. The slower moments in the game are dotted with some very good and logical puzzles that you must solve to advance or solve to reach a hidden area.\nThe absolute best part of the game is the blend of visual and audio aspects to put you into the most tense condition that I can recall while playing any game.\nThough it does have the thrice cursed "Boss Monsters" It includes them in such a fluid manner and rather than just throwing you into an arena with a monster that you have no clue what the "super secret" way to defeat it could be, you are given hints along the way that alllow you to make quick tactical assessments and fight the creatures without wasting your time or ammo searching for the special spots to poke at. Bravo design team!! This is the only game that I actually enjoyed fighting the boss monsters. Not that is was easy.\n\nnow the bad;\nThe number one most terrible thing about this game is that it is absolutley too short, in 19 hours I finished it twice. granted I tend to finish game more quickly than most, but with a story this good I would have loved to stay in it a while longer.\nThere are a few places that the collision actually blocks the path you are suppsed to follow in such a way as to make you think it is another invisible wall. Here i would like to note that I HATE invisible walls!! When you make a barrier it should look like a barrier not like an open path that might lead to a hidden area.\nThe controls suffer from being ported over from a game deck so they do not really mesh well with keyboard and mouse but it is not too bad and you can remap them to more fit you preferences which helps a lot.\nThere are several places in the tutorial section of the game that gloss over some things that you really need to know so it's very easy to miss which makes using the equipment later in game more difficult than it should.\n\nOver all this is a beautiful gem of a game that I think anyone who is a fan of tense and dark gameplay should absolutely pick up, and tell their friends","April 19","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The down side is that at some points where you really should have have a full complement of weapons, your not given any warning and the checkpoints for that area has no way of getting another weapon/ammo.  Further towards the end of the game, it gets WAY too easy.\n\nOutside of that, it is a good game if you can get it on sale.  Rather short.

The singleplayer isn't very long (I think about 5-6 hours) but it's really good. Multiplayer is sort of dead so, but i tried it and if it had more players it would be awesome. You can play as a soldier or as a creature in a vs mode. But you will need some friends for this so.\nBut overall recommended.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IgnisRex/recommended/42670/","IgnisRex","Ignis Rex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IgnisRex/","84 products in account","Gratuitous Cyrillic is bad, mkay? It can be understandable if you put it in the title for style (though I still grimace at that), but you really shouldn't put it all throughout your game, to the point where you objectives are, "Fiиd Katheяiи aиd escape." Every time, through the entire game. It gets old really, really fast.\n\nNow that that little grievance is out of the way, Singularity is fun. It's an interesting tale of the Butterfly Effect and the instability of time travel. The story itself isn't exactly groundbreaking, and some of the narration-particularly the end sequence, which talks for a minute or so and just sort of ends-is poor, but it gets the job done. You're an American military spec ops dude who goes to a Russian island for something they never really specify, and find the island was an old Soviet research facility for an element called E-99 that has time changing properties. ♥♥♥♥ goes wrong real quick and you're sucked into the past, where you change history by accident, and come back to find a world run by a brutal dictator who was formerly one of the researchers on the island, which is now overrun by strange abhuman beasts. Now you gotta fix it. There's a sort of twist at the end, too, and while I didn't really see it coming it wasn't exactly M. Night Shyamalan levels of "holy ♥♥♥♥." Still not a bad story by any means, but you really aren't playing Singularity for a riveting tale.\n\nWhat you're playing for is the action. In a similar setup to Bioshock's plasmids, you acquire the TMD (Time Manipulation Device), which allows you to age/de-age objects and people as well as do some other neat ♥♥♥♥, like telekinesis. There's really nothing quite like snatching an enemy RPG out of the air and throwing it back at him. You also have guns. You're honestly going to use the guns a lot more, but the TMD is very useful in interacting with the environment. There's a particular puzzle involving age-crushing a box that the developers really, really, really like. The TMD can one-shot human enemies, instantly aging them to mummies, and has various other effects on the time warped monsters throughout. It takes a lot of energy to do those, though, and while you're constantly swimming in ammo for both your guns and TMD, having to reload after every 2 agings when there's a billion dudes around kinda puts a damper on the useability. So you'll be using your guns a lot, which you can find "weapon tech" to upgrade and get larger magazines, faster reloading, and higher damage.\n\nThis is where the game makes its biggest mistake. It gives you the Autocannon. It's basically a minigun, and you get it maybe halfway through the game. This isn't a mistake in that it's a bad thing-in fact, quite the opposite. The autocannon is so good I almost only ever used it after getting it. For about half the entire game. It's useful against any enemy, it's high damage, high rate of fire, and the ammo is plenty. Towards the end of the game, **Mild Spoilers** you even get a TMD upgrade that eliminates the use of energy, allowing unlimited use of the TMD's aging attacks against the Russian hordes **/end spoilers** I still used the autocannon anyway. It's just that good, and you feel like a Terminator implacably advancing towards the enemy and cutting them down in a hail of gunfire. Especially with damage reduction and max health upgrades, you feel unstoppable.  There's also the Seeker, an E-99 powered gun that lets you control the bullet mid-flight and is probably the coolest gun in any video game ever. Sadly, you don't get to keep it since switching weapons drops it and the ammo only appears in select areas, but it's always fun while it lasts.\n\nSingularity is a good game. The story is feasible enought to provide a backdrop for the action, the gameplay is solid, and autocannon autocannon autocannon. Would recommend.","March 31","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Reaper95/recommended/42670/","The_Reaper95","The_Reaper95","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Reaper95/","210 products in account","A damn good single player title.\n\nShort, kinda cheesy in terms of voice acting and plot as most linear single player FPS games usually are but that is overshadowed by the epic and high quality mechanics this game has. I wouldn't suggest getting it unless it was on Sale simply because the game is quite old and based on that fact alone that's why I say it doesn't deserve full price, but would it have been worth full price when it first game out? Probably.\n\nIn this game you are Captain Renko, a US Army Operative who is sent with a team to Katorga-12. An island just off the coast of Russia. Whilst there events occur and you end up changing the course of history and finding a device by the name of the TMD, or the Time Manipulation Device (Creative. I know). On the Island of Katorga-12 a revolutionary resource used in many technologies throughout the island and is the basis of the island having any sort of presence at all, and that resource is E99. It is what powers the TMD. When E99 is applied to something, be it an object or a living creature/person, adverse effects happen and the TMD was created to channel that.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe TMD (Time Manipulation Device) is something that sticks with you as an item all throughout the game. Occasional upgrade related to plot events means it always has a relatively fair balance against the enemies you will encounter at different porions of the game. You'll get to use it to turn back or advance time on an object in the world to do a number of things. One of those things is aging and then restoring objects to open shutter gates which are there halting your progress to continue the game, or (IMO) more importantly to find hidden goodies such as the fairly rare Weapon Upgrade Kits and also more of the much wanted E99 Technology.\n\nAtmosphere Is pretty good, best in the first part of the game but it does end up being non-existent in some places but revives again eventually only to die out again. Atmostphere is worthy to be listed as both a pro and a con simply because of it's inconsistency.\n\nWeapons are basic, and small in range but they offer enough variety to turn a linear experience in to something worthwhile I'd say.\n\nMechanics include the TMD to manipulate and manage the flow of time in real-time, which I explain more about in the original paragrapth about the TMD.\n\nAn upgrade system for the TMD, you as an individual via perks and also the weapons via upgrade kits. With E99 Technology as currency in this to be used at upgrade stations and weapon lockers to get health, ammo and upgrades as I just mentioned. The mechanics in this aren't very in-depth but they do exist and are pretty solid, solid enough to say they're a pro rather than a con.\n\nCONS:\n\nCharacters, whilst thankful they exist they lack depth of any sort, they're stereotypical, sometimes useless, feels like they're was supposed to be more to them but no one bothered to add those things. The range of actual characters is very small and like most if not all other Linear FPS shooters, you don't actually "Speak" to characters but moreso you are simply told things by them, given instructions and then you go on your way.\n\nAtmostphere (Refer to the Atmostphere paragrath in PROS for more info)\n\nMultiplayer (When it existed) was okay but not really, it was really unbalanced because it was playable humans VS non-humans, and generally it was just bad at that because the maps made it more balanced for one side over the other, and naturally as time has moved on nobody plays the game online anymore.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI'd give it a slightly better than okay 6.7/10\n\nIt's good, I enjoy this game. Played it more than once (First time I played it was on PS3 years ago and now I got it again on PC during a sale some time ago and still enjoyed it) so yeah, if you see this game on Sale for like 3 quid/5 bucks. I'd say pick it up, give it a quick playthrough.\n\nIf you have a modern Nvidia GPU you can use DSR to put it up to 4K to make it look a bit better if it looks too old for you people at 1080p. Graphics were never really this games strong point I'd say but it makes up for that in other areas as I have mentioned already.","December 11, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has an interesting story, but again it's not going to blow your mind. If you're thinking about buying this game expecting fun time tools, you may be disappointed. Aside from scripted events, the only time-based powers you have in combat are 3 things. The first is aging - you can age humans into dust. The second is a sphere of stopped time, which is cool, and it's fun to unload tons of bullets into things and then have them die as soon as the sphere dissipates. The third power lets you "revert" a human into a mutated monster. The weapons are mostly standard fare as well, but one that really stands out is the Seeker rifle. It fires a bullet that you can control. Yes, you can drive a bullet. This is the single greatest thing about this game. It's incredibly satisfying, but it doesn't quite make up for the rest of the game being pretty... average since you only get to use it in a few spots in the game. Overall, I'd say 7/10. Not bad.","July 6, 2011","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has overtones of Bioshock (scientific utopianism), Fallout (1955 environments and retro-tech) and a good chunk of Resident Evil (monsters).\n\nThe music isn't anything fancy, and there are no subtitles.  The graphics hold up very well for a six year old game.  I did run into a couple of bugs, but nothing bad or a simple reload didn't fix.\n\nThe game is labeled as survival horror.  This is not correct.  It's action horror, simply because it is almost impossible to die unless you're just bad at games.  By no stretch of the imagination is the game difficult, as it practically throws medpacks and boxes of ammunition at every available opportunity.\n\nThis is, of course, not including the Time Manipulation Device and its various abilities.  With it, an otherwise average corridor shooter is spiced up with some simple time puzzles and incredibly overpowered battle mechanics.  It pretty much breaks the game, but it's enough fun that you don't really mind.\n\nI didn't play any multiplayer.  From what I understand, it was great, but dead seeing as how old it is.\n\nThere are reasonably large upgrade systems for both the TMD and your guns.  Unfortunately, there is no NG+, which is kind of a bummer seeing as how there are technically four different endings.  From reading the other ones, I hesitate to call any of the endings "good", with the primary choice being kind of a letdown.  There's room for a sequel, but it'll never happen because Activision liquidated Raven Software as soon as the game was done.\n\nDon't pay more than $15 for it and you won't regret it.","April 24","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IgnisRex/recommended/42670/","IgnisRex","Ignis Rex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IgnisRex/","84 products in account","Gratuitous Cyrillic is bad, mkay? It can be understandable if you put it in the title for style (though I still grimace at that), but you really shouldn't put it all throughout your game, to the point where you objectives are, "Fiиd Katheяiи aиd escape." Every time, through the entire game. It gets old really, really fast.\n\nNow that that little grievance is out of the way, Singularity is fun. It's an interesting tale of the Butterfly Effect and the instability of time travel. The story itself isn't exactly groundbreaking, and some of the narration-particularly the end sequence, which talks for a minute or so and just sort of ends-is poor, but it gets the job done. You're an American military spec ops dude who goes to a Russian island for something they never really specify, and find the island was an old Soviet research facility for an element called E-99 that has time changing properties. ♥♥♥♥ goes wrong real quick and you're sucked into the past, where you change history by accident, and come back to find a world run by a brutal dictator who was formerly one of the researchers on the island, which is now overrun by strange abhuman beasts. Now you gotta fix it. There's a sort of twist at the end, too, and while I didn't really see it coming it wasn't exactly M. Night Shyamalan levels of "holy ♥♥♥♥." Still not a bad story by any means, but you really aren't playing Singularity for a riveting tale.\n\nWhat you're playing for is the action. In a similar setup to Bioshock's plasmids, you acquire the TMD (Time Manipulation Device), which allows you to age/de-age objects and people as well as do some other neat ♥♥♥♥, like telekinesis. There's really nothing quite like snatching an enemy RPG out of the air and throwing it back at him. You also have guns. You're honestly going to use the guns a lot more, but the TMD is very useful in interacting with the environment. There's a particular puzzle involving age-crushing a box that the developers really, really, really like. The TMD can one-shot human enemies, instantly aging them to mummies, and has various other effects on the time warped monsters throughout. It takes a lot of energy to do those, though, and while you're constantly swimming in ammo for both your guns and TMD, having to reload after every 2 agings when there's a billion dudes around kinda puts a damper on the useability. So you'll be using your guns a lot, which you can find "weapon tech" to upgrade and get larger magazines, faster reloading, and higher damage.\n\nThis is where the game makes its biggest mistake. It gives you the Autocannon. It's basically a minigun, and you get it maybe halfway through the game. This isn't a mistake in that it's a bad thing-in fact, quite the opposite. The autocannon is so good I almost only ever used it after getting it. For about half the entire game. It's useful against any enemy, it's high damage, high rate of fire, and the ammo is plenty. Towards the end of the game, **Mild Spoilers** you even get a TMD upgrade that eliminates the use of energy, allowing unlimited use of the TMD's aging attacks against the Russian hordes **/end spoilers** I still used the autocannon anyway. It's just that good, and you feel like a Terminator implacably advancing towards the enemy and cutting them down in a hail of gunfire. Especially with damage reduction and max health upgrades, you feel unstoppable.  There's also the Seeker, an E-99 powered gun that lets you control the bullet mid-flight and is probably the coolest gun in any video game ever. Sadly, you don't get to keep it since switching weapons drops it and the ammo only appears in select areas, but it's always fun while it lasts.\n\nSingularity is a good game. The story is feasible enought to provide a backdrop for the action, the gameplay is solid, and autocannon autocannon autocannon. Would recommend.","March 31","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat is fluid and frantic but is not constant nor does it swamp all other aspects of the game. There are plenty of moments to just look around and feel the atmosphere of the game which really allows for deep immersion. The slower moments in the game are dotted with some very good and logical puzzles that you must solve to advance or solve to reach a hidden area.\nThe absolute best part of the game is the blend of visual and audio aspects to put you into the most tense condition that I can recall while playing any game.\nThough it does have the thrice cursed "Boss Monsters" It includes them in such a fluid manner and rather than just throwing you into an arena with a monster that you have no clue what the "super secret" way to defeat it could be, you are given hints along the way that alllow you to make quick tactical assessments and fight the creatures without wasting your time or ammo searching for the special spots to poke at. Bravo design team!! This is the only game that I actually enjoyed fighting the boss monsters. Not that is was easy.\n\nnow the bad;\nThe number one most terrible thing about this game is that it is absolutley too short, in 19 hours I finished it twice. granted I tend to finish game more quickly than most, but with a story this good I would have loved to stay in it a while longer.\nThere are a few places that the collision actually blocks the path you are suppsed to follow in such a way as to make you think it is another invisible wall. Here i would like to note that I HATE invisible walls!! When you make a barrier it should look like a barrier not like an open path that might lead to a hidden area.\nThe controls suffer from being ported over from a game deck so they do not really mesh well with keyboard and mouse but it is not too bad and you can remap them to more fit you preferences which helps a lot.\nThere are several places in the tutorial section of the game that gloss over some things that you really need to know so it's very easy to miss which makes using the equipment later in game more difficult than it should.\n\nOver all this is a beautiful gem of a game that I think anyone who is a fan of tense and dark gameplay should absolutely pick up, and tell their friends","April 19","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanabu/recommended/42670/","kanabu","KaNaBu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kanabu/","76 products in account","Dear sir/madam. I am writing to return the enclosed 'Time Manipulation Device' I purchased as part of your first-person shoot-them-up 'Singularity'. I had looked forward to using the tool to rend the fabric of spacetime like a cheap hooker's tights, but was confused by the results. When assailed by a spindly mutant, for example, I found my TMD simply caused him to turn red, inflate, run towards me and explode – at some cost to my constitution. How is this related to time manipulation? I fail to see how the mutated gentleman could have been an about-to-explode gentleman at any point preceding our encounter – nor destined to become one after it.\n\nFurthermore, while I see consistently good results using the device to age crates and staircases, it has no effect on doors. I did read your helpful disclaimer that the device could only affect objects infused with Element 99, but this only raises further questions. What benefit did the Soviets imagine the most lethal chemical known to man would bring to the humble stair?\n\nI hope for a refund and that you will rename the device The Certain Things Manipulator to save future customers the same confusion.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nYour Future Self Or Something Trippy Like That\n\n\nIn Singularity you're an American captain sent to investigate a remote Soviet outpost. What happens there changes history to put a powerhungry lunatic in charge of the world. His empire is based on the Singularity, a power source derived from dangerous new element E99. Ostensibly, E99 is the explanation for both your time manipulation abilities and the mutants you fight. More honestly, they might as well have called it Unexplainium.\n\nThe joke is that this is Raven's first original game in a decade, and it's comprised entirely of parcel tape and borrowed ideas. It's as if they've been collecting tropes to rip off: when they couldn't find a way to fit time travel into a Jedi Knight game, or exploding alien bugs into Wolfenstein, they put them into this. I don't mind the borrowing – more games should learn from what the classics do well – but the unfocused jumble they've ended up with makes a lot of the coolest ideas arbitrary or useless.\n\nThe Certain Things Manipulator is a perfect example. It's supposed to age things or renew them, which in most cases means bending spacetime to perform menial maintenance work, such as repairing decrepit staircases. It's used for one good puzzle, where you wedge a collapsed crate in a narrow space and renew it to widen the gap. But rather than build on that puzzle type, they simply repeat it four or five times and never come up with anything else.\n\nEven true time-travel isn't used for anything interesting. I thought for one exciting moment that I had to use a crate to jam a bulkhead door open in the past, so it would remain open when I hopped back to the future. But no. You just have to take the crate itself to 2010 and stand on it to reach a higher ledge.\n\nThen you start using the CTM on enemies, and the jumble of random mechanics you find is almost funny. Some enemies it ages. Some it swells to twice their size. Some it turns into zombies who vomit acid on their friends. And some, as mentioned, simply turn red and explode.\n\nThe thing is, turning people into projectile-vomiting zombies is awesome. If the device always did something along those lines, it'd be a fun and inventive cornerstone of combat. Instead, even towards the end of the game, it takes a second to remember which arbitrary effect your CTM will have on the enemy type you're facing.\n\nOne idea that's close to working is the stasis field: you can throw out an orb that pauses everything in a generous sphere of influence. It's awkward, thanks to using the same key as your rudimentary gravity gun, but it offers some interesting options. Lacking any long-range weapons, I was about to give up fighting a sniper when I tried firing a freezeball at him. It hit some cover between us, but every shot he fired was caught in the field and held there, while I slipped round it and shotgunned him at close range.\n\nMore commonly, it provides breathing room to fuss around with the game's tactics. You can pick up and fling both exploding barrels and freeze canisters that turn enemies rigid and brittle. You can pump bullets into a stasis field and they'll all hit at once when it collapses. And you can manually roll grenades around in a murderous game of Marble Madness. None of these things are quicker or more efficient than shooting people with guns, but stopping everyone with a stasis field gives you time to do them anyway.\n\nYou can eventually level-up your abilities, including the size and duration of your stasis field. But 'eventually' is a dangerous word in a seven-hour game. You get enough E99-themed experience points to make customisations, but most of these are locked until you find certain scraps of paper. It's only in the last hour or so that you have any real freedom to upgrade yourself and, shortly after that, you're given infinite energy for your CTM. I'd specialised in maximising that, so all my upgrades were a waste of time. Sulk mode activate.\n\nThe other problem with the level-up stuff is that you get a lot of experience points by exploring. This isn't a nice game to explore. Apart from dragging you through some miserably drab takes on Ruined Lab, Anonymous Warehouse and Thing That Might Be A Sewer, it's riddled with invisible barriers. Can you jump on that? NO. Can you get through there? NO. Can you get across- NO.\n\nThe scenery isn't helped by a problem where low-detail versions of most surfaces don't get sharper when you get close. It looks like the world's been hosed down with a number of increasingly beige flavours of soup. That the developers missed this hints at something gone badly wrong behind the scenes.\n\nWhat did happen behind the scenes, surprisingly, is a whole lot of effort, love and intelligence on the multiplayer. A feature that's so often rushed, in a game that clearly has been rushed, yet it's packed with far more ideas than it strictly needed – all done well. It's a class-based humans vs mutants deathmatch, with an objective-based mode to focus the action. So having a random jumble of unrelated abilities actually works here: each human class has only one or two of your singleplayer powers, and each mutant has a radically different way of fighting.\n\nMy favourite's the Phase Tick: a tiny insect that can walk on walls and ceilings, explode on people, or jump on a human's face to take them over. At that point you simply become the player you face-hugged, only with lethal friendly fire. Great fun to do, and even oddly fun to fight against: as a human, I respawned once to face my tick-possessed doppelganger – who promptly killed me with my own carefully chosen loadout.\n\nI'm not optimistic that there'll be many people to play against in the long run – there's no server browser, and already the matchmaking is struggling to find me a game. But it's another aspect to Singularity that makes me sad the overall game was bungled. It just needed someone to say, halfway through development, “Good work guys, now pick three or four mechanics that really work, make them consistently useful, design a few more puzzles around them – and cut everything else.”\n\nIt would have given them time to do something interesting with time travel, the space to give each ability its own key (currently four keys double up), and scope to make the combat creative and satisfying throughout. What we've got instead is a desperately muddled game that's routinely frustrating to play, but one that copies enough cool stuff to be fun every ten minutes or so. If it drops to a pittance on Steam, it's worth your time.","April 23","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the very least, it's garnered itself a place in my heart next to Alan Wake and Bioshock Infinite in the "shooters with strange and interesting mechanics" section of my personal little hall of fame.\n\nThe game is not without issues, but those are both very minor and very few. For the most part, Singularity was a joy to play from start to finish.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive thing Singularity has going for it is its time manipulation mechanic, which allows you to modify the environment, attack enemies directly and defend yourself in combat, as well as solve some light puzzles. its implication is nifty - if a little limited - and never failed to spice up combat whenever it came in handy.\nSpeaking of combat, the fighting in Singularity is robust and varied, with monsters that attack quickly and brutally, as well as your more common-garden soldiers, an upgrade system that gives you fairly simple but meaningful upgrade choices, a strong perk system and weapons that offer great shooting experiences, from a powerful pistol to a minigun which I found myself besotted with throughout all the time I had with it.\nOn top of this, feedback from shooting enemies is incredibly satisfying and messy. Fountains of blood from headshots NEVER. GETS. OLD.\n\nThe story is also quite engaging, with twists and turns and nice little details from audio logs and the like, underpinned by strong voice performances from the small cast. Regrettably I can't speak much of the storyline itself, owing to spoilers, but I can certainly say that the whole experience - from reading little scraps of paper to finding grizly bodies - was thoroughly engrossing.\n\nFinally, I found the game's graphics and performance to be the only point of serious contention.\nThe game's options menu is seriously limited, with only a few very basic options like high-res decals and bloom to play with; in practice, this manifests itself by way of some very gnarly textures on some environment elements and generally poor lighting compared to what we have today.\nThe flipside to this is that the game runs like an absolute dream: I had no problems running this game at 4K, with what little eye candy there was available at max and reliably achieved a very consistent 30FPS (the highest possible with my connection) throughout the entire game. Were you to play this game at lower resolutions, I expect framerates in the 90s and beyond to be possible with even modest cards.\nSealing the deal for me on the graphics, however, was the run-down-50s-Soviet-Union look of the whole game, with everything looking all brutalist and industrial; the environment design on this game is utterly fantastic and appealed to me very much.\n\nSo, in conclusion it's a great shooter that looks a rough round the edges. So long as you can get past that, you should enjoy this game very much.","April 20","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has overtones of Bioshock (scientific utopianism), Fallout (1955 environments and retro-tech) and a good chunk of Resident Evil (monsters).\n\nThe music isn't anything fancy, and there are no subtitles.  The graphics hold up very well for a six year old game.  I did run into a couple of bugs, but nothing bad or a simple reload didn't fix.\n\nThe game is labeled as survival horror.  This is not correct.  It's action horror, simply because it is almost impossible to die unless you're just bad at games.  By no stretch of the imagination is the game difficult, as it practically throws medpacks and boxes of ammunition at every available opportunity.\n\nThis is, of course, not including the Time Manipulation Device and its various abilities.  With it, an otherwise average corridor shooter is spiced up with some simple time puzzles and incredibly overpowered battle mechanics.  It pretty much breaks the game, but it's enough fun that you don't really mind.\n\nI didn't play any multiplayer.  From what I understand, it was great, but dead seeing as how old it is.\n\nThere are reasonably large upgrade systems for both the TMD and your guns.  Unfortunately, there is no NG+, which is kind of a bummer seeing as how there are technically four different endings.  From reading the other ones, I hesitate to call any of the endings "good", with the primary choice being kind of a letdown.  There's room for a sequel, but it'll never happen because Activision liquidated Raven Software as soon as the game was done.\n\nDon't pay more than $15 for it and you won't regret it.","April 24","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kill both the scientist and the dictator and live your life in solitude until later... (this in my opinion is the best ending becuase you fix the timeline, end the scientist so that he can't use the T.M.D. to control people, you kill the dictator so that he can't use the T.M.D. to spread his rule and communism, you fix the singularity, and finally you get to keep the T.M.D. and later come to rule what we now know as America)","June 2","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
