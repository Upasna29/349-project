Decent as an homage game and a first attempt at a commercial game (unsure if the dev has made anything else so might be wrong) if you don't run into any game breaking bugs.\n\nBasic premise is:\nget a car and weapons\nwork as a courier to earn reputation\nduel in the arena to get money\nget wrecked and start again\nHowever, the game is poorly balanced. Arena tiers are gated by reputation with the bottom rank available to any reputation but ONLY IF you have no car and less than $4000 in bank (otherwise can't enter since the idea is you can then buy a car and do jobs). Jobs are randomised but also gated by reputation. When you die you lose all reputation and have to re-start your climb.\n\nI am now unable to play because of these gameplay elements. I got wasted, bought an expensive car and weapons, however because of the randomisation there are no jobs available for my reputation. Because I have a car I can't enter the bottom rank of arena (not that it gives reputation anyway), and I can't sell my car. I can't even get killed to re-start again.\n\nThere we go, game lacks proper testing resulting in game-breaking edge cases.","October 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","37","43","5","0"

That's why it only manages to reach the level of free browser gaming fun: there is no story and/or intermission art, runs start suddenly and finish abruptly, maps are flat and look alike, flamethrower animation is horrid. If you could tolerate such primitivism then you look at a nice car-shooting rogue-lite.\n\nАвтор вдохновился отличными примерами типа Смертельного ралли, Межгорода-76 и Великого Автовора 1, и смесь получилась не столь уж плохою, просто не хватает требуемого антуража и сделано все на движке Единство. Потому это всего лишь уровень бесплатного браузерного развлечения: нету истории и/или заставок между миссиями, которые просто внезапно начинаются и заканчиваются посреди дороги, карты плоские и выглядят одинаково, ужасна анимация огнемета. Если вам удастся взглянуть на сей вящий примитивизм сквозь пальцы, то перед вами прикольный автомобильный рогалик.","November 11, 2015","false","3.0"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","28","37","0","3"

I've been waiting a long time for someone to get around to this.\n\nI would urge the developer to check out another similar game, Mexican Motor Mafia.  I think each game has its strengths, but the car driving in MMM is a bit more fluid.  http://www.scienceoftomorrow.com/mmm_screens.htm\n\nWorthy of $3 easily.  I hope you keep working on this.  It'd be interesting to see more Car Wars stuff incorporated, like wheel damage, more Uncle Alberts weapon insanity, perhaps a mini-map during missions (install radar on the car?) etc.  I'd prefer a bit nicer vehicle handling with skids, fishtails, and such as well.

Of course, it's just a car game in entirely 2D top down. Though on the bright side, controls are not that hard to use. But as a person with a thing about repetition and cliches, it's the most cheapest control design that can be made by anybody. Final thing about design, it's entirely a game developed by beginners.\n\nBut underneath this beginner-made game is its uniqueness. The gameplay is enjoyable at least. I enjoyed running from point A to B. Kinda because I often play delivery guy. The AIs were easy to deal with too. At least they aren't impossible to take down. Did a lot of grinding for 10-30 minutes so I was able to get far and proceed towards the end of the game. I used every tactic of what a player would do in a top-down (car) shooter game.\n\nOf course there are several things I would've expected while I was busy trying to finish this game. That problem was: No conveniences, such as saving armor setups...at least that's the only thing I would've expected.\n\nFor a game at a beginner's level, I'd say it's worth my 3 and a half-hours of finishing this entire game. These guys may have potential for their future game development plans.\n\nPersonal Notes: The armor system reminded me of Darkwind.","September 7, 2015","true","4.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","1"
