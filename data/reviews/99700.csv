Most levels require precise platforming skills but it's still a thinking man's game. I've played other games by Nifflas and his distinct style of gameplay, graphics  and music once again work in so many levels. Recommended.\n\nP.S. You need 12 stars to unlock all the stages in the last level. You can go back anytime you want but I recommend collecting them as you progress because getting to the last level and realizing you need the stars to fully complete the game can be an unpleasant surprise (as it was for me).","August 6, 2014","true","14.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

Generally, the game remains pretty easy and just as relaxing all the way through. Definitely a good thing to do if you need to clear your mind and if you're stressed out.\n\nThe forefront visuals are very basic and unfortunately there isn't much support for high resolutions at all, so fullscreen will have you super zoomed in sadly, but for what it's worth, the backgrounds are very nice looking and are probably the strongest point of the visuals. The sound is also really nice. Not very much sound as far as what you do, but the very, very calming soundtrack that's more or less just ambience really helps add to the relaxing mood of the game.\n\nAll and all, I'll say I recommend it. Even though it's another indie puzzle game, this one has always stood out for me as one of the best designed.","July 14, 2014","true","1.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Well, we wouldn't have this little ball beauty for a start! Or gravity. Or molecules. Or ukuleles. Or underpants. Or hotdogs. Or gangrene. Or police pension funds being suspiciously syphoned off into untraceable dummy accounts. Sorry, where was I?... Oh yeah, NightSky!...\n\nNightSky is a physics, balling, roll-'em-up puzzler of sorts where you have to guide a ball through a wide selection of varied obstacle courses. This is primarily done by simply moving around with the arrow keys and adjusting your ball momentum and timing accordingly, as well as speeding up, slowing down or braking on the stages where it's allowed. But as it goes on, further elements are added, like parts of the environment that can be manipulated or inverting gravity or any number of marvellous contraptions that can be guided around while housing your ball. It really is amazing just how creative the game manages to consistently be through so many different areas and that it rarely ever feels repetitive despite the generous number of stages, which include an "alternative set", essentially a remixed version of every stage you've already completed, but this time ramping up the hardness on your ball.\n\nThe difficulty is judged nicely as well. It teaches you each element perfectly whilst at the same time testing you fairly with every mechanic you learn. As should always be the case in any game, if you fail here, it doesn't feel like the game's fault, and each "death" isn't a punishment on your ball, but rather a lesson to learn as you further refine your strategy and ball technique. If there is any frustration to be had it's when you get to the end of a tricky stage, have your ball suddenly drop or get your ball stuck somewhere, then have to go all the way back to the start and drag your ball the whole way through again. But between the quick restarts and well designed stages, this shouldn't be too much of a problem for anyone with any patience, and when you finally achieve success, that euphoric feeling should be ample reward enough for your struggling ball.\n\nThe look and sound of the game deserve some attention, too, as the solid black foreground of most stages set against the beautiful night-time backdrops help keep your blood pressure down during even the most difficult of ball manoeuvers. This is further reinforced by the sedate music and charming little dings and thuds of any moving parts around you. I can imagine it could have been tempting to try ramping up the tension and sense of urgency on your ball by adding more energetic music to push you forward, but I think they judged it perfectly here and are real enablers of that "one more go!" mentality you want to have in your ball games.\n\nSo for a slightly different breed of puzzler with fun, fair, challenging and yet relaxing ball play, you really need look no further than NightSky... now with 87.8% more ball jokes.","October 11, 2015","true","10.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","9","10","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/99700/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","Nightsky is a casual physics platformer puzzle game with exceptional sounds and graphics. Although, despite sounding and looking amazing, it’s gameplay can be repetitive, I can still recommend this and here’s why.\n\nPros:\n\n♦ Great Atmospheric Graphics (It’s simple art style but it all fits together and looks amazing)\n♦ Relaxing Eargasmic Sound (Relaxing and calming sounds that just fit together and make playing the game so much better)\n♦ Relaxing/chill gameplay (Gameplay isn’t 100% but if you want a game you can easily pick up and put down in your spare time or want something to relax to, then this hits the nail on the head)\n♦ Nice number of easy achievements (You can get all the achievements just by completing the game)\n♦ Reasonable price considering the amount of work that has gone into the Graphics and Sound (Though if you are buying it for the gameplay, I’d say buy it on sale for a couple of bucks)\n♦ Controls that just work (They just work)\n♦ Interesting Vehicle Concept (I won’t spoil it, but vehicle concept is very interesting and fun)\n♦ Interactive Credit Concept (This was a nice little way to do the credits and made reading them that little bit more enjoyable)\n\nCons:\n\n♦ Really Repetitive (I say this as I was happily playing and then all of a sudden when I expected the game to almost be finished, it tells me there are more levels but to progress I have to redo the old levels and find a “Hidden Star” which it never told me about. This concept is so annoying, as having to redo levels you’ve already completed to find a hidden object just to progress the main storyline seems really redundant and stupid)\n♦ Really Easy (For 90% of the game all I had to do was hold down the left or right arrow and roll to the next screen/part of the level. This is kind of silly for a puzzle game to be this easy)\n♦ Non-Existent Puzzles (I say this as I mentioned above I could hold left or right and progress easily. Also the only puzzles I seemingly found were timing jumps or rolling balls into the correct spot at the correct time, which I imagine a 5 or 6 year old could figure out easily)\n♦ No Steam Trading Cards (Would be a nice addition as the graphics of the game are amazing and I imagine they could create some really stunning backgrounds, emotes and badges).\n♦ No way to tell how far you have progressed in a level or how many are left (There is no level numbers and I could only seemingly tell how far I had progressed via exciting and selecting the level I was on. Then again it still didn’t tell me how much of that level I had left and how many more levels were left. The only way I could tell how many levels were left was via the Achievements. This concept is annoying as they should show each level and part of level as locked, not hidden, to make it easier to know how far you have left).\n♦ No real storyline (Tried to implement some kind of Storyline but never executed it well enough to make any sense or significant impact on the game)\n♦ Wasn’t aware some levels had hidden objects that I needed to collect to progress later in game (Not being aware of this until I needed these hidden objects to progress is really annoying as I would have searched and collected them on my first run through to save me having to repeat the levels again just to find one hidden object)\n\nOn a Side Note:\n\n♦ I haven’t finished the game as much as I wanted to because even though I had only played 2-3 hours of it, it was already getting on my nerves. I say this because it was repetitive and never really offered anything new in the terms of its puzzles per level and every time I progressed, I felt like I was just playing to get the next achievement. Then when I got to the point where it said I had to go back to levels I had already complete and find hidden Stars to progress… it just ruined the whole game for me and I closed it. I ultimately wanted something new, not having to go back and search old levels for something I missed on the first run.\n\nOverall, even though there are a lot of cons, I never finished the game and probably won’t and the gameplay is repetitive, I can still recommend this. I recommend this if you want something easy and relaxing that has great graphics and eargasmic sounds. Therefore, I recommend you pick it up for that reason. However, if you are buying it solely for the gameplay, I’d recommend buying it on sale at the cheapest possible price due to lack of actual puzzles and how repetitive it is as mentioned in my side note and cons.","November 19, 2015","true","3.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

The former allows you to be more precise in your moves, but lacks some motion power. The latter will allow you to jumps gaps and do wall-rides, but it's harder to control properly.\nYour job is to find the right ballance between those powers and switch them accordingly.\n\nNow the interesting part, is the fact each level has different rules. Sometimes you will have both powers, sometimes one of them, sometimes both are disabled.\n\nThat doesn't stop here though! Sometimes, a power is forced on you and you must deal with it, sometimes you cannot even control your marble, and have to play with the decor to help it move.\n\nThrough your adventure, there will be loads of different puzzles with unique mechanics, giant-sized pinballs, crazy vehicles, physic-based puzzles with bridges, buttons and moving obstacles, or even altered gravity!\n\nEven though the storyline stays a bit in the background, it completes the game with a nice touch of mysteriousness and fascination.\n\nThe music, soft and relaxing, gives that "end of the day" kind of feeling, which fits very well to the name of the game.\n\nThe lenght of the game is actually very good!\nThere's a total of 11 chapters, each of them containing ~20 puzzles with very interesting mechanics.\nWhen you finish all the chapters, you unlock the "Advanced mode", where every single level of the game has been redesigned to make it much harder. That a total of 22 chapters of fun and insane physics.\n\nWhat makes this game great in my opinion, is the great variety of levels. You will NEVER have the feeling to do the same thing over and over as all the puzzles are different. The level-design was amazingly well done.\n\nAs for the explorers and other tricky challenge hunters, there's a few stars hidden in some levels, both in the normal and advanced mode.\nBeware, skills required if you want to retrive them all!","December 25, 2013","true","12.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

It's not bad as indie puzzle platformers go, don't get me wrong, but a lot of the levels feel like one-off proof-of-concept gimmicks. (Admittedly, I only played Normal and then enough of Alternative to realize that it was basically just the same levels reworked to be jerkish, for the most part.)\n\nThat said, the reason this is getting a thumbs up is basically just that it was full of neat gimmick levels and the art, sound, and level design really clicked with me as something neat. So, I dunno. It's not a glowing recommendation, more just a "buy it if you really like puzzle platformers, ridiculous vehicles, or the artstyle" recommendation.","June 15, 2014","true","3.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kilbyashi/recommended/99700/","Kilbyashi","Kilbyashi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kilbyashi/","232 products in account","The one thing NightSky gets right is being a soothing game to play. The silhouetted visuals, color palette full of blues and violets, and ambient / new age soundtrack combined with its gentle pace make this physics-based puzzle game a relaxing ride.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about all I can praise here. Given the near-universal acclaim of other reviewers, I'll probably be shouted down as in the minority here - but this game just didn't do it for me and I can list a number of reasons why.\n\nThe plot is a complete throwaway. There are a few screens trying to explain the origin of the ball players roll around, but that explanation never goes anywhere. It's the kind of tactic that screams "indie game trying too hard to be important."\n\nThe core mechanic ("roll a ball to the end in a side-scrolling maze") isn't revolutionary and is mostly well-implemented, but it has some issues. The "wall riding" and "air control" mechanics in particular are awkward (as in one must continue to hold down the direction the ball was originally traveling to continue rolling, no matter which way it is going - but be sure to switch directions mid-air once it falls off). There is no native gamepad support - an analog stick would have been desirable for this reason.\n\nWhile there is a good bit of variety with fun contraptions and game mechanic modifications that are used in some scenes, the problem with these scenes is that they are often easier than the standard "control the marble directly" levels - which are already pretty easy.\n\nAnd that's probably the biggest issue with the game. This game's normal mode is way too easy. There are way too many scenes that only require the player to hold the right arrow to complete. There is an advanced mode, but since it contains no prompts at all (including what the controls are), players will likely need to play through most of the normal mode to learn the game's mechanics before tackling that mode. Personally, I had no interest in running through the game a second time after I had to force myself to finish the first run.\n\nThere are plenty of great physics-based puzzle games out there. That makes it hard to recommend one that doesn't do anything unusual except be low-key - and has some flaws, to boot. I'd give it a pass.","December 12, 2013","false","3.3"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

When he grabbed hold of it, it felt like it was alive, he decided to take it home. On that night however he started to have these strange dreams as the sphere itself. You play as the sphere in the child's dream as you will go through a strange world within the dream.\n\n• Characters: 4/10\no Basically there are absolutely no characters at all but however where the game lacks up to actual characters the personification of the player as a sphere going up against the entire dream world which is consisted of imagery that contains all sorts of beings and different events make up for it, this is however only if the player uses his or her imagination to even consider that.\n\n• GamePlay: 10/10\no NightSky's main aspect is its gameplay, as a physics game it consist of several puzzle elements that the player must solve to get past each section and level within the game. There will be parts where you will be able to increase or decrease the speed of the sphere, you would have to use gravity and pull, and other moments where you must simply use the environment itself to bridge your way a path to the destination. The game also comes in two difficulty modes - one for beginners and a challenging mode for those who are experienced in the game and want a more difficult challenge to the game overall.\n\n• Graphics: 9/10\no One of the best aspects to NightSky is the imagery which is present in the game - it brings a whole new level of design and depth into the playing environment for players. You will be awe and left mouth open at the beautiful visuals which illuminate quite well with the music and the overall gameplay. Despite the fact that the game has mostly dark tones, NightSky does incredibly well in terms of visual effects and design.\n\n• Sound: 9/10\no The sound effects in NightSky go hand to hand with the eerie music and the dark themed visuals. You will get chills from the beautiful sound effects as each stage will have certain sound effects as if wind blowing in a forest or plains, the gears chiming in factories, etc.\n\n• Music: 9/10\no NightSky's music is quite soothing and relaxing, if you are into orchestral tracks which are peaceful and soothing, you will enjoy NightSky's OST. It brings a eerie feel to the touch that goes well along with the sound effects and the visual appearance the game has.\n\n• Length: 4/10\no Possibly the weakest aspect in NightSky is its length - the game will not take you more than 3 hours to complete on the first try. The game's multiple difficulty and the fact that you would have to collect/complete certain hidden stages in order to unlock the final level will of course allow you to play a few more hours in the game however NightSky is a type of game where you can pretty much start and finish it in one day or go little by little and finish it within a week or two.\n\n• Replay Value: 8/10\no NightSky's replay value relies on its puzzle capabilities - the multiple difficulty adds not only another challenge but brings a whole new dimension to the overall gameplay as if you are playing a second game. Although this might not seem like a lot, it really is in terms of content. Along with that you are free to go back to each level and each stage to go back to see if there are multiple ways to finish a level or as a challenge to see if you can pass a level in a different way.\n\n• Player Value: 8/10\no NightSky is a short and still enjoyable game with amazing visuals, soothing soundtrack and a unique style of gameplay which will be enjoyable for anyone especially those who love puzzles or those who play games casually. You will not find anything wrong with the purchase once you start this game, it is highly recommended to get this fine amazing piece of art and incredible indie game.","December 30, 2013","true","3.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Without a solid physics system, mechanics that make the most of them, and scenarios that challenge your understanding of both, you're left with games that are too frustrating or too boring. Luckily, NightSky nails the trifecta with a charming, otherworldly presentation and a wide range of challenges to face.\n\nThere's no story to speak of, aside from an intro scene where you discover an orb on the beach and start dreaming of the alien landscapes of the game proper. You control a glassy black sphere in these remote, shadowy places, your only goal being to exit to the right. The obstacles in your path can be as simple as hills or as complicated as spinning mazes and grinding gears. Most puzzles are solved simply by careful rolling, but some levels give you special abilities, or limit you in some way. Sometimes you can roll more slowly and carefully, sometimes you can roll fast, sometimes you can control gravity, and so on. Additionally, there are levels where you use the ball to control some goofy vehicle or don't control the ball at all, and instead control flippers or platforms to help it on its way.\n\nThere are about a dozen thematic areas, each divided into another dozen levels of three screens each. Losing your ball or getting stuck just starts you at the beginning of the three, so you never lose much progress by flubbing. The art style of each area is striking and full of creative details like tiny cities and alien creatures, and the sound design is appropriately reserved with simple effects and a fitting ambient soundtrack. If you've played Within a Deep Forest or any of the Knytt games it'll feel very familiar, being made by the same fellow.\n\nThe challenge level isn't terribly high once you get used to the traction of your ball, and a full playthrough should take about two hours. There's a hard mode you can attempt afterwards if you want more, or you can hunt for hidden stars across the many areas. With solid mechanics and gorgeous levels, there's no reason to pass this one up. I consider NightSky a classic of the physics platformer genre, one that makes a great entry point for new players or a great example for new games.","February 6","true","6.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

NightSky favors a deliberately minimalistic style both for graphics and control, which after initial doubts quickly grew into a grander experience. The effortless interaction between the player and his mysterious "black sphere" lends the game play an almost subconcious quality, which is layered upon an enigmatic background of churning machines and eerily blinking creatures (think World of Goo).\n\n\nI actually played this game on 3DS, but don't tell the people that work here (they might be Steamed)!","January 9, 2014","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It asks the players to solve simple puzzles using a sphere and the physics that come with it.

Many screens do not require any user input at all, the ones that do usually only require a well-timed roll or button press. Many may consider this a positive, as it gives the player time to soak up the scenery. Unfortunately, as stated, the game uses a minimalistic art style, and there are only so many times you will be impressed by black squares and dandelions.\n\nOverall, Nightsky has some positives, some negatives. Unfortunately, this game is so short it's impossible to really dig into it... and seeing it's age, Nicalis is not likely to update in more levels anytime soon.","December 23, 2013","false","2.8"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Some consider if average, some that ignore the alien atmosphere, the variety of gameplay, the soft relaxing music, and the hidden secrets.   Some people don’t know the meaning of average apparently.  You will see all manner of strange creature and landscapes here, with something always catching your attention.  Backgrounds and soft music..  it's worth it for that alone.\n\nThis is not a game you play to try and figure out puzzles though,  this is a game you play to unwind. When you need to wait for something to get done, when you just want to lay back, take a deep breath, and play a game that makes no demands on you.\n\nUntil you play it on hard mode of course, then prepare for a challenge. honestly though the game isn't that long, and can be completed in a few hours.  If there was anything I would want, is more.\n\nOne thing to note is the variety of levels.  Sure you will always be a ball rolling along, but your situation can drastically be different in fun new ways.  Maybe you will have different powers?  Maybe you will be stuck inside some kind of machine? or even better maybe you won't be able to control yourself at all and need to activate things on the landscape to get by?

I would say it's one of my favorite puzzle platformers. As always with games like this, it's not easy to describe what makes it fun - the game as a whole is just designed in a way that it's pleasant, relaxing. and entertaining through the whole game. At no time in the game did I not enjoy myself, so however short you think it may be, you're in for a really good time throughout the whole game. I'll do my best to try to explain why it's so good.\n\nSOUND\nThe experimental jazz soundtrack combined with the nature soundtrack is done very well. If you're used to the typical indie game mistake where you have a blastingly loud short chiptune loop that's played all the time, you're in for a breath of fresh air. It's as relaxing in the same way as going to a secluded beach or forest trail. It invites you into a mindset that helps you appreciate the minimalist art style even more. You won't be getting listening fatigue from this. The sound effects for every interaction sound great, too. I especially like the sound the ball makes when it clinks into things. It's just very polished and pleasant all around on this front.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nUnlike more chaotic physics platformers like Gish, you never feel like you're being cheated out of success or struggling due to the random nature of the physics. They give you a great amount of control over the ball - the ability to switch to a high-traction or high-speed mode makes it very precise. I never felt like the ball wouldn't do what I want - you do have to keep in mind that there's no air control though, something that you might have trained into yourself from playing other standard platformers. The game also features several levels with a wide variety of vehicles, and levels where you can't even control the ball but control elements in each stage. Those are also fun to interact with and add fun variety. Overall, I found the gameplay to be a perfect level of challenge throughout. Each of the levels is a small, self-contained puzzle. When you die, you restart from the beginning of the level. This makes death hardly frustrating at all - you just get another chance to try what you messed up on instead of having to go through a whole bunch of stuff you already solved and are bored with. The challenge towards the end, where you have to collect stars by replaying levels and searching for them, is also not as frustrating as you might expect. It's usually pretty obvious where stars might be (and it tells you which stages have unfound stars), and the levels are so small that you really don't have to search far.\n\nVISUALS\nThe visuals are very easy on the eyes and very easy to parse while also being beautiful. Just the simple gradient and other small details enhance the relaxing aesthetc.\n\nIn sum, I would describe the game as more of an action and movement oriented puzzle platformer (as opposed to more "sit and think" type platformers). I found the experience of playing it to be vaguely similar to the Trials games (except for the aesthetic). If you like puzzle platformers, definitely get this game.\n\n\n\n","November 11, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/99700/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","NightSky is a very short, but neat, physics-based puzzle platformer. You control a ball which must be rolled through a series of levels, solving various puzzles along the way. The game does a good job of easing you into the various different techniques required to progress. It starts off easy, with simple things like speeding up and slowing down to control momentum, then advances to more complex tasks such as changing the spin of the ball on walls and slopes to fling yourself to otherwise unattainable heights. Along the way, you'll also have to solve a number of puzzles involving objects such as balls, cannons, rotating platforms, wagons, blocks, an assortment of different ball-powered vehicles, and more.\n\nComplementing NightSky's solid physics gameplay is its unique graphic-style. The levels are rendered in a dream-like palette of rich hues in the background and stark black terrain and objects in the foreground. It really is quite impressive and soothing to look at. Add in some subtle music that plays from time to time, and it all comes together nicely. If you're like me, you'll also find yourself wanting to take a screenshot of nearly every screen, because there's always something neat to look at. That said, one major downside to the graphics (and the game in general), is that it only runs at an extremely low resolution. This is a seriously unfortunate issue for a game like this that depends so much on its visuals to stand out. Additionally, the game doesn't even run full-screen properly. In order for it to run full screen (albeit with "blown up" visuals), you should make sure to download the "unofficial" 1.1 patch from the developer's web site (more info below).\n\nThat one major issue aside, this is still a game that is worth checking out. Between the solid gameplay and the beautiful visuals, there's a lot of variety packed in such a small package. And small, it is - the game can be fully completed in around 3-4 hours. Once finished, there is an extra bonus level that can be unlocked by finding a series of hidden "stars" throughout the main quest (don't worry, the game tells you which specific sub-levels the stars are hidden on, so it's fairly easy to find them all). But aside from that, there's not much else here. There is supposedly an HD version in the works (which will in theory fix the one major issue noted above regarding graphics resolution), so it may even be worth waiting in case that ever materializes. Regardless, whether you get the current version or hold out for a true HD update, this is a game that is worth experiencing if you're a fan of physics puzzlers or games with unique styles and gameplay.\n\n*** Note about updating the game: The default download that comes from Steam runs in a very low resolution that can't be changed. However, there is a post in the developer's forums (and also in the official Steam discussions) which links to an updated executable (NightSky11.exe). I recommend downloading this. Rename the original "NightSky.exe" in your SteamApps folder and replace it with the 1.1 version (rename it "NightSky.exe". This version allows the game to run full-screen, though unfortunately not at a higher resolution (so the graphics will be slightly blurry). Still, it's much better than nothing.","December 15, 2012","true","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Once I fought a great battle with my own shadow, an epic fight, over continents and oceans. He ran, and I pursued him, and still we chase each other across the sky. I love him, and I fear him. Night wins, then day wins. Yesterday I was beaten by a different strength. Dimly, I felt the blows, and was bruised. I cried, and my tears were wet, and amazed me, and I cupped them in small fingers and stared at them, tasted them in the dirty cracks of skin. They taste of the sea. I have asked him to find me, for I am empty inside. Someone has buried me deep in layers of skin and bone and muscle.

There are two modes, either beginner or advanced, but it says if it's your first time playing you should start on beginner. Still, there isn't much I haven't seen before.  If you're a skilled fan of puzzle platformers, this game will probably be far too easy for you. If you're looking to introduce someone to puzzle platformers and you don't think a game like Limbo or Oddworld would be appropriate for them, either content or skill wise, then this is a good option.\n\nIt's fun in the way that little unique challenges pop up from level to level, but on the other hand those unique bits left me going, 'Oh, I remember this from Braid,' or 'This part is just like that part in Limbo'.\n\nDefinitely get it if it's in a bundle or goes on sale.

Good polish, enjoyable music. Just a fair warning to people who care, but the majority of achievements did not pop for me, not exactly sure why.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DukeofHarvest/recommended/99700/","DukeofHarvest","Duke of Harvest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DukeofHarvest/","212 products in account","Gameplay\nNightsky is an odd mix between a puzzler and a 2D platformer. On paper, it sounds like the two would muddle up, but it's actually quite simple: you're a glass sphere that rolls around, and obstacles and physics ensue. It's a simple concept, but it starts to get naturally more complex and interesting as the levels go on. Timing, precision, focus, and manipulation of the game's physics are all gradually introduced, giving the game a natural progression of complexity. Overall, it's fun to play.\n\nIt has its hiccups though. For one thing, the mechanic of holding certain keys to change the ball's traction and speed through various "modes" is never referenced or formally taught to the player, but is nearly essential in many of the game's levels. It has its fair share of frustrating levels as well.\n\nStory\nThe story was a bit dissapointing. Much of my motivation for playing though the game was from the single sliver of story teased at the beginning, but any hint of a plot is never brought up again. It's not a huge loss, especially since a narrative would demand regulation of the game's fantastical and often unrelated settings.\n\nPresentation\nI was NOT expecting this much atmosphere from a such a simple game. The best way to describe it is pure, unadultered Zen. Ambience such as wind, trees rustling, and the humming of caves provide a constant backdrop for the laid-back soundtrack and the soft "clinks" of the glass ball as it rolls about. The visuals compliment the sounds perfectly, resulting in a game that's extremely relaxing if nothing else.\n\nComments\nDifficulty is bizzarely estatic; one level could take ages, whlie the next takes a single attempt. This could be seen as postive in many ways, but nevertheless, it's notably peculiar.","July 1, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In Nightsky you roll around a ball and try to get through some levels. The concept is interesting but theres no story. Theres a ball found on the beach and then it rolls around random levels. While the Art style is beutifull the game could get angering because the controls are too tight and dont fell smooth and the game does revevolve on tought phisics which does ruin the fun. And if you want to finish the game you have to find all the hidden stars which is just insane but there only twelve of them so thats not that bad. So overall this game is good but for the rage inducing  and the Abysmal level desing im gonna bump down the rating so i give it an 8/10.","July 13, 2013","true","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I started to get annoyed with it once the game started to make me replay the previous 3 screens just for failing the puzzle on one screen (I already solved those!). Also kinda annoyed by the mechanic where you have to forward spin off a ramp into the ceiling, then change to a backspin mid-air to hit the ceiling and reverse direction, etc. Just found it a little too irritating to pull off.\n\nBut if you enjoy physics puzzles, then take this review with a grain of salt, dear readers. I am not a fan of physics games at all and almost always find them annoying, so this is probably more a matter of me having no taste for this type of game than it is a problem with the game itself.","April 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

Now mind you, these levels are by no means unbeatable, but the play style changes abruptly from mellow, easy fun to COMEONCOMEONCOMEON DONT FALL OFF THE @#$% LEDGE annoyance where you have to repeat levels several times to complete them and you are at the whim of the highly chaotic physics.

The settings made available to the user are minimal to nearly none. The "widescreen" setting is not widescreen at all, as the size of the game's screen is still very small and surrounded by large black borders. The graphics are also of the most minimal efforts that are found in free Flash games for PC or phones. The so-called ambient music is barely noticeable and does not add to the overall experience in any way. The game mechanics are only mildly interesting or amusing, and the game world and design are uninspired and uncreative. Guiding the ball around the levels is unsatisfying and dull. The game play is so vacuous and boring, that I would find it hard to believe that someone would actually be interested in such a dead and valueless activity after about one hour. Every aspect of the game is so breathless, numb, flat, lackluster, and muted. The physics of the game are not interesting nor exciting in any way, and the overall atmosphere is so indifferent and apathetic, that you will be wondering why you should be spending any time at all with this poor attempt at a game. NightSky's sale description lists it as an "action-puzzle" game, set in "picturesque worlds". This couldn't be farther from the truth. NightSky does not involve any action whatsoever, and the game world is the opposite of picturesque, as it is as good as dead. The asking price is borderline insanity, as the developers are clearly overpricing an\nobviously poorly designed and low-grade game.\n\nNightSky is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","1.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The developers have done an exceptional job here, not only with the attractive and stylish visuals, but with the excellent soundtrack as well. My major complaint with the title is that it is presented on a tiny window that cannot be scaled, making the gamefield tiny on a widescreen monitor. However, I found that after playomg for a few minutes I stopped noticing this as the rest of the presentation is so engaging. I would recommend this game to puzzle gamers who are not turned off by a high twitch requirement and are willing to attempt to complete the same puzzle multiple times before getting it right.

It's not particularly challanging or long (2 hours is the average run time). The physics act a bit wonky at times as well. As far as games go, it's average. However, i enjoyed it quite a bit. It doesn't waste your time, it's refreshingly lacking a scary atmosphere that a lot of indie physics based platform puzzlers seem to have (taking a page out of Limbo's book most likely). It has some nice sound disign, soothing music, and a pace devoid of stress (mostly. When the physics decide they don't to work as intended, it can be a tad frustrating on a few select levels. It happened to me twice). At full price, i would say it's not worth it, but at any $7 or lower (the price of a movie ticket), I would say it's worth it. It's a nice little ride while it last, if a bit lacking in substance or challange.\n\nTo summerize, if your looking for a more soothing type of game, you like physics puzzlers, and the game is on a discount, pick it up. If you want something challanging and more lasting, skip it. I recommend it tentitively. Definitely not the game for everyone or every occation (best played at night in my opinion).","November 26, 2013","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this is a physics puzzler, the way physics is exploited especially in the alternative mode is astonishing. The difficulty is challenging but not impossible in normal mode which is IMHO perfect. Levels are short but there's lots of them, even then first play through on normal should take you anywhere between 2-3h. Alternative mode is more difficult and looks like it will take around 5-8h by my estimate.\n\nWhat's not so hot, is the star hunting, personally I felt it could have done without, but that's a minor quibble.\n\nAll in all, great puzzler, somewhat short but very sweet.

While this is a physics puzzler, the way physics is exploited especially in the alternative mode is astonishing. The difficulty is challenging but not impossible in normal mode which is IMHO perfect. Levels are short but there's lots of them, even then first play through on normal should take you anywhere between 2-3h. Alternative mode is more difficult and looks like it will take around 5-8h by my estimate.\n\nWhat's not so hot, is the star hunting, personally I felt it could have done without, but that's a minor quibble.\n\nAll in all, great puzzler, somewhat short but very sweet.

As a rule, I'm generally not very fond of physicsy games, because success ultimately has a tendency to become downright random at the best of times. NightSky does succumb to this problem on occasion, but most of the time it holds together surprisingly well.\n\nYou control a sphere of some sort, and sometimes pinball flippers or spinning paddles or some other odd object. The goal is to make it to the end of the three screens which make up each level. The means of accomplishing this vary, and there's what I really enjoy about NightSky. You never know what you're going to get in the next level. Where a game of this type would traditionally feature a couple specific mechanics that you learn and utilize over each world, growing more complex and piling up over time, NightSky just kind of does what it pleases. In one level, you might be using a speed boost key to spin through U-bends and climb higher, and in the next the key you pressed to go faster now reverses gravity. You finish that level, and now maybe you're in some sort of vehicle which could do any sort of thing. You just have to figure out the shifting rules from level to level, and it keeps things nice and fresh the whole way through, while alleviating\n\nNightSky can have a few annoying spots, or entire annoying levels. But overall the game manages to be just challenging enough without being too frustrating. As for visuals... well, I have to admit, I'm growing sick of games copping LIMBO's black foreground motif, but beyond that it does have its own style, and can be downright pretty at times.\n\nThere are a series of bonus levels unlocked after completing all of the other levels and finding enough of the secret stars hidden in certain levels, and the higher difficulty mode rearranges levels to trip you up à la Master Quest, if you're into the additional challenge. If you're looking for a physics platformy sphere rolling game with a little problem solving, then boy did you luck out with NightSky.","December 4, 2013","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I found that after playomg for a few minutes I stopped noticing this as the rest of the presentation is so engaging.

You control which you can move left and right, and depending on the situtation you have certain powers such as the ability to go fast or invert gravity. These powers make for some interesting puzzles.\n\nI never found myself stuck for more than a couple of minutes at a time in the game because most of the puzzles were logical (as logical as a physics platformer can get).\n\nLater on in the game, there's certain parts where you'll control a vechile, these add some variety, but very rarley were they interesting enough.\n\nThe game has an interesting graphic style and soundtrack that create a great atmospheric mood.\n\nAs a whole, I enjoyed NightSky but it's hard to recommend it for more than 3 or so dollars.","November 25, 2011","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or well, it's just very easy and rather short, even if you take into account the extra stuff for finding hidden stars.\n\nBut I found the journey pretty enjoyable, akin to exploring some interactive artsy picture. Nice downtempo game. It's indeed all about the journey.\n\nIn essence it's a 2D platformer where your goal is to cause a ball to roll past exit. For the most part you control the ball directly, the direction and speed it is rolling about. Some levels give you extra powers like reversing gravity or breaks that improve precision of rolling and make the ball stick to given surface better (sometimes such extra stopping power is forced to be active at all times). A few levels put the ball in role of an engine to some kind of Da-Vinci-nesque machinery. And there are also levels where you control parts of the scenery instead of the ball.\n\nNo real challenge here, but still it's a piece of sweet escapism, if short.","September 7, 2012","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There's nothing puzzling about it, and the platforming is in that try, try again and pray category.\n\nIt's not a puzzle game if you know exactly what you need to do but are beaten by the control scheme.  That first wall running bit is a good example - hold left all the way through the loop, but then you have to flick suddenly to holding right.  No matter what I couldn't get a smooth looking transition on that one, I'd always end up losing momentum and if I was too slow coming to a complete stop.  Very jarring, breaks the smooth, flowing tone of the game by making me have to THINK about the control scheme.

The sky lit in vibrant colors, but everything around you unlit and shrouded in shadow.  NightSky from Nicalis exists solely in that short time, a collection of puzzles centered around moving an enigmatic sphere from left to right.\n\nThe physics are top notch.  You’ll guide this little sphere through dozens of stages full of clever puzzles, ingenious machines, and constantly changing (though easy-to-understand) rules.  The game will often give you a new control scheme, and immediately twist it in a surprising new direction.  The story is almost nonexistent, but it doesn’t have to be strong in a game like this.\n\nThere are two difficulty levels, but the game plays functionally the same in each.  The main themes of each world are still present in each, though the puzzles themselves are ramped up in the alternate version.  Some levels have hidden stars on them, which are required to finish the bonus levels found at the end of the game.  Going back to find those stars is a fun little sidequest.\n\nThe audio is astounding in its minimalism.  The music is soft and relaxing.  The sound effects include waves lapping at the shoreline, the soft sound of rain on grass, and wind blowing through tree leaves.  The sphere and other movable objects will make audible thunks when they hit something, giving them a weightiness that would otherwise be lacking.  The sound the sphere makes when it hits something makes it seem fragile, though you can’t break it (but you can drop it down a bottomless pit).\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, and I always had a softspot for this kind of art direction where the foreground is black and the background is lit in brilliant colors.  Though sometimes it can be difficult to tell what is a stable platform and what is scenery, and more than once I dropped my sphere thinking I could land on something.\n\nThe puzzles are expertly crafted and gorgeously detailed.  They progress very logically, teaching you the rules you’ll need to solve them as you go.  At least in the normal difficulty, nothing was overly frustrating or unfair, and most times figuring out what I needed to do was rather simple.  It was the doing of it that took a bit of time.\n\nNightSky is a great example of minimalist game design.  Nothing too flashy, but there is some real enjoyable content here.  The physics come together very well and everything behaves realistically.  Graphically its a real treat, and I would listen to the soundtrack every weekend to help me relax.  It only takes about two hours to finish, but what a great two hours it is.  Highly recommended.\n\nNightSky is available on Steam, Humble, and 3DS.","April 5","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sky lit in vibrant colors, but everything around you unlit and shrouded in shadow.  NightSky from Nicalis exists solely in that short time, a collection of puzzles centered around moving an enigmatic sphere from left to right.\n\nThe physics are top notch.  You’ll guide this little sphere through dozens of stages full of clever puzzles, ingenious machines, and constantly changing (though easy-to-understand) rules.  The game will often give you a new control scheme, and immediately twist it in a surprising new direction.  The story is almost nonexistent, but it doesn’t have to be strong in a game like this.\n\nThere are two difficulty levels, but the game plays functionally the same in each.  The main themes of each world are still present in each, though the puzzles themselves are ramped up in the alternate version.  Some levels have hidden stars on them, which are required to finish the bonus levels found at the end of the game.  Going back to find those stars is a fun little sidequest.\n\nThe audio is astounding in its minimalism.  The music is soft and relaxing.  The sound effects include waves lapping at the shoreline, the soft sound of rain on grass, and wind blowing through tree leaves.  The sphere and other movable objects will make audible thunks when they hit something, giving them a weightiness that would otherwise be lacking.  The sound the sphere makes when it hits something makes it seem fragile, though you can’t break it (but you can drop it down a bottomless pit).\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, and I always had a softspot for this kind of art direction where the foreground is black and the background is lit in brilliant colors.  Though sometimes it can be difficult to tell what is a stable platform and what is scenery, and more than once I dropped my sphere thinking I could land on something.\n\nThe puzzles are expertly crafted and gorgeously detailed.  They progress very logically, teaching you the rules you’ll need to solve them as you go.  At least in the normal difficulty, nothing was overly frustrating or unfair, and most times figuring out what I needed to do was rather simple.  It was the doing of it that took a bit of time.\n\nNightSky is a great example of minimalist game design.  Nothing too flashy, but there is some real enjoyable content here.  The physics come together very well and everything behaves realistically.  Graphically its a real treat, and I would listen to the soundtrack every weekend to help me relax.  It only takes about two hours to finish, but what a great two hours it is.  Highly recommended.\n\nNightSky is available on Steam, Humble, and 3DS.","April 5","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me, however, I thought it wasn't anything enormously special.

It's a very relaxing game and I've had a lot of fun with it over the last few weeks. Check your humble library!","May 31","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its ambient and subtle atmosphere along with its lack of time-pressure makes it almost zen-like. Most of your focus will be on a small black ball which you manipulate left and right. You may also speed it up, put the brakes on or invert its gravitational pull. For an added twist the ball is sometimes embedded inside certain airborne or vehicular contraptions.Overall the difficulty is spot-on and perfectly pitched putting you in that sweet-spot of puzzle gaming. Restarting is instant and you never have to do large chunks over again.\n\n--PRESENTATION & DESIGN--\nNicalis sticks to the less-is-more formula greeting the player with a straightforward start-menu that simply lists the names of the areas in the game. The ambience instills a zen-like calm to the user where the soundtrack consists of a lone acoustic guitar with a hint of other gentle sounds and soft notes. The ball hits surfaces with a satisfying chink suggesting it's made of marble or is metallic.\n\n--CONCLUSION--\nThe game took me around 5 hours to complete. The restricted size of the screen along with no option to change the resolution or to re-configure the keys are some of the very few negatives. Clicking Settings takes you to a small window in the desktop, which can spoil immersion slightly, but the game as a whole is exquisite.\n\n5/5","December 21, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No real setback if you screw up, but the challenge is just enough without needing to be punishing. The moody ambiance can pull you through. Does seem to go quick, but a bit of a fun trip, with not your usual platformer mechanics. Reminds me of And Yet It Moves in that regard. Just very nicely done, with interesting flourishes. 4/5","November 14, 2011","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
