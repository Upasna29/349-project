To me, 2K12 was the peak of the series so far. This year though, it seems like they're taking advantage of no competition and are taking it easy. Why?\n\n- Players feel much less flexible/agile than in previous years\n- They changed the controls, again. 2k13 probably had the best gamepad config to date\n- Players are much more sloppy with regards to ball handling. Rebounds go through their hands, silly collisions cause players to lose the ball, sometimes players will randomly animate in ways not appropriate to the situation (sometime causing out of bounds calls)\n- Inexplicably consistent blowing layups and dunks, sometimes with completely clear path\n- Physics sometimes act weird. Going for a steal sometimes you'll knock the ball out the other side of the court or even into the crowd. This has an unintended funny side effect of making some blocks look way more spectacular than they should be\n\nStill, even having said that laundry list of things that bother me, I'd recommend the game (unless you want to manually patch the new rosters into 2K13). I'm hoping we get a mid-season patch like we did last year to fix these annoyances.\n\nThese opinions only cover single player mode.","November 25, 2013","true","239.0"," 163 of 222 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","163","222","0","3"

Though I know this may not be the next-gen port, this game still does not meet my personal expectations and feels worse as compared to previous titles and years of the NBA2K franchise.\n\nOver the course of my playing time, I have experienced many frustrating issues with the game. Here are some of the examples.\n1. Player stats are not consistent. How is it that MyPlayer, who has maxed out his stats, miss a wide open 3-point shot with no defenders, with the shot feedback showing A+ on Shot Selection and Excellent on Release? I dont know either. This major issue happens too often that I have resorted to give up on shooting the ball, and drive it in instead.\n\n2. Opponents are too over-powered. Though this may sound like I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, or suck at the game, but this is a major issue that I've felt playing NBA 2K14. The opposing team seems to have stats that are not accurate to their real-life counter-parts. How is it that a CENTER is able to intercept my bounce pass when he is not quick enough to react to it? Do you really think every player is aware of a pass and is able to react to it quickly enough to steal it? I don't think so. I have experienced countless possessions that ended up in turnovers because of the over-powered oppenents.\nAnother stat issue is with the speed. Do you really think that a center can outrun me? A 6'8 SF with 90 speed? Yeah, of course he can! (sarcasm)\nThe stats in the game are not realistic, and it gives players abilities they do not possess.\n\n3. There seems to be an issue with ball control. For some reason, MyPlayer, who has maxed out his dribble attributes, can't keep the ball in his hands without having to pass it to some other player. Even with my stats maxed, there seems to be a way for my opponents to take the ball for me. No wonder I average 4 turnovers a game.\n\n4. Association mode is terrible. That's just to make it simple. There seems to be no way for me to get a good running team that has over 80% of team chemistry without making one of the players the STAR role that they want, even if they don't perform like a star. I had a bench player who averages 2ppg asking for a starting spot. Really now? Like that's going to happen.\n\n5. Too many false goaltending calls! I'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that 2K has made the goaltending calls more sensitive. I have been called for goaltending, even though I know for a fact that it is a clean and legit block. DUMB ♥♥♥ REFS!\n\n6. Online is ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nI sadly regret getting this game for its full-price of $29.99. This game shouldn't even be worth $5. Terrible job 2K, if only ya'll cared about the PC players, then maybe more people will buy it.\n\nI would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this game.\n\nI'm still going to play it though since it's the newest 2K title.\n\nHope I don't break my keyboard.","June 21, 2014","false","82.8"," 60 of 84 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","60","84","0","0"

We've come a long way in some regards--- there are finally rookie players that can make an immediate impact, intuitive trading mechanics, and subtle nuances that add great levels of realism, depth, and nearly infinite strategic options. 2K does a much better job of this than any other studio has, and continues to build on that each year. Last year, EA's NBA Live was so bad that they decided not to even release the product, much to my surprise--- credit due to them for at least recognizing that their product was ♥♥♥♥ and saving me a few bucks in the process. Anyhow, it now appears that 2K has become complacent in the absence of competition and have added only one feature, from what I can tell. That feature is called something like "Lebron mode" where you battle a receding hairline and try to keep your teammates from sleeping with your mother. Lebron may be great at basketball, but this is really not a feature and while I do enjoy the game, I can't possibly recommend it to PC gamers, since 2K has neglected the PC version of this game so badly. I went to play online blacktop (streetball mode) and there were exactly 5 people online playing the game in the early evening on a weekend (which was generally the peak time on 2K13 for PS3). I didn't bother even joining a game at that point and just returned to single player. The actual basketball gameplay works pretty well, although the controls feel a bit clunky (360 controller on Windows 8). If you're not sure whether to get the game or not--- don't. It's overpriced, poorly supported, and neglected. I don't think I'll be buying any more 2K basketball games after this one unless they really show that they give a damn about PC gamers.","May 6, 2014","false","133.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The gameplay is fantastic and all of the voice commentary is taken from actual NBA games so it makes it feel very real. However, if you are a HUGE fan of playing the NBA All-Star weekend, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nThe dunk contest controls are absolutely awful. Guitar Hero controls make absolutely no sense whatsoever in terms of replicating the feel of someone completing a slam dunk. Further, the controls were meant to be "fun friendly", for casual gamers to pick up and succeed. In contrast, I actually found completing a dunk and winning a contest in 2K13 was much more difficult in both regards than its predecessors found in previous 2K's. And again, at no point do we ever feel we're in control of what's happening on the court. Absolutely no correlation.\n\nThe 3pt. Contest was just incredibly clunky. There was, in fact, a shooting groove to be found. But, under no circumstances do I feel a gamer's lack of ability to find a groove should be punished with complete controller unresponsiveness. In short, the mode offered virtually no fun, just frustration and confusion.\n\nIn summary I only recommend this game if you don't care about the NBA All-Star weekend, if that aspect doesn't interest you then this game is absolutely amazing, if they can fix this for future games then it would be near perfect.","December 30, 2013","true","16.7"," 87 of 153 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","87","153","0","1"

I've almost given up on passing completely, you have to select the person you pass to, and almost every time, right before you're about to pass, the game just says, "Here, pass to this guy in the middle of the other team where it will get stolen". MyCareer is just ridiculous at times, giving you impossible challenges, ex: If you're team is getting destroyed, it will give you the challenge to get your team within 5 points, which is impossible. Other times, it tells you to get a basket, a steal, a rebound, and an assist, and it always puts you on the bench.\n\nThe commentators don't shut up and repeat themselves every few minutes, and always interrupt time outs with stupid stats and other crap that delay your gametime. they always jump to some lady named "Doris Burke" who has the most painful voice ever. When Halftime comes, it throws the Sprint logo and says "AND NOW THE SPRINT HALFTIME REPORT PRESENTED BY SPRINT" and after you spam the enter button to just get it to go away it comes back with "THE SPRINT HALFTIME REPORT PRESENTED BY SPRINT" again.  While you're playing, especially when playing the Heat, they always talk about how gatorade was in the Chalice of Jesus and is the liquid of the fountain of youth and how lebron drinks his gatorade every morning. Honestly they're so over-advertised I don't want to drink Gatorade anymore.\n\nThis game is just a headache on PC, get a PS4 and buy it for that, its so much better.","July 11, 2014","false","387.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

This is a big deal for me i used to play on the ps3 with black top and everything dont expect that here, From what im seeing/hearing its similar to nba 2k13 just with a fewminor commentary changes.\nThe Controls. Why why why 2k you just had to screw it up and change the dame controls the controls for 2k13 was great shooting pick and roll was great. I get on 2k14 and cant even do a ally-opp anymore!

It definitely has more pros than cons and I would definately recommend it. On the upside, it has an extremely addictive career mode and will leave you playing game after game. The graphics are pretty awesome, but watching Chris Smoove play it on the next gen makes me extremely jealous of the eco-motion that pc does not include. Also, the career mode lacks the realism that next-gen brought with cut-scenes that make it seem like your actually living within the dream of being a rookie in the NBA. Whether its meeting with an All-Star on the court before the game,  getting in someones face at practice, or even dealing with your agents issues. Whats not to love... Its extremely depressing that PC gamers were deprived of this greatness and I pray for these qualities to be on 2k15 for PC.

That being said, I still enjoy myself playing this iteration of NBA 2k as I really enjoy playing a NBA GM and creating my own dynasty. The association although lacking in comparison to other sports games does have a somewhat good logic as it is very stingy with what trades the computer will accept from you.

It would be nice if the multiplayer features actually worked properly and on the level of consoles, as the PC version doesn't have multiplayer blacktop or My Crew among other things. Hell, on the PC version, you'd be lucky to be on the same team as your friend in a match, that is if you can handle the network lag. Also this version is based off of current gen and does not contain any features from the next gen version of the game.\n\nI'd rate this game 7 out of 10, mostly because the single player keeps me occupied. I don't recommend buying this game full price, however, and instead get it during a sale.

This game is a lot of fun. Here are my downsides. My player mode could be amazing. However if I am a 6'8 forward taken 10th over all I shouldn't miss wide open layups. No one airballs layups. At 6'8 I should be able to dunk no matter what I start at. Overall the game is great. A few suggestions. Instead of made up players going by a choice of lame made up nicknames use the madden system of saying thier names. I don't t expect massive backgrounds, but a name would be nice. At the draft I would expect a top 10 pick to be able to do things like make a jumper or dunk at the start. It is frustrating to miss wide open layups at 6'8" atletic build from the start. Make it realistic. I dont expect to be lebron but let me at least be a 8th grade point guard if I am in the top 10 in the draft. Also if you are not a point guard forget about blowing by someone for a dunk. If I am lebron i cant get past a rookie 6'4" forward for a dunk. dont try to make the game equal. those who want it equal will make it equal and the others will build there amazing guy. All in all this game is great but certain things just ♥♥♥♥ me off. I have only played rec league ball and I have never airballed a layup yet Kevin Durant will airball a wide open layup. That is just ridiculous. 2K stop taking advantage of not having competition and tighten up these small things and you will be gods. give the option to let someone have the possiblility of being a #1 pick and being awesome.","May 24, 2014","true","88.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing 2K since 2005, and I have to say the progress in the series, while slow at times, is never stagnant and the 2K team works hard to deliver with every new iteration.

This game is a lot of fun. Here are my downsides. My player mode could be amazing. However if I am a 6'8 forward taken 10th over all I shouldn't miss wide open layups. No one airballs layups. At 6'8 I should be able to dunk no matter what I start at. Overall the game is great. A few suggestions. Instead of made up players going by a choice of lame made up nicknames use the madden system of saying thier names. I don't t expect massive backgrounds, but a name would be nice. At the draft I would expect a top 10 pick to be able to do things like make a jumper or dunk at the start. It is frustrating to miss wide open layups at 6'8" atletic build from the start. Make it realistic. I dont expect to be lebron but let me at least be a 8th grade point guard if I am in the top 10 in the draft. Also if you are not a point guard forget about blowing by someone for a dunk. If I am lebron i cant get past a rookie 6'4" forward for a dunk. dont try to make the game equal. those who want it equal will make it equal and the others will build there amazing guy. All in all this game is great but certain things just ♥♥♥♥ me off. I have only played rec league ball and I have never airballed a layup yet Kevin Durant will airball a wide open layup. That is just ridiculous. 2K stop taking advantage of not having competition and tighten up these small things and you will be gods. give the option to let someone have the possiblility of being a #1 pick and being awesome.","May 24, 2014","true","88.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can even add in some SSAO and what not via ENB, sweetfx, or driver settings on a modern system with no fps loss at all.\n\nGameplay:\nThe devs at VC decided to change things up quite a bit. The new 'pro-stick' (right analog stick) is pretty intuitive by combining dribbling and shooting without any modifiers. Tap a direction to juke, hold a direction to shoot. Pretty neat.\n\nThe post game really sucks though, as it is akin to playing Mortal Kombat with dial-in maneuvers. There is no fluidity to post moves like with dribbling/iso/shooting on the pro-stick. In fact the only way to get the full post game experience is to switch the 'pro-stick' back to 'isomotion/shot' stick like in 2K13. (Hold LT and use the right stick to strut your fancy footwork in the post.)\n\nUsing the 2K13 right-stick settings has draw backs as the pass controls rely on the new 'pro-stck'. You cannot throw alley-oops or fancy passes as the controls for it under the 2k13 stick literally do not exist and was acknowledged by 2K/VC developer Mike Wang. If you are like me and love the low post to do Olajuwon-type moves you either have to sacrifice alley-oops or learn to play "Enter Fatality combo in the low-post Kombat".\n\nOther than that gameplay looks like 2K13 and feels more like 2K11, which I love.\n\nNiches:\nLebron James\n\nI'm no fan of Lebron. As an Orlando fan it is and has always been my sworn duty to hate the Miami Heat no matter who is on their roster. But Lebron has had this cover and theme a long time coming. It's way past due for us to have an NBA 2K game cover with Lebron on it.\n\nBugs:\nI haven't played all the game modes yet. I usually just get right into an Association mode. One thing I have noticed about 12 games into the regular season, 90% of players on my team and around the league suddenly had their block and steal ratings upped ('progressed') to 96. Ninety-frigging-six! I can't possibly manually fix every player's rating without some reference spreadsheet in front of me, nor should I have to. Plus, after fixing it, what would prevent it from happening again another 12 games into the season? This totally ruined the association mode for me and I literally just gave up and deleted my saved game. What a waste of time!\n\nMyPlayer, according to practically everybody on the 2K forums is broken (as usual).\n\nOnline:\nI haven't tried online yet. I usually buy this game for the association mode, but I understand 2K's track record with online support on the PC. So it is a mediocre rating of 3 by default.\n\nGraphics:\nSame as 2K13. Exactly the same. It was good then and is good enough now (I guess). Bynum still rocks the faux-hawk.\n\nGraphics for the PC version by the way are last-gen and nothing like the Xbox One and PS4.\n\nAudio:\nThe commentary in the game is a lot of what was in 2k13 with some additions to the color commentary. It was good then and is good enough now.\n\nReplay Value:\nIt is NBA 2K. This game can occupy you for years.\n\nConclusion:\nPerformance: 10\nGame Play: 5\nNiches: 8\nBugs: 1\nOnline: 3\nGraphics: 5\nAudio: 7\nReplay Value: 10\nOverall: 6.1\n\nIf you already have 2K13 and aren't in dire need of a roster update then save your money on this one. I for one was enjoying this game up until I discovered player progression in Association mode is so broken it ruins the entirety of it. I live and breathe that mode for this franchise so it is a deal breaker for me.\n\nThere is no word of any PC patches coming any time soon or at all. Don't expect these bugs to be fixed.\n\n2K has also decided to drop roster updates on all current gen platforms (PC, 360, PS3) and during the current life cycle of the game too. It's not even the playoffs yet and they abandoned this game.","April 3, 2014","false","115.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The league was hit by a force of nature no analyst could have ever predicted. Smith destroyed rookie records for scoring and steals, these feats garnered him Rookie of the Year honors but unfortunately his incredible run was stopped by The Big 3 in the Easten Conference Finals. Adam had always aspired to play in the Big D and requested a transfer. Little did he know that he wasn't the only acquisition the Mavericks would make that offseason. Dallas had managed to acquire Lebron James and Smith in a 3 team trade involving Dallas, Miami, and Atlanta. Smith's second year was almost better than his first; in fact it was statistically better but the spotlight had been shifted. Smith finished 2nd in MVP voting to his colleague James. The Mavericks did manage to land the franchises second championship, a fabulous concession. Smith would learn to love this series of events as four seasons passed, each with a similar storyline. He was a valuable asset to the team but he could never quite keep the spotlight. Two more championships, top five in MVP voting for each of those four seasons. His seventh season was the breakout season he was looking for; he made it a mission to finally be the MVP. This was a contract year, he needed to perform. He was the league top scorer that season; in fact he had outscored the entire rest of his team combined. Smith finished with an outstanding 50+ points/game average and a career low in assists. The Mavericks finished ninth in the West barely missing the playoffs; but he had done it. Smith was the MVP. The administration was not happy with his selfish play and the decline in the team's performance and quickly dealt him away to the Pelicans on a max guaranteed contract. Smith was the star, the golden boy of basketball at last. The glory was lost even faster than it was earned after three pitiful seasons in New Orleans. Many insiders blame the fall on addiction and questionable off-the-court decisions. Smith chose to retire after his contract ended that season. Methamphetamine had utterly consumed the future hall of fame candidate; all of us wish Adam 'The Maverick' Smith the best and truly hope he can turn his life around. It is possible he may have another MVP season in him.\n\n10/10 would dunk again.","May 26","true","209.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You're really paying for updated rosters... which seems like something you should get for free for your old game.  It should "update rosters" each year, but 2K likes taking your money.  If you like the idea of having some of your stats at 99, don't buy this game.  It caps your predominate skill position stats at 90 or 92.  Meanwhile other AI players in the game can max out at 99 and run circles around you.  Why do they do this to you?  To force you to buy temporary stat upgrades.. that is if you own it on PS4.  You don't even have that option in the PC game.  A fully maxed out player in all stats and skills should dominate the leauge as a Superstar... but you only get to be one of many stars in the league.\n\nYou're wide open, no one on you, your shooting stat is maxed, and you'll still miss 50% of the time.  Seems kind of stupid.  In NBA2K13 in the above scenario (and in real life) you make the shot 90% of the time.  You normally drop 30 pts, 10 rebs, and 10 assist when you play.  When you sim games, it's more like 12 pts, 5 rebs, and 3 assists.  WTF right?\n\nThe game does improve with the animations relating to blocking shots.  Your character moves towards the ball and has a reasonable physics response.  The other nice upgrade is in 2K13 you were whistled for a foul every time you even thought of making a steal.  In 2K14 you can acutally get a steal or 3 without fouling out.\n\nI'd give this game 8 out of 10 overall But! not worth the purchase if you have 2K12 or 2K13.","May 17, 2014","false","156.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One of my major gripes about this game is how the 2K servers are constantly down. I have owned a number of 2K basketball games, mostly on the Xbox 360 and while their servers are also notoriously bad they are amazing compared to the 2K's PC servers. I have had the game for about a week and i have tried every day and still have not been able to play online even once... While MyCareer and the other non-online gamemodes can be fun, there aren't that many changes from NBA 2K13 - you could that this game is NBA 2K13 v2. It is honestly not worth $30 and barely worth the $10 that i paid. If you have NBA 2K13 DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you see this on sale and enjoy playing MyPlayer or other single player gamemodes and don't own NBA 2K13 that i would that it would be worth the purchase, otherwise avoid it.

It's one of those.  You like sports games, and you want it to be good, so the bar isn't even set particularly high.  At first, you brush off some of the awkward controls and the occassional completely non-sensical thing the computer does.  But then they really start to add up.  And then they really start to ♥♥♥♥ you and you get angry.\n\nYou get situations like:\n\n-Your center dribbling the ball with 7 secs left on the shot clock, refusing to pass.  In fact, the game PENALIZES your in game rating for "calling for the ball to much".  And then the center clanks hard on a 3 pt attempt as the clock expires.\n\n-Try to pass to a guy cutting to the hoop for an easy dunk, but instead pass it to a guy 2 feet to your right.  Who will then dribble right into you and have the ball go off your knee and right to the opponent to start a fast break.  And then the game will penalize you for "allowing your man to score".\n\n-The game will offer an in game challenge, like "Tie the game before half" or "Comeback and Win", and then sub you out of the game.  And you'll return with like 35 seconds left in the half.  Down 6.  Without the ball.  And don't worry, the game will figure out some way to penalize your score for something in those 35 seconds.\n\n-The tendency on Pick and Rolls, for the pick guy to not really pick anyone.  or roll anywhere.  or even go to the correct side of the defender.  So all he really did was start a double team.  And you will be penalized for a bad pass and turnover, or try to do some sort of silly circus shot on a relatively straight layup that clanks hard.  Either way, you start a fast break.\n\n-And then just some of the teams or players will start to be just rediculous...like 13 of 15 from 3 point range, or your team blowing 9 straight layups.\n\nEventually, you just start wanting to rage quit, because you'll be up 4, get subbed out, and come back in down 19, and you're just like "Well ♥♥♥♥ you too game, restart".  After doing that 3 or 4 times over 2 or 3 games, you just stop playing for the night.","January 22, 2014","false","33.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The controls are abysmal, they are on the level of the worst play controls for any game I've ever played.  Trying to control your players is like trying to control someone with a 2 second reaction time on the slickest of ice.  Nothing makes intuitive sense in this game AT ALL.  From the times you will press the pass button and instead of passing to the most obvious wide open player in front of you, it throws it across the court to a guy in double coverage, to the times when your guy is tripping over his own feet for 3+ seconds while you are unable to pass it to the painfully wide open guy - this game is just awful.\n\nRunning a play from the play book is comical, good luck trying to execute any of that in a timely fashion.  The game doesn't even feel finished - and it's like the 10th incarnation of this trash so there's absolutely zero excuse.\n\nThe MyCareer mode is a complete joke.  Playing offense is atrocious enough with your completely gimped player, but defense is just beyond believable.  How do people put up with this ♥♥♥♥?  I guess I forget the demographic that typically gets sold on this game hasn't necessarily seen a good game before to know how comparitively awful of an experience this game provides compared to even the most mediocre of games out there.  I played perfect defense (which is hard enough to do in a game that provides no good way to defend a ball handler) and was up in a guys face the whole time, all the way until the point where I'm directly on him and jumping up to block his shot, perfectly right in front of his face.  Shot ♥♥♥♥ violation.  Do I get "team points" for forcing the violation?  Nah.  But what do I see as the screen refreshes and the ball is being inbounded?  Yep - I lost team points for "Bad shot block attempt"  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\n\nIf you have any self respect at all, don't throw your money at this sorry excuse for a game.  Even getting it on sale for 7 bucks was not worth it in the slightest.  These game devs must be laughing all the way to the bank with this trash, it's even worse than Madden if you could believe it.","May 7, 2014","false","5.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is by far the worst addition to the 2K franchise I personally have ever played.\n\nLet me break down this abysmal, ghetto, BET soap opera of a game.\n\nStarting with the controls; the addition of the dribble stick is pointless.  Seeing how it's near impossible to, what brotha's call "cross over" your opponent--since the AI is programmed to stick to you like ♥♥♥♥ing black on Kenyan.  2K switches up the controls from previous entries for no apparent reason.  Weird button and analog combinations for all the various moves prove too complicated, especially for this game's target audience.  I have a extremely high win-rate in 2K14 along with over five-hundred games played and have yet to learn how to "Eurostep."  The button combination to Eurostep in 2K13 was "X-X", that simple.\n\nNext, the music.  For perfect execution of a flawless soundtrack look back at 2K13.  They had legendary producer Jay-Z arrange a masterpiece of 20 black songs and Coldplay.  But now, in 2K14, where supposedly all songs were taken from LeBron James' iPod we see a drastic change as we take a look into the mind of LeBron.  The entire soundtrack is one perpetual ego-stroke, non-stop "♥♥♥♥ da haters!" songs as we're forced to listen to "Started From The Bottom" by Aubrey Graham during the startup loading screen.\n\nNow most importantly, the multiplayer.  Listen when I say this, 2K14, and 2K in general, has the most broken multiplayer you will ever witness in a video game.  The multiplayer is random, meaning no matter what you do it doesn't affect the outcome of the game.  Let me explain.  Say you miss five wide open shots, your opponent grabs the rebound, prances down the court, does a 360, contested three point attempt, with three guys in his face while fading away out of bounds...and makes the shot.  If you like those odds, this game is for you.\n\nOtherwise, avoid at all costs.","June 21, 2014","false","36.0"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","1"

This review would be a maybe, but I just can't recommend it with a "YES", because the game would disappoint anyone that expects the player behavior on the court to be even remotely realistic. Also, the controls really stink. :]\n\nYou know what basketball is, right? Well, this game tries to emulate it and sell it as a simulation, but I've never seen a real basketball game situation where 3 players are guarding the same guy... often, 2 of my computer controlled teammates will leave their defensive positions and start obstructing me while I'm guarding my own target, which leaves the area around my basket and 2 opposition players totally unguarded.\nThe player switching mechanic is just primitive, press A (360 control scheme) to switch/scroll! through your players, and maybe the game will pick a player you want to control in time to prevent the other team from scoring (right stick, 2K! Have you heard of it motherfu... well, yes you have, but I mean outside of your ridiculous menu). There is another way to switch players, but it's even harder to navigate, press RB (360 controls) and then press the button displayed above the head of the player you want to control (there is no way to do it in time to prevent the other team from scoring, and some of your players will often be out of view, along with the button prompt above their head, so it's worse than the A button solution).\nThe player physics feel really stiff, for example when you want to go for a quick counter-attack after stealing the ball, when you pass the ball to the player that's in front, the ball passing player first completely stops and then passes the ball, usually giving the opposition enough time to set up their defense. Another example (my favorite) is when you knock the ball out of the opposition player's hands, and it falls behind him, your player will often not pick up the ball, even though you are holding that direction with your controller (he just won't move for 1 - 2 seconds), and the same opposition player that lost the ball will recover, turn around and take the ball before you are able to. You can usually expect delayed response from your players from any directional inputs you give them, and I think it's because of the motion capture, this game takes it's physics and animations seriously, or at least it tries to, I had a few situations where the opposition players would go through me with their ball dribbling hand and score.\nThe game's menu is probably the worst menu I've ever had to navigate in any game, ever! I don't even know how to explain the way it works.\nYou can't turn off auto subs, the game's coach decides to take out LeBron "motherflippin" James and put in Andersen and there's nothing you can do to prevent it, the best you can do is wait till you have the ball again and reverse the stupid decisions made by the coach.\n\nThat would be all that's bad and horrible and inexcusable about this game, I think... (haven't touched the online modes, but I've read that you can't play against your friends unless the game graciously pits you against your friend while you both search for an online game at the same time).\n\nThe game can be fun when it's working, and it's a shame that so many issues are plaguing it (I'm not risking buying NBA 2K15 because of this, I don't care about the graphics, 2K14 still looks fine graphically IMO, so I don't feel the need to upgrade/update), and it's probably worth the money on a 75% off sale if you like arcadey sports games and don't care about NBA roster updates (or slightly, yes, just slightly worse graphics than the new game).\n\nScore 6.5/10","October 13, 2014","false","11.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RainbowApricot/recommended/255480/","RainbowApricot","RainbowApricot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RainbowApricot/","5 products in account","NBA 2K14 review by RainbowApricot\nThe NBA 2K series is a long standing series of basketball video games developed and released annually since 1999. This series is very dominant in the basketball video game market, easily outshining competititors such as NBA Live. To put it into perspective, imagine a team of five Stephen Currys playing against a blindfolded and dehydrated JaVale McGee. This is NBA 2K vs NBA Live. NBA 2K has always been a reliable series, releasing quality games year after year, which makes it such a popular choice in the sports video game genre. NBA 2K14 is yet another stellar release. Meanwhile, the developers at EA Sports were probably stroking, combing and styling each other's pubic hairs while they were producing NBA Live 14, as it is a (figurative) piece of sh*t. Sloppy gameplay combined with clunky controls and terrible graphics can only mean that the developers were either very unfocused in the production of the game, or they were actually trying their best to create an unpolished (again, figurative) piece of dog turd. Either possibility should not be ruled out.\n\nBefore I give my final rating, I would like to provide another analogy of NBA 2K vs NBA Live. Imagine Matthew Dellavedova is taking a dump in one of the toilets at the Quicken Loans Arena. Suddenly, Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Jr. pops right out of the S-bend and swats all of his faeces out of the toilet, sending it flying all the way to Australia. Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Jr. then bellows viciously "get that weak sh*t (haha sh*t, geddit?) out of here!". Matthew Dellavedova stares back at the sopping wet Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Jr. in total disbelief, tears streaming down his bearded cheeks. I understand that this is quite a vivid description, however I wanted to make clear the distinction between the NBA 2K and NBA Live series. In this case, NBA Live is Matthew Dellavedova and NBA 2K is Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Jr.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to congratulate the developers of NBA 2K on another successful release. I can't say the same for NBA Live, however. In fact, I would very much like to challenge the entire development team responsible for NBA Live to a battle of wits, however I fear they are unarmed. I would probably go to as far as to say that LeBron James could have produced better games by smashing his d*ck[pbs.twimg.com] around on a keyboard.\n\nFinal rating for NBA 2K14: 10/10\n\nTo trigger a hidden celebration, press the shoot key 15 times in a row quickly, after a made free throw from your player. He will pull down his shorts and begin to "helicopter" his d*ck around in a circular motion. Be careful though! This animation lasts 30 seconds long, so it will not allow your player to get back on defence.","December 12, 2015","true","467.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","1","3","3","0"

Well, that's because this is the only basketball game that is under $50 at this time, so I'm stuck with this ALMOST UNPLAYABLE PIECE OF DOG ♥♥♥♥.\nHere we begin the large list of everything wrong with this game:\n- An awful port, basically demands a controller.\n- Doesn't tell you how to play.  No joke.  They have a "Training Camp" option, but many of the mechanics don't work.\n- RS and X (Xbox controller) are both shoot; this means when you try to attempt a crossover, many times you just end up making a terrible shot.\n- The release system is pointless.  You can get wide-open shots, hitting "Excellent A+ Quality", and clunk!  Also, it tells you to release when you see a flash around the ring of your player, but releasing on the flash makes it "Slightly Late" basically every time.\n- No multiplayer, so you're stuck with the infuriating task of playing against the AI, which is the most frusterating thing ever.\n- Here's why the AI is the most frusterating thing ever:  When you're playing a game against the AI, your defense will not effect them in any way, not kidding.  They will throw alley-oops nonstop, and they will almost never fail - dunking over your best defender, sometimes even two.  This would be fair if you could do it, but you can't.  The AI's defense is solid (which can actually be fun and challenging), but your team-mates sit there with their thumbs up their ♥♥♥, not doing anything - THEY WON'T EVEN THROW A HAND IN THE SHOOTERS FACE!\n- You go on cold streaks for no reason.  You'll get five open looks, get five perfect releases, and none of them will splash, and then that player is useless for the rest of the game.\n- MyCareer is about as enjoyable as stapling your scrotum to your stomach.  You start out as the most horrible player to ever step on the court: you miss wide-open shots, you can't pass, you try to steal and it's a reach-in-foul, you try to block and it's a foul.  Your coach is constantly changing who you're guarding, so you'll switch from the person that you're actually guarding, to a guy wide open (and unlike your team the opposing AI team will always make their open looks), and then your team grade goes down AN ENTIRE LETTER.  If you slip-up once you're basically crucified!  And the grind for points to upgrade is like cutting your own fingers off.  Without-a-doubt, MyCareer has been the worst part of every single NBA 2k game, EVER!\n- A disgusting lack of classic teams.  They do have a good selection of teams to choose from, but they're missing so many.\n- Post offense is OP.  To score in this game all you have to do is pass it to the bigman, and he'll hook it in every single time from the post.  No joke, you'll shoot atleast 50%, guaranteed.  Doesn't matter if they're being triple-teamed, it will somehow by the grace of God, make it's way MAGICALLY into the basket.\n- This game looks like a flashy PS2 game.\nDon't buy this. This game contributes nothing to my time but frustration and anger.  Buy 2k16 or 2k15 instead.  Proabably 2k15 since that's the only one I'd call good.  sports games suck, never buy any sports game before doing heavy research into it first.  They don't care about you, but I'm sure you've deduced that over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they've pulled over the past few years.","May 29, 2015","false","259.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are so many problems and glitches that I get drowsy just thinking about it.\n\nLet's start with teammate AI:  it's horrible.  Players do not behave like basketball players.  They won't take open shots, they won't attack the basket when they should, and they don't seek open space when rolling off a pick.  On defense, you'll find yourself screened by your own guys, who will proceed to just move out of the way of a driving opponent instead of providing help or making the correct switch.\n\nShooting is so bad.  I can't stress just how ridiculous it is.  You can have a player with 100/100 shooting from all ranges, take wide open A+ shots, get Excellent timing and still miss more than you make.  No average NBA player is going to miss more than half of their wide open mid range jumpers, so when a player who should be among the greatest pure shooters of all time is missing constantly IT IS A SERIOUS PROGRAMMING PROBLEM.\n\nDon't even get me started on lay-ups and putbacks rimming out.  This game has seriously made me wonder if there is such a thing as a "high-percentage shot."\n\nThe computer's recovery speed on defense is way too fast.  You can break their ankles and they still recover in time to block your shot, unless you get them to fall down completely.  The same is true on a fast break.  You can have a sizeable lead, sprint with a very fast player, and slower men will magically show up in time to get in your way.\n\nYou can't adjust the sliders in game modes like "My Career," because they'd hate for anyone to tamper with these gamebreaking problems.  Believe me, there are more, but I'm not going to continue listing them.\n\nI haven't even bothered with the multiplayer because they didn't think a "play with a friend" option was important enough to include.\n\nSeriously, who are these morons?  Is this the standard in sports gaming?  This ♥♥♥♥ would not fly in other genres; they'd have to label it "pre-release."\n\nThe game isn't completely terrible overall, it's still playable and if you can ignore it's glaring, frustrating faults then it can be enjoyable... but I can't recommend it.  There are just too many problems that should have been fixed before this game ever saw the light of day.  Now they're surely on the verge of pumping out NBA2k15, which will have the same problems because people just continue to buy it.  Glad I didn't pay full price.","September 10, 2014","false","218.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you enjoy basketball games you will enjoy this for the most part.  There are some goofy things about the game.\n\nIn dynasty, the players that are created look completely different than the real players when you get 5 or so seasons in.  This didn't bug me, but it looked odd.\nThe hall of fame doesn't adjust for shortening the game clock.  No one on my team would be able to make the hall of fame because of this.  Disappointed even when I had a scoring or rebound leader for multiple seasons.\nThe on ball defense is a full motion that needs to play out, so if your player is near the sideline and this happens there is no chance to jump throw or stop moving before going out of bounds.  This only happens 2/3 times in a 3 minute quarter game.  Not the worst but semi-frustrating.\n\nThe gui is fine, and the depth of the franchise mode is fun.  Drafting and scouting was fun while trying to manage what oldies i should keep.","October 11, 2014","true","69.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However I like using the current rosters (most recent trades reflected, ie Pacers with Turner, etc) and can't do so without online access. So I am not about to start a new season until they fix my CD Key.

I am very pleased with the gfx and especially the speech which makes you feel like you're at a real game. I have the video effects (not much to choose from however) maxed out and it's still fluid at 55fps. Some say the visuals are not up to par but I feel they do the job just fine while keeping the game lag free with all the animations going on.\nI couldn't figure out how to do the free shots until looking it up online, there's not much help in knowing the controls for some moves but the tutorial section for the basics cover everything else.\nI can't compare this to other games in the series but this suits me fine, I'm hooked on the genre now.

The only problem I have with this game is that it's EXACTLY like NBA 2K13 and possibly NBA 2K12. The only differences would be the music, menu layout, and the rosters. The draft mode is exactly the same down to the letter. The same teams interview you, they ask you the same exact questions, and you give the same exact answers (from what I can tell). The draft mode is kind of annoying. There's no way to skip through it, so if you feel like you might be a late pick, go ahead and take a nap or something. They also added in live recordings from the actual draft along side the game sound, which ruins the experience.\n\nI can recommend this game on sale just to have a sports game to play, but look at the earlier titles first and pick them up if they're cheaper.","March 13, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then after they score my player jumps! HAHAHA !\n\nI mean, great basketball game. But there's no competition out there. Maybe this year EA will have something good.\n\nLove the oldschool teams, using Magic, Zeke, Jordan. Making my own Roster reppin' my City is cool. Lebron's path mode is the closest thing to role playing (story mode) that this game has. Which will keep you coming back watching his story unfold.\n\nPretty much the same as 2k13 but with a crappier soundtrack. Plus 2K loves shutting down its old servers to make way for the next year's game. I can't play 2k13 online anymore, the same shall soon be said for this title here. So only buy it if you're going to play single player or co-op on the same screen.\n\nGood game, but don't buy it. Wait for 2k15 which is NEXT GEN on PC, then you'll have access to all the features like the game was intended to have. And what is a game (at least in this generation) without in-game purchases?! Virtual Currency? Crap...\n\nPS. These non-next gen versions of 2k14 are not compatible with the MOBILE GAME, and cannot be synced unless you have next gen. You can still play the MOBILE GAME, but you can't do extra stuff because you have a crappy Ps3 port on the PC.","October 2, 2014","false","164.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That should be a refundable purchase if I ever heard of one. The best part of this game is laughing at how crappy it is.\n\n-If you actually want to play the game make sure to turn all the rules off because if you don't ever 10 seconds you will get a foul or some other stupid crap that is annoying enough that you will wish you had a gun in game where you could just pop these suckas when it happens.\n\n-Graphics looks like a good PS2 game, most crowd is sprites or cubey people and there are no settings to chance graphical settings that I could find. Aliasing is a huge issue! You would have to force it via drivers if you really cared to play this game but you won't because its ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n-Telling distances and positions on the feild is difficult, partially due to graphics and due to the strange feeling camera angle that does not assist in viewing the game area in any way aside from being more cinematic.\n\n-AI are either cheating or are able to get past the bad controls and design aspects. I say the fuggers are cheating.\n\n-UI design is atroucious. Whoever designed the UI should be dragged through a pit of a million camel spiders. The way its setup trying to do anything brings up a menu that would make you think it would be a menu you quit the game from or exit out of something but instead that menu is the menu you use to do anything aside from the first 2 options in the startup menu. Its just bad. ♥♥♥♥ 2k. 2k sucks.\n\n-The actual gameplay isn't good. Blocking feels completely random based as does most the game. Shooting comes down to letting go of the button at the right time which feels cheap as heck and its pretty random at that. AI will almost always land shots and actually block anyone is difficult as you tend to be either to far one way or another or your chracter decides he want to jump in a random direction and leave this world behind.\n\n-Buttons change randomly without any indication or parrallels so one minute you might have to hold the button to pass the ball to another player, but next you don't hold the button its now a toggle.\n\n-Entire feeling of being a janky and crappy feeling game\n\n-Career mode is to much filler and to much crap and not enough basketball, but after one game they probably realised no one would want to play much more of that.\n\n+Character creation let me make a freak\n\nThese types of sports games NEED euphoria physics or some parrallel to that as without it just looks like crap especially this game though. I would rather play an old College basketball game I had for the PS2 made by EA because thats more fun and better in every way than this game but both games feel flat and emotionless.\n\nIt sucks, don't buy it even for $5. Its not good at all.","June 24, 2014","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Superstars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkley didn't even understand the concept of basketball anymore. That scene sums up this game perfectly. There is a basketball in NBA2k14, but it is not a basketball game. Much like Space Jam, your teammates do not understand why they are on the court. They constantly make bad decisions, can't shoot, can't pass, and often will hopelessly bounce the ball off of theiroverpriced shoes. Not to mention, your CPU opponent will make unbelievable shots (ie fadeaways from the 3pt line with .8 left on the shot clock), get seemingly impossible rebounds, and are so clutch that even MJ can't compete.  Combine that with sluggish controls and bad animation, and you have NBA2k14. Tthis game screams laziness louder than Carlos Boozer when he goes up for a rebound.\n\nThis isn't only the worst basketball game I've ever played (move over NBA2k10), this may be the worst game I've ever played. We desperately need legit competition in the NBA-sim market. To quote Scottie Pippen to Karl Malone in the 1997 NBA finals, "The Mailman doesn't deliver on Sundays", and 2k Sports is mailing these games in.

We PC gamers have been treated like crap by 2K sports over the years given stripped down versions of NBA2K and this year is no exception. This is not the great looking NBA 2K that we seen trailers for the next gen consoles no no no, what we get is the Xbox 360 and PS3 version. It does look a lot better than those consoles but it is no comparison to what the current gen consoles got. But overall i am having a lot of fun playing this game and even though it's stripped down i still can completely enjoy it. One benefit of having the PC version is the mods and i highly recommend the Ultimate NBA2K 14 mod pack which adds soo much stuff it's unbelievable, it's 22 gigs of extra content. They add rosters and players going all the way back to the 60's, it's overwhelming and awesome at the same time. If you're a fan of previous NBA2K titles than you will like this game, the controls are tight and playing career mode is fun i just wish there was an option to play as your whole team in my career mode not just yourself. But honestly if you can hold off till October 7th you can pick NBA 2K15 for PC and this year PC will get the next gen, fully featured game for the first time in history! And from all the information i'm reading on it 2K15 is looking like a beast of a game and i can hardly contain myself.

I believe the game plays the same but the graphics are much better, faces look insanely realistic. There is also an this awesome feature where at the end of games players will get interviewed and they are voice acted by the real players! I find that so cool that I cant wait for 2k15 to come out. I dont blame 2k for not giving PC the updated version as the game was released with xbox 360 and PS3. They sold the game for $30 on launch day.

The game looks beautiful despite its many shortcomings (look cons section). Myplayer mode lets you play the game using a custom player, pretty good to immerse yourself in the game, but this mode has its flaws.\nCONS: Player models look funny, since the game uses the same engine as its previous iteration. The next gen graphic is only available on console, pretty stupid move 2K. Myplayer mode still lacks immersion, the better mode is only available in Xbone and PS4, way to discriminate your user base 2K. The AI teammates in Myplayer mode is beyond useless. They can't defend, leaving you to do a lot of the defense yourself sometimes to no avail. They miss wide open shot, sometimes they dont even take wide open shot, they can't run fast break often time running themselves out of bound. The AI opponent in Myplayer mode however can be godlike adding to your frustration. They can ignore your defense and put the ball pass it by forcing their way to it, their 3 points ability is beyond ludicrous, 4/6 3pt FG attempt per quarter is common. So you have to REALLY enjoy MyPlayer mode to get past these obvious flaws.\nEDIT: I can't take it anymore. The teammates AI is beyond useless. 2 consecutive out of bounds when you passed to them. These are supposedly world class players in KD and Westbrook. They can't defend if their life depends on it, Ibaka can't receive pass and shoot mid range. Waste of money. Never again 2K.\nCONCLUSION: I decided to get the game after playing 2K13 and thought it was awesome. 2K14 isn't awesome. The MyPlayer mode drives you nuts. The only salvation this game has is its good pvp mode.","July 15, 2014","false","243.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even in Hall of Fame difficulty, playing a three-point specialist or an athletic one(or an all-around scorer) could be the easiest ways to rack up quick skill points and get into the starting lineup within 4 to 6 games into the first season. The other specialties are hard as hell, for me.\n\nThe other modes are fine, especially Association mode.\n\nAs for the online experience, no. Not working for me, at least. Very laggy. Maybe because I live in a Southeast Asian country and the matchmaking is sending me to the other side of the world. I hope that 2k fixes the online experience in 2k15.\n\nThe controls are good.

This is the best basketball game to date, in terms of realism and feel. The graphics are descent. My only complaint is that PC did not get the "next-gen" version of the game. Xbone and PS4 had an updated 2k14 with a whole new graphical engine and much more dynamic interesting things, its hard to explain. I watched a video on YouTube of someone playing 2k14 on PS4. I believe the game plays the same but the graphics are much better, faces look insanely realistic. There is also an this awesome feature where at the end of games players will get interviewed and they are voice acted by the real players! I find that so cool that I cant wait for 2k15 to come out. I dont blame 2k for not giving PC the updated version as the game was released with xbox 360 and PS3. They sold the game for $30 on launch day. So it was worth the 30 dollars when I bought it but now I would recommend waiting on 2k15. Im excited for it.","August 2, 2014","true","455.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks beautiful despite its many shortcomings (look cons section). Myplayer mode lets you play the game using a custom player, pretty good to immerse yourself in the game, but this mode has its flaws.\nCONS: Player models look funny, since the game uses the same engine as its previous iteration. The next gen graphic is only available on console, pretty stupid move 2K. Myplayer mode still lacks immersion, the better mode is only available in Xbone and PS4, way to discriminate your user base 2K. The AI teammates in Myplayer mode is beyond useless. They can't defend, leaving you to do a lot of the defense yourself sometimes to no avail. They miss wide open shot, sometimes they dont even take wide open shot, they can't run fast break often time running themselves out of bound. The AI opponent in Myplayer mode however can be godlike adding to your frustration. They can ignore your defense and put the ball pass it by forcing their way to it, their 3 points ability is beyond ludicrous, 4/6 3pt FG attempt per quarter is common. So you have to REALLY enjoy MyPlayer mode to get past these obvious flaws.\nEDIT: I can't take it anymore. The teammates AI is beyond useless. 2 consecutive out of bounds when you passed to them. These are supposedly world class players in KD and Westbrook. They can't defend if their life depends on it, Ibaka can't receive pass and shoot mid range. Waste of money. Never again 2K.\nCONCLUSION: I decided to get the game after playing 2K13 and thought it was awesome. 2K14 isn't awesome. The MyPlayer mode drives you nuts. The only salvation this game has is its good pvp mode.","July 15, 2014","false","243.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First there is Mycareer. In this mode as you can probably guess. You make your mark in the NBA. Your aim is to be the greatest player in the NBA. It is a very addictive mode that can keep you playing for hours. You can also buy shoes and clothing to dress your created player to look casual or wacky off the court!\n\nThen there is Association mode. You play as the president of basketball operations of any team you choose. From Philly to Washington and even the historical teams the Micheal Jordans Bulls. You can coach your team, trade players, play as your team, set practices for your team ect. It also simulates games and generates rookies so your mode can go on for years and years and years, without a single current NBA player because all players eventually retire.\n\nAfter that  is Lebrons Path to Greatness mode. To be honest, i really dont play this mode because all you really do is simulate LeBron James career ( i would play all the time if it was Carmelo Anthony though!!!!!! :) So if you a fan of LeBron James, this mode is for you.\n\nLast but certainly not least is My Team. Again i dont play this mode a lot, but it is basically a player market. You can have any player current or old, on the same team. The catch is you have to buy them. There are also tournaments and just quick matches to play with the players you have on your team. I guess you can say it is kind of like fantasy basketball in a way.\n\n\nI ultimately give this game a 9 out of 10:\n\nPros:\n\nGood Game modes\n\nImproved and new animations\n\nRealistic Gameplay and Simulation\n\nCons:\n\nBuggy gameplay\n\nSome slow animations\n\nGame crashes from time to time\n\n\nOverall Great Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","August 6, 2014","true","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The two main differences is the roster update and how the game looks/feels (you can finally block dunks!).  Besides that nothing has changed.  So, if you're tight for money and want a basketball game, go with 2k13 since it's cheaper.  Otherwise, 2K14 is an improvement, but with seemingly no competition, it may be heading down the path the MLB 2k franchise went and not improving enough through each year.

Prior to the release, tons of new features were hyped for this games, most of which remain unfulfilled - a dedicated, stable online server for online match-ups, customization of your avatar restricted to console versions when it was said otherwise and improvements to the stability of the game, to name a few. With a distinct lack of online support to go to for troubleshooting as well (For PC anyway), 2K Sports and its developers have effectively parted the fools that bought this game from their money. With broken control response mechanics, an unbalanced script for teammate AI on defense and teammate AI itself frustrating players to the point of questioning whether there is any intelligence at all. This game is, upon review, very much a beta release rather than a full release, possessing glitches and bugs that the publishers have refused to address.\n\nIt's a miss more than a hit, but I don't think 2k Sports and its affiliates care much for that.

I've played every NBA 2K game since 2K6. I wouldn't call myself a hardcore player, but I enjoy messing around with it and playing Franchise mode. I understand that the online modes didn't work as they should have, which is very disappointing because they're very fun when they do work. Franchise mode remains fun as always, and the presentation is better than ever.\n\nHowever, like many sports games, this franchise seems to suffer from some of the same problems year to year. Online modes, street hoops mode, and some A.I. hiccups remain mostly unchanged. A year isn't a whole lot of time in the game development world, but it's very "EA-ish" to just roundly ignore entire sections of a game. Still worlds better than the Madden franchise.\n\nAlready have 2K15 and am enjoying it immensely, will review next year some time. Also, this was one of the best soundtracks in the franchise's history. Just sayin!\n\n92/100\nBest basketball sim to date. Off the charts realism, somehow better than the year before.

With that being said, I am insulted with the way the developers are holding back the necessary updates to put this "version" on par with the "version" on the next gen consoles. It seems flakey to have different versions of your game when the hardware is not the bottleneck. What is the bottleneck then? I question their motives. As a matter of fact, there really hasn't been any updates, nor has there been any DLC. I will think twice before buying from 2KGames in the future. You might say, "You get what you pay for." but what about those who happened to pay full price? If it was always this low cost, I would have some more understanding. Bad job by the developers failing to give back to its supporters who bought this.","December 29, 2013","false","170.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What you need to do is make your account, enter in your CD key and confirm the email that they send you. After you do that you can finally play online.\n\nThe graphics are last gen graphics, which was to be expected since it's a port, but put all that stuff behind you and this is actually a really fun game. I enjoy the gameplay and the My Player mode that it offers.

I've seen previous NBA2K titles go as low as $4-8 once The Finals end. Solid game, regardless. Online play is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and full of cheaters though.

The graphics are great. The controls via Xbox 360 controller are spot on. I was an EA BB fan for a while, and they went down hill, so tried some 2K BB games in the past, and they were okay at best IMO. But this one is much better than any other 2K BB game I have played. Still think Sega Genesis Coach K college basketball is the best of all time, but this comes in at number two.\n\nKeep in mind I have not played this game for endless hours as most of my play has been local multiplayer, so keep in mind the single player stuff might stink for all I know, so the info above is for multiplayer which is why I bought this game.

I have a black 360 controller and a very fast and powerful PC as well as broadband and this game seems to have a little lag for buttons.\n\nGameplay is what you expect from this series, except they still have not fixed (they are getting like EA) the small things that make the game annoying.  You man being immobilized after almost every move is annoying.  I know in real life there is a delay to guys getting back up to speed, but not for every move.  If this doe not happen, then there is the'sliding' that your man does, often leading to 'out of bounds' calls!\n\nOf course, there are way too many 'kick ball violations' which you hardly see in a real NBA game.  One real annoying thig (at least while palying online) is that the game (or cheaters) will change your man that you are controlling, not allowing you to keep your defense!  The game also fails to pass the ball to your intended target on the fly a lot of times, often at the wrong time!  This makes me think that this is done on purpose as the game (like EA) likes to control the flow and game type and possible outcome.\n\nCheaters online is a big concern so I will buy a PS4 and the news game to prevent them from cheating.  It is annoying and weird to think that someone wakes up, wants to play a game and can only do so by cheating, as if they are winning a prize.  I hope that 2K can crack down on cheaters on PC and console and penalize them.    Others quit when they are losing.  I get the win, but still.  It appears as if the system can tell when bums pull the plug on their internet conntection, but they still do it.\n\nNow my final issue is with the controller (black 360).  I do not know if it is the game of Steam, but if someone pops up and takes me to the desktop or I switch to it, I can no longer use the controller unless I restart my PC.  It just started happening lately and more often.  As of writing this review, it has happened after none of the previous occurred.  I assumed that Steam updates games to the latest version auotmatically, but mine still says "1.0.0" and I have to assume that updates were done since then.  I hate to say that I do not like Steam, but I need to be sure that games can be updated.  I like my PC gaming, but I think I will buy a console.  I expect PC games to take advatange of ALL PCs, not just be cheap ports with more resolution.","July 20, 2014","true","277.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reason I did this is 2K15 isn't going to be 'next gen' for the pc, so I will probably never buy a sports game on PC again, as our hands are being forced to console. That being said, rarely can I play 2k14 online without lag. Not sure if it's server problem, or people I am playing against. The single player is about what you'd expect. Basic gameplay, no out of this world graphics, and just a minimal difference from previous years. If you can't find the game for $5 or less, move on and never look back.\n\nEdit: I've read, from multiple sources, 2K15 for the PC, will be based off the ps3/360, and not the ps4/Xbone.

"well f*** you."-2k representetive. The representative went on to say, "we'll simply throw previous gen graphics and engine in there and just update player stats, it'll take our intern 20 minutes to copy new stats into the last build of 2k13... online play??? Well, in addition to you not being able to join games with your friends, our game's 'server' is actually an outdated laptop strapped to the back of a wild cayote wandering the Mojave desert. Yeah, we're not obligated to do anything other than put a price tag on what could be considered a 'basketball videogame'. Oh, did you want support for your game? Did you think we would have a single patch to fix gamebreaking bugs that are realized in 5 minutes of any of the game modes? Well this is 2k, and as we say, 'f*** you'. "\nNow, of course the representative of 2k metaphorically said all of these things, as the representative I quoted is itself the inanimate intellectual property that is the steaming pile of middle-finger-waving, cash-grabbing, consumer-decieving garbage that is the PC version of NBA2k14. 2k has made some great games in recent times, for consoles and PC alike. However, this is one of the worst experiences I have had in a long time as a PC gamer. If all you want in a basketball videogame is playing 1v1 games against the computer with the August 2013 NBA roster and injury list on 10 year old hardware, then this is your game. But that almost definitely isn't the case, so you almost definitely don't want to buy this game.","June 2, 2014","false","215.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the best basketball game to date, in terms of realism and feel. The graphics are descent. My only complaint is that PC did not get the "next-gen" version of the game. Xbone and PS4 had an updated 2k14 with a whole new graphical engine and much more dynamic interesting things, its hard to explain. I watched a video on YouTube of someone playing 2k14 on PS4. I believe the game plays the same but the graphics are much better, faces look insanely realistic. There is also an this awesome feature where at the end of games players will get interviewed and they are voice acted by the real players! I find that so cool that I cant wait for 2k15 to come out. I dont blame 2k for not giving PC the updated version as the game was released with xbox 360 and PS3. They sold the game for $30 on launch day. So it was worth the 30 dollars when I bought it but now I would recommend waiting on 2k15. Im excited for it.","August 2, 2014","true","455.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game looks beautiful despite its many shortcomings (look cons section). Myplayer mode lets you play the game using a custom player, pretty good to immerse yourself in the game, but this mode has its flaws.\nCONS: Player models look funny, since the game uses the same engine as its previous iteration. The next gen graphic is only available on console, pretty stupid move 2K. Myplayer mode still lacks immersion, the better mode is only available in Xbone and PS4, way to discriminate your user base 2K. The AI teammates in Myplayer mode is beyond useless. They can't defend, leaving you to do a lot of the defense yourself sometimes to no avail. They miss wide open shot, sometimes they dont even take wide open shot, they can't run fast break often time running themselves out of bound. The AI opponent in Myplayer mode however can be godlike adding to your frustration. They can ignore your defense and put the ball pass it by forcing their way to it, their 3 points ability is beyond ludicrous, 4/6 3pt FG attempt per quarter is common. So you have to REALLY enjoy MyPlayer mode to get past these obvious flaws.\nEDIT: I can't take it anymore. The teammates AI is beyond useless. 2 consecutive out of bounds when you passed to them. These are supposedly world class players in KD and Westbrook. They can't defend if their life depends on it, Ibaka can't receive pass and shoot mid range. Waste of money. Never again 2K.\nCONCLUSION: I decided to get the game after playing 2K13 and thought it was awesome. 2K14 isn't awesome. The MyPlayer mode drives you nuts. The only salvation this game has is its good pvp mode.","July 15, 2014","false","243.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First there is Mycareer. In this mode as you can probably guess. You make your mark in the NBA. Your aim is to be the greatest player in the NBA. It is a very addictive mode that can keep you playing for hours. You can also buy shoes and clothing to dress your created player to look casual or wacky off the court!\n\nThen there is Association mode. You play as the president of basketball operations of any team you choose. From Philly to Washington and even the historical teams the Micheal Jordans Bulls. You can coach your team, trade players, play as your team, set practices for your team ect. It also simulates games and generates rookies so your mode can go on for years and years and years, without a single current NBA player because all players eventually retire.\n\nAfter that  is Lebrons Path to Greatness mode. To be honest, i really dont play this mode because all you really do is simulate LeBron James career ( i would play all the time if it was Carmelo Anthony though!!!!!! :) So if you a fan of LeBron James, this mode is for you.\n\nLast but certainly not least is My Team. Again i dont play this mode a lot, but it is basically a player market. You can have any player current or old, on the same team. The catch is you have to buy them. There are also tournaments and just quick matches to play with the players you have on your team. I guess you can say it is kind of like fantasy basketball in a way.\n\n\nI ultimately give this game a 9 out of 10:\n\nPros:\n\nGood Game modes\n\nImproved and new animations\n\nRealistic Gameplay and Simulation\n\nCons:\n\nBuggy gameplay\n\nSome slow animations\n\nGame crashes from time to time\n\n\nOverall Great Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","August 6, 2014","true","37.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't watch sports and I'm not a fan of the NBA but I do like games. This simulator can be enjoyable either way. I like to fantasize  I have a basketball team that destroys everyone and wins the championship or whatever it's called. I like to pretend to be an all-star player and smash balls in faces or whatever. For that this game is perfect. It's very fluent and the graphics are beautiful. That's all there is to say about the pros; if you like basketball then this game will be thoroughly enjoyed. Now one major complaint I have is the draft with a new character. It is the most boring nonsense I've ever endured in my life. I had to experience it again when I created a new character. Why would there not be an option to skip this garbage. The graphics are terrible during these scenes and remind me of the old Wrestlemania games when you could go backstage and it was all underdeveloped. Another issue are the mandatory questions for the press after the game. They are a total waste of time and completely basic and thoughtless. There should be an option to skip for those of us unfamiliar with ESPN news and don't care to live out the fantasy to that extent. If you can tolerate it that far then you have to deal with the incredible difficulty and slow process of leveling up your character so he doesn't crap away his career. Aside from those annoyances, I found this game to be a fun way to waste a little time. There's no way a basketball fan could be disappointed.","June 12, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am glad to see some frustrating bugs in 2k13 get fixed (e.g. broken replays, though they should have patched 2k13 if 2k sports really cared about the fans), however there are just too many legacy issues as well as newly introduced ones to make a purchase of this game worthwhile. Here I would like to highlight 2 major problems for me:\n1. Teammate offense AI in my career. There is no improvement at all. They probably tweaked it a bit, which actually makes it worse. Your teammates routinely ignore your position on the court which means they may get in your way, or they may leave you double teamed while not creating any open shot. Your teammates will also be Shaqtin' A Fool a lot: stepping/standing out of bound, missing open layups, and setting screens against air. The AI issues will be especially annoying if your player plays a non-PG position because you won't get to call plays, which could have reduced the chance of awkward movements or spacing.\n2. A couple of "too easy to ..." issues. It is too easy to block shots or get blocked, and it's too easy to get the ball knocked loose inadvertently. Blocks, turnovers/steals, and goaltendings, their unrealistically high rate of occurance can really do damages to the overall experience sometimes.\nTo sum it up, nba 2k14 is at best just a patched 2k13 with a tiny addition of new animations, plus some slight tweaks of AI and ball physics, which in many cases make the game less fun than its recent predecessors.","January 18, 2014","false","234.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yet helping your team rise to the NBA Finals and taking home the Larry O'brian trophy is so sweet.

Each NBA2k game seems to improve on the last (with some exceptions... sorry heaps of 2k12). Right stick now controls dribble moves and shots without a modifier and makes breakin ankles on the way to a casual tomahawk feel so nice. Player upgrades are better than they were in 2k13 and are powerful and varied enough to significantly impact the way your players play. AI is as good as it has been in the series, and while still a little prone to odd backcourt, 3 second violation or mind numbingly stupid pass, it's still an improvement.\n\nBut by far my favourite thing about 2k14 (and for the most part, the NBA2k series in general) is how team orientated it is. On lower difficulties you can carry your team. Pump up that difficulty to HoF and it becomes a strategy game, where play calling, mismatches, etc are all important. That doesn't mean you can't dunk on Dwight. Just that there might be better options.\n\nThoroughly recommended.

The two main differences is the roster update and how the game looks/feels (you can finally block dunks!).  Besides that nothing has changed.  So, if you're tight for money and want a basketball game, go with 2k13 since it's cheaper.  Otherwise, 2K14 is an improvement, but with seemingly no competition, it may be heading down the path the MLB 2k franchise went and not improving enough through each year.

I also agree that the All Star weekend is a massssive waste of time. Trying to do dunk contests or 3-pt shootout is like sticking your head in a bucket of tar - wholy unsatisfying.\n\nHopefully 2K sports will listen to those of us that they have skunked, and put out a patch or a fix for this lame goose of a game.","March 2, 2014","false","340.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But from the perspective of someone who has not played the series in atleast a decade I can safely say that this game is highly enjoyable playing the mode where you create your player, start off as a rookie and only control that character the entire time and your progression is based more on how well you played with your team and not wither you won or lost, or heck even scored the entire game, a big part of the "SP" (might as well be XP) that you earn is based on your grade you get playing the game which is based on making good passes, turnovers, and just being in the right place when your suppose to, yes scoring helps raise the grade, but missing lowers it worse so until you gain enough stats to make more shots then you miss its almost better to not shoot at all and be more of the person to pass and block.\n\nThe controls while a bit confusing if you don't play the tutorials or look at the control scheme do feel good even if sometimes  its hard to remember how to do "move x" since there is a lot of "wiggle the right anolog stick in a certain way compaired to where the key is" controls and so until you know how the controls work it is really easy to accidently move the analog stick the oposite direction of the move you wanted to do. Which brings me to the only thing I do not care for about the game, it is blatently designed for controller in mind and the keyboard and mouse controls are iffy. I would never play any sports game without a controller anyways, but atleast put some effort into making the game playable with keyboard and mouse.\n\nAll in all I would only play this game for the gameplay of controlling only the rookie you create and working on improving and getting better contracts and sponserships and what not, I would not play it for the more arcady mode of you playing as all characters because well that feels the exact same as it did a decade ago. (Then again I am also the type of person who prefered and played better in the 1st person view gamemode of NFL 2K2(?), I more enjoy playing modes that are not the same thing every year and give a feel more of the entire team needs to work well together and not the arcady feel of you controlling everything to where the AI really doesn't factor into how well you do at all.\n\nSteam really needs to add an option for Yes/No/NA as to wither you recomend a game or not when writing a "review" because parts of the game I would, parts I would not, and not everything has a yes or no answer when it comes to recomending something. With that said my "Yes I would recomend this game" I have to append on only if you have not played a recent NBA 2K game but enjoy RPG like elements in your sports games where your a single player and have to figure out how to work with the AI to do better. Because I would not recomend this game if you like to play it like how every NBA 2K arcade mode has played for over a decade, pick up a older cheaper NBA 2K game if you want that because it doesn't feel any different in 13 years for that mode.","March 2, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In general, it's a fun game, and it's the only option for basketball.  I bought it in spite of all the complaints of bugs because it was on sale.  I have not run into any serious ones yet, and it has been worth the 10 bucks.  It does have a lot of flaws, though.  The graphics look somewhat dated, so I can only assume this is not the same version found on the nextgen systems (the $30 base price tag backs this up).  Also, the AI is dodgy from time to time. For example, sometimes players will just dribble straight out of bounds or randomly throw the ball out of bounds, especially while inbounding against pressure.  It doesn't happen too often but enough to be noticeable and frustrating.  The game also attempts to force close games in the 4th quarter through officiating, shot percentage and the like.\n\nIf it's on sale, and you're just looking for a decent basketball game to play, I would change my review to recommended.  If you're hoping for a cutting-edge game that truly captures the NBA or a significant upgrade from 2k13, you'll likely be disappointed.  The "Not Recommended" vote is more of a warning due to the game feeling several years old and many people reporting multi-hour saved games being ruined by bugs. Lack of competition in the basketball market has apparently provided no motivation to work on major improvements, similar to the 2K baseball series and Madden football.   I've really lost faith in the 2K team over the past couple years.  They used to be one of the good guys.\n\nBottom Line:  It's a fun game if you like basketball, but it's not really worth the full price (even at $30) for this version unless you just love the NBA and absolutely must have the latest game for it on PC.","March 31, 2014","false","45.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There isn't a better basketball game available at the moment, so while I have my reservations sending someone else to this title it's not like there's something better I can promote. Generally speaking, since I love baskebtall, I'd really like any game developer to produce a flawless title. Apparently that can't be done, so this is what we get. Will you enjoy it? Here's what I've seen:\n\nThe refs barely call charges, even when they should. They instead call blocking fouls against defenders who aren't moving. That's not how the rule works. You can, however, fall down on defense by double-tapping B. I don't know why this option exists.\n\nYour AI teammates: 1) don't recognize iso situations, so they often crowd the lane and fail to drag their defenders away from your attack. 2) don't set picks if not prompted by your controller. 3) have trouble effectively performing basic pick and roll offenses. 4) Never throw alley-oops if not prompted, and barely throw alley-oops when prompted. In a nutshell, you have to ask for everything to happen in a MyPlayer / Player Lock situation, and it's luck of the draw as to whether any of it goes down how you envision it.\n\nThe AI defense always favors your player, regardless of his position on the court, possession of the ball, skill level / ability, etc. This likely was implemented to make up for 2K13's lack of intensity, which allowed perimeter shooters to sprint side to side to nail open 3s. Consequently, you couldn't get a back door alley oop opportunity in this game even if it was possible to make your teammates perform one, because you're never forgotten by the defense. This doesn't hold true for your team when it plays defense, however, as opponent alley-oops are frequent.\n\nYour ability to perform putback dunks are nearly nonexistent. Over 100+ hours with a 7'2" Griffin/Shaq hybrid in MyPlayer mode and I have 0 putback dunks. But I have seen the AI perform them, so there's that.\n\nMy team's offensive gameplan completely ignores its best player. Real Durant is in the hunt for the MVP title. Fake Durant has trouble getting the ball, ran out of bounds while uncontested last game, is far less effective than Westbrook or even Jeremy Lamb (who?), and doesn't get nearly enough touches even though he remotely reflects his actual skill level. He has trouble scoring 20 points a game.\n\nYour player plays garbage minutes. You'd think in a game where they implemented a fast forward feature to skip games because completing a career was nearly impossible that the developers would've recognized that your all-star juggernaught doesn't need to be on the floor in a 30-point blowout in the 4th quarter. They kind of got it right, in that they sub in all the scrubs, they just forgot the most important part - to sub you out so you don't have to wade through garbage time. I'm not that desperate for stats, I don't need to dunk on rookies I can't identifty.\n\nThis is only the next title in a long stream of basketball games that gets some things right and some things wrong about basketball. The charge flaw isn't new. I can, at least in this version of the game, get to the foul line. I can't just run away from the defense for open looks. Whether it's right for you really depends on whether these flaws sound better than earlier versions' batches of flaws.","April 4, 2014","true","190.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prior to the release, tons of new features were hyped for this games, most of which remain unfulfilled - a dedicated, stable online server for online match-ups, customization of your avatar restricted to console versions when it was said otherwise and improvements to the stability of the game, to name a few. With a distinct lack of online support to go to for troubleshooting as well (For PC anyway), 2K Sports and its developers have effectively parted the fools that bought this game from their money. With broken control response mechanics, an unbalanced script for teammate AI on defense and teammate AI itself frustrating players to the point of questioning whether there is any intelligence at all. This game is, upon review, very much a beta release rather than a full release, possessing glitches and bugs that the publishers have refused to address.\n\nIt's a miss more than a hit, but I don't think 2k Sports and its affiliates care much for that. Not recommended to the smart buyer.","December 28, 2013","false","439.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sorry EA but your game s*** B*lls\n\nSo yeah if you want to play good ball buy this game.. Roster is updated all year long (of course stop updating when the next game comes out but you might still be able to find the roster in downloadable content online) The gameplay is pretty easy to start with,, u will be able to take control of any team and play right away. If you want to get better at it there is tutorial with NBA Legends to help you master dribbling skills, shots, play calling, and post move.\n\nFranchise mode allows you to play a complete dynasty by drafting a team or by taking control of an already existing team. Fight your way to the playoffs and afterward you will have to use your scout skills to recrut the best rookies available for your team. There is much more waiting for you in this mode.\n\nUnfortunatly 2K cancelled all of the all star week end, except the all star game. So if you're lucky enough to get a early access pass you might have the chance of getting access to the all star week end.. Otherwise, you will have to play old nba games to do a slam dunk contest, and 3 pts shooting contest.\n\nOverall :\n7-8/10 because it is an awesome basketball games and not a 9 or a 10 since they took of one of the most cool thing available , i.e. doing slam dunk contest with MJ against, Erving, Wilkins and Webbs.\n\nSoz for my english","June 20, 2014","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you have no interest in basketball, it's a very good game.\n\nHowever the people who sell the game have decided to charge more to play the game if you live outside the us than if you live inside. Have no doubt, basketball is a US orientated sport yet they've chosen to charge everyone else a premium for this game, last time I checked 1.5X as much.\n\nTo me this game is absolutely worth every penny (that's a British term btw) but then I already played a stupid amount of time on 2k12 and more than got my money's worth out of that.\n\nAll in all if you aren't American and aren't that interested in the latest rosters etc, don't buy this game. Do buy 2k12. They don't charge you extra just for being from a non basketball country and it's hlaf the price and 95% as good.\n\nIf you are american and/or a basketball fan then by all means get the latest version.","June 21, 2014","true","82.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
