The series as a whole Is wonderfully amazing, almost endless possiabilties, its own lore, challenging bosses, limitless followers if you spend points in shapping. Eahc game seperatly however is quite a diffrent story. Like any gamer I have ones I like and ones I wouldn't be to upset If I never got to play again. Lets start with the first 1; Very involving, you can get attached to your first creature if your not careful, the story is awesome, I recomend reading anything you find for back story, and always avoid anything you don't think you can take. The second on; It's not the best geneforge game but its not the worst in my opinion, didn't play much of it but what I did play I didn't care too much for. The third, By far my second favorite one, I could go on and on about everything I loved in it. The 4th could care less if I was unable to play, Its good and leads you up to the 5th but its  tedious and irrating at the best. The 5th is the best in my opinion. Great graphics, new montsers, new creature to shap, wide ammount of areas to explore, many differnt paths to chose, my only probelm with it are the plants that stun you and the white beasts in the middle of the map. Back to the series as a whole, my only 3 issues with it are 1.) Turn based combat annoys me now adays hard for a game to impress me with turn based combat. 2.) Oppenets having laser sight and can see you even behind them quite annoying had to redo missions a lot. 3.) While albeit an old game I would love voice acting. It would just add so much more to the games. In all the geneforge saga is one of if not the best game series' I have ever played in my life.","December 25, 2013","true","26.0"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","45","51","0","0"

Difficulty in torment is legit and with 5 main factions and a myriad of choices, lots of replay value.\n\nGameplay is not simply just about slaughtering everything in your path - stealth and non-combat skills will be needed to clear the game.\n\nMonsters don't respawn which means that your experience is limited (in particular, your minions get xp when you get xp); but this is only an important factor (getting minions early means they can level up more by the end game and are thus stronger than 'fresher' ones) in the harder difficulties.\n\nTwo minor complaints:\n1.) I can't move the screen easily (arrow keys only) since you're usually clicking with your mouse to move the party and its awkward to have the left hand on the arrow keys to move the screen around\n2.) A 'solo' style is virtually impossible on the harder difficulties (even with all your points in solo stuff like spells and stats rather than creations)\n\nAwesome game, and great bang for the buck!","June 24, 2014","true","41.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

It's every bit as good as the late 1990s infinity engine classics from which it draws its inspiration (in fact, it even rivals my beloved "Fallout 2" on many levels).\n\nThe gameplay, plot, and writing are all top notch, but its biggest success is how it handles choice and consequences. There are 5 separate factions, each with their own political and moral opinions, quests, storylines, and endings. Every choice you make in the game affects how these factions view you, which makes political maneuvering a dimension of gameplay every bit as important as outright combat. Playing the various factions off of each other, allying with them, or betraying them, is endlessly entertaining and there are very few games which balance open world freedom of choice with complexity of plot as well as this one.\n\nAn awesome end to one of the best RPG series ever.  If you only play one game in the Geneforge series it should be this one.\n","July 27, 2012","true","94.5"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

I love spiderweb's games.  It is a turn based rpg, multiple endings and quests are pretty much up to you which ones you take or refuse. You also get a choice of which group to help or even leave one -once you join. It might seem simple but its actually very chalanging. You cant just hack and slash you way throught the battles. You need to use stratigy. Also alot of choices of what class to play and skills to invest in and stats also. The world is huge. The story line is well thought out but not confusing. The game plays well. No glitches, lag, crashes or freezes.

But most of the important characters know who you are... and none of them will tell you out of the kindness of their hearts. All of them will exploit you and profit of the actions of the 'mysterious stranger'.

Why?\nThe narrative is good, the freedom is back.

Complicated concepts are generally very difficult to convey with simple graphics. It just feels like a slightly updated version of the previous 4. This would be spectacular if it was released in 2002 or before perhaps. I would like to point out that 4 years before this, Half-life 2 was released, which by today's standards has acceptable graphics. I understand that graphics aren't everything, but some people will find this not making sense if they have an IQ of 100-. I don't personally, but I am just trying to point this out. Also the UI was very glitch-filled for me. Movement seemed clunky, and objects were difficult to tell apart. Also generic plot pls. This game in its nature is like Counter-strike Condition zero. It was difficult to tell friend from foe, and where you were supposed to go and what you were supposed to do there. More on, I couldn't tell how to do what I was supposed to do. Idk man this game sort of feels like a fetish, most people wouldn't like it, but the few people who actually really look into it appreciate it more. Btw I mentioned I didn't have 20 minutes, it was something along the lines of 7 or 8 hours. Maybe you have to completely play the previous 4? Maybe you have to put in 100 hours? I don’t know but, it seemed too boring and illogical, so I stopped playing and went back to Duck game and CSGO (until r8 pls.) Feel free to object in comments. It just occurred to me that I wrote a small essay reviewing a game when I have an actual essay due tomorrow. At this point I wrote more in this review than I have on my essay I've been working on for days now.  Lol, and this took me like 3 min.
