I'd recommend playing it for longer than 20 minutes before leaving a scathing review.\n\nThis is a great game. If you ever wanted to play a management game a la Footy Sim but dont give a s**t about sports, then this is the game for you. I mean, it's not nearly as in-depth as sports management games, but it doesn't need to be. It's got the right amount of everything.\n\nIf you are a huge fantasy nerd, (like me) and want a change of pace from your standard RPG, pick this up!","September 1, 2015","true","5.7"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","40","51","4","1"

The developer has made a lot of positive changes over the last few days - you can tell he's really put some time in, and he is clearly listening to the community and implementing suggestions.\n\nIt's still not Baldur's Gate or OOTP, but I think Redemption is at a point now where it's worth $3.99.  My impression is that the dev is going to be improving this for a while longer yet.\n\nI'll keep my original review below so it is still on record, but this applies to the original version that I bought on the release date.\n\n****************************************************************************************************************\n\nFor the first five minutes, it looks like this game is going to be great. You review the different characters you can hire, and they have detailed looking descriptions like, 'Derp of Derpville tends to make bad decisions under pressure'.\n\nAnd then you get to the actual gameplay and there's nothing there at all. You don't directly control the party during the quests, which is fine, but you don't get anything that bonds you to the characters which is really what this game should be about. There's a handful of attributes for each character, but no individual stats or personality to them.  I've just spent over an hour playing, and I can't tell you the name of any one of my characters.\n\nAnd that bit of detail in my first paragraph about someone not handling pressure? You can't see that, or anything like that, having an effect on the game mechanics at all. Same with morale.\n\nPeople are saying that this is like an OOTP Baseball for fantasy role playing. Well, I've been playing OOTP for 13 years and games like it for much longer than that. And no... it's not like OOTP in the least. It has very vague aspirations in that direction but it's far too simplistic. It's more like a very basic mobile game that's been converted to PC. You will see everything that this game has to offer in the first 10-15 minutes of play. The artwork is fairly nice, but that doesn't mean anything in games like this.\n\nI hope the devs continue to add depth to this game because the concept is good. But until then I can't recommend it even at this really cheap price.","August 30, 2015","true","8.3"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","3"

You can heal and train your characters in between quests. You get to make decisions while on a quest: Which path of two are you going to take? Do we enter the ruins or not? Who will go on the quest?\n\nIt's quite simple and entertaining, with a nice, narrating touch to it. The music adds to this storytelling atmosphere.\nIt's like a roleplaying book in its game flow.\n\nThe game in its current form entertained me quite a while, trying out specializations and strategies - it helps if you like numbers, though, and keep track of your characters.\n\nThe author so far makes regular updates and there is still much which can be expanded and filled with some flesh in this game. Also, access to character information in all screens would help the game, as you wont need a "cheat sheet" with your characters next to you while playing.\n\nBut all in all it's a pleasurable experience. Casual, fun and ideal if you have your head full with other things: Then it will relax and entertain very effectively.\n\nI'd buy it again, no doubt, for its full price.

You just pick from a list of samey characters with different stats that don't really affect much. You send them on quests on a little map thingy with a couple options then it tells you what happened. Even the most challenging options are easily doable on starting chars. There is no inventory or equipment management, all the loot you find with the special names are just fluff for the number of gold pieces you get - which there really isn't a use for other than training and hiring guys, but I don't see the point of that given the starting guys don't seem to have a problem taking on the most challenging places. The most complex thing that happened was a random event where a character got pissy with me and left because he was upset, which was apparently because I kept sending them against challenging places (despite them winning and coming back with great loot every time) and another guy got "injured" which simply meant he was off the team for a little while. I bought it from a Groupees bundle, where it had the following description:\n\n"Redemption: Eternal Quest is a unique and challenging RPG/Sim where you manage a group of adventurers, guiding them through thrilling quests and collecting treasure and relics. The difference with this game is you step into the role of managing these warriors, healing them, schooling them, making key decisions and watching them grow into legendary heroes.\n\nIt combines roster/resource management with RPG sensibilities, with a completely random world generated every game and even every turn! Explore Ruins, Dungeons, open treasure chests, fulfill Grand Quests, and engage in combat with a unique card-based system. Use the Prestige from your discoveries to drive your party to even greater heights. "\n\nThat description sounds like an awesome, in depth game. Nowhere did it say anything about it being a soulless casual game with absolutely no depth and no gameplay to be had. Kudos for them saying it was casual on Steam, but they sure tricked me with their previous description. In the future if I buy from groupees I'm just going to cheap out and pay $1 and give more if any of the games are worth a dime.\n\nIf you like shallow, casual, mindless games this might be just what you're looking for - but otherwise get yourself a double cheeseburger from McDonald's, it's cheaper and it'll last you longer.\n\n-edit- 10/15/15: Apparently my issue with the game being too easy for starting chars to storm through the toughest events has been somewhat addressed by making the starting characters get injured more.\n\nAlso, I was wrong to base my review on the description that Groupees had and the dev called me out on that, so I went and found where Groupees got their description. The game's Greenlight page, written by the developer. Not sure why he's upset over me basing the game on a copy paste of what he or his team wrote, but I am sorry I bought a game and expected it to be like it was described on the page I bought it from. I should have looked up the longer description on Greenlight... and been even more disappointed.","August 31, 2015","false","0.6"," 37 of 55 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","37","55","5","6"

If you like it, more power to ya, but for me this game is a complete waste of time and money. Here are my major gripes:\n\nPacts: For gods sake, how about a pop-up or notification when a pact expires; you know, like a big red flashing thing. This is important. Sure, you can figure it out from the character screen by noticing that there are zero days left, but instead of doing it that way, have big bold red letters that say "NO PACT!" Who knows, if a pact ends, you might even have the game ask if you want to extend the pact and take them to the screen to do it if they say yes.\n\nInterface: the interface is dated and clunky. Quitting the game gives me a a standard Windows confimation box with a Windows ding instead of a custom one. Makes me feel like I've just crashed the program instead of tried to exit.\n\nStats: What do stats do? As far as I can tell, they do nothing because there is no indicator when something happens if your stats helped/hurt you. How about giving me some target numbers and die rolls to show the stats actually at work. Anything less might as well mean you threw random numbers at me at the beginning of the game and never use them again.\n\nCombat: This is the worst offender. Combat is sheer luck. I might as well be flipping coins or playing rock/scissors/paper. How do I know what morale might be before combat. THat sure seems random. How do I know anything about how terrain might affect combat aside from a wag. (If you don't know what a wag is, the "g" stands for guess). The cards then are not really important since you don't even have a rough idea of what the random modifier may be. While it might make for a crushingly boring game, don't give the player any combat choices, because his choices are really meaningless and completely overshadowed by the randomness. That would be better than giving a player the false sense that there is some actual strategy involved.","February 23","false","2.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

The current goal is to "not-go-broke".\nIt's primarily a text game with many interaction screen to make dicisions for the Guildmembers as random events occur both in the world and with individual guildsmen.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone... however if you are interested in managment games (which can be modded), this would likely fit your needs for a casual Fantasy sim.\nThe power of Grey Dog games is the ability to mod their games with content... their MMA and Wrestling games have long community endurance due to the players being able to insert their own home-made mods, including actual UFC and WWE Pics and "stats".\nThere should be no reason that any person could take this game and add in their own pic/stats from say...

With this considered, this is a very good game if you like casual text and statistic based adventures in a high fantasy setting. This clearly won't appeal to all, but it definitely does to me as I like fantasy settings, detailed stats and management and reading stories and seeing random results based on my management.\n\nAdvice - Play this game once through for an hour to get stuck in.  Then start the game again, play through and read every '?' help bubble going.  After one hour you'll know if you like it to keep or want a refund.\n\nPositives:\n- You select 6 heroes to manage, each with unique abilities /100. You have to choose carefully what to do with them - rest them to heal or pay for healing? Send them on a quest, or send them to training? Choices will have a decision on morale.  You also have to choose who to hire again for another season of adventuring, and who to fire.\n- The quests can go different ways. Either you just get a story reported back, you enter a card game driven battle (simple mechanics of pick 1<3 support cards to play), you get to choose a path to take, whether to open a chest or not, and in some cases this game turns into the TV show 'Strike It Lucky' - choose 'Top, Middle or Bottom' across 3 colums, and try to avoid the 'Hot Spot' aka Trap.  The other two options are treasure or very tough monsters to fight.\n- I found myself thinking 'Just one more turn...' (i.e. Adventure).  Always good in a game, the addictiveness.\n\nImprovements required:\n- The developer is active in this game so look forward to more community aided improvements that may hopefully increase variety of encounters.\n- Could do with Steam achievements and Trading cards, but for the money I pay, it's still excellent value.  Achievements would be a no. 1 improvement for me.\n- If you're not into text and numerical games, and like top end graphics and real time action, avoid this game.  This game after all is around a 50MB download!  You have to imagine in your mind what's going on sometimes and how it would play out, something sadly lacking today in a lot of games.\n- May get a little repetitive, but again, it's cheap and good for a good few hours of play here and there.\n- There is no tutorial or manual, but you don't need one as its all explained within the interface.  As a positive: The interface is actually simple, well thought out, unlike the UI of a lot of games these days. This ones actually intuitive and useful, everything where you want it to be.\n\nBuy it - it's good value entertainment for fantasy and management fans! A very niche market, but good for those who enjoy the niche.  I suspect a lot of negative reviews are from people who don't like that niche or appreciate what the game is attempting to deliver. You need to 'get' this game and what it's about to appreciate it.","January 24","true","2.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The focus is on signing up a team of six adventurers from an available pool with an eye towards optimizing your cost-benefit differential and maximizing profits. You select quests from an available menu that grades the encounters as to potential danger and potential profits.\n\nThe audio and visual elements are minimalist and your fun factor is almost entirely dependent on how much you enjoy resource management in a Tolkienesque world.

It was a continual loss of gold, with very little gains.\n*You contract your adventurers for 1-4 years. Each quest is a season long, four quests equal 1 year.  At the end of their contract you have to pay for them again or contract a fresh adventure.

(yeah that is fun, instead of character progression, every quest my adventurers suck more)\n\nThere are more reasons not to play this game but I am too frustrated to list them all.  I would give this game another try if they update content to make it fun and rewarding.","February 6","false","0.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is a fantasy adventure SIMULATOR, not an RPG. It relies mostly on random generated algorithms, similiar to SimProse Studios's other text games. The programmer's main goal was to design an adventure management simulator. This dream has been relealized with pacts (contract negociations).\n\nI have played an earlier version of this game, called Arcadia. Redemption is more complete and has more options and features.\n\nI still would like a pact expiration notice, perhaps a low funds warning, monster card values revealed (at least a range or maybe one card), numbers seem too random, a better end game screen if you lose, adventurer stats probably need to be slimmed down to a handful, and salaries usually just keep increasing. The good news is there are options to turn off settings now for different game experience.\n\nAll that said, if you like text games and old school themes, you will like this. There is a lot of fantasy flavor text and tropes we are all familiar. DnD fans should like it.","March 31","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Grab it if you feel ocnfident the devs will continue to work on it and if it's cheap; could be a good surprise in a few months.\n\nThe overall concept is quite good, but it's somehow confusing. You manage a party of adventurers, then send out only one team to a single quest per "season"; then the adventurers face some evil foes and engage in a...pokemon/card combat where you have "minions" (monsters of your own) that fight the enemies...I was expecting to see my warriors facing the monsters.\n\nFor a type of game that is basically a UI (a managing game), the UI is poor; needs more work, time and visual feedback as better floating textes, highlight buttons, better fonts (and pop-up screens). A back button would be handy, specially in the screen where you select the warriors you send (if you prompt me with a text saying that this action ends the turn, you should allow me to go back). And please, make a custom Save and Exit screen, generic Windows alert screens are not cool.\n\nThings that should be improved:\n- More responsive UI\n- Less text, or better placed\n- Text fonts\n- Better help screens and floating texts.\n- Allow for adventurers name customization.\n\nI paid little for this game, so I'm not disappointed but I'd like to see how far this game can get.","October 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","3"

It's there, don't get me wrong, but you mostly just send them out and then decide who heals or trains.
