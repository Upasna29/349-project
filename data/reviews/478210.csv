"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/recommended/478210/","Azralynn","Azralynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azralynn/","472 products in account","BUDDY is a puzzle platforming adventure that at first glance reminded me of other similar games like Limbo or Albert & Otto, which I generally enjoy.\n\nCheck out my Quick First Impressions here: https://youtu.be/2Z20gDYB_zg\nOk, you are probably wondering why this is a first impressions video instead of my usual review, but after an hour of trying to play, I felt that I had to refund this game. It’s actually the first time I have ever refunded anything on Steam. So, I am sorry for this being a first impression, but I felt I needed to post this anyway.\n\nThe graphics portray the game as an old filmstrip type of movie, which was nice, but I could have done without the black splotches popping up all the time. I really like the art style, and colour pallet that the game uses, and the story sounds interesting, but don’t be fooled by how nice the game looks, it seems like a very early access version right now, and has quite a few issues!\n\nWhen I first launched the game, Avast for some reason flagged and deleted the executable for BUDDY, and I had to re-verify the game through Steam and disable Avast to launch it. That wasn’t a huge deal since false positives happen, but still, it was an inconvenience. Yes, I know Avast isn't that great, but this is the first time it has ever deleted ANY of my Steam games. My reasons for refunding though are due to the gameplay issues. There are multiple bugs and glitches I experienced, and the controls are horrible.\n\nAbout the controls, for keyboard you use ASD and arrow keys, but neither W or spacebar work for jumping. You HAVE to use the arrow keys. To interact with objects, only left control button works, and not the right control. There is no way to change any game settings or keybindings at all. Using the keyboard was horribly clunky feeling to use, so I tried a Steam controller, and while it does work much better, you will have to use a special customization unless you like jumping with Y for some strange reason…\n\nPoor controls aside, the actual jumping is so painfully slow. In a few parts so far, you have to do things quickly, so there is a bit of pressure on timing.\n\nPros:very good art style, and colour pallet that the game uses (reminds me of Limbo and Albert & Otto)\naudio is good, and the ambiance, and sound effects are well suited to the game (for what I did play)\nCons:black splotches popping up all the time was a bit distracting\ngame is way too slow paced, there were several times where you walk or push something for a long time without anything happening at all\nhorrible controls (for both keyboard and controller), and the game never tells you what the binds are, and there are no way to see or change them\nthe actual jumping is so painfully slow, and there’s no reason that jumping should be THAT MUCH slower than walking...\nbug where you can move a box around without even touching it\nbug where you are glitched and walking on air to move the box\ndying to monsters that never actually touched you\nbug that teleports you to a different area, forcing you to exit and reload\nSo yea, BUDDY is a $15 full release game, and while the audio and visuals are great, there are too many other issues that need to be addressed.\n\nAgain guys, I’m sorry about the first impression rant here, and I was really hoping to do a full review, but uhh, I just couldn’t continue playing.\n\nUPDATE: The developer has contacted me to inform me that there has been an update to fix some of the bugs. However, I can neither confirm nor deny this. (More information)","May 27","false","1.1"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","35","50","2","1"

And the conroles are bad, WASD, exept W and SPACE don't work so you have to use the arrow keys. And the checkpoints could be better.\n\nAs I said, I REALLY like the concept and it has potential to be a great game, just not at the moment. :/","May 27","false","0.3"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

I passed many puzzles and when I died, the check point suddenly changed and I had to start from the begining of the stage. I don't konw if that was a glitch or not. In general, the game can't be played and the developers should fix these issues. Without fixing, it is impossible to complete this game.","May 27","false","1.7"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"
