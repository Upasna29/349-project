Really, they are. You just have to remember their place. Because if you want to beat the game, you have to know your path through every level.\n\nMusic isn't annoying, graphics are ok. So why am I still stuck in level 3? Because I've no real skill. That's what the hardcore gamers will tell me. But... it's not a question of skills. It's a question of remembering the enemies. To see the enemy's bullet through explosions. And mainly, I'm under the impression that when you have to go to the left, you're slower.\n\nAnd the bosses? It's up to you to learn how to avoid their bullets. So, no, it's not a question of skill. It's a question of patience and remembering.\n\nStill, the game is perhaps short. But a save system (or a credit one) would have spared many many players the frustration that basically, they're killed in level 5?

To live up to that mighty 15 minutes means surviving, playing levels multiple times until every enemy is memorized.  No checkpoints, no continues, means doing it all over each time.  The game does alot of great things real well and other bad things are real bad.  The good is the gameplay is right away, no waiting, no load times, no story, or push this button to continue, and that is awesome.  When death occurs no waiting, no checkpoint just right back in the action.  The bad is the music which might sound good if at a better quality, sounds like its playing through a tin can.  The enemies are interesting looking but seeing their shots is very difficult which is what requires mastering, less being able to see the shots but memorizing where those shots go.  When you die the explosion is pretty awesome as in old school atari 2600 awesomeness making it hard to get overly mad when dying except when out of lives :P\n\nTiamat X is a quirky entry in the side shooter genre.  This game is like a moving puzzle.  Its like the memory game with cards except with lazers shooting everywhere.  Being that its a moving puzzle game with the same enemies in the same spots it means lots of replaying to memorize their patterns.  The challenge is based less in the game itself having no difficulty level and more against yourself since only your own memorization, discipline, and focus will lead you to victory!\n\nNot sure who the target is for this game, puzzle fans?  Side shooter fans?  For the niche group who always wnted a puzzle shooting side scroller this game will challenge their abilities to the point of being a ninja.  Few games made ever require skill from the player where mastering the game truly feels rewarding but Tiamat X pulls it off for the low-low price of 2$.  People who dont like memorizing or puzzles will not like the game since without the memorization part which makes the game a moving puzzle they will just curse at the screen and uninstall the game.  Fun game to challenge friends when visiting who call themselves "pro gamers", only to watch them writhe in agony xDDD\n\nBridgetips:\n*Each stage has a 1-up so grab those to sore to victory!  Level 6 has 2 one ups.\n*Dont blow up your power ups or one ups!\n*All powerups stack like missiles and fireball, gotta catch em all!\n*Level 3 underwater grab the 4-way shot, this is very useful in later levels\n*Level 4 in the missile alley sections with snails on top and bottom pick top or bottom to survive, not both.\n*Level 5 caves, get the all way firing powerup, its cruise control for killing.\n*achev hunter tips:\nLevel 1 is best for firing minimum shots just dodge all enemies go to boss get close, stay below gun.\nLevel 6 is best for kill all enemies with powerup from level 5.\n\nRating:  7/10  Value:  $1.99","May 30, 2015","true","4.6"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","26","43","3","0"

Tiamat X is an old-school style shumup. The evil Choazid Empire has launched a surprise attack on your homeworld, establishing a heavily fortified base from where their forward assault group burrows deep underground, capturing subterranean lifeforms and transforming them into vicious biomechs.\n\nWith it being only a matter of time before the Choazids start converting your people, it's up to you to take the controls of one of the few remaining Tiamat dragonship prototypes: the X class fighter, a craft capable of immense firepower - provided you pick up enough upgrade caches during a mission where you must dodge and blast like there's no tomorrow.\n\nFeaturing six levels of intense shooting action, Tiamat X is a rip-snortin tribute to the side-scrolling shooters of yesteryear, and would be right at home blazing away on the screen of a booming, beer-stained arcade cabinet. As such, your PC will have to do, and it is much to the designer's regret that he can't plumb a coin-slot into his rig for that truly authentic seaside amusement-park experience.","July 1, 2015","true","0.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

This is late 80ies / early 90ies homecomputer-euro-shmup kinds of bad.\n\nWhen an arcade game has no notable introduction/attract mode to get you fired up, and no options except choosing auto/turbo-fire on/off you know you are in for a ride. Not.\n\nGameplay is as barebones as it can get, no "systems" of note. No score-multipliers. Power-ups will spawn at a fixed position per level AND CAN BE SHOT (dumbest idea ever). Enemy patterns consist of flying at you, and occasionally shooting. There is little variety. Boss enemies do the same, but the shooting-frequency gets absurdly high towards the end of the game.\n\nEverything just kind of floats through space, there are almost no animations to speak of. Eventhough the game is super-static, it runs at something like 20 frames per second - feeling that extra bit of sluggish you do not wish for in a shmup. Bullets and especially missiles blend into the backgrounds 80% of the time, which turns an unpleasant experience into something unfair and frustrating. To top it all off, the final stages have routes that lead into dead ends and loss of extralives - and there is no way to avoid that ♥♥♥♥ if you don't know it or get lucky the first time around. Oh, and of course you only get a bunch of extra-lives, run out of those - it's instant game over. No credits or continues. So, you better be enjoying playing through those incredibly dull first stages again and again. But wait, there is a problem there - because playing this game is neither enjoyable nor rewarding. Might turn replaying those first levels into a bit of a drag.\n\nSeriously though, absolutely terrible piece of software. Pretty much every other shmup on Steam does a better job at shmupping than this (try Satazius if you want a great, classic horizontal shmup, for example). Do avoid Tiamat X at all costs.","June 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

But honestly its not bad, runs smoothly on my rig, have a hard time thinking this could be hard on any modern rig in the last 10 years.

It's a fun arcade space shooter.  The graphics are nice and crisp, the controls are simple.  Though, I do recommend using a controller.  There's not much to the game, but then you really don't expect there to be a lot to it due to the type of game.  The download is really small, something like a little over 100 MB for Windows and 43 MB for Linux.  It runs great on my piece of crap laptop with the 1 GHz dual core, 3GB RAM and some crappy AMD APU running Peppermint Linux.  So, you don't need a lot of computer to run it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoopx/recommended/343340/","thecoopx","TheCoopX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecoopx/","688 products in account","First, let me say I've been playing the DRM-free version since 5-23-2015, plus the 1.4 hours with the Steam one. So don't let that 1.4 hours mislead you into thinking I've barely played the game.\n\nWith the visuals, the CGI rendering technique that was used offers up plenty of colors used for the shading and detail in the backgrounds and the individual sprites. There are multiple layers of parallax scrolling that give the backgrounds some nice depth, and for the most part, the animation is pretty fluid. The designs for the bosses and ships are a mix, with some that look a bit generic, to others that are nice looking with some interesting traits. Either way, it's clear that the artist behind the graphics put some real effort into their work. However, there are some spots that really feel like someone slacked off. The explosions for one, look out of place and cheap. They don't match the rest of the visuals at all, and truly look like a generic effect that came prepackaged with some kind of software (Game Maker perhaps?).\n\nThe graphics also have an unfortunate amount of copy-pasting going on. The very first level features constantly repeating lines of ships in the background, as if you're flying through a parking lot. It's literally the exact same ship over and over and over, both up close and farther away. Other levels suffer from this same issue (stage 2's buildings, stage 3's crashed underwater ship, etc.), which results in a cheap look being given to the game, despite the quality of the images themselves. Factor in other issues like how your ship snaps back to its side view when you stop moving vertically, and visibility issues (the missiles fired from the little R-Type looking pod walkers, enemies/shots being hidden in explosions, etc.), and it's a game that tries to look really snazzy, but stumbles at times some keys areas.\n\nWith the sound, there's not much to get excited about. The music is incredibly minimal and very muffled. There are maybe three instruments going at once, and most of the time, the only instrument you can really hear in-game is a strings-like one. Now I say “in-game,” because if you play the ogg vorbis tracks on their own and turn them up, you can hear faint instruments behind those strings; instruments that at times sound out of tempo thanks to an echo effect that was put on them (this is the drums and timpani, namely). But they're so muffled and quiet that they may as well not be there. This makes the compositions empty feeling and leaves them offering nothing to support the action happening on-screen. Factor in that the compositions themselves aren't overly noteworthy, and it's a glaring hole in the game's presentation.\n\nThe sound effects fair a little better, but not by much. The shots being fired do their job without offending your ears, while enemy shots and missiles do the same thing. As such, those effects work well. But, there's a problem. The sound effects for things like explosions, ships flying onto the screen, missiles being fired... they all have a fair bit of rumble and bass in them. And when you have a bunch of enemies that fly in and get killed at the same time, they all play those bassy effects together. The end result is a too-loud, distorted and crackling mess of sound due to the same kinds of noises being layered over each other. So yeah, the game's aural qualities leave a fair bit to be desired, and don't stack up well against its visuals.\n\nThe gameplay is straight-forward stuff. You get powerups, you fight bosses at the end of the levels, you blow up ships during the levels... you all know the drill by now. The hit detection is pretty good, and the enemy patterns came at you from all sides as you progress through the levels. You also get a number of powerups that range from missiles and bombs, to fireballs and multi-directional lasers. These also stack up, so if you do well enough, you can have quite the bit of firepower at your disposal. However, this game throws a few unwanted wrinkles into the mix.\n\nFirst, and perhaps most annoying, is that you rarely see a powerup more than once. The forward-angled side shot? Once. The up+down+back shot? Once. The seven way shot? The fireball? The enhanced electrical ball that passes through things? The bomb? All once. The only powerups you see more than one time are the missiles and the various extra life types (a 1up and a star that appears to give you three lives). So if you miss your powerup, it's gone forever. And if you blow it up...\n\nWait. Did I just say "blow it up"? Yes, I did. You can blow up your powerups. They can take a few hits, but if you're firing away at a slew of enemies and you're not paying attention when that powerup appears in front of you, it can and will explode if you hit it more than a few times. That someone thought exploding powerups was a good idea to implement, truly baffles me. That such an idea was coupled with how most powerups only show up once, makes for a maddening setup that defies logic. If it was done as a means to be different, then bravo. It's different alright. It's also an absolutely horrid idea that should have been replaced before it ever got programmed. Granted, when you die, you still get to keep your powerups. But that doesn't offset the ludicrousness of it all.\n\nLastly, the bosses in this game are pretty unremarkable when it comes to their battles. They're good design-wise, most of them animate when they fire, and they all start smoking as they get damaged. So visually, they look fine and had some nice touches added to them. But their fire patterns are simple and easily dodged, with most of the bosses simply moving up and down on the other side of the screen. It's only the last two bosses that actually start really moving around the screen more, making for some pretty dull encounters with the other four. This dullness isn't helped at all with how two-thirds of the six bosses can be easily beaten due to the huge safe spots in their simple laser patterns, or because of your being able to destroy what they're shooting at you. Sure, the last three bosses have a kind of “hyper mode” they go into when they're half dead, which then increases the intensity of their attack. But even then, those attacks are usually handled with little trouble. Frankly, only the final boss gives you a real challenge with what it does. So really, the bosses are pretty basic as all they do is shoot. No ramming, no arms to grab at you... they just shoot, and shoot easily avoided stuff at that.\n\nIn the end, what can be said about Tiamat X? It tries, I'll give it that. At times, the visuals are quite nice, the controls feel pretty solid, the hit detection's alright for the most part, and at six stages, you'll likely get your $1.99's worth. But the game's got issues. Various visual and audio problems, iffy and muffled music, little in the way of options to tinker with, no difficulty selection, over half of the game offering little to no real challenge, utterly bizarre choices for how the powerups are handled... all of this really hurts this game. The game's length doesn't help either, as it can be beaten in under 15 minutes.\n\nIs the game busted? No. It's quite playable, though I do keep having it crash on me when I try to send my high score to the global tables with the DRM-free version that can be bought elsewhere. But it has some rather glaring flaws that really should have been addressed before this thing went live on Steam. I feel that it was a missed opportunity to spruce it up a bit for a new and wider audience. So to me, the game's a generally nice looking, but very average quality shmup whose main saving grace is its low price. And it's a game that, quite frankly, BBQ Games should have kept cooking on the grill a bit longer before they served it to everyone.\n\nScore- 5.1 out of 10\n\nFinally, here's a playthrough I recorded, if you want to see the game in action...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn2wubNGZfg","May 30, 2015","true","6.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

It starts off a bit on the slow, but makes up for it later. The game is still in a early form as of this review, and lacks the ability to change resolution as far as I can tell (or tweak settings beyond auto fire or color Blind). For $1.79 it's a great steam addition fun little game for the price, just so long as you go into it expecting a R-Type clone. Clearily this is still in a WIP, so hopefully the Ship speed will be increased, some enemies made more agressive, the overall pace of the game speedup a bit, some deserving non-generic back ground music added, a few more powerups, a more forgiving continue system, and more graphic options become availiable later - and perhaps the keyboard controls could use a remapping option.

Repeating the earlier sections gets tedious fast.\n\nFull controller support and the option to customise autofire options is a redeeming factor.","June 26, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, this game is dated.  I may have played a similar game on Windows 95/98.  Controls aren't as tight as some side scrollers.  Power ups aren't random.  They appear magically on the same spot of each screen.  Spreader weapon is achieved about 30 seconds in the game.  You don't lose the spreader upon death, which is nice.  Lack of speed control is a nuisance.  You can miss a target just by advancing in the screen too fast??  Ugh!  That would be okay if you didn't die by being in proximity of an enemy and not an actual collision!  I'm sure I'll play it again, just because it has native controller support.  But find it hard to replay back to back since the patterns are the same.  So many other better Shumps out there.  Luckily I picked up on sale for $1.49.  Is it worth $1.49, probably not until I advance further.","June 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I was wrong.\n\nThe only thing you can do in this game is to run through the exact same handful of levels over and over again, and those levels are the exact same every single time. You can't even decide to replay your favorite levels, you have to redo everything from the start every time. It gets real boring real fast. There's nothing new and very little to do.\n\nStay away.","June 2, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I've been exploded a few times now by shots that I'd have sworn I was out of the way/range of.\n\nSeems okay otherwise... just generic space shooter #3021 or something.

Though it is relatively cheap, it's also relatively mediocre, and the keyboard ghosting issue can worsen the deal further. Given that shmups are a popular genre on Steam I'd recommend players dish out a little more and get something a bit more innovative - check out Pixel Star on Steam.\n\nRead the full review of this title and more at Budget Gaming Review!\nhttp://budgetgaming.blogspot.ca/2015/06/tiamat-x.html","June 26, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The game is difficult, the controlls are OK and there's an option to turn on 'auto shoot' but the enemies are harder if you use that option.\n\nThe graphics are not pretty to say the least and you often can't see incoming bullets. Some of the enemy designs aren't that bad.\n\nThe sounds in-game are just regular space shooting sounds but the worst is probably the music, which sounds like it has a bitrate of 128kpbs or less.\n\nOverall, Tiamat X is probably one of the worst games in the genre. The only good thing about it is the price but even then it's probably not worth it.\n","May 29, 2015","false","8.1"," 45 of 96 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","45","96","0","12"
