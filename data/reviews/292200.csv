A lot of good memories are evoked in this game: the dress style of the characters is a fantastical blend of classical 18th century stiff frocks to a 1930s flapper style, the music is scratchy like an old record and hovers just at the edge of your perception. And I really appreciate well-written characters, subtle storytelling and good voice work: every character was charming and unique to me, and helping them out advanced their one-sided story a little further.\n\nCons: The game is unforgiving if you burn all your money buying plants instead of breeding them, accepting orders you don't have the energy or money to fulfill, or buying upgrades too early in the game. The 'tutorial' day feels tedious, but it takes two minutes to speed-click through everything. It's also extremely short: a skilled gamer can chew this up in an hour, but the quick end (and super-low price - I bought this at 4 CAD) prevents the game from feeling tedious and worth the money.\n\nAlso, I'd shoot the marketer who said "crazy" was a good descriptor for this game.\n\n* Edited after completing the game.","August 4, 2014","true","3.4"," 70 of 76 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","70","76","0","0"

The key is trying to offer your customers the most combinations of plants using the least amount of breeding stock (pedestal space in your store) and mating attempts (energy). It's a fun little casual game that is challenging enough to keep you coming back for more, but not terribly difficult or stressful.\n\nThe game uses scientific concepts and terminology, and features the use of Punnett square diagrams to determine the traits of the plants you are breeding to fill customer requests. It would be a great game for kids taking biology classes for the first time, but I think it's still pretty entertaining even for adults who are familiar with the science involved.\n\nThe artwork is cute, and the plants are interesting and varied. The music's appropriate, but the voice acting is pretty cheesy and gets repetitive and grating after a while.","August 9, 2014","true","8.0"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","36","38","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/292200/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nWell, damn, I am learning while playing a video game...Crazy Plant Shop is a game based around the idea of breeding and growing plants to tell to your customers in your "Crazy Plant Shop". This game is actually used in school based environments because of the benefits and information it provides for teaching.\n\nEssentially you get a customer who has a request for a certain plant. You then have to either purchase the plant out right from the plant catalog or you can breed the plant with your Super breeding machine "out back". When using the breeding machine you have to take into consideration dominant genes and recessive genes, as well as different genotypes and phenotypes combinations. While doing this you also use the Punnet squares, something which I have not seen since my secondary school days.\n\nI can see why this game is used in  schools, because there is so much information, each word that you may not be familiar with comes with an audio definition recording.  I actually learnt quite a bit from this game, science wasn't exactly my strongest subject at school, and boy could I tell when playing this. I haven't managed to complete it. The aim is to actually buy all of the plants in the catalog within a 13 day time frame and not go bankrupt through paying rent everyday. I really struggled around day 8 or 9. You have to be really good at your breeding, and try not buy as many plants just to sell outright, at least that's what I figured out would be the best solution.\n\nThe graphics are very cute; the game can be played in a browser which I suppose is for the school environments that don't want Steam being installed on all their machines (understandably) , so we are not talking revolutionary graphics - it does its job to a very high standard.\n\nThe game actually has amazing voice acting; every character, and there are tons, have an awesome voice actor. It's actually on par with some AAA games if you ask me. It's amazing how good voice acting can have such a positive impact on any game.\n\nDifficulty; like I said, I didn't finish Crazy Plant Shop, I am terrible at science so that didn't help. If you put a lot of hours into this game you will eventually beat it. I have seen people ten plus hours on this so it does have it's own fan base out there. Along with some very handy community made guides in the hub.\n\nThere are no technical problems which your regular player will run into really. The only issue I had was that I was not able to take screenshots either using Fraps or Steam, I assume because it doesn't use any DirectX engine behind it so it doesn't recognize it, who knows.\n\nIn conclusion, do I recommend Crazy Plant Shop? Well I suppose the best way of putting it is that I "don't Not recommend it". The game does it's job very well, it serves a purpose to teach the younger audience about breeding, genes etc, and it will do that! I will actually be showing this game to my partner who is a teacher to see whether it would be used in a classroom environment. I am not going to down-thumb this game because its not bad, it's just not going to be everyone's cup of tea who will be on Steam.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

So once the 13 days are up, you have to restart from the beginning if you want to keep playing.\n\nAll-in-all this game was well worth the money, and the flaws were very minor. If you're a fan of tycoon-style games you'll most likely get some fun out of this, though it's definitely a lot more calm than some of those types of games. It would be very nice if there was an endless mode after you've beaten it, but even playing from the beginning again is fun, especially since it's fairly quick to play through the 13 days.","August 5, 2014","true","8.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

As a game, it falls in the middle range of quality of games you could find easily for free on Kongregate or similar sites.\n\nFirst off, there is a very small selection of poor music. The voice acting is limited and at times cringe-worthy. There is only one game mode- a 13 day challenge to obtain all the plant types. There is no way to buy extra plant slots. Waiting on your character to walk around for everything and for the plant breeding machine to go ding takes up far too much time, which is pointless because the days are not on a timer. There is no penalty for rejecting customers or failing customers' orders that you accepted.\n\nUltimately, there is just very little to this game. It's good, but there needs to be MORE. I can find good little games all day for free, and most of them have more depth and keep me entertained longer than Crazy Plant Shop could ever hope to.\n\nAs a warning, note that there is no cross-breeding plants to create new, strange species.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/292200/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Crazy Plant Shop is a botanical genetics lesson disguised as a casual time management game (without the time management).\n\nThough it aspires to be something of an interactive entry course on plant genes and reproduction, its educational value never goes so far as to attempt to beat you over the head with the fact the game is trying to teach you something. It gets its points (for as hyper simplified as they are) across through gameplay hooks rather than walls of text, and it's a surprising amount of fun. It essentially boils down to cross breeding plants while taking into account dominant and recessive genes to produce the traits you need to fill a customer's rather exact and bizarre orders.\n\nIt sounds incredibly dull, but in this case breaking things down to their utmost basics actually works in Crazy Plant Shop's favor. Traits are distinct and easy to recognize, with the biggest thing you need to keep tract of being making sure you spreed enough recessive genes around to be able to breed plants with those traits. The lack of any time limit or penalty for refusing orders you can't focus on allows you to take as much time as you need mixing and matching plants, until you've found the right combination and feel like an insane plant matchmaker.\n\nWhere the game unfortunately trips over itself a bit is the unexpectedly punishing economy, which I wouldn't hesitate to call broken in most respects. You begin with a limited, finite amount of money to start your botanist career, and ordering plants is expensive and almost never fully compensated by the amount you're paid for fulfilling orders. If you aren't meticulously micromanaging your inventory and making full use of your also limited power for using the breeding machine, you're going to find yourself stuck with no other option but to start the game over. Aside from there being a bit about how breeding plants is cheaper than buying them outright, it was never made clear to me just how exact I needed to be with my orders, and how closely I needed to watch the number of power I had left if I wanted to succeed which led to me being forced into a corner several levels in on my first playthrough with no way out.\n\nCrazy Plant Shop's oddly restrictive monetary systems make playing in it a little more stressful than I was looking for. I wasn't allowed room to experiment because I was so scared of losing all the progress I'd made because I bought one too many plants, and this really hampers and experience that seems designed as a more lighthearted way for people to learn about plants than a typical textbook. Once the game opens up a bit in the later third and puts less pressure on your every decision it was a lot easier to see it as one of the more creative forms of edutainment I've seen. It's just a shame that I'm sure a lot of people won't get that far.","December 21, 2014","true","2.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

So, the economy is strangely (lovingly caressed) against you. You can decline orders with no consequence as far as I could see, they just keep cycling through until you have the maximum number accepted.\n\nAside from the business model being odd, the real science of plant breeding is glossed over. I got the idea that some plants are "simple" like sunflowers, and you can just choose through selective breeding whether they shoot sunlight or rainbows, whereas a Pitcher Plant is more complex with variables such as whether it holds a hot or cold beverage and if it has a sippy-cup or a lid, but you choose those traits by clicking on a button and it doesn't explain anything about how to actually do that to your Mom's houseplants.\n\nGood points: for one there's no time pressure, just resource juggling. Also I did feel a genuinely heartwarming moment when, after days of fighting foreclosure, no money in the bank, no credit available and no way to fulfil paying customer orders I was able to waste my last 6 Gold Coins on a stock bunch of white daisies to sell for 3 Gold Coins to some scruffy street urchins who needed a break. The smiles made my day and the business turned around from that moment. So the Karma Simulation seems solid.\n\nUpgrades to the store itself are unlocked very early and I strongly recommend getting the Breeding Machine Power Upgrade asap, as that is the only possible source of profit as far as I can see - the machine manufactures new plants at no Gold cost and the number of uses refills each day (starting on the day AFTER you buy it, I think.)\n\nGraphics are excellent, hand-painted stuff in the ballpark of Bastion and nice animated, the sound's fine but the voice acting is patchy and amateurish, it seems like a port of tablet game but runs fine on my Windows 7-64 rig.\n\nNot sure if "terrible fake accents" is a good or a bad thing but it has that too. Also a Catctus... I mean a cactus shaped like a cat, in Spiky or Fluffy varieties. There are rabbit and chicken plants too.\n\nScience!","November 6, 2014","true","1.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A child might also learn something about business, but there's no shortage of games where you run shops or manage a business in a manner that stays fresh and enjoyable much longer than this game does.\n\nUltimately, this is a game you beat in about 2-3 hours, and the only reason to replay it is to max out achievements.  Unless you get it dirt cheap in a sale, I can't say it's really worth the money - there are games, even games for kids, that scores a higher enjoyment time to cash ratio.","October 25, 2014","false","5.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Dominant and recessive genes, Punnett squares and the like. The voice acting is okay, and so are the basic mechanics, if a little simple. As a whole, the game isn't too offensive in any given area.\n\nExcept for the fact that I ran into a bug that rendered my save file unusable, and for that I have a hard time recommending it. If you ask me, game-breaking bugs are unacceptable in complete and commercial products.\n\nIf you're in 4th or 5th grade, have at it, you might have some fun. Otherwise, you probably already know what this game teaches you and won't extract that much value from it.","October 24, 2014","false","1.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It does and it does so in a way that isn't hard to learn either. I even bought this game for my nieces to play. This game and it's developer bring relatively hard concepts, even for some of my collegues, to a basic level and introduces them to children; Or the children at heart. I'll be going into my third playthrough soon and I'm only on 14.8 total hours. I could run through this game pretty quickly, but then you'd be missing the story. The story is...decent, not great but decent. You are the proprieter of a plant shop and your landlord is Gregor Mendel. He makes you pay 10 bucks every night for rent. You have to make enough money to stay afloat while also trying to breed plants for customers orders. A third but optional objective is to ender the local flower show and move through the local, state, and national levels before trying to win at the worlds fair. These are all pretty easy as long as you have two heterozygous plants ready to breed for anything. The hard part is turning away people when you don't have enough (breeder) power to breed plants for a customers order. Eventually the game will realize you have a spare fauxglove and give you a customer who wants that specific plant and only one.

The target audience is obviously people still in primary school - the game itself is trivial to break (get two identical plants of each type that have both the dominant and recessive gene for every trait and you can breed any combination) and it's nigh on impossible to actually lose (there's no time limit). While more plants are added as you progress, the mechanics remain unchanged throughout the game; it's the exact same game but with some different images for the later stages. I can't even really recommend it to teach simplified genetics because the game does a poor job of explaining how to breed plants.","February 9, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Further the player is restricted by number of plants one can have, which is 10 out on the floor and two in the machine to make copies. If you have no room you are pretty much forced to sell the plant on sale for I think it is 1/3rd the catalog cost. There is no graphic options btw. The game does not support full screen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raseht/recommended/292200/","raseht","Raseht","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raseht/","435 products in account","Crazy Plant Shop is a fun edutainment game inspired by Mendelian inheritance and Gregor Mendel's famous pea plants.\n\nThe premise of the game is similar to other shopkeep games (e.g. Recettear) in that you must earn enough money each period (one business day) to pay the rent and stay in the black through the entire game (13 in-game business days.) You can end an in-game day any time you want, but for the best results you should wait until you are unable to complete orders. Orders continuously stream in, but you are limited in the money you have and the number of plants that you can breed in one day; I have never run out of open orders. The game is short--a full run through will take about 1-2 hours depending on how much thought you put into each order.\n\nThe theme of the game is plant breeding and Mendelian inheritance. You will buy plants from a catalog and breed them for traits desired by customers. Each trait has a dominant and recessive expression and up to five different traits. One plant is asexual and comes with only one dominant trait expressed. You can choose to fulfill orders by breeding or ordering directly from a catalog. Ordering from the catalog results in a net loss--customers always pay the same amount for each breed of plant and this amount is always at least half the cost of buying a plant. Breeding is limited to 9-15 times per day, depending on upgrade level. This is limiting factor where strategy is required.\n\nThe power-ups are difficult to afford in the beginning and, aside from increasing your breeding power and shelving capacity, the upgrades provide little benefit to gameplay. You can take as much time as needed for any order and there are no bonuses or penalties for performance. The pacing and difficulty of the game is relatively static since there are few options for earning money faster.\n\nIn all, this is a relative short, fun, low-pressure game that might educate young botanists or entertain casual players. There is no New Game+ or Leaderboard and no record of progress aside from achievements, so the replay value quickly vanishes, despite its brevity. I recommend this game for casual gamers and fans of the genre, but if you like a challenge, look elsewhere.\n","September 11, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is generally fun. You buy plants, mess with the "breeding machine" to get the genes you're looking for and you fulfill the orders of the customers. You have 13 days to unlock all 13 plants.\n\nThere is also a bad side. If you're someone like me, you'll soon find yourself declining 99% of the orders because they don't net the most gold possible. It basically means that you've unlocked plant #5 and #6 and they net 9 coins each and you'll  just decline all orders asking for plants #1 to #4. Especially fun when you're at plant #10.

The game reccomends that you have two of each plant, displaying different traits. Once you realise you actually need two identical plants, with every catagory having a recessive and a dominant gene present, it becomes amazingly simple and prevents wasting resources by having to do multiple levels of breeding for some orders. (Especially the competition orders, which can ask for specific gene codes (Like having two dominants, rather than being a carrier for the recessive gene)\nThe art style is cute and fun, and the game itself is very zen.","April 15","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
