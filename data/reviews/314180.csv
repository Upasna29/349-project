When you can't get past wave 9 in Robotron 2084, that means you've hit the wall. One of the many walls I've run into is Black Heart from Battle Garegga. No challenge is impossible, but the ones that are the most improbable to overcome can be considered walls. Deathsmiles is one of Cave's easiest 2D shooters, but it's definitely not without walls of its own. Through the use of a brilliant rank system and a multitude of deep scoring methods, players will find many ways to test their abilities.\n\nUnlike other Cave STGs, this one allows players some freedom in determining their route. There are eight stages in the game, one of which is entirely optional. Furthermore, players can choose from one of three ranks of difficulty, for the first six stages. The higher ranks result in tougher bosses, enemies spitting more bullets, and other dangerous occurences. Still, the walls aren't liable to appear until you aggressively pursue the hardest possible route.\n\nIf you decide to play the extra stage and/or go through five of the other stages at rank 3, you're going to enter "Death mode". At this point, every gothic horror you destroy will unleash a flurry of suicide-bullets. In order to combat this new threat, you'll have to change tactics. Your familiar is essential in Death mode, because they can absorb these last-ditch attacks. The little beasts are rather tricky to manipulate, and since they float so far from the player, there's a good chance suicide-bullets will still get uncomfortably close. The presence of physical walls and swarms of foes add to the claustrophobia.\n\nI'll admit, at first I hated the presence of suicide-bullets. I've been playing Deathsmiles off and on for over five years, and I'm just now starting to get accustomed to them. Their presence requires players to adopt new strategies. The monsters of Gilverado are rather weak, and they don't flood the screen with bullets as soon as they appear. This gives players time to position themselves as well as their familiars. The keyword here is restraint. Enemies in this game can approach from both sides, and you can box yourself into really bad situations if you shoot everything as soon as they appear.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm nowhere near qualified enough to discuss how to get hi-scores in this game. On average, players better than I are scoring ten(!) times as many points. Still, it doesn't hurt to go over the basics. When you're in the middle of several monsters and their bullet-spewing corpses, you still have to consider how to get some extra points. First off, your shot determines what items you collect. Depending on the enemy, tapping the fire button or holding it down, can result in more or less valuable items. By holding both fire buttons, you get a lockshot, which drains your item-counter, but can award even more items if used properly.\n\nWhen the item-counter fills to 1,000, then you can unleash the Power-Up mode. Now, when you destroy enemies, they drop truckloads of valuable items. You'll want to gather gold crowns until you're awarded 10,000+ points apiece. At this point, you allow the crowns to hit the floor, where they will break into several skull rings. These items don't build your counter as quickly, but once that's maxed out, you'll still recieve the 10k bonus for every ring. Finally, you have to time your kills so that as soon as your Power-Up runs out, you recieve a huge in-flux of gold crowns. This will fill up your item-counter almost immediately, allowing for another Power-Up. Naturally, this is all easier said than done. Your timing has to be precise, and everything falls apart if you fly into a bullet. The scoring system is a little convoluted, but it also feels very rewarding. Collecting thousands of 10k rings at once makes for a very lovely visual.\n\nDeathsmiles boasts six modes of play. While these modes are very similar in terms of stage layouts and bullet-patterns, they're quite different in other ways. Version 1.1 introduces suicide-bullets at earlier ranks, more maneuverability for your familiar, and several scoring changes. Mega Black Label offers a fifth playable character, another Extra stage, the dreaded 999 rank, and its own set of scoring rules. Both modes also have their own variations on cumulative multipliers, which will result in hundreds of billions of points. To me, 999 rank might as well be Ultra mode from Mushihime-sama, the density and speed of bullets is just too much for my puny brain to handle. However, I really like all of the variations on the scoring system. Sakura's a good character as well, probably too good. She has two familiars! Two! This makes suicide-bullet absorbing less ardous a task.\n\nFor the sake of completionists, the original Arcade versions of Deathsmiles and Mega Black Label are also included. When this game was ported to the Xbox 360, it recieved a graphical overhaul and some slight rule changes. Certain stages and bosses also have varying amounts of slowdown, which further differentiate the arcade and 360 versions. To be honest, I can't pick a favorite mode. They're all great, because none of them feel too easy or too confusing. Although, the 1.1 modes are probably best-played with a 360 pad, since the right-stick can be used to control the familiar.\n\nHaving so many modes of play can seem overwhelming, but I think it works for this game. Despite the sizable differences between them, these modes clearly communicate all of the basics needed for players to succeed. If learning the extra stage in one mode is giving me a headache, I can move to 1.1, MBL, or MBL 1.1 and practice them for awhile. There aren't any variations of the game that play entirely different, so most of what you learn can be applied universally. Coupled with the exceptionally fluid rank system, this makes for an STG that's approachable for gamers of any skill level. If you hit a wall, at least you have something else to work towards in the interim, rather than just head-butt the bricks in the hopes that you'll make a few cracks appear. There's a constant sense of accomplishment, and you'll always feel like you've made some progress.\n\nDue to a (recent) disc-drive failure, I haven't been able to compare the PC port with the Xbox 360 version. Still, from my experience I feel confident in saying that this edition is well-done. The slowdown is accurate, even when accounting for all of the various game-modes. Like Mushihime-sama, this port lacks standard resolution options, but the screen-size can be adjusted for most any monitor.\n\nDeathsmiles is one of the rare titles that understands the balance of accessibility. It offers enough challenge through its various systems to satisfy hardened veterans, but also allows concessions that appeal to casual STG-fans, without being condescending. It doesn't make players ashamed of themselves for choosing rank 1, or opting to not play the Extra stages. At the same time, there are sizable scoring benefits for learning Death Mode, 999 rank, and possibly challenging the true last boss. Whatever the case, players are treated to Cave's trademark mastery of STG design and mechanics. All in all, it's a fantastic addition to any fan's library.\n\nDisclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 10","true","11.4"," 139 of 161 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","139","161","2","5"

Thus far, on All-Hallow's Eve, a man named Jitterbug appears in Hades Castle, summons a portal between Gilverado, and the real world and tries his way to get back into the real world, he also has a family with his Wife and his daughter, Sakura, the Witch of the Bog Wastes (Also a playable Angel), from where the portal appears, monsters and beasts have appeared all across Gilverado, and its up to the Angels to stop Jitterbug and turn everything back to normal, but not only that, a sinister being appears what stands between them and it, can they defeat it? Its up to you, the player to find out.\n\nEither way, the game's based more or less on the US/PAL 360 version (with less on the text accents) with all of the features so far and all modes pertaining to this release (Arcade/1.1/Normal/MBL/MBL 1.1/MBL Normal), Arcade and Normal modes are your default modes with its own scoring mechanic and difficulty selections in-game, while the 1.1 Arrange modes play slightly different, and requires a controller with the 2nd thumbstick to move your familiar to handle the suicide bullets easier. (Be reminded, there's no online co-op unlike the 360 version has.)\n\nPC Options will be there as usual to check within your own resolution and style. For bug problems and all that, as usual, refer to the forums for this game.\n\nNote: More on this review will be compared and fully complete as soon as I get enough time onto it. I recommend it, as would others that like the Shmup genre as well, thanks CAVE/Degica!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/recommended/314180/","sashadarko","Sasha Darko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/","1062 products in account","Status: Completed (w/ Rosa)\n\nThis is an enhanced port of the 2007 arcade shooter from Cave, which was also ported to Xbox 360 (and later to mobile platforms). It feels and plays like a very high quality old school arcade game.\nThe chosen theme here is nothing new for Japanese shoot'em'ups - witches and castles entourage, bizarre enemies and story which doesn't take itself seriously (well, if you choose Rosa, that is), and it reminds me of games like Parodius and Cho Aniki. You will fight bosses like giant cow and giant man head, it's that kind of game.\n\nPresentation\n\n...is fantastic. Gorgeous art, highly detailed everything. Non-stop action, bright colors, little touches here and there. It features both pixel art and pre-rendered sprites (some of the enemies and bosses like Mary).\n\nGameplay\n\nThe controls are simple, yet not really common - you have one button to shoot right and another one to shoot left. You also have a bomb / spell which kills everything on the screen and “Targeting Magic”, which is an alternate attack which features lock-on mechanics.\nBullet hell shooters are known for being very unforgiving. But Deathsmiles has...how would you say...democracy? All stages except the last one (and the bonus one) have Rank system (difficulty level). You choose 1, you get a walk in the park, you choose 3, you get the true bullet hell.\nSo both groups of players would be happy – the ones who play shoot'em'ups for entertainment and the ones who play it hardcore, for scores and ranks.\nEvery stage is different and the game introduces new enemies with each one. I never felt like something was recycled.\nIts length is exactly would you expect from an arcade game – 30-40 minutes and it's GREAT. The replayability is there – choose different characters (all have different attacks), choose different ranks, choose a different mode, heck, choose a different ending (quite literally, you just choose the ending you want in the end of the game, A or B).\n\nTechnical\n\nThere are many options to customize your experience. Make it 4:3 or 16:9, choose background image, zoom the screen how you want, etc.\nThe game has framerate slowdowns. They're not common, and they usually occur when there are hundreds objects on screen at the same time. In such games it's something that people see as both good and bad, so it's up to you to judge is it a problem or not.\n\nA quality port and great game, a must have for shoot'em'up fans.","March 11","true","3.5"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/314180/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Deathsmiles is a horizontal Bullet Hell centered around five girls and their fight against evil. Right off the bat you are given 6 modes to choose from which all feature subtle tweaks to the gameplay. Normal mode allows you to pick which ever difficulty you want and Arcade mode only allows you to pick the easier levels a few times before forcing you to up the challenge. “Ver.1.1” is definitely a mode you'd want to avoid picking the first time around as it only gives you one bomb per health bar and causes enemies to fire yellow projectiles once they are defeated far more often. Mega Black Edition adds an extra fifth character called Sakura to the fray as well as one new optional level and an new harder, more insane difficulty called “Level 999” that will test even the most hardened bullet hell player's skills.  It is quite an overwhelming number of modes to choose from the first time you play and they don't state what the differences are so I thought I'd dedicate a paragraph properly explaining them.\n\nAfter you choose your mode of choice, the game will start up in a rather small screen that you can tweak to your liking in the options menu as well as change the border art. Depending on the mode you choose you are able to choose from either 4 characters or 5. They all have the same speed and health though what really separates them is how they shoot their projectiles and their unique familiars that accompany them throughout. Sakura fires in a narrow spear like formation and has two crow familiars that take quite a bit of skill to use correctly but allows you to fire at any angle. Follet fires in a wide helix like formation and has a dragon familiar that rains fire in a short but devastating stream while Rosa has a single giant stream that sparks a few extra projectiles toward the end of it and has a fairy companion that can shoot through any objects which is insanely useful. The other two have their own quirks too and none of them feel better than the other which really helps fuel the need to discover the ins and outs of all the cast.\n\nOne of Deathsmiles most unique features is the ability to choose in what order you take the first 6 missions on. You can play them in any order and if you are playing Arcade mode gives it a bit of strategy as it will not let you play all the levels on easy so choose wisely. After you finish the batch of 6 levels you are then given the option to head to either the last mission or the completely optional stage. Mega Black Label modes adds another optional level resulting in two optional stages if you are brave enough to face them. Those two optional levels do not have a difficulty mode you can set so these will be your demise if you are used to playing on easier difficulties. You don't receive anything for completing them other than a higher score at the end assuming you don't die so it may be best to skip them if you are attempting to run with no continues or a 1CC as Shmup fans call it. With 7 levels and two optional ones it will take you around 40 minutes to get through this.\n\nThe gameplay has a rather neat feature in which you can shoot to the left with one button or to the right with another. I really liked this unique mechanic as it keeps you from remaining stationary on the edges of the screen like so many other bullet hells. In Deathsmiles sticking in the middle is your best bet as enemies will swarm you from both sides of the screen which feels absolutely awesome as you lay waste to your foes and feel like the anime version of Neo from the Matrix. Unlike most other games of this genre you will not die from a single hit, instead you have a life bar with three sections.  Taking a hit will cost you one section of the life bar while touching an enemy or a hazard will cost you half of a section. Losing an entire section will reset your bombs to max capacity though they do not stack so taking a hit while still having bombs left is incredibly wasteful. Bombs work like in any other game and they clear the screen of all projectiles and does heavy damage to your enemies.\n\nYou can increase your life bar to allow you to take more hits if you do well enough though it is a very difficult task and using a continue will reset it back to normal. Holding both firing buttons at  the same time allows you to fire at any enemy in short range of your character which is less useful than simply firing in that direction. Where it becomes really useful is when facing bosses as getting in close and holding both buttons locks on to him meaning you can focus on just avoiding his attacks while doing consistent damage. As you defeat enemies they will drop items that both increase your score and fill up a number meter at the bottom left of the screen. Once you hit 500 or more in that meter and you press both attack buttons you will enter a “Power-up mode” where you cause more damage and receive much more points per kill.\n\nIn “Ver.1.1” entering this power-up mode becomes much riskier as killing an enemy while it's in effect guarantees that it shoots projectiles once it dies and your attack becomes much more flashier making it hard to keep track of where the projectiles are. It is a risky gamble while on death's door and you are hoping the extra points you get from it will get you a health item or a bomb. Holding the attack button slows you down and deals more damage but the amount it slows you down is so minimal you are unlikely to notice. The amount of continues you can use is unlimited so any one can get to the end of this title.One minor annoyance that remains from Cave's last Steam release called Mushihimesama is the lack of one overall option for your screen settings. That means you will have to tweak your preferred screen settings on each of the 6 modes which is a very slight annoyance yet a remaining problem of their ports.\n\nWhere Deathsmiles really messes up is on the story. It is pretty terrible and that is nothing new to the genre but there is too much of it here and no way to turn it off. It's pretty bothersome to mash a button to slightly speed up the cutscenes that were boring the first time around and it does reduce my will to keep on replaying it. Each character has slightly different things to say throughout the course of the game and each one also have one of two endings to choose from at the end. You know nothing about the characters which makes it hard to care but it's a cool feature nonetheless. A simple option to turn the story off would do wonders for those that have already seen all it has to offer or simply don't care. Graphics are do the job yet for some reason the characters are 3D models that have aged far worse than the 2D sprite work. The game also has objects like walls or cliffs that block you and forces you to make your way around it. I'm personally not a fan of stuff that impede your movement in bullet hell games but the real problem here is that you occasionally don't know if it's an actual object or just background scenery until you try flying through it. In a genre that requires split second timing second guessing yourself like this will likely spell your doom.\n\nEnemies in this game range from minotaurs, cyclops and even tanks. It is a very cool and whacky mix of both reality and fantasy. Each level has a boss at the end waiting for you and they all fight quite differently. Bosses are far odder than regular enemies and your jaw will likely drop when you see one of them is a giant cow. All in all Deathsmiles is a fun Bullet Hell that tries many different things and succeeds on most of them. While the story is a pain to read through having 5 characters, multiple routes and many modes to choose from is more than enough reason to replay this game time and time again. It's not the best the genre or Cave has to offer but it is a unique enough experience to warrant a buy from any fan of Bullet Hells.","April 9","true","6.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

This version also includes all of the updates and modes, including the Mega Black Lable DLC with Sakura as the 5th playable character and an extra additional level. Deathsmiles stands out as a Cave shmup title because they've committed to a horizontal side shooter which has been rarley seen with their titles.

Luckily to fix this when the game does crash when switching to full screen, just restart the game and it will display on fullscreen.\n-This is considered one of the easier Cave titles to 1cc, which may turn off the most die-hard shmup fans\n\n\n\nVerdict: Thumbs up! Despite the minor bug and the missing online feature, Cave and Degica has done this game justice bring it out to steam and for the right price with everything featured. This is another sleeper hit I think gamers should look into and give this one a go. It may not be quite as intense as Mushihimesama but its just as enjoyable.","March 13","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/superemp/recommended/314180/","superemp","EmP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/superemp/","360 products in account","Suicide bullets are a bigger feature in the 1.1 strain. Everyone you shoot has them, but the game makes them easier to manage. In all strains, suicide bullets are annulled by your satellite helper - in Deathsmile’s case, an adorable mascot familiar. Outside of 1.1, you control them in a similar fashion to BioHazard Battle, wherein they rotate round you in the opposite direction in which you move. So, for them to cycle through to your left, for example, you would have to move to the right. You could use them to eat up the extra bullets with some pre-planning, but the greater numbers 1.1 offers make it a bit of an ask. As such, the familiar becomes directly controllable and can be easily nudged into the path of bullets, which it gobbles up and turns into points. To make it all a little bit easier, prompt for any of the MLB versions and you’ll find previous enemy, Sakara the Swamp Witch, playable.\n\nWhich is handy, because she has two familiars. That makes it easier to plough through the swarms of bullets you produce when you turn uncountable enemies into corpses. Deathsmiles is too stylish to lean on overused fighter crafts to slip through the constant bullet walls, so instead has you wage war with a handful of loligoth girls who each possess unique quirks. The youngest of the bunch, Casper, has a bloodthirsty bat familiar who can spit out arcing balls of rolling plasma. Shy, bespectacled Collete’s dragon chum offers powerful but short-ranged tongues of flame. I’ve talked a lot about the mechanics of this game -- and I’m not done doing so just yet -- but the gothic fantasy world is stunningly realised here, and absolutely obsessed with trying to kill you. Graveyards spawn plasma-spitting crows from shadowy tombstones, while bipedal ram-headed monstrosities mingle with mammoth ogres, all firing skywards from opposite sides of the screen. Other stages fling out serpentine plants that belch tadpole-shaped lasers that lazily wriggle around the screen, along with cycloptic swarming bats pinging bullets at you from their singular eyeballs. Slice your way through them - Cave kindly supply a very well-defined hit box to help you wiggle through all the bullets - and maybe you’ll see a few of the bosses.\n\nWhich gives me a chance to talk about Mary. She’s a giant cow. She wants to kill you.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12916/pc/deathsmiles/review.html","March 15","true","4.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

It seems pretty much like a port of the Xbox 360 version, and it includes the Mega Black Label 1.1 edition. It's a fun game, a little easier than most Cave shooters until you set the difficulty on level 999. I highly recommend it.

And yes, you can shoot backward. Why? Because enemies might actually show up behind you. Don't worry. Enemy indicators are present to let you know an enemy is behind you.\nIt looks simple at first, you shoot enemies on the front and on the back. But, the real eye examination begins when your enemies scatter bullets all over your screen and you have to dodge them all, or use a magic spell to eradicate the bullets (and enemies and certain destroyable objects). You have a tiny hitbox, so don't worry if your character might get a headshot. Worry about that hitbox where you'll actually take damage if a bullet strikes that hitbox!\nThis means your eyes are concentrated on both the left and right side, and all the bullets on screen. Luckily, with the bullets, the game will lag for you just so you can read and analyse and plan an escape from the stream of bullets. This is probably the only time lag is your best friend, so don't blame your graphics card for not maintaining 60FPS.\nSo, does this look easy? No. But you can still win this arcade game using a combination of good eyesight, quick response, and timing (for the magic spells). This, ladies and gentlemen, is pure bullet hell from famed bullet hell developer, Cave, and Deathsmiles proves to be very fun and challenging.\nAll you need, is focus.\n\nOh, and it also has amazing gothic art style and a rocking soundtrack. You can also have co-op, which is always nice to have on a shoot-em-up game.","May 14","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The goal of the game is to blow things up and go for the high score.\n\nNow your mileage on the game will depend on 1. If you like a challenge and 2.If you are a high score nut and i am in the number 2 category i just love a decent scoring system in a game and this has it.....i just have a thing for shooters where you have to collect loads of items and often in this game the screen is full of them.\n\nSo yeah i can recommend it, it looks, plays and sounds great and in my play time not encountered any issues.","March 11","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is, of course, a shooting game. But CAVE has chosen a curious theme for this game: horror. Often, shooting game themes are ornamental: despite how beautiful the graphics might be, the meat of a shooting game is in its mechanics. Post "bullet hell" this has never been more true, as graphics have been borderline abstracted to hitbox pixels and bright blue and pink bullet patterns. I have never minded this distillation of shooting mechanics in an era when, in most other genres, gameplay is often secondary to storyline and graphics. But it is from this understanding that the curiosity of Deathsmiles unfolds. Deathsmiles' horror influences go much deeper than the surface of the game and influence the very core of the game design.\n\nFor me, the beauty of Deathsmiles lies in its homage to the horror-themed side scrollers of the 1980s. CAVE produced a horizontal shooter here, which is something of a rarity for a developer whose most significant contributions to the genre are of the more common vertical scrolling style. The scenario and soundtrack also stick out versus the rest of CAVE's shooting productions. Rather than more traditional military or alien settings, Deathsmiles uses a unique horror theme to derive its world and enemies. The scenario pairs with a brilliant soundtrack that fuses orchestral Hollywood monster composition with rock and electronic energy, filling the player with equal drive and dread. If the horror theme only got CAVE this far - a unique setting allowing for some fantastic looking enemies and a fun soundtrack - it would have already served them well. Instead, these elements all combine to create a game that is uniquely fascinating.\n\nThis is a game by perhaps the most famous of all the shooting game developers. Yet, when I play it, I am transported back to the countless hours I've spent playing Castlevania and Makaimura. It is an experience that is at once nostalgic and new, and feels less like a shoot-em-up and more like Speed Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Upon starting a level, the player is presented with a world map, just like in Castlevania and Makaimura, and allowed to choose the location and difficulty of their next battle. A feeling of exploration - travelling around the world to slay a variety of evil monsters within a greater context - is created with this simple addition. The player character also does not die in one hit - rather, a Castlevania-style lifebar is used. The player character is still fragile, however - much more an Arthur than a Belmont. This serves to make the enemies more intimidating than a Castlevania ghoul ever was.\n\nInstead of enemies primarily coming from ahead of the player, as in traditional shooters, the Deathsmiles player is attacked from all four sides regularly. Two buttons are even dedicated to a left and right attack, affording the player many more movement and attack options than the typical modern shoot em up and drawing further similarities with side scrolling horror classics. Many modern shooters are about positioning to dodge, but Deathsmiles is about positioning to attack. To perhaps hammer home the influence of Castlevania, enemies may drop heart shaped items when defeated that can be used to perform a powerful secondary attack. These offensive tools are tactile and fun, and allow the player to feel less like a hitbox dodging hitboxes and more like a witch slaying giant monsters.\n\nDeathsmiles is, fittingly, a bewitching video game. Yes, it is a shooting game. But it is so much more. It takes the tendency of modern shooters to distill and refine their formulas to the purest form, and applies it to another classic genre: the arcade-style side scrolling horror adventure. It infuses a new energy into these classics that has not been felt in decades. It is a stunning look into an alternate future - a taste of what two of the most classic game genres could have become. It is, in my mind, a design masterpiece and one of CAVE's finest.\n","March 10","true","4.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The different modes all offer something different and you'll find yourself going back to play more to improve your score or try different routes.

Pretty simple play mechanics, shoot left or right, or press both bottons to do a lockon system and your trusty smartbomb. Seems to be a lot of debate whether the game is worth it or not. As a SHMUP fan, I can say its money well spent. Not a huge bullet hell fan though, but at least there is unlimitted continues. Playing the game in arcade mode, the game looked bland, but the 1.1 in HD sure made a difference, there is also a BLACK LABEL mode that seems to just have more stuff onscreen, similar to Mushihimesama V1.5. I am only a casual player, not a 1CC type of guy, so the unlimitted continues really helped out. There are SHMUP's that I will never finish due to only having 3 credits. No its not a long game, but if want to get on the scoreboard be prepared to play it over and over. As far as SHMUP's go, I'd give it an 8/10. Sadly even in our modern age of online play, SHMUP's on PC just don't seem to support online co-op, just so sad.(with the exception of GunDeadliGne)","March 12","true","4.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

And I guess a new boss if you are playing with Sakura.\n\nThe graphics are not... good. But I don't mind they. It is a old game, to be honest, I find it a little charming. But that is probably nostalgia playing with me.\n\nNow, the Art direction is excellent! I love the gothic style Deathsmille has! I really like every character design, especially the bosses, Casper and Windia.\n\nThe same can be said about it's soundtrack. The OST is very memorable and it will stuck in your head.\n\nI really like the gameplay system. Nothing much to say about it other than 'it is very fun to play'\n\nFor it's full price, Deathsmilles suffers for its lack of in-game story, replay value and shortness.\nThe music and art style begs for you to buy it, but please be wary of the things that I have mentioned.\nIf you are going to play, be sure to check on the internet more about the story otherwise you will not know much about.\n\nI recommend getting this if you don't mind self-imposing a limit of continues to your plays or get Deathsmilles in a promo!\n\nYet, a very enjoyable game.\nHave fun.","April 17","true","2.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

Unfortunately, I haven't put many hours into this version yet, so I can't speak on how stable it is. 40 minutes in, and didn't have any problems so I'm assuming it's better than the last port Degica pushed out.\n\nNow to the game it self. I absolutely love this game! I have put countless hours into the Xbox360 version and I plan on putting many more on the Steam version as well. As I said earlier; Deathsmiles was my very first CAVE game, and I had no idea what I was getting into once I got it. I came in with the intention of trying something new and I was blown away by how fun it was. It came around for me when every other genre of games was getting so boring, and to easy.\n\nWith that being said, this game can be very hard and if you're looking for something with good story, you will not find that here. Obviously this is a Shoot 'Em Up, so you can pretty much clear each game mode within a couple of hours. That's not what this game is about though. It is very addictive, and can hold your attention for days and days if you're someone that likes to really push their self for hi-scores and 1CC.\n\nI know a lot of people with look at this game and be like, "Oh another anime game on steam" but, please don't let that fool you, it's very very fun and I really can't recommend this game anymore. If you like Shoot 'Em Ups or just ready to try something new, please get this game and support CAVE!","March 11","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excitehype/recommended/314180/","excitehype","Excitehype","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excitehype/","363 products in account","Full Review for Deathsmiles (PC) was originally published on Excitehype[excitehype.com]\n\nI’ve been in arcade game heaven as of late with so many good releases over the last few months, especially on PC. I recently purchased Raiden V on Xbox One and have been loving it to death despite what my YouTube comment section says about the game, but on my custom PC arcade cab i’ve been playing teh best games such as Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours, Street Fighter V, Guilty Gear Xrd, BlazBlue Chronophantasm Extend, Ninja Senki and many more. So I was pretty happy to add another great arcade game to the fold with Cave’s Deathsmiles for PC. The game originally released back in Japanese Arcades in 2007 and later received a port to Xbox 360 back in 2009 and mobile phones in 2011 and 2013. Unfortunately, I was a late bloomer to Cave’s SHMUPs and didn’t play one of their titles until around 2014 with Deathsmiles II. However, all that was about to change as Cave announced they were bring some of their fan favorite shumps to PC starting off with Mushihimesama back in November and now Deathsmiles.\n\nDeathsmiles isn’t your basic SHMUP from a presentation point of view, it is a Gothic styled bullet hell shooter which in many ways feels like the love child of say Touhou and Castlevania. And I’m talking the great Castlevanias, like Igarashi Vania games….not that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Lord of Shadows garbage. But back to Deathsmiles, graphically this game feels like it would fit right in with the late 90’s/early 2000’s Arcades or SEGA Saturn/Dreamcast library. But don’t take that as a knock as many consider that time of arcade gaming as the golden era of coin-ops, same thing with the SEGA reference as both consoles were known for their great arcade titles. Hell, the Saturn had many great SHMUPs like Cave’s own DoDonPachi as well as other awesome hits like Radiant Silvergun, Sengoku Blade, Strikers 1945, Gradius and Gunbird. The soundtrack to the game is awesome too feels like a mix of Bayonetta and Castlevania, the latter is probably because the composer Manabu Namiki has worked on a Vania title being the WiiWare title, Castlevania: The Adventure Rebirth as well as a couple of other awesome games (Odin Sphere, Contra Rebirth, Gradius Rebirth, Caladrius Blaze, Bloody Roar and Metal Slug 6).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__oabp8gxSM&feature=youtu.be\n\nGameplay wise, Deathsmiles is an all around fun bullet hell SHMUP that provides non-stop action as you take on hordes of demonic foes throughout 7 stages (8 if you choose to take on the extra stage prior to Chapter 4). With most SHMUPs its a pretty standard scroll to the right with enemies coming from the right but with Deathsmiles, enemies can come from multiple directions. This is where the game’s fun controls and mechanics come in to keep you from being overwhelmed. You are provided with two directional attacks in Deathsmiles, with one button firing right, the other left. Holding down an attack button gives you stronger shots but slows down your movement when firing, but you also have the option of tapping the attack button for burst fire which allows you to move quickly and attack but the shots are a bit weaker. It’s a pretty simple mechanic that keeps the game fresh and fun. There aren’t any power ups to pick up but you are provided with bombs which can take out an array of enemies on screen or save you from the trickiest of bullet hells if you are unsure of your dodging skills. For you casuals (JK), the game does not have a limit on how many continues you can consume so you can play until your heart’s extent but with each continue your previous score gets wiped. So don’t think you can rack up a high score by just playing through the game and dying countlessly.\n\nThe steam version of the game features all the content from the 360 version of the game (Arcade and Ver 1.1) including Mega Black Label (and MBL Ver 1.1) DLC where Sakura is a playable character. It also features a score attack mode, training mode, replays and full online leaderboards for the hardest of the hardcore. Not bad for a $20 digital arcade port. So if you are a fan of SHMUPs or good arcade fun, I highly recommend picking up Deathsmiles for your PC and for my custom Arcade Cab heads, this is definitely a must have to go into your multicade.","March 10","true","2.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I don't know what the dilly is going on except I'm pretty sure these girls are mages or something and then some jerk unleashed a boatload of destructive monsters on the entire world for some reason. I don't know. Anyways you gotta kill the monsters because they're monsters and you're a little girl mage; the natural predator of ogres, demons, goblins, and all other evil things. Luckily, none of the little girls are elf loli because then there might have been some trouble if there were orcs in the game.\n\nWell this is a review about the game not about what would happen if a hypothetical elf was put into the game. The bottom line is this SHMUP is just the way I like it. Little girls blowing crap up without some lame attempt at a story getting in the way. So I give this game 1 thumbs up since that's the only metric you can use in steam reviews apparently.\n\nIt would be cool if we could give games 2 thumbs up if we really liked them. Like pro movie critics. I think this would give a lot of legitamacy to steam reviews if we could just get that extra thumbs up. PLEASE NOTE: I'm not saying I would give this game 2 thumbs up if I had the option and I'm not saying I'm not either. I would have to strongly consider the ramifications of giving this game 2 thumbs up before commiting to that level of review.

A couple of the levels are perfect settings for fighting the forces of hell.\n\n-Characters: Pleasant variety between the characters, their attacks, and their familiars. You will also be treated with some snippets of background information on each individual if you defeat the final boss.\n\n-Gameplay: Overall smooth and enjoyable with the variety of enemies and bosses. You are also able to choose which stage to go to next instead of a completely linear progression.\n\n-Customization: No customization of characters, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since players compete for high-score. Plenty of settings to configure like the amount of damage you recieve when running into an enemy or damage you recieve from enemy attacks.\n\n-Dialogue/Well Written: Not a lot of cut scenes or dialogue. Most appear at the end.\n\n-Tutorial: There's a training option that will allow you to play individual stages to practice on.\n\n-Worth the price tag: For bullet-hell enthusiasts I would say yes. For anyone who is not sure if they'll enjoy a bullet-hell game I would say wait for a sale or find a free to play one to try out first.\n\nHave Fun Gamers!","March 22","true","4.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/314180/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","I will start out by saying Deathsmiles is my favourite Bullet Hell shooter of all time and to finally see the game released on PC is a big deal. I originally bought Deathsmiles along with a Japanese Xbox 360 back in 2010. Along with Mushihimesama, Deathsmiles is part of bullet hell shooter Cave’s new decision to bring its catalogue to PC and I really hope this is the first… well the second of many.\n\nDeathsmiles first appeared in arcades back in 2007 and unusually for Cave is a horizontal bullet hell shooter featuring a very strong lolita gothic visual style. While the game has not aged amazingly in the visual stakes its theme and gameplay remain as fresh today as they did back then.\n\nOne of the main reasons I always liked Deathsmiles is due to the multi-directional gameplay that sees you travel and fire in both directions as you move through the game on rails. As you progress through the game you can choose the order in which you play the various stages along with the individual difficulty which mixes up things in terms of gameplay and style.\n\nMechanically Deathsmiles isn’t the most complicated of shmups with you controlling a familiar which orbits your main Lolita and allows multi-directional shooting. Once 1000 skulls are collected, a special state mode can be activated to boost your damage & score. Waiting for the correct time to activate this is key to achieving high scores.\n\nThere are a number of different version in the game such as the original arcade version, normal mode which is graphically improved and Mega Black Label version which adds and extra stage, and extra character and is probably the best version to play for people looking for the most complete version.\n\nSadly I had hoped for a shiny new PC version but this is essentially a port of the game I bought on my Japanese 360 back in 2010 (I always found it odd that the 360, a system that was essentially DOA in Japan was the only place to play Cave shooters). I would 100% recommend playing the game with a 360 pad or a stick as playing with the keyboard just doesn't offer the needed level of accuracy.\n\nIf you are a Cave fan this is a must buy, if you are a shooter fan then this is well worth a stab and to be honest this is one of the more accessible bullet hell shooters out there so for anyone remotely interested in a very Japanese genre lets go and dodge some bullets.\n\nFor our video review please check out our site here:   Deathsmiles Video Review	[www.thegametutor.co.uk]\n\nPLEASE NOT A COPY OF THE GAME WAS PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVIEW.
