The game is extremely slow paced with only as much challenge as you take on.  It is great fun digging out your dwarven stronghold.  I have spent hours upon hours designing awesome underground towns for my little buddies to live in.  I bought the game on a steam sale and I do feel that it was a value for the price.\n\nHere's the bad...  Once you've played one level you've pretty much played them all which lends the game to tedium.  And it's not really much of a game.  It's more of a Dwarven Stronghold Designer.  There is no challenge, random events or enemies that attack your dwarves without you digging them out.  Even though I bought about half of them (I really wanted to support the game), but I hate DLC in a game like this.  Especially in AGoD, the DLC (maybe except for the Pets add on) came off as a desperate cash grab.  There is no reason why these items were not included in the core game.  Especially considering there are tons of reports of game/achievement breaking bugs in the game.  There is also an overworld to the maps that apparently goes completely unused.\n\nThe game does not feel finished.  It is painful how much potential is here.  It is a genuine crime that the money wasn't there for the game's full development.","January 19, 2014","false","34.4"," 160 of 187 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","160","187","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueZest/recommended/200370/","BlueZest","Zest","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueZest/","95 products in account","This game tries to scratch the itch dungeon keeper and dwarf fortress have long since stopped scratching for me. (hundreds of game hours can only do so much.)\n\nUnfortunately, where those other games are like a Velcro nose scratcher inside a spaceman's helmet, this is more of a damp sponge. You can try as hard as you want, it won't scratch.\n\nI only managed to stick with this game due to the mild amusement of designing a very simple dwarf base, but that gets old FAST; it was pure stubbornness after the first 3 levels. You don't have the challenge and satisfaction of making something like in dungeon keeper or dwarf fortress, and it's not much fun aesthetically because the near non-existent challenge the game does provide wrecks your design.\n\nThe major problem with the game is how unfinished the final product is. The potential is definitely there, but it was rushed into final product for obvious financial reasons. Hence the cash grab DLC rushed quickly out.\n\nThe biggest clue to this being an unfinished mess is the falling animation. When your dwarves tunnel into a large cavern, or are falling for some reason, they panic, fall one Z level, stop in mid air, Panic again, Fall another Z level; rinse, repeat till the bottom. Come on guys, didn't have time to fully program that one?\n\nThe second clue is the half-hearted attempt at making your dwarves happy. You can decorate your entire dungeon with minerals you find, but this is purely aesthetic. Rough wooden walls and floors do the job just as well as Dragonite ore, the rarest mineral in the game. Come on devs, was the balancing too hard? Dwarf fortress had that coded!\n\nIf we are talking balancing, the teleporting mechanic breaks the game so hard it physically hurt me sometimes with boredom. You can teleport your dwarves anywhere on the map you have visited, as many times as you'd like, and as fast as you'd like. Sure they TRIED to nerf it by only letting you do one dwarf at a time, and by having special fields you need to send your dwarves to destroy, but you can work around them easily, usually by tricking the stupid AI.\n\nIf I send a dwarf tunneling into a unknown cavern, I should fear for his safety, or for the safety of my base, not watch bored with my hand on the teleport button to whisk him away from the slow moving enemies. (The combat AI is so bad they even take a second to spin and position in a North-south or West-East pattern before hitting each other.)\nI never had any fear for my main base while playing the game. You can stop intrusion by deleting a ladder. Enemies try to circumvent this by randomly teleporting around, but half the time they stood there stupidly. Depressingly, I never had the chance to use all the nifty traps they game had available for me. By the time you can afford the traps you already have the appropriately levels fighters, making them useless.\n\nI was REALLY angry at the half-coded ending to the game. Anti-climatic, with rushed animations; even the writing was half-hearted. Did they even expect anyone to get through the entire game?\n\nThere are more problems, Terrible AI, bad animations, ETC; but this game has taken enough of my time already.\n\nI know some of you out there are desperate for easy to play games that scratch that itch I mentioned above, but don't come here. You will leave wanting, and with less money in your wallet.","June 10, 2015","false","44.7"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","60","62","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/recommended/200370/","blue_award","Blue Award","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blue_award/","803 products in account","Best viewed as a sim dungeon, dwarven style. There's a campaign mode where dwarves seek to reclaim their land from evil magi, but it's pretty rudimentary (I like the Dwarves-Elves angle in the story though!). It does structure gameplay a bit on each level with preset elements and gives some bonus incentive to continue playing, however it's still rather sandboxy experience, in the end not differing all that much from actual "custom mode", which is pure sandbox without the preset storyline elements.\n\nOtherwise, if you want to treat it as a strategy game (real time with pause), you're going to be dissapointed. It's as if creators were aiming to make something like Dungeon Keeper but in full 3D (multiple levels of dungeon not just one), changing the tone from dark lord to sort of supposedly benevolent dwarves, perhaps being inspired by Dwarf Fortress, but in the end they realized they won't make it and dialed down difficulty a lot. It's very basic, no AI to speak of, no challenge, you can do everything at your own pace without being forced to discover (always marked) rooms with enemies until you feel ready. No enemies respawn or surprise you unless you dig your own grave unprepared. Many things feel unbalanced and purely aesthetic in nature (although aesthetics do have gameplay implications of keeping dwarves happy - the more you dig, the more decorative stuff you need for dwarves to feel at home). Early game on a new level is rather slow in terms of trying to push story forward/discover random enemy rooms, because you are too weak. And then, after a bit of building up, you're totally overpowered. Especially once you realize your ability to move stuff anywhere you want by your godly player powers is overpowered on its own.\n\nSo yeah, as a sort of sandboxy doll house, err- dwarven dungeon, it can work pretty well. You dig around, gather resources, set up farm for food and wood (ultimate renewable resource that buys you everything), and possibly some shrooms for happiness (yeah.. but I usually just stick to wood for cash and get happiness otherwise :P), build some cozy place for your guys to live, occasionally fight baddies who won't be a problem at all after a bit of building up, push story forward. Can be somewhat slow, and there surely are better sim games, but the overall tone and setting here is pretty unique for such genre I think.\n\nDoesn't work at all as a strategy game, though. And if you want to be picky, animations are bit off, but otherwise looks are sort of cute.\n\nBonus points for spelling "dwarves" properly (not "dwarfs"). Malus points for broken achievements (one mission is broken and doesn't give you full influence, required for cheevos).\n\nAlso take note there are silly in-game cosmetic microtransactions, but many are free and you can easily ignore the rest (of which only Ales DLC is separate on Steam and only gives you ale tree and kegs to increase dwarven happiness). Bigger DLC is Space Dwarves, which changes medieval tone to futuristic, but it only works in pure sandbox (aka custom) mode, not in the campaign mode. No idea about the Pets DLC.\n\nIn the end, this title isn't very strong overall, but I still recommend it for its setting, however only to people who like to mess around sandbox/dollhouse style and maybe have some TV series to watch at the same time for slower moments or something xD","November 26, 2013","true","91.9"," 63 of 77 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","63","77","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cruinne/recommended/200370/","cruinne","cruinne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cruinne/","366 products in account","I recently played through the campaign for A Game of Dwarves.  I'm giving it a thumbs up, but a qualified one.\n\nThe GameThe game is something of a builder/manager game: you control a settlement of dwarves and guide them in both mining out the area around their settlement and building the things they need to be happy and do well.\n\nI really liked the potential of this game: I find it a fun thing to occupy myself with while watching TV or just winding down in the evening, and there is some challenge to it too — more than once I restarted a scenario to come at it from a better angle.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a decent enough game when it's available at a reasonable price.  Less than $10 is certainly OK, but around $7 might be more appropriate.\n\nThe ProblemsWhy would I want to knock the price down further?  Well, the game certainly has its flaws.  For one, while there are Steam achievements for the game, some simply cannot be earned because some of the levels won't give you full credit for completing them.  (Paradox knows about this bug but has said that, with developer Zeal no longer in existence, no further development will be done.)\n\nThere are several other little problems that, while they are not game-breaking, can be annoying as well.\n\nDwarves have problems climbing staircases, and sometimes repeatedly fall through them before navigating them successfully (this can be particularly annoying when they're starving and need to get up those stairs to eat).\n\nPathing is generally pretty good, but, for some reason, when some dwarves are attacked, they just stand around instead of fleeing and you end up needing to move them manually or watching them die.\n\nIf you happen, at some point, to spend all your money, no new wealth tally shows up when you get more (until you restart the game).\n\nThere are a lot misspellings and grammar mistakes in the game text — anywhere from repeatedly misspelling "environment" to sentences that make no sense whatsoever and game missions being called different things depending on what piece of text is referring to them.\n\nI've had a lot of problems with camera angle.  Sometimes about midway into a level, it just decides the only view I want of the dwarves is at the level of their feet, and nothing I can do can get it to reset or take a better angle.  The only solution is waiting for it to get so bad that, when you load the game, the game corrects it.\n\nLevel design leaves a lot to be desired: sometimes the monsters right by your starting location are, say, level 10 or better, while the ones far away and deep underground are level 2.  It seems somewhat random.\nI'll also say that, tone wise, I'd have preferred fewer puns and pop culture references (example: one resource is "dragonforce", with the tooltip, "the hardest metal known to man") and dialogue that was worthwhile reading — instead, it frequently pauses your game mostly to waste your time.  Some of that is, I think, poor translation work (or non-native English at the very least), and it tended to annoy me to some degree in that I generally expect a bit more polish from a game I've paid to play.\n\nThe GoodYet, all that aside, I really did enjoy the game itself.  That is, despite its slap-dash feel and poor finishing.  The pacing is relaxed, and the graphics cute enough that you can spend time just enjoying digging around and making nice settlements.\n\nThere are some DLC available for A Game of Dwarves, both add-on packs (Pets, Ale Pack, and Space Dwarves) plus some in-game purchases of furniture available.  I got a few of the in-game furniture packs, but they seemed a little overpriced (about $0.99 USD for three pieces of furniture).\n\nOverall: the game can be fun, and I can entertain myself for an unreasonable amount of time laying out settlements and making attractive rooms for my dwarves to enjoy.  Just know that the game is not really "finished" in a sense, and try not to pay full price for it.","April 9, 2015","true","230.3"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","51","62","0","0"

Seemingly inspired by the much better "Dwarf Fortress", A Game of Dwarves sought to improve upon it with better graphics, only to fall short in every other area. It can be fun to build in, or stripmine, as suits your moods, but there's no strategic depth and any of the levels can be beaten almost blindfolded (which is how your dwarves behave half the time). Overall, it can be fun to waste some time in, but I can't recommend you purchase it.","January 16, 2014","false","87.4"," 72 of 96 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","72","96","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastersteviekun/recommended/200370/","mastersteviekun","Steviekun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastersteviekun/","116 products in account","My first impression of this game was very optimistic; its gameplay was somewhat different from most games, and the games that this one is likened to are only in 2D, making this very promising.\n\nHowever, after the first hour it became very apparent that this game was designed to be casual- no real resource management or needs/logistics to cover even the most sprawling of dwarven strongholds. Granted, the game IS in the casual genre, but a game like this has so much potential that it comes off as more of a half-baked idea than intentionally casual. This is evident in the lack of true challenges and very repetitive gameplay.\n\nSo, avoiding the strategy genre because there is nothing challenging, I wouldnt count it as a building game either. The number of items available arent very many for a builders' game, and what's available is most likely useless decoration, which would have been fine if the game had direction, but because of the immense amount of time it takes to make one or two decorations, playing this just doesnt seem worth the effort.\n\nI was looking forward to this as an alternative to Towns, but I am disappointed to say that Towns is far more engaging and rewarding.","October 2, 2014","false","16.9"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","0"

Of course, it is full of downs/cons, like, it's a casual game, it's quite bugged, it has huge slow downs when the map becomes huge and full of your constructions, it is not very deeply thought and programmed, the scenario is poor, the dialogues useless, blablabla, you could make a huge list of the bad stuff, as there are probably more of these than the good ones. HOWEVER. However. All in all, there is one huge aspect of that game that is so nice that in the end it becomes heavier or at least as heavy as the bad stuff in the balance used to rank this game: the exploration feeling and the construction features. And you know what? These two simple facts, no matter how bad all the other things are, made me feel closer than ever to the golden past of games like Dungeon Keeper, more than any other game did these past 20 years.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sherish/recommended/200370/","Sherish","DeeplyDippy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sherish/","271 products in account","This game is horrendously addictive.\n\nI will initially start with the one thing I really don't like about the game - and that's the conversations between King and Prince - and only because it usually interrupts me as I'm either moving an object or placing one to build - having to click the arrow to continue the conversation is, for me, a niggle.\n\nOther than that, it's quite a simple premise that is developed very well indeed.  I find myself thinking "oh I'll just clear this area here, just a few blocks" and when I eventually look up it's been several hours and let's just say more than just those few blocks, because those few always lead to more, and more, and more...\n\nThe storyline itself is quite funny, and if you take the time to read the conversations when they appear, it carries that dry humour through the game.\n\nI've seen some people complain about the DLCs/Stores items that are purchasable with real life pennies - well all I can say to those it what do you expect when the game itself is so cheap for what you get - the small (and it really is!) amount for the extras help create more revenue for the developer, and in my mind that means the developer can afford to spend more time on updates - which is a win!  However, you don't need to buy anything from the shop - it's fluff stuff.  Instead of bed A that is 3 smileys and 4 Z's you can purchase bed B that is 3 smileys and 4 Z's.   Each item you purchase usually cost the same resources as one of the items (from the same group, ie beds) you already have.  So to repeat myself here, you don't NEED to buy anything from the store, you can play just fine without them.\n\nI have only found a 1 bug, but found that others had noticed it as well, reported it, and the developer acted upon it incredibly quickly - so if you do find one, just report it as best you can on the forums.\n\nNow if you don't mind, I'm going to leave this review short and sweet, as I really want to go back in and look after my dwarves :)\n","July 14, 2014","true","239.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

You're a Dwarf Prince, who is given control of a group of dwarves, and you build fortresses and caves underground and fight bad things who want to kill you. You go searching for materials to build furniture and decorations, and to advance your dwarven army. Once you kill the bad things, you can steal their beds and bunny rabbits and stuff to put in your fortress.\n\nThere is a campaign mode with quests which I think is really well done, and great to play. There's also a sandbox 'free' mode so you can build your ultimate fortress without any distractions. In both sandbox and campaign, I love being able to decorate my little dwarven fortress.. thing. There's a whole range of decorations and things to do, and discover.\n\nKilling stuff and making a badass army isn't bad either, theres a fair few enemies and bosses to defeat with your military dwarves.\n\nTheres a skill tree type doohickey that will allow you to give your group of dwarves more powers and items as the game goes on.\n\nIt's a great game to play casually and relax with (if you learn not to try and rush through, which made lead to stress and death unless you're quite focused!).\n\nSometimes your dwarves don't do quite what they're told, plus they're fat so they get stuck behind furniture a lot and then panic and die of starvation.. but it's okay, you can just spawn another one.\n\nI definitely recommend it.

From the start you must gather food and minerals, level up your dwarves as you go, fight off monsters, decorate your town/city/fort etc and make sure your dwarves are happy, you need specific materials for specific pieces of furniture and so you should really look to dig everything you can, you can make traps, barricades, grow food and create an army of adorable little dwarves.\n\nHonestly I love this game, it is slow but when you finally finish your 10 story all-marble throne room with pillars and suits or armour it is extremly satisfying. At one time I literally filled up the largest map with a city which I named Moria after the lord of the rings franchise.\nThe game is slow but satisfying and is NOT for people who do not like both trial and error and having to choose wallpaper for bedrooms...oh also you need to be patient, very patient.\n\nNow, the game itself is only 10 dollars and I got a pre-order of it, it is fairly cheap comparing to most games and much better than a lot of more expensive ones *cough* infection survivor stories *cough*. All in all that is around pocket money price for the average teenage male/female assuming you don't spend it on something else.\n\nAs any proper review does, I need to point out the bad. The main point being that it is repetetive, very much so...to the point where the only reason you play story mode is to see what the ending is, which brings me to my next point, terrible writing. The story isn't immersive and feels like it was rushed, VERY rushed. But the levels are thought out well and allow a fun time while you struggle to understand what the hell is going on. And the worst part are the DLC's....ill just leave it like this.\n\nAll in all it a very fun game, it sqanders is potential a LOT, however I still love the game, and I love playing it, right now I am still trying to get enough dragonstone to finish my grand treasure chamber so I have to go, but seriously check the game out.","July 15, 2014","true","34.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Supplies like wood to build stuff... you buy it, you don't chop it down. No this game is completely under ground like Dungeon keeper 2. And you play as Dwarves on a grid. Your dwarves dig out walls along this grid, but unlike Dungeon Keeper 2, you can dig up and down instead of just north, south, east and west. You hire new dwarves and assign them roles or jobs. Its just so much like Dungeon Keeper 2, but less faceted and a lot more boring. Not to say that every FPS is like Doom, with a new coat of paint, but imagine if a game released 10 years after Doom, used a modified Doom engine, yet had less interesting things than Doom.

Enemies appear only in air pockets dug out by the player, and keeping a good supply of resources is just a matter patience of not getting careless along the way (forgetting to make farms). This is the fundamental problem with the game if you're looking for a survival challenge.\n\nAside of these problems a number of other major issues and a significant lack of polish plague the game.\n\n[Combat]:\nEnemies lack proper patch finding and will when encountered instead wildly teleport around the level until they find a dwarf to beat up. Your own dwarves cannot be controlled (aside from teleporting them) and soldier dwarves will simply bullrush your enemy they can patch-find their way to, even if they are on the other side of the level and have 1% of their maximum health available (no way to prevent this aside from sealing them in).\nEnemies teleporting makes traps useless, and since you can't stop your dwarves from blindly rushing into battle the only factor is having more and higher level dwarves than the enemy monsters.\n\n[Resources]:\nCertainly better than the combat, but basic resources are surprisingly rare, while 'rare' resources when found can buy you immense quantities of these resources, which leads to situations where the best way to get "stone" is to find an unholy rock and sell it for a few thousand rocks. Unfortunately you also need to mash the "buy rock" button a few hundred times since you can only buy very small stacks. Aside from this you have a few minor issues like resources sometimes permanently disappearing from your resource tab if they reach 0.\n\n[Graphics & Sound]:\nThe sound and graphics for the game are both nicely done and get the point across. Aside of a few minor issues designing a good looking dwarf fortress is both possible, fun and fairly easy to do.\n\n[Summary]:\nA few major design flaws and a severe lack of polish across the board prevents this game from reaching its full potential. Perhaps the game will change later on, but as the game is now I do not feel that I can recommend it to anyone.","November 27, 2013","false","6.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lord_unagi/recommended/200370/","lord_unagi","The Pseudo King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lord_unagi/","121 products in account","While theres nothing inherently wrong with A Game of Dwarves theres nothing all that good about it either.  I was looking for a Dungeon Keeper-esque/ general RTS game that would fill waste some time and I did find it in AGoD (kind of an interesting abreveation, no?).  The gameplay itself is not terribly revolutionary, you dig out and settle an area, collect resources, do research and train and build an army.  The thing that kills the game for me is the AI, especially in combat.  To intiate combat you must dig into certain areas where monsters may or may not be waiting.  If they aren't you may find a few resources and go along with your day, if there are monsters they usually kill one, if not two, of your diggers because your army is perpetually late to the party.  Your supposed to be able to place down these flags that your army is supposed to stay stationed at but they just dont care about them.  So wherever they are they have to run to meet the goblins or orcs or spiders or republicans or whatevers killing you this time and stop them from stomping your ♥♥♥♥.  90% you can dominate them, rebuild your diggers, take their stuff and move on.  10% of the time your army gets wiped out and its game over.  If you lose a battle there is no coming back, theres not enough time to train new units, there simply isn't.  So really the combat consists of coin toss on wether or not enemies show up, a tense few seconds of them stomping around killing whatever they see till your army shows up and then a fierce but usually short battle that either allows you to move on or completely ends your game.  And I just dont think thats fun, probably because it isnt.\nLuckily combat is a minor part of the game overall, in my playtime I would say only a sixteenth of it was actually spent fighting anything.  Most of the game is mining and building and on this aspect the game does a bit better (though only a bit).  The minecraft like cubeness of the blocks seems like fun at first until you realise its a pain to fill in any dug up squares and covering them with wood is costly and ugly.  Using the resources you get from mining allows you to build all sorts of things dwarves need in a variety of models.  I made a little barracks once and was really proud of it until I realised I had to dig out the floor to try to find gold so I could continue progressing the story.  So anything you do build on either wastes the resource its built on or has to be gotten rid of eventually which kinda sucks.  Still its fun to be creative and make death pits for miners and cellars full of random cleaning supplies that no one can get to no matter how hard they try.\nThe art style was okay but it wasn't something I really liked looking at, its cute for a while but it got old for me pretty quickly.  The music got old even faster however, I had to mute it within an hour or so of my first game and pull up something on itunes just becuase it was so bland and repetative.   And there are some glitches that are pretty annoying, though nothing game breaking that I found which in a way was to bad, it probably would've been something fun.\nBut the reason I cant say I hate this game is that it really pulled me in.  It didnt really mater how boring it got or how annoyed with it I was I just kept saying, "One more area to clear then I'll (shower*eat breakfast*eat lunch*go meet my friends*eat dinner*sleep*etc)."  But no matter how many times I told myself that I would always find something else to do, this archer sucks, better make him practice, if the walls in here were covered in decorative stone it wouldnt look so bad, etc.\nI guess ultimately if you need a time waster, this is it, its not the best but its not the worst I've ever seen.  I just think for the money you could find something a bit better.","February 17, 2014","false","8.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

But the execution is bad. You get lost so easily with the huge amount of stories you build on, you lose dwarfs way too quickly and too often and digging is a pain. It also drags on forever, as your workers stop to sleep and eat so often.\nMuch of the pain could be spared by having the digger build ladders automatically but what to expect from a company that offers you decorative item DLCs in such (singleplayer) game?\nThis thing is unpolished - I would like to see the good in it but it keeps ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.

"A Game of Dwarves" is styled after "Dungeon Keeper" but has what amounts to a sandbox mode (so you can play and dig and build to your heart's content without being attacked left and right), is brighter (one of my complaints about DK was that everything was dim and dark, being in a dungeon, and that I couldn't see what was going on half the time), is 3D so you can dig up and down as well as sideways, and retains the humour that made DK fun to play.\n\nIt's not perfect. The voice acting is a bit weird in places ("what does it take for me to get somebody to listen to meeee"), though in a way that's generally amusing rather than off-putting. The dwarves can be slow to react - especially the military. (I miss the DK Call to Arms banner which at least told your dungeon's inhabitants to respond immediately to attacks. There's something similar in GoD but it's more like a garrison flag, a "mill around here until told otherwise" banner, rather than something you can use to make them react quickly to invasions.) The controls are not always intuitive or explained well (it took me forever and an internet search to figure out how to rotate objects. While I'm not averse to using walkthroughs when I'm stuck, I shouldn't have to look to external sources for basic controls).\n\nYou also spend a ton of resources on placing tables and beds for your dwarves to lay about doing nothing (they need to eat and rest frequently and die if you put said food and beds too far away for them to reach after their work shift), compared to DK where you'd just build a lair for each creature to live in. Despite that, I still find it easier and less labour intensive to play GoD than I did DK, which had you constantly digging for gold to pay your monsters. With GoD, as long as you've got workers operating your "farms", you can just sit there and let your dwarves take a long holiday.\n\nI haven't gotten too far into the campaign side of the game so I don't know how much harder it gets to keep your dwarves alive. My biggest complaint so far is that the resources are scattered so it's next to impossible to have symmetrical farms that aren't scattered in small pockets all over the place, but that's not a complaint so much as a personal peeve I have with keeping everything compartmentalised.\n\nAll in all, I'm enjoying Game of Dwarves more than Age of Mythology, which I paid at least twice as much for, and you can get a few freebie DLC to go with it, so I'd definitely recommend.","June 10, 2014","true","68.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The gameplay involves a large amount of digging which amounts to highlighting blocks to and waiting for your dwarves to dig them out. The exploration high that one would expect to get from digging is greatly lessened by the fact that there is nothing exciting to find in these underground complexes that you are digging out. The only part of the game that is fun, the design and decoration of a dwarven stronghold, requires grinding for resources by digging. The dwarves in this game are controlled mostly by the AI. When I play this game, I find that there are long periods of highlighting blocks to dig out and longer periods of waiting around for the dwarves' AI to respond.

You have to dig for gold and other materials, but also make sure you don't run out of wood, and have to defend yourself from incursions by monsters such as Goblins or Spiders.\n\nThe campaign is silly, and while there are voice clips they do not match the dialog at all. But it serves its purpose in teaching you how to play. Sandbox is where this game really shines.\n\nThere is an in-game shop which wants you to buy items for in-game currency on top of the DLC, but all that's in there is cosmetic and can be completely missed.\n\nIf you like your "town builders" but don't want the complexity of something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress, give this game a try.","May 25, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While it's easy to learn, it requires more skill to truly master. It's fun and quirky, with a whimsical silly style that lends itself well to its graphics. A friend of mine knocked it as Dwarf Fortress for casuals, but that's just fine with me.\nOnly complaints I have are that the music gets a little repetitive and though it doesn't advertise it, there is an in-game store. Doesn't bother me (especially since many of them are free) but it would have been nice to know beforehand. Unlike DLC though, these cannot be turned off, so once you download them, they're there forever, so think carefully before buying them!\n\nAll in all, a real fun game that has given me hours and hours of enjoyment.

I recently felt like playing a base building game and this one was unplayed in my library.\n\nThis game seems unfinished. It has traps and walls and tiers of military but there's no enemies to use them on. I've only played the tutorial and what seems to be 1/3 of the campaign so maybe there will be armies later but from the looks of it it seems that you don't need to ever use any of the combat features.\n\nThe only enemies are weak mobs that just exist until they die. Nothing spawns. So it is as if the developers had all these big things in mind but abruptly stopped developing.\n\nThe in-game economy consists of putting a few dwarves on farming and you're done for ever. Money is made by clicking the sell-wood-button repeatedly unless you buy the DLC that supposedly has the money tree.\n\nThere's a technology tree that gets researched autmatically over time so long as you have some dwarves researching. Once they're done and the tree is complete, you can't do anything with those dwarves and they just keep researching for ever.\n\nThis game should be considered very early alpha with lakc of features.\n\nA game that is early access and has more features, mod support, full invasion support, economy, seasons, etcetc is Gnomoria. That one is 2D isometric and something I go back to every few months.\n\nThis game though, I'll probably try to finish because of the sunk cost fallacy...","December 14, 2015","false","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Enabling the option for Dark Mode - which disables the overly bright lightning you see in the screenshots - creates a nice atmosphere as the only source of light comes from torches and braziers you build.\n\nIf you enjoy building then you will enjoy A Game of Dwarves, there are small 1€ DLC packs in-game which add a decent amount of new objects for you to craft. If you are looking for something deeper than just building and gathering  then you'll be disappointed with this game.\n\nAlso, it can get buggy, exitting and re-loading your game usually fixes this.","January 31, 2015","true","61.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Bugs aside, the game claimed to be completely randomized.  The truth of the matter is that the maps are only semi-randomized.  Maps are predefined, but clusters of blocks which most can be dug through are randomized.\n\nAs far as the bugs are concerned, I have run into 2 that bother me.  The first being that pausing the game, actually isn't a full pause; the game will actually progress even when paused, but at a much, much slower rate.  The second would be a bug where buildable objects will drop below an item that has been moved just for the purpose of repositioning it (even when paused), right into the same place of the item you just repositioned, making the block where the item dropped from no longer buildable on that wall; this has been enough to make me have to keep restarting the game.","January 9, 2013","true","161.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amikron/recommended/200370/","Amikron","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Amikron/","596 products in account","A Game of Dwarves has been described many ways by many people with much more experience in "gamez journalizm" than me, but I will attempt to give a recommendation for you, the reader, anyhow.\n\nThis game can best be summed up as Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress having a big dumb pretty baby.\n\nThe game isn't terribly deep, but that isn't to suggest that the game is simple, it has quite a few layers but after your first deep inspection, you won't have much left to figure out.\n\nFor those that are going into this thinking this is DF in 3d, it is not, please do not expect it to be as I did. The game is mostly centered around its story mode, with objectives on a series of small maps. You do indeed mine out areas in 3d (with ease might I add once you understand how placement of ladders work) but it is mostly to mine out gold and other resources to fuel your army when you uncover pockets of enemies or other objectives strewn about the map.\n\nThere is a non story mode, but even those center around monster spots and other objectives. Do not come into this game expecting a 1000 year fort with multiple generations. The dwarves don't breed, you simply buy more dwarves as you upgrade a spawning pool, and food is pretty much trivialized by being a simple plant and harvest resource set instead of being cooked, processed and so on.\n\nThis does not however mean it is a bad game. I am a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper and this takes a good number of bits from that game and enhances them for a new way of doing things. The systems are clean and work together well, are easily utilized, and research isn't made to be a complex chore.\n\nThis is very much a straightforward game for people that want to mine a large area, kill a bunch of stuff, and make a couple cool rooms along the way.\n\nSummarizing my rambling thoughts above: If you like Dungeon Keeper and DF, you probably will like this, as long as you go into it knowing that is more on the DK side of complexity rather than the DF.\n\nDefinitely worth the price of admission for fans of Dwarven fun!","November 10, 2012","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As others have mentioned, this game could have been amazing. Imagine just about any builder game, but with this games perspective/control and I drool. Gnomoria, Towns, Dwarf Fortress, Terraria, Craft the World, ect. They could all benefit from this type of 3d environment.\n\nSadly, this game doesn't even bother to try to take the gameplay features of the genre and implement them. Instead it gave you just enough to finish the campaign and rip some more money from you in the form of DLC before it was declared finished.\n\nI had a great time with it. Like all early access alpha/beta type games, you play them and enjoy them because the anticipation for the next content patch keeps you involved. However, if you can't help but let a game rub you raw with it's blatant inadequacy, don't get it. If you can take it for what it is, grab it.\n\nI don't regret getting, so I will upvote. I am saddend by the developers/publishers lack of vision and dedication in letting such a grand opportunity to become the best of the genre slip away.\n\nCheers,\nMichael","February 8, 2015","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is not so great, but neither is it not so bad either. With any games, it going to have its ups and downs. So does this game. I find it fun to play because this game is all about dwarfs, which if fun, second it also a qurcky mine, build, and slay the monsters that are in your way to get to that treasure room. I like this game because of that, but its also bad because it does have glitches, bugs, and the sometimes hateful crash and burn. Those do happen a few times that make it less fun, along side that all the decs in game for your hold, there are not a lot of them. The devlopers could've add more, or added a feature that let them build their own structures like Spore does. The other thing i find hard is that you cannot build top side that well, which is a drag. Dwarfs build ther hold from under ground to the top side. Like in the lonely mountain from the Hobbit, that hold had the whole mountain side carved out. But this is a mixed reaction from me.

There's only two things that keep this game from a solid eight out of ten for me. The first ting is how strangely demanding the game is on my system, and the second thing is how it leaves me wanting more, much more.

I love "A Game of Dwarves" a lot and I continue to play it from time to time (at about 200 hours playtime for now). I really like the general gameplay, the isometric view, the animations and also the weird kind of humour.\n\nProblem is that the game is still a bit buggy and shows unused potential, but the developer's company Zeal doesn't exist anymore... Players have condemned Zeal for selling over-priced DLCs before even fixing the main game, which is absolutely understandable in my opinion. But was it the small Swedish indie-company Zeal who came up with that idea or their international distributor Paradox Interactive?\n\nSome reviewers recommend to teach "them" a lesson by not buying the game until the bugs have been fixed. However that would be completely fruitless since Zeal has already dissolved a long time ago, only a short while after the release of "A Game of Dwarves". On their Twitter-page https://twitter.com/agameofdwarves the last entry was about the early access (!) release of the game in October 2013...\n\nParadox Interactive on the other hand has not given a d*mn about low sales and boycotts up until now, as they still continue to charge extra-money for the DLCs on Steam. More smaller DLCs can only be ordered from within the game though, and perhaps that cannot be changed without developers? Well, it's not like you are going to need the DLCs anyway!\n\n* the "Star-Dwarves"-expansion pack can only be played in "free-style" mode, not during the story-mode-campaign. The Star Wars-like fighters might be a little bit stronger than the "ordinary" dwarven fighters, but with not much visible difference\n* the "Ale"-pack is absolutely not necessary to keep your dwarves happy. Instead it's totally easy to get them all to 100% happiness forever by regularly crafting additional cheap storage-cupboards and/or decorative wall-tiles and floor-tiles made by wood (renewable) and/or stone\n* the "Pets"-pack is mostly decorative. Even though some pets will also help with fighting, they are very weak in the beginning and it takes a lot of patience until they have levelled up\n* the rest of the DLCs are just completely "cosmetical" additional items\n\nPerhaps I am just lucky but I have stumbled over only very few bugs during 200 hours:\n* ranged attackers sometimes have troubles with positioning themselves, and sometimes they can miraculously fire through walls or corners :D\n* there have been a number of crashes during the ending-sequence in the last "chapter" of the campaign - seems like this has been the last part of the code before Zeal gave up\n* very rarely my dwarves have somehow managed to get (fall) into small closed or secluded spaces so I had to teleport them out of there manually before they could starve to death\n* sometimes dwarven fighters wouldn't attack enemies by themselves if too far away; but it always helps to station them close to critical areas beforehand (just like in "Craft the world")\n* generally it will help to save and relog every few hours (will prevent most fighting-AI-bugs), as well as to make copies of your savegames once in a while just to be on the safe side\n* in my (PC-)version of the game I've never spotted any dwarves falling from ladders or getting inactive while fighting. They seemed to have troubles with staircases though as far as I remember, so I have long refrained from building those. They are too pricy anyways :p\n* very rarely the camera suddenly "fell" below the current level and got stuck - but that could always be fixed with a relog\n* I personally like the random and sometimes mean level-designs with a few tough enemies placed closer to the starting-area, as this poses a bit of a surprising challenge sometimes. Not everybody is going to like that though I think\n* the ending wasn't really bad, but it underlined the feeling that Zeal once had more in mind previously, but just couldn't make it into a reality before dissolving\n* the German translation also is quite good; even much better than in many other games I've played, with very few mistakes or bugs :)\n\nAll in all the few bugs I have experienced have not been able to kill the major fun I had and still have while playing "A Game of Dwarves" :)","May 9, 2015","true","199.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDragon/recommended/200370/","TekDragon","TekDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TekDragon/","485 products in account","A Game of Dwarves is a mixed bag of fun and frustrating; quirky and buggy.\n\nDrawing heavily from Dungeon Keeper, AGoD puts you in charge of a group of dwarves in a small mine. In each mission you expand your starting location by digging outwards and downwards, building new room types to supply your dwarves and advance your settlement.\n\nAs you explore further, uncovering new minerals that unlock new rooms and upgrades, you encounter increasingly deadly enemies. AGoD has you constantly juggling between exploration and training so that your military dwarves can always handle what's around the next tunnel bend.\n\nProblems start with the interface. A substandard UI and poor camera controls are mentally taxing.  This wouldn't be such a problem except that the campaign missions become obviously uninspired as time passes.\n\nCampaign missions involve digging your way to Spot X, and then digging your way to Spot Y, but this can be frustrated with the way the developers "walled-in" objectives with impenetrable rock. This often means digging around for a long time, juggling the poor camera controls, just to find the entrance.\n\nStill, there is fun to be had, especially if you can let go of the campaign and focus on building and creativity.\n\nIn the end, I can only recommend AGoD to hardcore Dungeon Keeper fans and those who enjoy building epic projects in sandbox environments.\n\n","May 20, 2013","true","20.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Some say it's not as good as Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria, but I argue that it is, in its own way. Nice little story in the main campaign with a little humour, and I love the fact that you can just fire it up with no enemies and make your dream underground domain, or with enemies and train up your soldiers to defend the realm. Graphics are more polished than Gnomoria, and the interface is far easier than DF!
