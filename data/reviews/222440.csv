Terrible, sloppy balancing, missing key characters (King), the soundtrack was god awful, and the presentation was weak. However after 1999, 2000 and 2001, one thing 2002 did right was return KOF back to it's roots after years of experimenting with new system mechanics that weren't well recieved, such as the Striker system.\n\nThe King Of fighters 2002 Unlimited Match much like '98 Ultimate Match before it, is a complete overhaul of the original game. Hell 2k2UM is an even bigger overhaul than 98UM was. KOF2k2UM brings back everybody from the NESTS Saga as 98UM brought back everybody from the Orochi Saga. Plus it also brings back the New Faces Team from KOF97, this being a Dream Match game and all. 2k2UM also includes characters from the PS2 version of the original 2002, such as Goenitz and Geese!\n\n2k2UM beefs up many characters movelists with moves that 99/00/01 introduced, along with some new additions, for example Mai Shiranui has her rekka special move straight out of Real Bout Fatal Fury Special, and Terry Bogard gained his Quick Burn special move from Real Bout Fatal Fury Special: Dominated Minds, which is a pretty obscure move from a very obscure game.\n\nAlongside new moves for many characters, 2k2UM also brings EX versions of characters such as Robert, Kensou and Takuma from 99/00. EX Robert is a charge style character, while EX Kensou  does not have his psychic powers, and EX Takuma is pretty much alot like 98 Takuma.\n\nProbably the biggest improvement from the original 2002 to UM is the presentation. The game looks very nice and refined, backgrounds are fantastic, HUD looks great, and the soundtrack is a huge improvement over the original, some of my favorite themes being Kyokugenryu Team, Korea Team, and the new Mustard For Geese arrangement.\n\nAs with 98UMFE on Steam, 2k2UM is based on the Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which is in turn based on the 2002UM Tougeki arcade update of the game. Unlike the XBLA version though, the netcode in this version is pretty solid from what I played. I managed to play with a friend all the way from California with barely 4-5 frames of input delay at 150-200ms ping, which is pretty playable.\n\nPlayers coming from 98UM should feel pretty well at home with 2k2UM, although 2k2UM has a bit of a different feel from 98UM. 2k2UM is alot faster, and the controls are more loose compared to 98UM's tightness, although it's not nearly as loose as say KOFXIII.\n\nIf you are a KOF/SNK fan or just a fan of fighting games in general, I highly recommend picking up this game. If you are new to fighters though, you may want to tread lightly. This game is extremely unforgiving as most KOF games tend to be. If your only fighting game experiences are with games like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, you are in for one helluva ride.","February 28, 2015","true","18.2"," 146 of 154 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","146","154","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miggoh/recommended/222440/","Miggoh","Miggoh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miggoh/","330 products in account","This is probably my favorite fighting game on Steam at the moment. I personally prefer 2002 UM over XIII.\n\nIf you are okay with the slightly outdated graphics and you are a fan of fighting games, you should definitely pick this up.\n\nSingle Player: There isn't really any story in 2002 UM as it is a "dream match" where they take all the best characters (doesn't matter if they are alive or dead in the main story) from past games and throw them together into teams. As I don't generally care too much about the story in fighters, I'm more than okay with this. If you are looking for a Blazblue-like single player experience, then you might be a bit disappointed.\n\nHowever there are multiple final bosses so there is some re-play value to it. You can choose your team size between 1 or 3 characters. Also unlike in XIII, the AI actually does fight you back properly on the harder difficulties.\n\nMultiplayer: Local and online available. Netcode is decent. Pretty much as good as you can get with input delay based netcode. Matches with players close to you (for example, I live in Europe and I can play Norway/Denmark/Germany/France from Finland without any problems), but you will probably notice lag, if you try to play between two continents. You can set your max input delay manually (like in 98UM).\n\nChallenge mode: This one is a huge improvement over XIII. Instead of "Do this exact combo with tight timing" the challenges actually give you some freedom and are like "Do a combo from command normal into special into super" or "defeat these three bosses in a row".\n\nEndless mode: Pretty basic. Enemies get harder the further you go. I got somewhere between 250 and 300 stages, but then I Omega Rugal said I had gone too far.\n\nGame runs well on my mid-range gaming PC (Phenom II x4, HD6870, 4GB RAM) without struttering. Sometimes there is a slowdown when you get hit by a projectile (like in 98 UM), but I don't know if that is an innate problem in the original arcade game rather than being a problem with the port itself. All the character (includes secret and boss characters) are unlocked from the start, so you don't need to complete story and challenge mode just in order to play online with your friends.\n\nAchievements are a bit harder than 98 UM as you need to complete all the expert mode challenges, but definitely doable. I say it's a very enjoyable fighter easily worth the money (14,99€).","February 27, 2015","true","32.7"," 74 of 84 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","74","84","4","3"

Even if you already played the Neo-Geo version of KOF 2002, this one feels like a completely different game with all the changes. The stages and music are all-new, K9999 is overhauled into the new character Nameless, and even veteran characters like Terry and Mai are given new moves. The combo system is very deep without being cheap and unintuitive like in XIII, and the playable cast is even bigger than MvC2. It's not a 100% comprehensive representation of the Neo-Geo KOF series, but it's without a doubt the single finest example of it. I give 2002 UM my highest recommendation possible.","February 27, 2015","true","13.3"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","41","46","4","0"

At least the King of Fighters Series. This game plays well on an Intel Celeron 2.53ghz processor, and an Intel HD Graphics Card with 2GB Ram. The controls are surprisingly smooth with a Gamepad and the loading times are not there at all. The only thing I dislike in this version is the choose your fighter interface. There is also no "3D Backgrounds" like other remakes in the series had to enhance their appearance (look at King of Fighters 99 and Millineum Fight on DC for examples of 3D enhanced backgrounds. Hit detection is dead on for the most part but there is also some things there where the punches and kicks just don't land where they are supposed to. This is a a slightly minor annoyance probably enhanced by higher resolutions and or graphics filters. All in all this is a solid fighting game, even if it just has one title. I wish this game would have inlcluded the original KOF 2002 like the KOF 98 offering did here. Not a biggy but should be there to sweeten the deal. 8/10","July 4, 2015","true","0.4"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/recommended/222440/","cucumbericepepsi","telos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cucumbericepepsi/","669 products in account","Like the King of Fighters '98 UM FE port on Steam, The King of Fighters 2002 UM port has decent netcode. I play with someone about halfway across the US and don't ever have any lag problems regardless of what the ping indicator says. Just making it that far is a struggle for the more poorly coded games, so I would assume it's good enough for continental US. Anyway, now that the most important thing is out of the way...\n\nWhile 98UM FE feels pretty much like '98 to me, 2002UM feels significantly different than the 2002 I'm used to. Admittedly I've always been more of a '98 person so my playtime on 2002 isn't that high but this version feels much faster and the controls more fluid than I remember. The balance too is definitely better and most of the characters feel improved over the way they were before rather than nerfed (though there are some exceptions!). I still feel like there are some weird hitboxes, but that's not a terribly big deal compared to psycho ball cheese.\n\nThe presentation is improved, but there's only so much you can do with the ancient sprites. Whether portraits or menus pretty much everything is redrawn that isn't the actual sprites. There are new stages with cameos of other SNK characters too if you like that, but unfortunately no sort of filter to help alleviate your eyes of the pixels the size of your eyes for the actual sprites themselves.  More importantly though, the game also has an arranged soundtrack with the character themes in it. A pretty good one at that. It's one of the best additions for sure because the music Eolith put in 2002 was absolutely terrible.\n\n'98 may be a bit dated for people who didn't play fighting games before their revival with Street Fighter 4, but I feel this version of 2002 is definitely something that can be appreciated by both newer and older players alike. It's a much better port job than 98UM FE and a fast paced, exciting game. I'm hoping more classic fighters hit Steam soon.","March 10, 2015","true","71.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Just about every member of this game's huge 60+ character roster is lethal. Beginners may have a tough time with things like learning whole teams or executing some of the higher damaging combos for certain cast members but the game is generally forgiving due to it's focus on strong pokes, unlike KoF XIII which is centered around big damage from light-confirms. And much like most other KoF games, the focus here is movement options, which can leave players from more footsie-based games (like street fighter) feeling overwhelmed/stiff until they get a grip on how to move and how to counter the options.\n\nThe netcode is wonderful (comparable to GGPO in feel but it's actually not rollback based AFAIK)  but don't expect terrific performance on WiFi (fighting games generally hate dropped packets). My only gripe is a lack of matchmaking options and chat.\n\nAnd last but not least, the presentation of the game itself. The voice acting and music is superb (comparable to the likes of Guilty Gear) and I'd buy an OST CD if it was ever made available. Lots of stages if you care about that sort of thing. One fault I'd like to address here is the lack of color options / custom palletes.\n\nOverall this port of the game is the definitive version of an almost flawless fighting game and I'd say it's an instant buy if you're even remotely interested in the series.","July 24, 2015","true","105.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RX0Banshee/recommended/222440/","RX0Banshee","RX-0Banshee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RX0Banshee/","292 products in account","(My first-ever Steam review)\n\nThe Steam version of the Xbox360 port of The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match is great!  Having played KOF 2002 in the arcades  (back n 2002), KOF 2002 Unlimited Match for the Japanese Playstation 2 (which I still own), and the Xbox360 version of Unlimted Match (via Xbox Live), I can say that the Steam port is as good as the Xbox360 version it is based off of.  A handful of achievements and numerous 3vs3 and 1vs1 match options abound, but at the heart of it all, KOF 2002 Unlimted Match is a deep fighting game, yet decent online competitve experience.\n\nThose new to the King of Fighters series will find a MASSIVE roster of characters from which to choose from; each representing their own series from SNKPlaymore's extensive history of both fighting games and action-adventure titles.  From the Psycho Soldiers and the New Faces Team to multiple versions of Kyo Kusanagi and a completly revised K9999 (K-four nine) called "Nameless", Unlimited Match boasts a wealth of fighting styles and over-the-top moves to utilize against your opponents.  Offline, controls are sharp and responsive which means that special and desperation moves require precise motions to successfully execute (using a comtroller or arcade stick is highly recommended).  Combos are fairly easy to pull off and juggle combos abound.\n\nOnline, however, is where the port takes its beating.  As with nearly every fighting game that isn't say, Skullgirls, lag is and will be an issue.  Whether it actually works, there are a few online options that you can tweak in the options menu to reduce input lag (from 1 to 9) and see the input lag measured on-screen for your convenience.  Some matches will be decent, while others will be slow and painful to play; if you have been playing fighting games on Steam for a while, then it will be nothing new.\n\nAs for this port, everything from the console version has been replicated flawlessly (including the widescreen boarders, which you can change via a few options).  Graphics-wise, there are a standard host of resolutions and sprite sharpening options to suit your preferences; however, keep in mind that the Steam version is based of a game from over a decade ago, so the graphics will obviously have aged...badly, when compared to other fighting games.  The Endless Mode is simply a survival mode, while Challenge Mode requires you to master character combos with the utmost precision and skill to advance to the next challenge.  Rounding this out is a completely "new" soundtrack (the arcade version of 2002 had a different soundtrack) that hosts great remixes of famous themes while adding many new arrangements.\n\nOverall, The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match is a great fighting game for local versus play, but for online, the lag and latency hurt it and keep it from being a top-tier option for those wanting to prove their online superiority against others.  Only time will tell if the port developers continue to fix the and tweak the netcode to where it is good enough to make the majority of players happy.","February 27, 2015","true","6.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

This game boasts the largest roster of any KoF game so far and will have a very familiar max cancel system to those coming from XIII.\n\nLet's get right down to it. It's an XBLA port, so it's the Tougeki version. That means this is the arcade version that has all of the latest balance changes. If you've played the XBLA version, it's that but with playable online, input delay features, and every character unlocked at the beginning.\n\nFor those that haven't, it includes your typical arcade mode with single play and team play. You have your versus modes, you can fight the CPU, etc. Endless mode is there to grind it out and see how far you can make it. Online mode has both player and ranked, but you stay in the same lobby in ranked. It's not something I've ever seen in a fighter, but whatever.\n\nSince this is based off of the XBLA version you'll get the AST, 2D backgrounds, and no fancy camera intro. All of which are an exact 1:1 of the arcade version.\n\nHere's the bottom line, if you're buying this because you want an arcade perfect port with playable online, you're making the right choice. If you want all the bells and whistles of the PS2 version like 3D backgrounds, color editor, gallery, etc. Well, this isn't probably for you. If you just want it to play with a friend, buy it now.\n\nPersonally, being arcade perfect and able to play online is far more important to me.

(In my humble opinion, of course)\n\nI dont know, but I fell like my review is going to be biased by the fact that I played a lot of this game back in the days it was released, so its a game very dear to me, and seeing it back here on Steam in this improved version is so amazing!\n\nThe Roster\n\nFirst, you should know that this is not the regular version of KOF 2002, but the Unlimited Match version, which includes tons of extra features. One of them is the expanded roster, which includes not only the original KOF2002 chars, but also each and every char from KOF 99 to KOF 2002. So, chars like Kasumi, Heidern, Shingo and many others were add to the cast, making the character selection screeen became HUGE!\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nThe gameplay of a Kof game is basically a faster and furious version of Street Fighter. Its very combo heavy and demands a lot of practice from the player. So be prepared to spend a lot of time in the training mode practicing your set ups and combos, because the players you will find online do it a lot. Also, as I said before, this version contains aditional features, which are some new moves and specials for many chars, so it will surprise the kof veterans a bit, in a good way.\n\nThe Online Play\n\nThe whole point of a fighting game in the era of the internet is to play online, as most local arcades have closed down. So Kof 2002 UM includes an online play feature, with both Player Matches (casual) and Ranked Matches. But here is the thing: there are only a few players online and you will only find random online fighters on the weekends. Most of the online play in this game is made via your own friend list. That is: you add people from your country our nearby countries and, when they are online, you ask them to play with you. Thats how the online play has been working for the kof games here on Steam. ITS NOT DEAD, it just works the way I described.\n\nFinal Veredict\n\nOverall its a pretty solid fighting game made for those who are really into the genre and like a fast paced fighter. Its also a classic game from the arcade era and playing it might be very nostalgic to some (like me). This Unlimited Match version actually improves the game a lot by adding new features like more chars, moves and the online mode, thus making the game even better.\n\nI rate it 9.0 / 10.0","May 7","true","13.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

This version added more rosters from predecessors (correct me if I am wrong) and game tweaks. The fighting mechanics work well, but they're missing the juggle from the console version which is my favourite thing in fighting games genre. They added the multiplayer as well but the community is dead anyway. Controllers are welcome as well.\n\n+ Pros\n+ Added fighters from predecessors\n+ Around 50 rosters\n+ Endless Mode\n+ Controller support\n+ 2 player support split screen (one with keyboard and controller or 2 controllers for fair match)\n+ Satisfying MAX2 moves\n\n- Cons\n- Juggling is missing\n- Tough boss fight (Even when you put CPU level 3 on Options)\n- Multiplayer is dead\n- Skill List seems to be weird (There are some Russian language for other fighters and some complex MAX2 moves for some fighters)\n\nAround 50 rosters, MAX2 moves for comeback and Endless mode seems to be a great addition, but they miss out the juggle mechanic on PC version which is what I was really disappointed. But that doesn't mean the game is unenjoyable. Overall, it is really hard to recommend for newcomers and KOF veterans on this version. This is probably the only fighting game I would spend on while waiting for Tekken 7 coming on PC or console if it's not going to happen. I would recommend Street Fighter, Skullgirls, Blazblue, Guilty Gear and King of Fighters XIII if you want a decent fighting game on PC.","April 18","true","24.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While this game is a big upgrade to a previous game, I could not help but compare the difference between it's predecessor KOF02 for the neo geo and this game KOF02UM.\n\nThe Pros:\n- Excellent soundtrack for each team and boss characters\n- the teams seem to have their own stages.\n- The bosses from KOF99 to KOF01 are present and playable\n- The characters not found in KOF02 such as Lin, May Lee and Jhun are here in KOF02UM\n- Many different modes to choose from such as practice, challenge and online\n- certain artwork opens when you win against Rugal as a team\n- Most MAX2 moves are changed.  They are easier to remember and perform now.\n- Some characters' moves or properties have been changed or added.  EX - Heidern's Neck Rolling is now unblockable.  EX- Xiang Fei's super is a string of commands.\n\nThe Cons:\n- Bosses can be overwhelmingly difficult.\n- The win quotes for each character are the same no matter who you win against.  EX - Ralf has a certain quote when he wins against a female on the last round in KOF02.  It does not show any personality for the characters.\n- There is no gallery for the artwork [as far as I see].  As far as artwork is concerned, I like it in color but that is personal preference.\n- You only get one chance against Rugal\n- no story/background for each team.  Need to find external source to read about it.  If they added it as unlockable material in this game, then it would be amazing in my opinion.\n- In KOF98 and previous games, your teammates would be in the background cheering their team.  In this game, it is not here.  Another personal preference by me.\n\nOverall, I like this game.  I would recommend buying it when it is at a discount.\n","January 26","true","68.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In the Xbox Live Arcade version you had to play through Endless Mode, or Arcade Mode and defeat that specific character. So if ya suck. you don't have to worry about it.\n\nAnd if you didn't know already.

I came from KOFXIII andS SVC Chaos back to this after having not touched it for over a decade. It's always great when an arcade game when a good port, and the online works great for matching up with friends.\n\nThis is a lot faster than '98 and it doesn't have XI's tag system, but the combo game is intense and there is a lot of variability with even basic bread-and-butter inputs.  Ifeel this game is pretty acessible, plusall the characters are balanced really well (save the bonus characters from the arcade, the boss characters and various console exclusives, or the shadow/chaos variant of some character, like Shadow Chris), so you can feel fairly confident hitting Edit Random and learning different characters rather than just your main. There is also a huge amount of depth to the game though; there are challenge modes that are great for building general fighting game skills, and the amount of different ways you can do combos with different moves is insane.\n\n9/10, Favourite SNK Playmore game and one of the GOAT fighting games.","February 16","true","23.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To see a masterpiece completely remade and brought into Steam. This game is perfect for those fans who are looking for that nostalgic feel of 2D fighters, while enjoying fast paced battles with very good music to help induce the hype.\n\nThe graphics have been improved, the gameplay as well (to a very good extent) and you have a huge roster of 66 characters to choose from (including bosses and EX versions of a few characters!), all unlocked from the start!\n\nNot only that, but the achievements in this game are a real challange to get, giving the feel that you are actually achieving something worth fighting for! What more could you ask for?\n\nThe only things in this game that may be a reason to complain are: The controls aren't really that good for the keyboard (you will most likely have a hard time with difficult inputs such as Nameless' Rasen super) and you will often see yourself playing with more simple characters like Iori, Ralf or the Kyo Clones (which, in my opinion were a really good adition for those who like Kyo's old design and moveset better).\n\nThere is no story in this game, making it simply a character mosh pit (much like Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 though this games' roster is bigger) so fans who wish to get to know their favourites will probably be disappointed.\n\nAnd don't think you can play this as you would Street Fighter, or else you're going to have a hard time! ;)\n\nIn the end...\n\nI give this a solid: 9\10!","June 17, 2015","true","40.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The roster of 2002 is way bigger than in XIII, (there are 66 fighters for you to pick!) i really like the pixelated style of the game and many characters got an overhaul by getting new moves added to their moveset.\nThe controls are fluent, the special moves are easy to remember and use and i also like the fact that it actually makes a difference if you do a special move with either a light kick or a hard kick, that adds a lot more strategy to the fights.\n\nThe netcode of this game is a mixed bag, sometimes the netcode is really good, the game is fluent but other times the game runs really slow and / or choppy, but most of the time it's good. You can also see the ping difference between you and the guy you want to play against in the lobby, so if the ping is too high, you can still leave or kick the guy.\n\nThe developers are also very close to the community, they patch the game regulary and the community as a whole is very helpful.\n\nSo overall, if you enjoy fighting games with a huge variety of characters and a very high learning curve (and if you are not afraid to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you online) get this game.

The sprite filter options are here but have minimal effect.\nAs said elsewhere in the review section, there is a distinct "line" around the sprites, hightened even more by the fact that the backgrounds in this port have been forced into hi-rez.\nThe screen scrolling, as your character moves left and right, suffers from judder, despite constant frame rate.\nAll this makes your inputs feel laggy.\nI have seen others point out these problems in the reviews and they get thumbed down.\nLikewise, in the forums, they get accused of not appreciating "pixel art".\nThe issue is not a lack of love for pixels.

Basically, it's the ultimate resource for KoF, and I think this is the best overall roster list you can get right now. You can see the complete roster online, but you're really spoiled for choice with this game!\n\nIt also has great controller support. Both my Xbox 360 pad and my SNES pad work perfectly, which isn't all that common for the SNES pad. And of course, keyboard is there for those that want it.\n\nTHE BAD\nThere's not really a story mode though, and this means there's no character interaction beyond the intro to a fight, where some characters might have a unique animation+sound depending on who they meet (e.g. Shingo vs Kyo). But keep in mind it's all Japanese audio with no subs.\n\n\nTHE ONLINE\nKoF13 has connectivity issues, but in 2002 Ultimate Match online play actually works! However, you may have to "shop around" players for a decent ping (there are no servers, it's all peer to peer). I've found anything up to 250ms to be perfectly smooth while 500 was unplayable.\n\nOnline play is dependent entirely on ping, so if your opponent is based far away, the game will slow down to keep both players exactly in sync. This means that you can play with anyone in the world and have an equal chance to win, but far away players result in the game being played in slow motion! The closer you are to them, the faster the gaming experience.\nYou can see someone's ping before you play with them and cancel out if it's too high, but if you accidentally go ahead, there's no way of quitting without forcing the game to close via Windows!\n\nPossible Tip: There's a setting in the Network section of the Options menu that lets you change the frame count for input when online. Normally it's set to 9, but after changing it to 3 I got far better pings on opponents. It could be coincidence, but it's unclear how they've implemented their netcode.","June 12, 2015","true","22.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not as mecahnically deep or charming as KoF98 nor as polished and accessible as KoF XIII but it does have the biggest roster of characters in the series with the biggest selection of moves each. That may sound like faint praise but because they're so well implamented and reasonably well balanced (bosses aside), with few characters being truely identcal in playstyle, then it adds a richness to the game that even the other two can't match - there's something here for everyone both visually and gameplay wise which gives it a lot of replay value.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3krok/recommended/222440/","3krok","FΛLCO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3krok/","22 products in account","One of my personal favorite fighters and the perfect KOF experience, and a fine example of SNK Playmore's work and fighting games in general. Boasting a huge roster of over sixty characters, all with different movesets, beautifully designed stages and a deep combo system, KOF02UM is easily the pick of KOF games on Steam and in general, 'Unlimited' is definitely a word that's perfect for the game, due to how big it is.\n\n2002 Unlimited is an expansion of the Dream Match game The King of Fighters 2002, both games have no story, but the single player experience is still very fresh while keeping things "KOF". There are Arcade modes for both 3v3 and 1v1, as well as challenges, an endless mode, as well as free Player vs CPU battles, and of course, a mode that allows you to practice and perfect your skills and special moves.\n\nThe multiplayer experience is just as expansive, allowing both Team and Single battles online and offline, something not available in most KOF games. Though SNK Playmore isn't known for providing the best netplay experience, it's definitely worth a shot, especially if you have a friend to play Player Match with.\n\nThe sprites, although pretty retro, still hold up quite well now, with some nice shading detail and coloring and a pretty range of palettes. The stages are beautifully designed and the music is enough to get any player pumped for a three on three rumble.\n\nDespite a couple of downsides [lack of color editor and plot.], 02UM has many hours of gameplay to offer, while keeping to what's truly KOF and not blowing new players off of their feet with too much to do. Whether or not you're trying to get into KOF, or you've played it before and you're looking for more, 2002 Unlimited is the next direction to go by far.","February 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

Definitely go wired.\n\nAlso, in true KoF fashion, prepare to have your face rammed into the ground by SNK Boss Syndrome.

I don't want to come across as arrogant, but I know what i'm talking bout when it comes to 2D fighters.\n\nREAL REVIEW FOLLOWS\n\nPros:\n+Great soundtracks\n+Huge roster with very diverse characters\n+Amazing online play\n+Nostalgiac pixelated graphics\n+Smooth gameplay\n+Steam Trading Cards :)\n\nCons:\n-Small number of online players\n-No story/career mode (not really a problem with endless, team play and challange)\n\nFirst of all, the all important graphics. While the pixelated arcade fighter graphics may be a major turn off for some people- and believe me, I initially didn't want to buy a pixelated fighter, however my graphics card would not allow that- it really, REALLY works with the game. You really get the feeling of playing a traditional 2D fighter. Once you start getting into the game, it really doesn't bother you. You want the pixelated graphics. You want the artwork border. And you want it to be hard to tell if a character is half nude or not (helps a lot when a parent comes in the room ;)\n\nOnline gameplay is amazingly smooth. If you have a lower end computer, you may experience very minimal lag, otherwise you'll play as if it was you versus the AI. There's actually a setting to limit the amount of frame lag there can possibly be in your match. The only problem is that there aren't too many players online all the time. Try playing later in the day, or grab a friend.\n\nNow for the actual gameplay. KoF 2002 UM's mechanics and responsiveness is golden. Never have i had a game related problem with playing the game, not even online. This means maybe I messed up a combo move, but i've never had the game cause me to mess it up. Every character is balanced and equally powerful in my opinion. Some moves are more powerful than others, some more annoying than others. But that's one of the main components of a fighting game: every character is different and takes a different level of skill to master. There are some characters designed for veteran players- namely May, who has two different play modes in one- and some designed for beginners- namely Bao, who has a very simple moveset.\n\nThe actual roster is expansive, much larger than most fighting games including SSF4:AE, with 66 playable characters. About 60 if you discount the Orochis and secret form characters. For younger players, players with protective parents or Muslims (like me), most of the females are actually dressed decently, and I would confidently play as them in front of my parents. Stay away from Angel♥, Mai, Vice, Mature, Blue Mary, Leona, Foxy, Vanessa and Shermie. If you choose Hinako, be aware that she may panty flash you at the beginning of the match.\n\nJust about every other aspect of the game is perfect. This is a great purchase for fighter fans and those looking for an exuse to smash their best friend's face in. If overpriced at all, I would say only by about a cent. Maybe 2 cents. If you really don't want to pay full price, grab it on sale. I got my copy and a friend's for about 6$.\n\nThanks for reading my long♥ss review. Goodl uck becoming the the King of Fighters!

I own all of SNK's games on Steam, and I say: this game sucks.\n\nI _know_ this game has lots of fans and all, and many who appreciate its style. However, I'd _really_ rather stick to '98 and XIII, because they're original, unique, have a good feel, good music, good graphics, nice characters, are overall solidly built and have a good flow. 2002, even UM, is unoriginal, lame, plastic and rotten. If you're an old-time lover of this game, of course you love it, but if you're new to the series, stick to '98 and XIII, they're both excellent, deep and rewarding to learn.\n\nIf you wanna try it, see for yourself; maybe you can like it. I'm still trying, but as for now, I wish I could get a refund.","April 13, 2015","false","22.7"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","6","22","2","5"

Decent netcode if you stay continental. Just don't be rebuted by character graphics and you'll find a deep game.\n\n\nLong version :\nthis game is an updated kof2002. Some characters return from previous years, some had changes. Also, it incorporates the latests tweaks from arcade version.\n\nThe base system is from 2002 (max mode, super cancels, max supers, max2 supers), however some important tweaks allow better overall balance and usefulness.\nMax and Max2 supers are doable directly, outside of max mode, for 1 additional bar (so 3 bars in total). This makes some Max and Max2 much more useful and relevent, like Maxima Max Maxima Revenger and Max Arch enemy, Takuma Max2 reversal or Angel Max reversal because you don't have to enter max mode.\nSuper during max mode doesn't cost another bar, it simply ends max mode. Also a super cancel during max mode also doesn't cost bar, so a combo in max mode like normal>special>supercancel-super would only cost 1 bar for entering max mode.\nQuick Max still costs 2 levels total (1 for cancel, 1 for max mode).\n\nAll the above plus the numerous tweaks on characters movesets make the game extremelly well balanced.\nThere are 66 characters in total. Not including bosses which have more health and unfair movesets, and counting alternate versions, this leaves a total of 61 characters, which is nothing short of staggering.\n\nBackground graphics are nice, if a little flat because they use 2D.\nCharacter graphics are probably the game's weak point. They're blocky and worst of all the filtering options don't do a lot.\nBecause the game is 2D, it's requirements are very low, and even low end laptops can play it fine.\nSound is great with good voice and effect quality and numerous themes remixes.\nControls are top notch, use of a gamepad or an arcade stick is heavily recommended. Works with direct input devices (AKA many gamepads and PS3 wired sticks and pads).\n\nNetcode is good if you manage to stay under 350ms of ping. Find players within your continent and you'll be fine.\nThe game has also local versus play of course.\n\nFor me, it's the best fighting game to this day. It's only held back by outdated character graphics, but don't let that detract you from the immense depth this game has.","December 31, 2015","true","403.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
