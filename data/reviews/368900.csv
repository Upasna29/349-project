All the problems would’ve been observed and maybe fixed before the release. As it is now, it’s pretty unplayable.

There's little to no reward for completing any part of the game (unlockable skins don't really do it for me), annoying, repetitive music, an uninteresting and very unoriginal story which includes dull characters and rounds off with generic and poorly executed gameplay mechanics. This game unfortunately, did not reach its potential to be a fun and quirky little platformer. However, the developers only have themselves to blame as basic game testing from an external source could have easily pointed out some of the game's biggest flaws (e.g. camera obscuring your view, poor shadows to make jumping inconsistent and difficult to assess, momentum effecting Bob's placement etc.).\n\nConclusion: Tries to be Super Meat Boy 3D ends up as Pointless Purple Block of Turd 3D.

Granted, I haven't put that much time into this yet, but with over 1300 games in steam it will take a while before most of my games have respectable playtime. The controls feel pretty good to me, and the environments are nice to look at. This game has a simplistic feel to it that reminds me of some of the n64 games of my childhood.  I only have 2 issues with this game, but with the $1 I spent on it I can't complain.  The first issue is the music, which is repetitive and restarts with each level. The second issue is the story. I figure this game would be better without a story than the one showcased when you launch the game. Some might call this a quick cash grab with unity assets, but the gameplay is fun for a few bucks. Its one of those games that I goof around with on one monitor while watching TV on the other. -PR0XIDIAN","June 14, 2015","true","0.1"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","22","38","5","0"

Said and done - fools gave it away for free and here I am. NEAT. Let's get straight to buiness.\n\nThis. Title. Is. Bad. First of all let's talk about art style. No effort or no talent - I don't know, maybe both. UGLY. Just look at this main font! Good God... By the way, main char - this "BOB" - doesn't look like purple Meat Boy, oh fиcking no, not one bit!\n\nGameplay is pure generity and tediousity. Just ultra-mediocre boring 3D platformer - no creativity, no real challenge, bad cam angles, you name the sнit.\n\nAnd about "story"... Doncha even get me started...\n\nOk, I think some croatian punks just wanted to have fun and create a game. Yeah, no problem, suit yourselves, except it made it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way on Steam! Look, Greenlight is a great stuff for young  TALENTED   devs. But considering how many disgusting abominations it let loose, Valve should rethink this scheme IMfHO. So not a single of indie-dev-wannabes spoils the whole damn thang.","November 23, 2015","false","6.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","0"

You never explore the other bigger Landscapes, they are only for Decoration. And listening to the same boring Music is also not fun too.\n\nThen also Game Mechanic suxx, the Double Jump sometimes work sometimes not and the vanishing Plattforms are not visibly different then normal Plattforms, so no way to anticipate. Also it's even worse, they vanish even if you touch them from below or from the side and not if you actually land on them, which is simply buggy.\n\nAnd if you are standing on those moving Plattform they slip away under your ♥♥♥ and Air Control also lacks Control. And the Camera is awful, should be mapped to right Stick but is mapped in LB/RB and not a real Camera, it's more a turn left, turn right, no free Cam so not really useful for 3D.\n\nThis Game could have been fun, but seems execution was messed up and it also looks unfinished, perhaps a glimpse at Woodle Tree Adventures would help, it's not an ultra great Game either, but use the same Assets and at least offers some fun.\n\nThis Game is only frustrating and boring, so i'm sorry but i'm forced to move it to the Scrapyard.","December 5, 2015","false","2.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

You have to use the Q and E keys instead of them, so you can only turn your camera at one specific speed which is too slow for this game, not only this but you can't look up or down so it's difficult to tell the distance of the platforms, when you turn your camera it is not centred on the character but offset so if you turn your camera whilst jumping it will ruin your jump.\n\nThe main challenge in this game is being able to jump off the timed platforms whilst your camera is facing the wrong direction because you are not given enough time to adjust it with the Q and E keys. There are also more things I don't like.\n\n1.Disappearing Platforms start to dissapear before you have even landed on them, you only have to be near them. - If you clip the edge or the bottom of a platform it will begin to vanish.\n2. When moving platforms change direction they knock you about and can even knock you off the platform without you pressing anything, this feels pretty clunky in my opinion.\n4. The game sometimes doesn't let you double jump making you die. More Frequent on the Spinning platforms and disappearing Platforms\n5. There are far too many disappearing Platforms\n\nI don't understand why the game doesn't allow you to turn the camera with a mouse, or automatically adjust it for you.","August 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerzgaming/recommended/368900/","gamerzgaming","Gamer Z","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerzgaming/","140 products in account","Brilliant Bob is a 3D Platformer with a simple plot and diverse environments. The graphics are simple built on the Unity3D Engine making the game look goofy and cartoony. This game probably would have made it in the Top 10 platformers, but there is one huge flaw in this game.\n\nThe platforming itself. Yes, the platforming. To beginner players, the controls are odd and very awkward to get used to. The camera is fixed in one position, however you can use Q and E to rotate it. Double jumping is a feature and you need it for almost any jump in this game. The jumping in this game is sadly flawed as the collisions don't like you and you will slide off if you just barely make it. Also, for a platformer, you jump very low and double jumping is absolutely required for every jump in this game except for the ones that you can just walk across. Once you get the hang of it though, you will be able to get the jumps.\n\nThe enemies in this game are unrelenting and match your speed making them hard to lose. Slimes, your #1 enemy in the beginner levels, are just as fast as you and hard to kill (throwing crates at them is hard; you can't aim, and they are on you in 3 seconds). The most annoying part about the slimes is that you jump on them like trampolines. No kidding, you can actually use them as trampolines. However, it gets annoying when you try to jump to certain areas or move in a certain direction. I think this game would be better without those damn slimes. Other enemies like the spinning cubes are pretty neat entities. Some levels, you have to jump through them and if you touch the sides, you get hurt. This allows for some pretty tough platforming and some rage-inducing levels which may or may not be fun for some people.\n\nOne thing I liked about this game is the physics. Holding shift allows you to move and throw boxes and use them to your advantage when trying\nto make a difficult jump. I belive that in some cases, the crates are not needed and only get in the way. However, they do allow you to do some really cool things like jump really far and glitch out the game.\n\nThe storyline is a generic Ironic Comedy - The happy town of Sekotwana thrives as Bob lives there for 20 years. However, Dr. Magazi's planet is a sad and lonely one that needs happiness. Magazi then goes to the town of Sekotwana to steal their happiness with his little De-Happiness gun. Ben's parents do not like this and rebel against Dr. Magazi and Bob goes to destroy his Ship. Meanwhile, Bob's parents are kidnapped by Dr. Magazi and Bob must go find his parents before it's too late. The story is simple, easy to follow and comprehend, and somewhat a cliché, but also a fun and\ncompelling one.\n\nI haven't gotten really far into the game, but I plan to try to beat it. The game is fun for a short time; this game was not meant to be played in a 2 hour binge, marathon or speedrun. If you get this game, it is best to play it in short bursts or it will get very annoying very quickly.\n\nIf there is someone out there with an account for their child, then this is a must-buy. This game is a good one for children, but teens and adults probably won't be interested in it.\nAlso, I got this game for 29 cents. Please, spare your money and do not buy this game for the full price ($9.99 at the time of writing). The game can be fun, but it is not worth that much money.","August 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","2"

It is very hard to movement your... thing... around the stage.\nAnd, to make things even harder, the movements are slippy. When you reach a platform your character will not firmly stand there but, instead, slip for a bit, making you probably fall from the stage.\nThe camera is pretty bad, it should have a 45º/90º instead of a at-your-will-angle, this system only makes it harder because you'll waste more time trying to get the good angle for the jumps. The jumps, by the way, are really hard, it doesn't feel responsive at all.\nOh, also, be careful with the ending-point of the stage. Since it levitates your character, but doesn't lock him, if you movement a bit, he will also probably fall from the platform.\n\nThe story is pretty simple and actually makes not much sense. I mean, what, the dude had a teleport all along? Why the rocket then?! And how come the protagonist's family simply decided to not be part of the effects of the enemy? It is not something that you can decide.\n\nI had my fuse blown when the game asked for you to movement a box and it couldn't really push/pull that box without it looking ridiculous and not pushing/pulling it AT ALL. Just a few milimeters by milimeters.\nAlso, by these box there first some enemies who you had to kill with a... poison box, I guess? Anyway, the enemies are so fast that when they hit you, they throw you up and you can't ever land on the floor again. GOD THIS IS HORRIBLE\n\nI guess I'm looking too much into it, huh? Yeah, well, don't buy it, it is not worth even selling the trading cards.

Play through level 8 and you will understand what I mean.\n\nPeople are quick to scream Game of the Year but I've never played a game I felt so strongly deserved it.

That is because it is really difficult to play. The concept by itself is easy. Some alien guy kidnaps your family and you have to save them. The game by itself looks okay. But the controls. I'm telling you, there is nothing more frustrating than the controls. I just can't seem to figure them out!\n\nSo, Brilliant Bob is a cheap game, but you really shouldn't buy it if you like games that have fluent controls.

Runs on Unity and the graphics feel similar to Zelda 64 and Mario 64 textures. Nothing bad but outdated a little. The game itself is pretty fun aside from a few bugs I mention in the video below. Definitely an aggravating game at some points and will test your patience. Typical story line of Village destroyed and out for revenge. All in all its an ok game, I had a fun time playing it and I will recommend it to people that enjoy this type of game. It's definitely user preference.

In my opinion I would of said it to be more of a 3D Platformer. Not really the most action packed game-play. For me this game was more of a chilled down experience. After the first 30 minutes of game-play the music had gotten repulsive for me. So, listening to your favorite music online while playing the game mute was very enjoyable for me.\n\n\n\nPros\nFun game-play\nChallenging Level Design\nProactive Developers\nInteresting Story (To an extent at least)\nAddicting and Enraging Game-Play\n\n\n\nNow let me explain\nBy Fun game-play I mean that you will indeed get some giggles out of the game's physics, and its visual quality settings.\nChallenging and Addicting and Enraging Game-Play work hand and hand. The game-play at times makes you really want to beat it. At points I felt as that I was getting angrier over a square purple guy not being able to jump on a green cylinder, than if I was to be playing Counter-Strike and having a "troll" in the lobby. Next, what do I mean by Interesting Story? Well I mean that it tells you who you are, what you’re doing, and why you’re doing it. I like to know what is going on in the story to give me little thought on the game itself. The begging cut scene was enough for me to be happy about. I understood who I was, what I was doing, and why I was doing it. It would have been nice to have interlining story with the game-play, maybe every 10 levels adding in to the progress in the story would have been more pleasurable, but it did its job.\n\n\n\nCons\nDiscombobulation with the store (for me, maybe not everyone else)\nSomewhat glitchy walls\nPhysics\n\n\n\nAgain, lets restate.\nNow, I had trouble finding very many "flaws" with the game. So the most irritating things are what got on the cons list. Let us start. So discombobulation with the store, by this I meant that their weren't a great deal of "bobllars" for me to pick up per level. So buying the different bob costumes was, and still is, a hard challenge for me. I understand that the point of it is to be a reward, but not to the point where bob could sign up for wellfare. Next, by the glitchy walls, I mean the fact that you can run and partially jump up some walls. I understand that it did help me with some levels, but got very annoying when I accidentally jump up to a wall, and then accidentally double jump making me go all over the place and ending up falling off of the map. Next were the physics. The physics were completely fine when I got used to them, but first starting out made me question why Bob's world felt like the moon x10. In all honesty, its not exactly a con. Just something that bothered me throughout the whole experience.\n\n\n\nFirst look: 7.5/10\n\n\n\nAll in all, Brilliant Bob is a great game. I did enjoy its challenge. It made me want to explore every which way I can to try to figure out different levels. I would recommend this game at full price for any person that loves platformer games. If your just looking for a quick 1-2 hour fun, wait till it’s on sale.\n\nMy personal thoughts on it?\nWell I'd like to say that it is great! I'm going to spend alot of time continually playing this game until I fully complete it, and I recommend that you guys do to.","May 21, 2015","true","2.2"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","12","30","0","5"

Why have a double jump when it could just be a higher single jump? Well, let me tell you why that would be a bad idea: because then I wouldn't be able to glitch jump up walls after unfairly falling down them! That's right, falling is something you will do a TON.\n\nThe design choices for the enemies are poor as well. The enemy you will have the most encounters with in the first 20 levels is the basic slime enemy, which comes in many different variations. Well, they're all basically the same, but they are each colored differently and deal more damage as you progress! The other enemy you'll encounter in the first 20 levels is this floating spinning cube with bones painted on the side, and these are a pain. They just sit there, but in the level they're implemented in, they're too close together and you unfairly get hurt by them because you're trying to fit yourself between them to move past.\n\nI HATED the moving platforms, which also come in many different terrible variations. There are some smaller platforms which move in a set path, but abruptly change direction with no indication so they end up moving from under your feet when you're trying to land on one. Another type of platform is the spinning log, which there are two of them. One spins on the z-axis which is interesting in concept but you'll most likely slip off them before you have time to enjoy their existance. The other type of log spins on its x-axis, but this one you won't even move with, they just move out from under you, meaning you have to slowly walk along with it's movement, which is VERY annoying because of the slipping issue I just mentioned.\n\nLevel 16 is the worst level in any game I've ever played. Moving platforms and spinning logs. Enough said.\n\nSometimes this game likes to pretend it's a puzzle game or something by throwing a bunch of cardboard boxes at you, which you can pick up or destroy at your own leisure but LOOK OUT, if you destroy a box you needed, you have to restart the level. It's really dumb how there's a tutorial on how to handle the cardboard boxes, yet you never really see any of them past the first 5 levels.\n\nYou know you did something wrong with your game if the player has more fun MOVING AROUND ON THE SCENERY IN THE BACKGROUND then in the ACTUAL LEVEL. That's right, if you fall to your death in a couple levels, sometimes you won't even die, you'll just land on the scenery. If this happens, just move around and have fun because pressing "R" will force you to replay the level again.\n\nThis game is not worth the $10 I spent on it. Wait for it to go on sale to like $1, and even then it's a stretch to say it's worth the money. If playing really awfully controlled games is how you like to spend your boredom, then more power to you. But I'm going to go back to my $1 games that are actually GOOD. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS. Even the "recommended" reviews are straight up saying "game has bad controls but that's cool". Gosh, I wish I had my 2 hours back. Most of that was spent on level 16 anyways.","August 27, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Platforms that once you have touched them they disappear in like 3 seconds, which means you've got to move the camera and jump at the same time). A very important thing you should know is that the lobby is also a parkour. You have to do a parkour to get to the level you left on, and it's pretty annoying.

Frustrating as hell though, especially if you are greedy like me and want to collect all the bobllars. Many levels are fairly beatable if you just want to complete it. But collecting those bobllars is entirely different... For instance, there are levels where you basically have to jump back down near the start and basically redo the entire (already frustrating) level just for one extra little bobllar. Others put 10-20 in really easily-failable spots, so completing the level might take 2-3 tries but collecting all of them $ could end up taking 100 tries. 10/10 frustrating for people who like collecting all the $$$.\n\nNot really sure why everyone is complaining about the jumping being so terrible. Yes, the shadow is on his side so you dont see it when jumping, but it doesn't take long to figure out the physics of the game. After the first couple levels, I never really had any time where he jumped in a completely different spot than intended. I never felt I was "guessing" on a jump. The most frustrating parts to me were only being able to single jump off falling platforms if you time it a split-second too late (and theres a TON of falling platforms, and lots of situations where timing is wicked important), having to time jumps on moving platforms that switch directions at inopportune times, hitting my head on a dissappearing platform above me, making it dissappear when i need it a second late, and getting stuck in the little dirt divots on the ground (intentional i'm assuming).\n\nBought it on sale and recommend when on sale again.

Why have a double jump when it could just be a higher single jump? Well, let me tell you why that would be a bad idea: because then I wouldn't be able to glitch jump up walls after unfairly falling down them! That's right, falling is something you will do a TON.\n\nThe design choices for the enemies are poor as well. The enemy you will have the most encounters with in the first 20 levels is the basic slime enemy, which comes in many different variations. Well, they're all basically the same, but they are each colored differently and deal more damage as you progress! The other enemy you'll encounter in the first 20 levels is this floating spinning cube with bones painted on the side, and these are a pain. They just sit there, but in the level they're implemented in, they're too close together and you unfairly get hurt by them because you're trying to fit yourself between them to move past.\n\nI HATED the moving platforms, which also come in many different terrible variations. There are some smaller platforms which move in a set path, but abruptly change direction with no indication so they end up moving from under your feet when you're trying to land on one. Another type of platform is the spinning log, which there are two of them. One spins on the z-axis which is interesting in concept but you'll most likely slip off them before you have time to enjoy their existance. The other type of log spins on its x-axis, but this one you won't even move with, they just move out from under you, meaning you have to slowly walk along with it's movement, which is VERY annoying because of the slipping issue I just mentioned.\n\nLevel 16 is the worst level in any game I've ever played. Moving platforms and spinning logs. Enough said.\n\nSometimes this game likes to pretend it's a puzzle game or something by throwing a bunch of cardboard boxes at you, which you can pick up or destroy at your own leisure but LOOK OUT, if you destroy a box you needed, you have to restart the level. It's really dumb how there's a tutorial on how to handle the cardboard boxes, yet you never really see any of them past the first 5 levels.\n\nYou know you did something wrong with your game if the player has more fun MOVING AROUND ON THE SCENERY IN THE BACKGROUND then in the ACTUAL LEVEL. That's right, if you fall to your death in a couple levels, sometimes you won't even die, you'll just land on the scenery. If this happens, just move around and have fun because pressing "R" will force you to replay the level again.\n\nThis game is not worth the $10 I spent on it. Wait for it to go on sale to like $1, and even then it's a stretch to say it's worth the money. If playing really awfully controlled games is how you like to spend your boredom, then more power to you. But I'm going to go back to my $1 games that are actually GOOD. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS. Even the "recommended" reviews are straight up saying "game has bad controls but that's cool". Gosh, I wish I had my 2 hours back. Most of that was spent on level 16 anyways.","August 27, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The look of the game itself looks as though it was made by a 16-year-old in a beginner's game design class at a high school, but the gameplay isn't too bad. Lets get down to the goods and the bads.\n\nGOOD:\n\n- Pleasant looking environment for how low quality the game feels\n- Fairly challenging levels for a game that looks like an early-childhood education game\n- Gameplay mechanics that are pretty responsive\n\nBAD:\n\n- The promise of an enthralling story is not really met, you just get a little cutscene at the beginning that you'll eventually end up skipping because of the booming music volume\n- One glitch where you can bounce on the heads of the slimes and just jump over to the platform that's supposed to only be accessible when you push the boxes over to the sides\n- The controls are pretty weird to get a hold of, but it's not too bad to be honest\n\nAll-in-all, this game deserves at least a 6/10, giving it my thumbs up.","February 13","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Frustrating as hell though, especially if you are greedy like me and want to collect all the bobllars. Many levels are fairly beatable if you just want to complete it. But collecting those bobllars is entirely different... For instance, there are levels where you basically have to jump back down near the start and basically redo the entire (already frustrating) level just for one extra little bobllar. Others put 10-20 in really easily-failable spots, so completing the level might take 2-3 tries but collecting all of them $ could end up taking 100 tries. 10/10 frustrating for people who like collecting all the $$$.\n\nNot really sure why everyone is complaining about the jumping being so terrible. Yes, the shadow is on his side so you dont see it when jumping, but it doesn't take long to figure out the physics of the game. After the first couple levels, I never really had any time where he jumped in a completely different spot than intended. I never felt I was "guessing" on a jump. The most frustrating parts to me were only being able to single jump off falling platforms if you time it a split-second too late (and theres a TON of falling platforms, and lots of situations where timing is wicked important), having to time jumps on moving platforms that switch directions at inopportune times, hitting my head on a dissappearing platform above me, making it dissappear when i need it a second late, and getting stuck in the little dirt divots on the ground (intentional i'm assuming).\n\nBought it on sale and recommend when on sale again.

Why have a double jump when it could just be a higher single jump? Well, let me tell you why that would be a bad idea: because then I wouldn't be able to glitch jump up walls after unfairly falling down them! That's right, falling is something you will do a TON.\n\nThe design choices for the enemies are poor as well. The enemy you will have the most encounters with in the first 20 levels is the basic slime enemy, which comes in many different variations. Well, they're all basically the same, but they are each colored differently and deal more damage as you progress! The other enemy you'll encounter in the first 20 levels is this floating spinning cube with bones painted on the side, and these are a pain. They just sit there, but in the level they're implemented in, they're too close together and you unfairly get hurt by them because you're trying to fit yourself between them to move past.\n\nI HATED the moving platforms, which also come in many different terrible variations. There are some smaller platforms which move in a set path, but abruptly change direction with no indication so they end up moving from under your feet when you're trying to land on one. Another type of platform is the spinning log, which there are two of them. One spins on the z-axis which is interesting in concept but you'll most likely slip off them before you have time to enjoy their existance. The other type of log spins on its x-axis, but this one you won't even move with, they just move out from under you, meaning you have to slowly walk along with it's movement, which is VERY annoying because of the slipping issue I just mentioned.\n\nLevel 16 is the worst level in any game I've ever played. Moving platforms and spinning logs. Enough said.\n\nSometimes this game likes to pretend it's a puzzle game or something by throwing a bunch of cardboard boxes at you, which you can pick up or destroy at your own leisure but LOOK OUT, if you destroy a box you needed, you have to restart the level. It's really dumb how there's a tutorial on how to handle the cardboard boxes, yet you never really see any of them past the first 5 levels.\n\nYou know you did something wrong with your game if the player has more fun MOVING AROUND ON THE SCENERY IN THE BACKGROUND then in the ACTUAL LEVEL. That's right, if you fall to your death in a couple levels, sometimes you won't even die, you'll just land on the scenery. If this happens, just move around and have fun because pressing "R" will force you to replay the level again.\n\nThis game is not worth the $10 I spent on it. Wait for it to go on sale to like $1, and even then it's a stretch to say it's worth the money. If playing really awfully controlled games is how you like to spend your boredom, then more power to you. But I'm going to go back to my $1 games that are actually GOOD. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS. Even the "recommended" reviews are straight up saying "game has bad controls but that's cool". Gosh, I wish I had my 2 hours back. Most of that was spent on level 16 anyways.","August 27, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For starters you don't move the camera with your mouse, you do it with the keys 'q' and 'e'. Really bad espeecially when you have to move the camera and you are standing in a vanishing platform. (Platforms that once you have touched them they disappear in like 3 seconds, which means you've got to move the camera and jump at the same time). A very important thing you should know is that the lobby is also a parkour. You have to do a parkour to get to the level you left on, and it's pretty annoying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/recommended/368900/","agw_ottawa","Sheep!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/","420 products in account","Per Wikipedia, the first 3D platforming game was Alpha Waves in 1990.  The breakthrough game that changed 3D platforming from a technical showpiece to an accepted genre was, of course, Super Mario 64 in 1996.  As the form improved, developers gradually found tricks to work around the biggest stumbling block of the genre; that even though you render your environment in 3D, a TV screen or a PC monitor is still 2D -- there is only the illusion of depth.\n\nZonitron Productions, sadly, has not learned these tricks.  So their 3D platformer is an exercise in frustration.  It's difficult to tell whether a platform is small-but-close or large-but-far.  Once Bob is in the air, it's a matter of pure guesswork where he lands.  Jumping Flash! handled 3D platforming much better than this in 1995, a year before Mario's version.\n\nAlthough the story is far from "brilliant," as described, and the gameplay lacking, the devs clearly put some effort into this game.  The levels look nice, and feature a well-detailed "floor" for you to admire as you plunge to your doom.  Brilliant Bob suffers mainly from inexperience.  The ability to design and build a set of 3D platforming stages just isn't enough to make a playable 3D platformer.","December 13, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Extremely slippery controls, double jump has trouble registering, disappearing platforms disappear no matter where you touch them, and they disappear FAST, you can skip through levels without collecting anything, you can jump off the main map onto the scenery (more fun than the actual game).\nBest part, no shadow below your character and due to almost no control of the camera good luck having any real depth perception. Unity has DEFAULT scripts for camera control and this is what they came up with, very gud.\n\nAnd to top it all off it looks like it was made out of stuff bought off the unity asset store, either that or made out of whatever models they had lyin around.\n\n10/10 a good addition to my shovelware collection.","January 20","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
