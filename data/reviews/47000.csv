Instead of aiming for points, your objective is to make your way through the levels by breaking the path with your matches. It was a great surprise--I didn't expect much, but ended up having some fun for a few hours!\n\nPros:\nInnovative mechanic on the match-3 genre\nTotal of 64 basic levels, plus 4 hidden-object and 16 spot-the-difference levels, making it just long enough for this kind of game\nSmart puzzles that require fast thinking\nA unique atmosphere in each "world"\nExcellent difficulty advancement--you'll find it too easy at first, but it'll get harder as you move on\nSpecial powers add another layer to the puzzles\nPleasant BGM and cute graphics\nCons:\nTerrible (almost non-existent) story, but who cares?\nFixed very low resolution\nHO and STD levels were really annoying, mostly because of the low res, making me just click around like crazy\nBoring animations and character cards (that you collect to progress in the game)\nBought on / for: Razor Bundle by Bundle Stars for an average of US$0.35 (R$ 0,91).

It's a great time sink.\n\nWhat this game does well:\n1. The artwork is beautiful.\n2. The Match 3+ puzzles are based on a maze-type "map" where you need to find your way from your starting position to the end, rather than a simple X by X board. Aided by 4 usable rechargeable items, you need to make your way to the end of the maze by any means necessary. And there are also explosions when you match 5 or more gems!\n3. The hidden object games are nice and challenging.\n4. The spot the differences game is lot's of fun - some puzzles are quite tough, too.\n\nWhat this game does poorly:\nIn my opinion - nothing, really... I guess the spot the differences puzzles could have had more differences to spot, but then again, it works fine as it is.\n\nThe conclusion:\nA magnificent casual 5+ hours game, with wonderful artwork and fun gameplay, which would cost you under 1€/$ on sale (like right now). This is cheaper than a bag of peanuts or chips, or a beer and will provide you with way more hours of enjoyment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/47000/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","4 Elements is a fun match-3 puzzler weighed down by unnecessary seek-and-find sequences and occasionally frustrating level design. 4 Elements' generic fantasy presentation hides an addictive game that will appeal to fans of Bejeweled and other "casual" puzzle titles. There's nothing wrong with story in a puzzle game, but with the relatively low resolution of the somewhat blurry art in the seek-and-find sequences, gamers will want the title to get out of its own way and let the real game breathe.\n\n4 Elements tells a simple story of an ancient evil that was locked away by the power of the titular elements — earth, wind, fire and water — but has now been unleashed. It's up to the player to unlock four books to release the elements and save the realm. It's inoffensive and flat, but the story is bolstered by a fairy who accompanies the player and periodically provides tips and hints. Unlike some other games that have overused the "helper" character while not allowing the player to discover and explore, the fairy is here to explain the various rules and power-ups and won't get in your way.\n\nThe main gameplay of 4 Elements involves creating chains of three or more jewels of the same colour to clear a pathway for a liquid to reach the tree at the end of each level. The 64 timed levels are large and sprawling, with multiple pathways and strategies for the player to take. There are 16 levels per "element," and the colours and visuals change depending on which element you're playing, adding a bit of variety to the proceedings while playing; as you progress, the levels become harder, longer and with more obstacles. For example, you might stumble upon a stone that can only be destroyed via a bomb power-up, or a frozen tile that must be chained several times before breaking.\n\nThere are environmental tricks, as well, with arrows that help clear large sections of the level when the liquid reaches them. There are several power-ups, such as the aforementioned bomb, the ability to swap any two regular jewels, "dig" out a tile to make way for another, and a power-up that reshuffles all jewels in the level besides stones and frozen tiles. Some jewels sit on more than one layer and must be cleared several times, as well. The time limit is rarely going to make players nervous, but it does add a good bit of tension as players scramble to reach the tree after a long journey.\n\nSupplementing the main gameplay are four hidden object sequences to find the key to each elemental book. The still paintings, while pretty, are a bit washed out on both the top screen and the touch screen, making it difficult to find each item. The fairy is available to point players in the right direction, but these sections feel like filler. There are also near-identical cards that require the player to spot the differences, which are short and relatively simple, but the small pictures on the card had us resort to pixel hunting and tapping the screen until we found something; these sequences aren't challenging so much as frustrating, and feel extraneous to the rest of the game.\n\nAlthough the colours seem a little washed out, the visuals are lovely and soft, evoking a fairy tale fantasy realm. The music and sound effects are quite soothing and peaceful, and the pay-off to a large combo or clearing a huge section of a level with "whoosh" and "ringing" sounds is surprisingly effective. The top screen is used as a map, while the bottom screen is where the action takes place. There is not much 3D implementation here, but it's not missed.\n\nThough 4 Elements is hampered by its filler hidden object/seek-and-find sequences, the puzzle gameplay is very fun and surprisingly involving. So while it's not the perfect puzzle game, players could certainly do worse. For a lengthy and well-crafted experience, 4 Elements is recommended; just be ready to do some pixel hunting in-between matching those jewels.","February 13","true","84.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Is there anything extraordinary? Nah, not really. But it has a story at least.\n\nThe Magic Land - yeah, this is the name of the realm that we are in. Creative I know, bear with me for the time - is in turmoil! The altars of the 4 Elements fell into ruin and the careful balance of nature is tipped off to result in catastrophes all over the place, so it is our casual gaming skills that shall save the Magic Land. With our trusted fairy companion - that girl is useful, I tell you - we are to unlock the books of 4 Elements and bring peace to the realm once again! For a casual game, it comes with a story and some lore about magical creatures. I must say that's a bonus.\n\n4 Elements is an entertaining, casual puzzle game that takes attention, quick-thinking and resourcefulness. Rules are very simple: your aim is to open a path way for the energy flow through the puzzle board labyrinth within a time limit, by matching as many possible same colored stones at a time. Your casual Match 3 game. It starts easy enough, and progresses to become 'what the heck I'm doing, I wonder???'. It has some HOG and “Find the Difference” scenes between chapters that are moronically hard: I couldn't decide whether they are a plus or a minus.\n\nThe game itself is kinda addictive. You find yourself passing an hour or two, then realize that you've just lost that hour, which is the exact purpose of these games. Theme is really pretty, and the design is well above the average. I'd recommend it to whomever that looks for a fancy Bejeweled alternative with flashy gameplay and needs a game that doesn't use much brain activity rather than some attention span.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 15, 2015","true","10.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

The graphics are so sweet. Unfortunately the resolution is fixed to 800 x 600. Could be HD. A really relaxing and outstanding soundtrack. Love this instrumental music. Panpipes, whistles, guitar and piano.\n\nLike every puzzle game it starts easy. Connect some chains with min 3 tiles ... but then the hardness raises quickly. Destroy stone blocks make longer chains. But it's much more. Every book part level has it's own break to solve a "spott-the-differences" minigame. Really not easy. To enter a new book you have solve a "quest", meaning search a big picture for several item parts. It's unnatural hard. But if you proceed you'll get into the game and enjoy the thrill of puzzeling. The last two levels are a pain in the ♥♥♥. You have to quick solve chains and may need many tries ...\n\nHighly recommend as a classic puzzlegame","April 28, 2014","true","11.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","3"

The objective of each level is to clear the blocks, which destroys the path below them, which allows the water to progress. The goal is to get the water from the start to the finish. As the levels progress, the size of the board increases and obstacles pop up. Destroying colors builds toward power ups. Collecting green blocks builds towards a shovel that allows you to dig away a piece of the path, for example. Making long chains creates explosions to destroy obstacles like ice.\n\nWhile the game is designed with a ticking clock each level, I think I only ran out of time maybe twice just from bad luck on what colors came my way. It's not really difficult. After a few boards, the game switches things up with some puzzles where you need to find the differences in two pictures or search for hidden objects. Many of these items/differences are extremely well hidden, basically blending into the backgrounds, which made that a bit of an annoyance. I had a few times where I just went click crazy all over the screen.\n\nThere are A LOT of levels in this game. After a while I thought it would never end, so it does feel like it stretches out a bit too long. It's still fun and completely worth a play through, though I can't see me playing it again anytime soon.

It takes you through a fairly lengthy single-player campaign and even manages to mix in a few Hidden Object and Spot the Difference mini-games. It is however not a game that can stand up to the more modern tile matching games and it's attempts at branching out, through the use of a small storyline and the previously mentioned hidden object games, does not add much to the experience.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough, you have to lead a liquid from the start of a maze to the end by matching tiles to open up paths. Most of it is pretty straight forward but the game does add in a few special puzzles and traps as you progress however the really interesting ones only show up in the very last levels and you don't really feel challenged until then. You get a few special abilities that are charged by matching tiles of a specific color however their use is mostly limited to the areas where they are required to progress.\n\nOne bug that kept annoying me throughout the game was that the on-screen arrow that shows you which direction you need to go always blocks your view of a tile.\n\nAll in all there is not much to see here. The game is not impressive or interesting and the fact that the individual levels are fairly lengthy means it does not even qualify as a decent timesink.

This game is somewhat appealing as it consists of roughly three types of minigames. The structure is pretty much the same. First you do a hidden object minigame, which then allows you to play 4 match 3 levels. The RNG is pretty fair, although sometimes I found that I could breeze through a level after a few attempts and restarts. The final level is a "Spot-the-difference" level. Unfortunately as with the hidden objects game, I just randomly clicked around until I completed the task. At first I was trying to actually find the things, but I realised quickly that there would be a  modicum of tedium involved. I did enjoy it, but it wasn't so much a game you play for the story. I don't even know what the story was. I just skipped as much of it as I could.\n\nIf you can get the game in a bundle or when it is on sale, I say go ahead.","July 18, 2014","true","18.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The gameplay is excellent: simple, solid mechanics, good level design, nice graphics and sound produce a game which is fun and, in later levels, challenging enough to give a sense of achievent when you complete the game. The only weakness in the gameplay is occasional visability problems caused by the automatic camera and direction arrow. This problem is rare however, it took me several playthroughs to encounter it. The game also features Spot-the-Difference levels, which add little, and occasional Hidden-Object levels, which are diverting and challenging.\n\nUnfortunately, the presentation and "story" are as cliched as anything I have ever witnessed in a game. If you find bad fantasy irritating, I advise you to click to continue whenever prompted.\n\nIf you enjoy timed puzzle games, this one is worth getting.

With most stages taking no more than five minutes each, the ability to save and quit at any given time, even in the middle of a puzzle and continue at your convenience, the creators have clearly put a great deal of thought into smoothing out not only the mechanics of the game, but the way it is presented to you, the player.\n\n'The baby's crying?  Dinner is ready?  Don't worry--we'll leave this just as you left it.'\n\nEverything within this simple puzzle title is polished to perfection:\nThe artwork and related 'find the difference' mini-games are masterpieces on their own, especially in the way that they are assembled according to your progression.  Every click of a button results in a harmonious tap or chime, rewarding your headway with a rush of flowing water or wisp of wind, weaving an encouraging musical atmosphere as you restore the world around you.  The stages themselves have a smooth difficulty curve as well, challenging enough to feel rewarding and encourage creative strategies without leading you to frustration.\n\nA brilliant puzzle game and highly recommended.

Though, this time, no tile to move but tiles to select, starting at 3 that have at least one border in common. The more you link, the better. At 5 linked (or more) an explosion happens, clearing more background and tiles. Some more options can be set during the game (bomb, swap tile, etc.), provided you filled them up first. Throught the four books, representing the elements, there are four "find the differences" mini games per book, and one other "find the object" mini game per book.\nThat's the basic of gameplay. Design wise, it's a very pleasant trip. The graphics are beautiful and music is relaxing. "4 Elements" starts easy but quickly becomes challenging. Near the end, it leans towards the very difficult.\nAround the last levels (amongst 66) the automated camera may show a part of the screen that isn't very useful.

You have to restore the elements by making chains of the same colored gems. The basics are simple but the obstacles get harder and sometimes you will have to play a level multiple times before you know how to clear it. But it never got me frustrated so the difficulty level was perfect for me. There are 64 levels, and in between there are some other puzzles to restore the books of elements. This game kept me busy for about 9 hours, so that is good value for just 99 cents.","July 12, 2015","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love puzzle RPGs but this was really boring and repetitive. Only played through it because of my OCD for achievments and feeling like I wanted to get my moneys worth. You only get 4 spells which you get in the first area or two and use throughout. The spot the difference puzzles were too easy even when windowed so I could barely see the pictures. The object finding puzzles were entertaining but there are only 4 and most of the items are really easy to spot with a few being almost impossible to see. Only the last few levels were interesting. Also I got excited about voice acting at the start but that is the only time there is any, not even some at the end.\n\nBasically I am minutely irritated that I have spent £5 on it and many hours of my life.

That means 800x600 resolution that messes with my desktop and results in other programs getting rescaled and thrown all over the place and my monitor flashing up a warning to change the resolution every time I start the game. There is no option to change the resolution... because it was 2008 and 1080p was like something out of 2001.\n\nYour options are limited to playing fullscreen with horribly stretched graphics and the desktop suffering or playing in a tiny window too small to see anything.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/recommended/47000/","Nawrusi","Nawrusi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nawrusi/","789 products in account","Mini games amd colour maching the game.\n\nintroduction:\nTo start out with, you are introduced to the story, wich involve the elements running amok in a magical world. We are told to restore peace to each element; earth, wind, fire, and water. On the menu screen we can see all the levls representet by books and gems, and we get an idea of how long this game is going to take.\n\nTherefore I felt the introduction to be really boring. It shows the whole game from the get go, and there are no surprises along the way.\n\nGamplay:\nThe gamepaly is split up into 3 diffrent games, where one acts as the main game, while the others are mini-games. The main game is very simple, match coloured blocks in a chain, in order to make sand dissaper. When the sand is gone, the water you need to get to the end of the stage can continue to flow. After you let the water flow to the end, you win the level.\n\nThe levels have diffrent obsticles along the way that can block the way to completion, these items is for eksample rocks.\n\nThe levels are getting harder along the way, but you also unlock power-ups, that will help you to reach the goal. The power-ups fells really overpowered, and can easily make the game a win for you, nearly every single time. This was a huge letdown for me, since I never really felt challenged. The powerups can be things like changing around blocks and blowing up paths.\n\nThe two mini games are done, in order to unlock new levels. The first one is a "spot the diffrence" game, where you click a place on a picture, to spot the flaw on the other picture.\n\nThe other part is a "find the objects" game, where you must spot things hidding in the background. All the games are controlled by simple mouse-clicking., and it fells rather slow and boring now and again. The overall games are not boring as such, but it quikly get`s repetative.\n\nCharecters:\nWell there are only two charecters in this game, and they both have no persanality. This game is clearly not story driven, but in my opinion, they did not need to include these charecters to complete a already unnesesary story. The charecters are a wizard, which we never see after the starting scren, and a fariy which guides you throughout the game. There is not much to say to this part, so let`s move on.\n\nVisuels:\nThe game looks kinda ok, but I really did not exspect anything brillaint to be honest. The overall visuesl in-game are accually pretty fluid, and looks fine. But when you do anything outside the main game, the grafics fells weaker and more bluery. It`s hard to explain, but I felt there was something wrong.\n\nSound:\nThe music is acually ok in this game. I fellt it was a nice thing to include, and the diffrent themes are acually not that bad. Other then that, there are not much to say to the sounds other than the star theme will blast your speakers out, it is so loud!\n\nStory:\nSo the story is pretty basic as said, clear all levels to controle all elements. The boring part is that the sory really has no twists and turns, instead it fells like it only is there to give you a reason to why there is 4 main levels.\n\nThe other mini-games really has some cool story. Not so much the hidden object part. But when you complete the spot the diffrence game. You see the real picture, and get`s the lore of the charecter on it. This was some intresting reading, and felt like a nice inclusion to the game, and the lore of the establist world.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is far from a masterpice, and it really is just another time killer game. This dose not mean I dislike the game at all, I am just saying you can find better games of this type out there. I completed the story and it really is just a congratiolation screen and nothing more. But if you are looking for a simple game to sit down and play, this one coul be a nice choice. I give this game a thumps up.","December 6, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the game is dragged down by a boring, cliché, contrived "story" that's duct taped around the game and adds absolutely no value to it, nor does it have any bearing on the game itself.

Main goal in match 3 mode is to transport a green liquid until it reaches a tree that grows and shows that you have finished the level. Each level is designed very different and makes the game more challenging and gives it variety.\n\nThe only compliant with this game i have is the unskippable sequences between levels. I can see such comfortable features were not common in these type of games back in 2008 and there are much better games released based of comfort function.

You dig by eliminating tiles on top of the dirt. The camera scrolls on its own as it follows the liquid, and you can't scroll back to earlier parts of the level, so you have to deal with only what you see on the screen. Sometimes the randomness will deal a bad hand, but you can get out of trouble with planning and clever use of powerups.\n\nI admit, I first thought it was a bit easy and simplistic for my tastes -- there are only four colors to match, and the powerups were a bit too powerful. About halfway through the game, I realized the main enemy was the timer, and it could put up a good fight. Later levels got fast and frantic as I had to dig through huge levels in only a few minutes, and the final few levels were quite a satisfying challenge.\n\nOverall, it was pretty good! It seems like something straight out of the golden age of PopCap. If you have fond memories of Zuma, Bejeweled, Chuzzle, Bookworm, and the like, you might find this very enjoyable.

And if youre looking for a Match-3 RPG DO NOT look here!\n\nOk, so the tags are misleading. This is mostly a fantasy themed HOG (Hidden Object game), not a match 3 RPG like Puzzle Quest.\n\nIt has a tiny "match 3" component, if you can call it that. Basically, youre trying to draw a path from a start point to a finish point by breaking the "rock" by linking gems, which breaks the background "rock" and creates an open path. You select gems by dragging over them with a mouse. In any direction, including turning while dragging. Its so easy it isnt even funny. It goes HOG scene, where you have to find the pieces of various items in a picture, then use the items in the picture to open more scenes (IE a pickaxe to break a cave in). That gets you a key to open a book.\n\nThen a few rounds of the aforementioned match 3. THEN a "find the differences between two images" HOG. You do that a few times in each book before going back to the "find pieces of items HOG" to get the new key to open a new book.\n\nTheres no choice, no choosing of puzzles, and a very weak fantasy plot with an annoying fairy that constantly flits around the screen. Its like its badly built for 5 year olds. If you like HOGs (oh god, why??) theres WAY better ones out there. And if you like Match 3 RPGs theres way way better ones.\n\nThis MAY entertain a 6 year old. But I doubt it. Do yourself a favor and dont waste your cash.\n","August 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","5"

It isn’t as genius as any of Popcap’s creations but it does have a place on the list of casual games worth playing; especially if you are in to the Match 3+ type games. The game plays pretty much like any other match 3 games, except with quite few more additional twist. You can directly chain multiple gems together to create larger explosions to clear paths to reach the end goal while at the same time build up magical energies that match the colored gems destroyed. These magical energies unlock powers that include re-randomization of the game board, defrost/destroy gems, etc. In addition to the already huge amount of game changing twist, at the end of each book chapter you have to undergo a spot the difference and hidden object challenge. The story, while very limited in scope, is a nice touch and it adds on to the overall theme of the game.","May 24, 2012","true","29.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game will then have you search for several differences between two seemingly identical pictures (search the difference).

For me, there are two big flaws; the tediousness of the game and the sharp curve in the puzzles. First, the game is very tedious. The puzzles follow a similar pattern (4 puzzles to solve a level, 4 levels to a world, then one world puzzle). This in itself is not a huge issue as you want puzzle games to be lengthy and have variety. However, the difficulty of the game provides no variety up until like the last couple of levels. I have to say that the last three levels are some of the most fun puzzles I've played in a while, but it ends up just being disappointed that it wasn't present anywhere else in the game.","July 29, 2015","false","10.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I had to play it that small windowed mode with the monitor closer to my face. This, I can take, but already fills up the dislike bar a little bit. Other details made the rest of the work and the bar resulted in this review.\n\nThe game itself is fine although a little bit repetitive and not very innovative. If you like lighly washed-on themes of fantasy and match-3 type games, no problem so far. But let's go to the list of annoyances:\n\n- There's one chance to shut the fairy up, when she asks if you want to keep receiving tips and stuff. If you don't shut her at that moment, you'll be stuck with her to the end of the game. The "hints" option only refers to the in-game matches, apparently.\n- You cannot choose what book you want to unlock next and there's no thematic justification for that, it is just "later books, harder levels". At least let us pick what card from a book to recover next or something, that would be easy to implement even keeping the levels linear but only changing their name, to present players with a "false choice". Everything is so linear that even this kind of insignificant choice would be cool to have.\n- You cannot replay any levels after they're beaten once. W-what?? That is a pain, because there are achievements that require you to start a whole new game if you don't get them at first.\n- The Epilogue took so long to appear that I have already clicked the screen thinking nothing would happen if I didn't. It skipped the ending and guess what? Once gone, you cannot access it anymore. In fact, forget your progress. At the time that screen appears, your progress is deleted and the only option is to start a new game. I hope there's a youtube video or something so I can see what the hell the Epilogue was about.\n\nThe smaller the game, the heavier these details become. Overall, I don't recommend 4 Elements. Even without all the annoyance, it's still a repetitive and very forgettable game.","May 28","false","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After every four levels, you'll get to play a short game of "Spot the difference", but that's pretty much all the excitement happening. Oh, and you get to search for objects before you open up another part of the game.\n\nThe plot of restoring four books of magic, so that the powers within are in balance again, are a nice little touch, but pretty much all there is to it. After 64 levels, the game is played through completely, and you have the choice of starting all over again. (I played the first 16 levels again to gain the last two achievements, but that's it - I'm done with this game.)\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend the game unless you are really a match 3 fan, and find it funny to have a fairy at your side making you think of Navi. Granted, the fairy in this game is not as obnoxious, but not as helpful as Navi either. And that is a feat.\n\nDone with the game, moving on to something more entertaining - at least I hope the next one will be more entertaining.","February 4, 2015","false","10.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The power ups are woefully slow to load back up and some of the time your just going to lose because you have to wait for a power up to recharge. Now games do have some luck involved of course but when it becomes a game mechanic instead of skill then we have some issues with it.\n\nMostly a game of luck rather then a game of skill really. ALso the dumb idea to add a timer is stupid and dumb and a little cruel to people who pay for this. Why does this need a timer at all??? It doesnt. . Also the price is way to high for this game bought it on sale for a buck. Im really not liking this game as much as I thought I would.

I picked this up in a bundle, so for the price it couldn't be beat. I really think that they should cut the regular price in half on Steam, however, because of certain elements of the game. It's in a very low resolution, which stretches to the size of the resolution you have set on your monitor.\n\nAt least from what I saw, there's no way to change this. A bad soundtrack is always my main complaint with games, but that's easily fixed with this game by just turning it off and putting on your own music - as I've stated in reviews for other games. 10 hours is about the maximum amount of time you'll get out of this game by the time you complete it.\n\nThat isn't entirely a bad thing.\n\nIt combines several different types of casual games. Click'n'find, image matching, and matching up crystals which give you some useful powers. Interesting, and not a bad game, just not amazing, either. Even for 2008 and a casual game, it could've been better. However, it did soak up 10 hours of my time and for that, it's definitely worth it for you to check it out next time it pops up in a bundle.\n\n6.5/10 - Fun factor is huge, everything else is just okay.","June 5, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I was expecting a classic Bejeweled-style game, but instead of swapping tiles or sliding rows, you form chains by clicking and dragging a path through adjacent matching symbols.  The paths do not have to form a straight line, you can zig-zag any direction except diagonally (for all the explanation the game gives, they never actually tell you this).\n\nAs the game progresses, you will encounter obstacles such as ice, immovable blocks, narrow passages, and rocks; however, you will also gain access to rechargeable tools that help you overcome these obstacles.  There is a timer, but chances are you will not need to worry about it until 3/4 of the way through the game, and even if you fail you just restart the level with no penalties.  The levels are increasingly challenging, but never frustrating or boring.  In fact, I found I enjoyed the later levels more because they forced you to use a bit of strategy to complete.\n\nI thought it was a nice touch that each of the four elements have a slightly different level aesthetic, which helps keep the levels feeling fresh.\n\nAs great as the gameplay was, though, there are things that destroy the replay value:\n- The story is cheesy.  Although, that's to be expected for this genre.\n- The chatty fairy.  She was fine for the first playthrough, providing necessary instructions and tips to help you learn and understand the game.  Subsequent playthroughs, though, are a different story - her dialogue cannot be skipped or turned off, so you will have to suffer through "Pop-Ups: The Game" every single time.  This is annoying if you just want to sit down and replay a few levels casually.\n- There is no option to select your starting level.  Whether you want to challenge yourself by replaying a tricky stage, or whether you are just trying to go for a specific achievement, your only choices are to continue from your last autosave or to completely start over.  Again, this is fine for the first playthrough, but an unlockable freeplay mode would have been appreciated.\n- The achievements are a bear to get.  It took me 1.5 playthroughs to get "Overachiever" because it is partially luck-dependent, and "Quick as a Flash" took 11 angry hours: The first FROG screen does not count toward the achievement because the fairy's dialogue and tutorial eat up so much of your time, so you are left with only three chances per game to earn it (the FROGs for the fire key, the air key, and the water key).  Basically, this means you will need to play through 16 match-3 levels and 4 spot-the-difference puzzles before you even reach the first applicable fractured object screen, and you will be continuously forced to deal with the fairy's "helpfulness."  If you miss the 90-second timeframe on the fire key puzzle, there is no way to just try it again because the game autosaves just AFTER you complete it.  You will either need to restart the game, or hope that you have better luck with the air key.  Regardless, you are looking at another 16 levels and 4 puzzles before getting a second opportunity to win this achievement.\n\nIf there had been either a freeplay mode, or a way to turn off the fairy, I might have given this game a 9.5/10 because the gameplay is solid, and it would have been incredibly replayable.  As is, though, I would have to give it a 6.5/10.","January 1, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most are easy, but the game does have a certain replayability in terms of getting faster at the levels.  Cutesy story.  After each set of four levels there is a spot the difference level.

The game is a variation on the match 3 genre. There is some nice variety between the four elements but the last two (wind and water) are obviously the most polished.  There are some really nice backgrounds with some animation (like fish swimming in some of the water levels).  The story is minimal but nice although the ending is really anticlimactic.  SPOILER   The intro has voiceover and more than one image but the ending is only a static image and some scrolling text.    After each four levels is a spot the difference game and once for each element there is a hidden object game.  You cannot revisit levels you have already played without starting a new game because there is only the linear story.  Also disappointing is the fact that you cannot scroll around a level and some of the action will happen offscreen at times.\n\nIn summary, this is a casual game in the match 3 genre with some nice polish that slightly outweighs its faults.","May 3, 2014","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed playing it, for the most part. It does have its downsides, though. First of all, you can't go back and re-play levels, or select your level at all. You're forced to progress level by level, which I think is a massive oversight in a game like this. Some of the achievements don't seem to work. Some of the levels are based on sheer luck, or force you to just grind to build up your power-ups, which I dislike. There is a time limit on each level, but this is not obvious and not pointed out to you until you're a good ways into the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a different kind of match-three game, you'll have some fun with this.

The game has 3 types of levels - a kind of match 3 level, a find hidden objects level and a find the differences between 2 images level.\n\nThe theme (plot) of the game is to restore the 4 elemental books. The way to do so is to first unlock the elemental book by playing a 'find hidden object' level. Then you have to unlock 4 cards for each elemental book. To unlock each card, you need to complete 4 objective based match 3 levels followed by a 'find the differences' level. There are 4 books - in total so 4 'find hidden object' levels. There are 4 cards per book so 64 (4x4x4) match 3 levels and 16 (4x4) 'find the differences' levels. So, although the game officially just tracks 64 levels, in total there are 84.\n\nThe match 3 levels have a maze like design. You start at one point and need to reach another point within allocated time. There are 4 power ups which help you on the way. These power ups charge as you match more of the same colored gems.\n\nThis is a good game to play when waiting for matchmade/MOBA games.","January 2, 2014","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'Cause I'm just a rebel like that.\n\n1. Find the key to unlock one of the books of magic, by playing a Hidden Object Game to construct several items and reactivate an elemental altar.  This is not timed, and there doesn't appear to be a penalty for needing a hint or clicking in the wrong place.  Some of the items you need to find are tiny and/or very well camouflaged - in some cases, even after the fairy helper pointed them out I had to admit I would probably never have found them!\n\n2. Once the book is unlocked, collect four cards for each one.  Each card is made up of four layers, which are collected by playing the main part of the game - the Match-3 levels.  These start out very easy and progressively get more difficult, although I did find that even towards the end of the game some levels were much easier and quicker than others.  The last two levels are quite tricky, and if you don't do the right thing at the start you might find yourself stuck and unable to progress.  I failed level 63 twice before I realised the trick to getting past it.\n\nThese levels, while fun and addictive, are not completely relaxing because there is a timer and you can run out of time to reach the goal.  Again, there doesn't seem to be any real penalty for failure except a few wasted minutes - even the fairy just shrugs and tells you to try again - and if you do fail you generally get an idea of what went wrong and how to do better on the retry.  I wasn't able to figure out how long the timer is, and I think it might vary depending on the difficulty of the level, but my slowest levels were over 9 minutes so in most cases you have a bit of time to think!\n\n3. Once you have the four parts of the card, you play a 'spot the difference' game to complete the card.  Again, some of the differences require very careful scrutiny to see them as they are quite subtle.  (I didn't feel that the resolution of the game was an issue with either this or the HOG sections; I believe it's just that the details are so small that you really have to look hard to find them.)  Once this part is done, the card is completed and the text becomes unscrambled so that you can read it.\n\n\nIn all, there are 64 Match-3 levels to play through - four books with four cards each, and each card needing four levels to complete it.  In addition there are the four Hidden Object scenes to unlock the book, and 16 spot the difference games to unscramble the cards.  The game saves your progress when you exit, allowing you to continue from where you left off, and there doesn't appear to be any way to skip a section or choose where to go next.  It looks as though more than one person could save a game in progress, as you choose a name at the start and there is an option on the main menu screen to switch this.\n\nThe background music was quite pleasant, although it occasionally began to feel a bit repetitive, and I didn't find it distracting.\n\nThe graphics, although perhaps a little dated in some ways, were really rather nice.  There are a lot of little details in the background of the level screens that you don't really have much time to appreciate when you're focusing on finding the next group of 'gems' to match (I particularly liked the fish swimming past on the underwater levels), and the gems themselves have different designs on them depending on the element you're working on.\n\nA few pros and cons, from my point of view.\n\nPros:\n\n- fiendishly addictive!  Like a good book, I found it really hard to put it down.  I didn't want to stop playing at the end of one section and have to wait until the next day to continue, especially if I was almost done with one of the elements.\n\n- attractive graphics... not top notch, but good enough to not detract from the game.  (In my opinion anyway, other reviewers clearly disagree here. :) )\n\n- pleasant music and sound effects, nothing too irritating.\n\n- new power-up concepts are introduced one at a time to allow you to get used to them.\n\n- the map is a handy feature to help you see where you should be heading, and there is also an arrow at the edge of the screen that points the way for you.  (Actually reaching it is sometimes another matter entirely!)\n\n- the maps sometimes make a picture, which is a nice touch.\n\nCons:\n\n- some of the details in the hidden object and spot the difference screens are just TOO small and well-disguised, leading to some frustration with these sections (especially the HOGs).\n\n- at the beginning of each level the camera sweeps back from the end goal to the start, showing you the route you need to take.  This is so fast that I find it nauseating to watch, particularly when the route loops around as it does in many of the levels.\n\n- there is no way to move the camera around the field (at least, not that I could find) to allow you to see what is just around the corner from your current location.  A glance at the map or a look at your guiding arrow will give you an idea of which direction to go, but the map won't show you any of the special flaming arrows you might need to head for or piles of stones/tiles blocking your way.\n\n- the camera follows the progress of the magical energy, which can lead to it swinging around unexpectedly when you're trying to click on something, or to your view being moved further away than you wanted and making it difficult to figure out where to go next.  There are sometimes flaming arrows (necessary to break through some areas) in hard to spot locations because of where the camera has positioned itself.\n\n- the playing tips at the end of each level got very irritating after a while, especially as they were repeating things you already knew towards the end, and I could not seem to turn them off.\n\n- the ending was just a text epilogue which, after the voiced intro, was a bit of a let down.  I was hoping for another word from the wizard after I heroically saved the kingdom!\n\n\nAll in all, though, I found this to be a very enjoyable game.  It does have faults, but they were mostly minor in my opinion and I was able to either ignore or put up with them and still have a lot of fun.  I certainly can't complain for the price I paid for it, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it - get it on sale if you're still not sure.  :)","April 18, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlock other math 3 games, you match the pieces together to clear a path through to the end. It's fun if you are in to this kind of game. There are about 60 levels, and they ramp up difficulty decently, but it would have been nice for there to be more levels, or perhaps randomly generated levels. Something to keep it going longer. Still, it took me several hours to beat and I enjoyed it.\n\nOne thing that annoyed me is that every so often you have to do a "spot the difference" or "find the hidden object" game. These just annoyed me, and I really don't think they needed to be included. Luckily they have a hint button so if you don't care about these you can get through them quickly.\n\nAs for the graphics, it's about as you would expect from this kind of game. Colored gems representing the elements. The theme is kind of boring as it is just generic fantasy. You have a little fairy to give you tutorials throughout the game. Still, match 3 doesn't lend itself to having great themes. Gems, candies, what have you, is what people go for. It works. There is just nothing theme wise that stands out.\n\nAnyway, while not an absolute must have, if you like games of this ilk, might as well give it a try if you see it on sale.","May 8, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If it were just the puzzles it wouldn't be so bad, but then we have the hidden object and find the differences mini games. Couple that with with stretched full screen (unless you have an 800x640 monitor) or small window and it's downright maddening.\n\nAlso, the fact you can change how the game plays simply by editing the save file? I really don't know how to feel about that.\n\nGet it on a sale if you must.","May 5, 2015","false","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"match h&z trails longer than two") click-fest almost ruined by the abrupt "find stupid differences" interruptions every few levels.\n\nI got through a dozen levels so far, and I don't know if it's possible to die.  Not sure if that's good, but you might.\n\nBut with the maze navigation and explosion reinforcement for getting at least 5 in a row, it remains a solid improvement on the frentic clicking to get ahead genre we all know so well.

You match same colored gems to carve a path along them, letting the magic energy flow in. You need to get the energy to the end in order to win the level. There's other puzzles in here, like the hidden object game to initially unlock a book, and after you clear the 4 levels associated with a card, to do a 'spot the difference' game. It's all very fun.\n\nIf you like gem matching games, I definitely recommend this.","September 17, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferizo/recommended/47000/","ferizo","ASH+Ketchum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferizo/","1490 products in account","At first glance it may look like just another match 3 puzzle game but surprisingly enough it has a pleasant charm to it.\n\nBeing a match 3 game, the concept itself is pretty simple but the game makes good use of it's mechanic and even the minigames in between are quite subtle and cleverly designed. It's a casual game and starts off pretty easy but does offer a little bit of a challenge near the end of the game. What's great about it is that quick thinking will often get you much farther rather than just mindlessly matching colors and hoping for the best.\n\nThe game only has one mode which is the main campaign but being as long it is (4 books / 64 levels to be exact) you'll find yourself occupied for a good while. That however does negate the game's replay value unless you like going through the same levels again.. the music is great and offers a soothing distraction from the fact that you're being timed on every level.\n\nThe artwork is quite beautiful to say the least which brings me to what I consider the only downside of the game.. that being that there's no option to change the resolution so you either have to play it in a tiny window or fullscreen which works alright but feels a bit stretched out. Other than that, it's a great game which can be enjoyed for quite some time casually.. or if you're obsessed like me; can be played through in 6 hours depending on how skillful or lucky you are. I'll stay quiet this time and leave it to personal opinion whether that's worth the price.","April 27, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
