The reason why Player 1 wants to open up a karate school is so that he can pass down his style of karate (which is identical to the style used by every other karateka in the game).  Being that his city only has 10 karate dojos (other than the one he wants to buy and open) and 4 dedicated karate tournaments, there is obviously a vast untapped market for Player 1's tutelage.\n\nThere are two main ways to fufill Player 1's dream: putting boxes on a truck with a forklift and getting famous enough to participate in the advanced karate tournaments that actually have monetary prizes and don't cost money to do.  In practice, even if you opt for the second way of raising the necessary funds, you will have to do the forklift minigame every few attempts at the tournament.  Much like the path of a real karateka the game is very grindy and repetitive, but you'll have some fun if you buy it on sale.","September 18, 2015","true","13.8"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","90","28","31","27","0"

No crazy complex combos, the simple controls allow for strategic planning of your moves precisely when used in this competitive fighter.  Many games people buy because their cheap then never play one hour of them, this game is to awesome to not play.   This game does the hardest thing in gaming, taking a simple concept and making it fun to play with working controls.  The competition style of the game uses a variety of moves that force the player NOT to just mash the buttons but plan each move to become a black belt master of their own.  The game is riddled with spelling errors and sentences that make no sense, but all that anyone needs to understand is "Karate is life!!!!"  At first many will think the strange phrasing of sentences is some kind of retro feel, though after checking their website, it seems to just be the way they write in general for whatever reason.   Either way it is awesome and fits the game perfectly.\n\nThis game has the most important aspect working flawlessly, the ai opponents are challenging and its never the same fight twice.  The music in the game is just as hardcore as the visuals.  Sick of boring drawn out realistic hipster type games from the last few years?  If so then karate Master 2 is your cure!   As the game says, get ready to "get covered in glory."  How often does anyone get to say that?  Imagine someone asking you how your day is, now finally you can reply saying you are covered in glory. What a good day to be you!\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99\n*for those who want the awesomesauce of Karate Master 1, its free from the developer and can be downloaded on their official website:  http://www.criansoft.com/eng/Karate%20Master%20KDB.html","May 26, 2015","true","8.4"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","26","29","3","2"

As you progress further in your stats, you unlock new training minigames that really help keep them from feeling stale.\n\nAs for the controls, they're pretty tight for being an indie title.  However, the game assumes you have an Xbox 360 controller, as the on-screen button prompts are of the A+B+X+Y variety, makes it confusing if you're using a keyboard.  Personally, I'm using a USB-connected SNES controller and it works beautifully with this game.\n\nThe graphics really capture the feel of the transitional period between the 16-bit and 32-bit console eras (think NEO-GEO), and they are of much higher quality than your average indie fare.\n\nThe sound effects and music really make this game shine, once again perfectly capturing that bygone era that a lot of us spent middle school listening to as we played our games.\n\nIf I were to criticize anything, it would probably be the rough translation job, but it's a minor slight that doesn't take away from the game much at all.\n\nThe devs have some real talent, and this game is well worth the $10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/347670/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","Nineteen eighty five called, it would like to have a word with you about cheesy Karate games. Specifically, I would like you to cast your mind back to the spectrum era. Long loading times, terribad graphics, but a blank canvas where game creativity was about pushing boundaries and exploring what games could be. One of those many explorations was a title called IK+ (International Karate +), a glorious bit of code involving some pixellated men in pyjamas whacking each other in the goal of changing their belt colours. The controls were tight, the fighting was good, and the feeling was very much that of a cheesy b-movie. Hell, the Amiga version had Stephen Segal (or a very good likeness)[www.atarimania.com] on the cover along with what looks to be Chuck Norris delivering a trademark kick to some poor sod. Fighting games have wavered in and out of vogue, travelling between the more realistic and the more fantastical over the generations, but the pure, basic Karate game sortof vanished into the ether...\n\n... UNTIL NOW...\n\n... KAHATAE MASTAH. NOCKA DOON BALOO. OSU!\n\nIt's gloriously throwback, the graphics are retro Amiga era, the script has more chinglish than a motherboard manual, you get to Karate Fight a bull and a bear (yes, you get the opportunity to punch a bear), and you get to do a jump kick over a car to promote your dojo. It's that kind of finely matured cheese. Jackie Chan would be -proud- to feature in such a script. It has so much terribleness (like the fact you can exit without saving very easily and the game does a TERRIBLE job of warning you) that it has no right to be as good as it is. Yet, it is. It's good, it's good in the way finely matured cheese is good.\n\nThe game features a mix of tournaments, one shot fights against various opponents (who if you beat, will then appear in the said same tournaments), special encounters such as the aforementioned "DO A FLYING KICK OVER A CAR!", and occasional expositions of horribly written story, with english so badly written even google translate looks at me and throws it's arms up in despair. You can read it, and you'll laugh, it's that wonderfully bad.\n\nIn between the fighting and the b-reel script you get to train your fighter in a fantastically diverse set of mini-games (some are genius, others... not so much), and there's a limited RPG style progression system where you'll tinker with the stats of your fighter, and can even suffer injuries and get to participate in a mini game where you have to recover from those (and the first time that happens, you get some cringeworthy story for that too).\n\nThe fighting however is -good-, really good, it uses the tekken style approach of mapping left and right legs and arms to seperate buttons, and then you can apply "low" or "high" using down or up on the controller to give you a wide variety of punches and kicks. There's a good set of combos and a fairly fluid system tucked away in here, as well as a solid blocking and countering system, and button mashing is punished frequently with the AI giving you a damn good spanking in the later stages, so it pays to learn the intricacies. In effect, this is IK+ put on steroids, and then given a serious training regimen, the Karate is pretty full featured (at least that an outside layperson can figure) and has a much more realistic, crunchy feel to it, as opposed to the more fantasy based fighters that you tend to run into.\n\nTraining focusses on the various stats, or training you in new moves, the stat training can range from simple button mashing (for body conditioning, which will give you hand cramp, well, they did say it was toughness training - BEAR THE PAIN), to attempting to hit a tennis ball suspended by a piece of string, which feels a bit like the human version of a cat playing with a feather. Generally speaking some minigames work really well (the concrete bag, the strength tests, some of the toughness tests) and there's only a few real duds (the water droplet test can die in a fire). There's even a minigame where you work to build up funds to enter the starter tournaments, which... can go horribly wrong if you decide to fiddle about with your forklift (there's safety videos for that you know!).\n\nWith all this said, would one recommend it? At the price point it's pitched at? Absolutely. It's a -steal-. There's a lot to do in this game, and it'll keep you busy easily for a good few evenings or a solid weekend, and you may well return to it every so often for a theraputic bit of Karate fighting in the later tournaments, even after you master the game. It's excellent value, and as a b-movie, modernised IK+, it's an easy sell. If you're into fighting games and fancy a change of pace, grab this and give it a whirl.","March 21, 2015","true","3.9"," 46 of 70 people (66%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","66","46","70","14","1"

Combining major tropes from 80ies Karate-flicks and martial arts anime/manga the game manages to set the tone well - however, lame gameplay, crappy art and a horrible translation bring it down.\n\nI could have lived with that, if the actual game was better. It does remind me of some oldschool homecomputer-titles like Chambers of Shaolin or Budokan - in a series of mini-games you raise your stats, do battle against other people in tournaments and either win and earn fame and cash to continue (and earn valuable trainig points to continue leveling up) or are forced to go back to work and earn some more cash to pay the entry fees to tournaments.\n\nThe training minigames are pretty much Epyx Summergames/Wintergames- or International Track & Field-style. Twirl the joystick, hammer all the buttons, hit buttons in sequence, execute moves when prompted. It's fun for a bit, but gets old fast (and will put some strain on your controller) - once you trained enough, you basically breeze through the rest of the game. Only getting stopped by arbitrary requirments you have to meet, like a certain amount of Fame before you can enter prestiguous tournaments or fight more renowned martial arts masters. Which means grinding for points, grinding for cash, grinding for training points. This is super-lame. And boring.\n\nThe actual fighting isn't very good either, I am coming from a fighting game background - and while Karate Master 2 shares some similarities, the fights feel off and turn in button-mashing cluster♥♥♥♥s that felt very little like controlled, masterful appliance of Karate but more like a drunken street brawl amongst drug addicts. The worst thing is, the game lets you get away with that - jab-jab-jab-strong punch all day long. Boring.\n\nFinally, let's talk presentation - this game has HORRIBLE art. While the fighters ingame look like somebody half-skilled painted over Art of Fighting / Ryūko no Ken-sprites, the actual cutscenes and character portraits are awful and ugly. This doesn't get me hyped for the somewhat entertaining story that gets lost in one of the worst english translations I have ever played. Seriously, entire paragraphs don't make ANY sense - grammar and vocabulary feel like somebody translated the original script into another language via google translate and used that as a basis for another translation into english using google translate again. The music on the other hand is pretty good, getting a strong Virtua Fighter-feel from the tunes and the dude doing the japanese voices is cool too.\n\nOverall, this game had massive potential - but I cannot recommend it in the sorry state it is in. With better mechanics and smarter-implemented progression along with a massive art-upgrade I could see myself checking out a Karate Master 3, but I am done for good with Karate Master 2.","July 12, 2015","false","3.9"," 42 of 70 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","42","70","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robobotnik/recommended/347670/","robobotnik","Robobotnik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robobotnik/","626 products in account","OSU!\n\nIn short; this game is a mixture of a classic arcade title like Karate Champs, IK+, or the obscure Chatan Yarakuu Shanku - The Karate Tournament, with Art of Fighting's visuals and the recent UFC titles' attention to detail, with a touch of RPG and simulation.\n\nIf you look at the screenshots and expect Karate Master 2: Knock Down Blow to be a typical Street Fighter II clone straight from the 90s you'll be in for a surprise.  In this game you play as forklift truck driver and karate novice Ken during his young adult years in 1980s Japan as he hones his skills, tempers his body and soul, breaks his bones, and fights every rival in order to achieve his goal of becoming a karate master and open his own school.\n\nTo accomplish this you will be tasked with taking on the various dojos of this harbour town, most of which are variations of karate, but you will also fight boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, and Taikwondo practitioners, as well as the odd bull or car, and defeating their students to make a name for yourself.\n\nHowever, these dojos don't except a new face.  You need to earn fame by winning two types of tournaments, one with protective gear and one without.  The difference supposedly is face hitting is against the rules of the latter tournament, however there isn't any in game punishment for this so just go wild.  I did find it the tougher tournament of the two, but otherwise they're very similar.\n\nHowever, you will also need to earn money in order to enter these, and other tournaments, which is earned with a rather simple yet satisfying forklift minigame that brings back memories of the similarly themed Shenmue.\n\nWinning the tournaments and defeating dojos will earn you training days, which are used to increase your Stength, Speed, Toughness, Ki (stamina), and Tai Kitae (described as increasing the roughness of your skin, effectively it increases your chance of critical blows) which are handled via various mini games that are unlocked as you progress in each stat.  Unfortunately a lot of these are rather hit and miss, but they're short enough that they likely won't be too off putting, but you will be playing them a lot.\n\nAs for the combat itself you have the d-pad and four face buttons, which for reference I will be using the X-Box pad layout for further descriptions.  Much like Tekken or UFC titles the face buttons represent Kens left and right punches and kicks, and the d-pad is used to aim for high, mid, or low strikes, combinations of the buttons are used for various techniques, and pressing the two punches together, plus a direction, will perform one of your defensive katas.\n\nInstead of a health metre, your body, as well as your opponent's, is represented by a small green silhouette which indicates damage to your head, legs, arms, or torso by changing to light green, yellow, orange, and finally red.  This increases the chance of being knocked out, but fortunately does recover slightly.  I'm not certain what governs recovery as such, but you'll sometimes be very grateful for a Yame, where the fight pauses due to either one of the combatants falling to te mat or going out of bounds, after which the combatants return to their starting positions.  This gives you a moment for recovery of both your health and Ki, though be warns, if you've taken too much of a beating you won't heal at all.\n\nFights are tense at first, as a single strike can end a match due to the opponent being too strong, or them breaking your bones with a critical.  When this happens you end up in hospital and must engage in a mini game to heal.  Fortunately this action goes both ways, meaning you can score a luck strike as well.\n\nThe game feels both technical and arcadey, I don't want to say I had to use a lot of skill beyond targeting a certain area, and some fights can feel like they're just a war of attrition, but at the same time are very enjoyable.  Hitting a heavy blow or dazing an opponent by getting in a Brainshock or similar feels great, and having to back off and rethink your game due to getting pulverised in the first few seconds and make a very tense moment or two, leading to a more brutal feel than the more famous fighters out there.\n\nThe visuals and sound really help there, seeing a realistic amount of blood splattering the fighters and the floor, heay blows sounding like an explosion as the game momentarily shudders as the screen is framed with a red haze, and the aforementioned Brain/Livershock, being left breathless, or a receiving muscle injury causes a dizzying, wobbly effect as the fighter starts staggering as they try to fight, all of it leads to a real sense of risk and struggle.\n\nThe graphics aren't superb sadly, the sprite work, while effective, does look very rough, especially on some of the fighters, and some of the backgrounds are poorly rendered polygon work, though it has some of the better audiences I've seen in a game.  The music is pretty good, if not very memorable.  It has the feel of an old Tokusatsu show, as well as a classic beat 'em up, and fits the game very well.\n\nUnfortunately the game does have some issues, occasionally the controls would become unresponsive, and the game can be rather repetitive, as grinding is necessary to max out your stats, and get enough money to get through the game.  It also hurts that there's a distinct lack of multiplayer, which would be great in a game this dedicated to an authentic feeling fighting game RPG.\n\nI spent around 6 hours in order to get to the credits, which considering the price is very good.  I can honestly say I had a huge amount of fun in that time, and would love to play more.  Hopefully there will be a sequel some day, with multiplayer included.","April 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Neither of these elements, or anything like them, really, are in the game.\n\nBut what we do have is an absolute beauty of a retro-styled martial arts fighter with RPG elements. It is very, very grindy, but the fights and occasional training minigames are, for the most part, a fun way to blow through a few minutes here and there.

The forklift truck part is absolutely the most indepth use of forklift trucks I've ever seen in a game. I remember games like Deus Ex Revolutions having forklift trucks in certain scenes. But you couldn't drive those ones - hell you couldn't even blow them up. Best you could do was bang your head on them. But these fork lift trucks are drivable. In fact, they are an integral part of this game, for without them you cannot earn your daily bread in order to go to those tournaments.\n\nI also love the way strength is spelled in the game. So much attention to detail in trying to emulate some 90s SNES Japanese import aka "ALL OUR BASE BELONG TO US".\n\nAll joking aside, this game is a really good blast. It can be a bit of a button basher and probably is played best with a controller. I'm using a PC Xbox controller so I have no problems personally.\n\nI recommend this game completely. I think the price tag could be a couple of quid less but it's probably worth it if you like your beat-em ups with a bit of a character improvement RPG element to it.\n\nI would have liked to see an option to turn off the bloody music though. It's not bad and extremely SNES, Playstation sound to it, but I'd rather be able to turn it off and play my own music.\n\nAlso, a free mode where you can test out your moves without a timer would have been welcomed.\n\nYep, recommended.

All though the fun didn't last long as the game is a bit too short, I can say that I really enjoyed playing it.\n\nIn my opinion, for the price of 10€, it should have been longer. I'd also would have liked to see more authentic techniques. Otherwise the RPG elements were nice, some might say that leveling is bit repetitive but I think it was done well. I don't regret paying 10€ for it, but I'd say because it's short and I don't think I'm going to play it through again, it should be more around 5-7€.\n\nAlso I would have liked the game to be a bit more challanging. After you get your skills up, you literally run through even everyone cracking skulls while doing it. Even the hardest tournaments are like 5-10 seconds and KO. There are many dojos to beat, even different styles and it looks like much at the start, but you only have to beat one guy per dojo and that's it (and if your stats are up most challange fights are under 15secs, though Hombu is a tad harder).\n\nStill it's a very good game, I just finished it after started playing yesterday. Addicting, yes.\n\nAll I can do is recommend this game for all friends of the genre out there, but there are TWO MAJOR cons I must adress, which was the only thing I'm giving this game 7/10 instead of 9/10.\n\nMajor reduction also from this because it is not mentioned in the requirements. I also understood that the developer has no intentions of fixing it (link below).\n\nQuote from the developer that made me also somewhat ♥♥♥♥♥♥:\n\n"we are sorry but is not our fault if your keyboard doesn't support more than 4 buttons pushed together."\n\n-and\n\n"Unfortunately, the only solution is that you must purchase a better keyboard that does not have this limitation".\n\n(Link to keyboard problem discussion)\n\nIt is NOT a common property in PC keyboards to have 4+ key pressed support, the developers attitude on that is totally wrong if they don't either plan to fix the issue, or at least add a text to the requirements that controller or keyboard with 4 key ghosting is required.\n\nThe lack of those 2 techniques didn't limit the gameplay that much but If you play with keyboard and don't have the 4 key ghosting ability, you can't learn all the moves. There are only 6 special moves you can learn, and two of those require 4 buttos pressed simultaniously.\n\nSecond major con is the absence of any kind of tutorial to the techniques, and the fact that buttons that flash in the screen are shown always in console format. as "X-Y-A-B". Even if you're using keyboard. Also the technique names are called in japanese, so many times you're just guessing until you got them right. It wouldn't have been a big task to add button images from keybindings to replace the console/controller images.\n\nSo, for that reason, 7/10. (If they would fix these, I'd give this one a 9/10)","March 22, 2015","true","11.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I had to use JoyToKey to map it to keyboard keys.\n\n3) Really poor instructions. It needs a full proper manual with a full move-list and explanation of the Training system (get more training points by winning the entry-level tournaments - get money to enter those by doing the day-job minigame).\n\n4) Buggy menus. Sometimes I end up with a stuck-input and the cursor keeps moving left or right and I have to alt+F4 out and reload. Save often!\n\nI suggest checking the Steam Forum for this game before buying, to get a sense of other problems I haven't covered.\n\nOn the plus side the save game file is REALLY hackable, so you can mess around, unlock progress-things without grinding through, etc. (Devs, please don't fix that.)","February 10","false","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It just feels slitly sluggish during menus and small moments.  Now the Fighting amazing, I have a great time ever fight sometimes I get a but confused on i get 1 shot but still the fighting can and is very enjoyable.\n\nBesides the bugs etc, the only thing i feel is a bit meh.  Is how the level and training system is.  You get 3 training options at the start of the game, and that is great. Once you use those 3 you wont get to see another til after you beat a event ( which sounds alright but) This is where it gets to the grind, they are op for a good 2 3 trys, and you do gain some ablity after but doesn't feel fun in that way.

It's very apparent that the developer has at least spent a lot of time learning about Karate (if not havign actual experience). Many of the mini games are where this really shows. The meditation mini-game is very acurate on an intuitive level (trying to keep the  cursor centered while it is shifting back and forth across a bar). The fighting itself is pretty fun and from the perspective of real real Karate competition it's actually very realistic very realistic (you even have to go through mini-game to recover when you receive a broken bone).\n\nThe Bad\nThe roughest part of the game is the Engrish English translation (the correct team would be "Beaten" not "Beated" when you've beaten a rival dojo). As well I can't seem to get the last couple of achievements (Bear Fighter and You're the Best) even though I've beaten all of the available events. There seem to be a few other minor inconsistencies with controls and menu navigation when using a joystick, but nothing you can't figure out how to get through. The playthrough time wasn't very long (I beat it in a single sitting of ~4hrs).\n\nThe Ugly\nI think some of the character graphics could use some refinement, but other than that there isn't anything I can call ugly about this game.","April 12, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alphaneonic/recommended/347670/","alphaneonic","AlphaNeonic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alphaneonic/","458 products in account","On paper, this idea of this game sounds awesome. A karate simulator where you work your way up from small beginnings. Start with training, move on to winning tournaments and money, learning new skills, and eventually opening your own dojo. Old school Neo Geo style graphics and soundtrack as icing on the cake? Sold.\n\nSadly, this is NOT that game.\n\nIt's a poorly translated, buggy mess.\n\nThe bulk of the first half of your journey is a handful of mini games, with fighting thrown in every now and then.\n\nWhen you start out and you need money to enter tournaments? A work mini game where you drive your forklift back and forth to load a truck.\n\nLeveling up one of your attributes? You have to play one of 20 different mini games, 4 for each one of your attributes. Many of them involve mashing buttons.\n\nGet injured during a fight and sent to the hospital? Another mini game.\n\nThe fighting itself is pretty simplistic, resulting in a "paper, rock, scissors" of low, medium and high attacks. It's pretty brutal early on with quite a few trips to the hospital and laughably easy later, when you are powerful enough to end a fight in only 3 kicks. Worse, you're fighting the same people all throughout the game, so while your skill has increased 10 fold, everyone else has stayed at the same level.\n\nThe story bits are painful to read because of the poor translation, and not in an "All your base are belong to us" kind of way either, it's just hard to follow what's going on. In addition to that, there seem to be two different art styles clashing in the game. There is some pretty good pixel art of the fighers during gameplay, and some MSPAINT abominations during the cutscenes.\n\nGood points: The impact of the fighting does feel good when you land a solid blow, if a bit random. The blood and bone breaking scenes are a nice touch and make you feel pretty badass.\n\nBad: Everything else.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential, but the premise is far better than the execution.\n\n\n\n","September 29, 2015","false","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was worth every penny.  Well, it was worth most of the pennies.\n\nThis is a game that is very approachable despite its lack of tutorial or even an opportunity to get your bearings.  It throws you right into the action with no explaination.  However, it's easy enough to figure out.\n\nThe first challenge is the bad translation.  I'm not sure how this game happened, but I'm pretty sure it's a japanese indie.  Level up your strenght and perform the ching chong toyota weeaboo dahg suup.\n\nAfter the translation comes the glitches.  I've only had to close it and reopen it twice, but it froze several times.  Have patience, and this won't be a problem.  There's also some funny glitches.  Tournament brackets will sometimes claim you've been eliminated when you haven't, and then the two contestants next to you have both beat each other.  It works itself out on its own.  There's also the boxing ring, where you can knock each other out at the same time but have to wait ten seconds before you crumple over and fall.\n\nThe final flaw is the grinding.  You have to go to work as a forklift operator to get money to enter tournaments, at least until you unlock the matches that give you money when you win.  There's also training minigames, which are actually really fun at first.  As soon as you get tired of doing them, you can just stop and let your stats level up on their own.  The button mashing will hurt your thumbs, but it doesn't go without reward.\n\nThe fighting itself consists of high kicks, mid kicks, low kicks, high punches, mid punches, and specials,  You can't throw fireballs, but you can do roundhouse kicks and high flying nose kicks.  You unlock those by pressing the "waza" button in the training menu.  Don't bother with the frontflip kick, spinning backfist, axe kick (leg goes straight up), or anything but the roundhouse and the spinning jump kick.\n\nThe fighting is really visceral, and you know when you land a good hit.  The game rewards you for having the skill to properly land a blow.  Don't be afraid to hit the body or the leg.  The head isn't the only way to win.  Working your opponent's leg is actually very effective.  Out of the three targets, head is the best - but not by much.\n\nDon't worry about the story, it's ♥♥♥♥ and it doesn't get in the way.  Just kick someone's face in.  Story can wait.\n\nWhen doing a tournament in the early game, I had a very intense second round that involved a lot of leg sweeping and face kicking.  It ended in me and my opponent punching each other in the stomach as fast as we possibly could, and then he fell over.  The third round consisted of the match starting, me closing in, one boot to the head, and it fractured his cranium.\n\nThe game will seem easy after a while, until you unlock the secret tournament.  I won't tell you what that is.  Just be prepared and have fun.\n\nYou'll end this game feeling proud of yourself.  You might even want to go again.  Personally, I would absolutely love to see the potential this game holds fleshed out a bit more.  Not many games need sequels, but this one does.  I want to see what else this developement team can do.  I see a lot of creativity in these people.","May 9, 2015","true","10.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

To fighting a bear bear-handed (LOL). To front kicking a Bull like a bamf, after becoming certified on the forklift. Kickboxer inpsired training, and 'Road House' boss Obora.\n\nAnd yet, there is still much more to learn with counter-parry system and some close quarter moves that I had no idea existed....\n\nI must say, I want more!

This game was nostalgic and it was worth every dollar of my $10.\n\n\nSPOILER ALERT END\n\n\nBeing a TKD student myself, the combat system was a breath of relief from the crazy shenanigans of Street Fighter, DBZ, etc. Granted I still love those series, it's just cool to see the principles/mechanics of what actual sparring is like in a video game context. For example: You'll never block everything, 20 hit combos are never going to happen (ROFL), there's alot of trading shots, and mind games.\n\n\nDefinitely wanna see more!

And it does take me back to playing on the mega drive, you still need some skill, it has great rpg elements and one of the few fighting games with training that isn't compeltely and utter crap, infact it's pretty good and it switches it up well!\n\nI recommend this game overall with a score of 7.5/10","August 2, 2015","true","6.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Nothing in this game is designed well. The combat system mostly relies on luck. The menu system makes no sense whatsoever. The game starts you on the stats screen for some reason, rather than the training screen which is basically the root of the screen directory system. The items on the menus are mislabeled. The dialogue is translated horribly, or written by someone who learned English as a second language. Appently whoever designed this game did not even bother to use spellcheck. Strength is as "Strenght" everywhere. The art is absolutely horendous. To beat this game and get the actual ending, you have to spend SEVERAL hours loading boxes and barrels onto a truck. NOTHING TO DO WITH ACTUAL KARATE and a grueling chore for a crappy thirty second ending. Any screen prompts you get for pressing buttons are basically Xbox controls, but it does not tell you what they mapped to on a keyboard. This makes you basically waste your first two training attempts firguring out what the controls are. You cannot get any more training attempts until you beat a tournament, which is hard to do without training. It is not intuitive at all disrgard any reviews that say so.

The actual fighting in this game is very satifying. The fast paced combat, sound effects, and the randomness of injuries during combat make you (the player) feel always on edge. I also felt that the games combat was never unfair if you take combat slow and watch your opponent move you can usually get around their defense or doge/counter your opponets attack in a way that feels very satisfying. It it hard to describe but when you do perform what was explained you feel like at that moment now you have control of the fight. I never truly felt that way in any other fighting game before this one.\n\nI do like how the in game sprite look and move! It is not the best looking but it has a nice style. The training environments are nice remind me of  old kung fu movies training under a water fall and having the other students beat you up so you get tougher,  that is great to see and help reinforce the whole karate lifestyle. But the game character portaits contrast with the in game sprite style. I think it would have been better off tweeking the in game spites for the character portaits during dialogue as oppose to what we got. There isn't that much dialogue but when there is you are reminded in how bad the character portrait contrast with the rest of the game.\n\nThe sound track is a bit weird for me the overworld track I love. It has the take on the world feeling to it, thats great! The other songs are either forgettable of bland.  No other song is more bland to me that when you start a fight. Interesting enough when either you or your oppenent take a serious blow the music starts to kick up and get good.\n\nNow the game is a little rough around the edges (at the time posting this review). some glitches may happen when fighting And text may get flipped around. And if I am correct in saying I do not think the developer CRIAN SOFT native language is english cause at time the dialogue is off when characters are interacting with one another.\n\nBut with all that said I highly recommend this game to any body that likes martial arts stlye genre and fighting games!","April 2, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I definitely am enjoying the ride so far, and I only hope that the issues get ironed out to make this game perfect.\n\nFirst, the things they got right.  Speaking as a former karateka myself, these guys really know their stuff.  Furthermore, while it may look like mashing will get you places, it's a lot more tactical than it appears, and lining up your shots, varying your angles of attack, and knowing when to risk the big fancy techniques will get you far.  The AI is good, providing a tough challenge without making it feel impossible.  The training minigames are interesting and while repetitive, the ways they simulate what they represent make a lot of sense.  The look and sound are perfect for this kind of game, and the translation is actually part of what makes it so charming.  I really hope they leave in at least one mention of STRENGHT.\n\nThe only real gripe with the game is controller support.  It's next to impossible to get a gamepad recognized by the game, and the keyboard controls completely lack macro options to help with the double- and four-button presses.  Even XPadder doesn't help.  For a game like this, that really works better with a controller, this is a pretty serious issue, and one I hope gets addressed soon.\n\nThat all being said, I still recommend this to anyone looking for a fun single-player fighter.  It may seem like a normal game, but it's a really...\n\nA SPECIAL GAME!","June 16, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty quick to perform and doesn't have to be repeated often tho so it's not the biggest deal.\nAltho this game has a unique and very interesting combat system, it's a chore learning it. There's not a very clear tutorial , things are poorly communicated to the player and instead of having some kind of listing of how to perform what moves you have to go into training where sensei will yell out random commands for you to perform and you learn the moves by doing that. Of course you can learn everything by just trying things out in combat, which is the ideal place to learn anyway so it's okay not to have a tutorial.\nThe real issue here is that the game is clearly designed with a controller in mind (sensei yells out commands in button prompts even if you have keyboard selected) but I have no idea what controller it thinks the player ought to be using, since it doesn't seem to recognize my xbox 360 controller (or based on the forum, anyone else's). If you have a mechanical keyboard then things won't be a huge issue but inputs on a regular keyboard are horrible.\n\nI do think this game is worth checking out, primarily because the top sellers on Steam are all awful and this is a better use of money than Bioshock Infinite or Spec Ops the Line or whatever dull triple A game you might be thinking of getting.

Broken ribcages, brain damage, cheesie story, animal cruelty and jumping over cars. Follow the story of Player 1 around building his karate legend.\n\nPicked this up on a 50% discount, no regrets. Put in 6 hours into the game and achieved almost everything there is. The game builds heavily on dat 90s feel. If you belong to a younger generation and missed the fabulous 90s you might stand puzzled at what you are getting in your hands in 2015. This is a fighting game rpg where you level up your heros abilities with minigames. The game offers a number of opponents to beat in dojos who are then later available to fight in tournaments as well. As you increase your fame and bank account you get more figthing venues to attend. As of version 1.09 that is all there is, but it was a fun 6 hours (for me at least).\n\nPros:\n- Dat 90s art style and feel\n- "Fun" button mashing minigames\n- A variety of opponents to fight who you will love or hate to fight against\n\nCons:\n- No replay value\n- No character customization\n- A bit short\n- Lacks tutorial/description in places","June 23, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got an old school fighting game feel, although it is more about realistic martial arts(mostly karate). There is no jumping, no fireballs but instead more realistic punches and kicks.

This can be done through a few means later in the game, though new players will find themselves playing the same silly forklift game a dozen or so times throughout the course of this game.\n\nAfter working, you must fight other karate guysThe goal of this game is to win matches so that you can earn fame, which will let you fight against tougher foes. I think this is an interesting progression system, but it's flawed in that once you get the hang of this game's fighting system, you can knock out just about anyone with a few blows to the head. It's actually pretty funny to visit a guy who the game tells you has devoted their entire life to karate, only to be the newbie who beats the ♥♥♥♥ out of this grizzled veteran in a matter of seconds.\n\nKarate Master 2 is really strange in that it seems that Criansoft has genuine respect for those who devote themselves to karate, though this devotion is told of through a game with a strange art style and a hilariously bad translation.\n(ex.Characters in this game start conversations with "thank you" and end them with "good evening")\nAll and all I'll still recommend this game, as it's still simple fun, and at the end of the day that's all that should matter.","July 8, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quite the button masher though; get ready to have the strongest fingers in the world. There are a few bugs still in the game: 1) Sometimes it says that you have 2 training exercises left but then it disappears after doing one. 2) After maxing out any category after a while, it displays it as 0 instead of 10. 3) Misspelled "strength" in the experience game screen.","June 22, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did!\nAs a game, it's not that amazing. But landing a ushiro mawashigeri in your opponents face, while not as satisfying as in real life, is a pretty nice feeling!","March 23","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mind there are a couple of glitches here and there that can affect the gameplay of the game, the appearance that these glitches will make are not common unless you are almost done with the game. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price, but if this game is on sale, you should buy it because aside from the glitches, you truly feel like you're putting some level of effort into the game, and that made this game really fun for me.","December 5, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Then after two hours or so of play the game then refused to work. First I got a black screen with a couple of white boxes where you could hear the game music playing but could do nothing else except ALT/TAB out and close it. Then the game stopped operating at all. This is a very common problem and gathering by the Community posts I\'m lucky I had the game run properly for as long as I did as some have been unable to run the game at all. I\'ve tried every fix imaginable but this game is now dead and refusing to work at all and there is no developer support, the game has not been updated since last September.\n\nThis is another sad case of the appalling quality control that exists on Steam. If developers and publishers aren\'t going to commit to making their software work for their customers they should not be allowed to sell it on Steam. This issue will not go away until Steam finally starts caring about what goes on their store front. Very disappointing.","June 1","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
