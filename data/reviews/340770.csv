If you love extreme music and appreciate the imagery, this one is no-brainer and deserves its place in your Steam collection.\n\n"Death Goat" is a bare bones twin-stick shooter where you are put against the endless waves of enemies. Using controller is recommended, but not mandatory. There is little variation to it, but you wouldn't notice, as your life expectancy oscilates around 2 minutes. This is clearly a type of game to be enjoyed in short bursts.\n\nOn a technical side: graphics are beautifully drawn. Game stability could be improved a bit - it can crash on occasion. Fortunately, it happens during startup or in the menus, not during the actual gameplay (at least in my experience). This is a minor problem and easily forgiven considering it's in Early Access. Music is one of the game main assets, obviously, and it doesn't disappoint (note for purists: majority of the music is not necessarily Death Metal, but it gets the job done). There are several tracks to choose from and - another good news - developers are willing to expand the catalog in the future.\n\nOK, I did my job as a reviewer, now's your turn - go grab your weapon and KILL THEM ALL!!!\n\n777/10","February 14","true","7.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Global scoreboards available for scorechasers. Screen resolutions of 4k+ was supported along with sliders for sfx, voices and music (why would you turn that down/off !?).

The game controls are simple,  you use a WASD to move and a mouse to shoot, aim and detonate bomb . The next wave always harder to survive than the previous, because you can find bigger amount of enemies, with always a new type of them appearing. When you kill enemies they have a chance to drop different kinds of buff for you to pick up. The graphics of game is simple but for this game style it's fitting. Music selection is nice, if you like this genre you'll probably like it.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+good music\n+fast action\n+steam achievements and trading cards\n\n-after longer time can be a bit repetitive\n-just one game mode\n\nI think this game not want be more for what this been developed, this a simple action game when you should survive as long as possible. This game have good music and enough fats action, but after longer time can be tiresome. But if you like this style or like a metal music i think you should try this one, because the price for this not a big, also at the moment this you can get in bundle to.\n\n7/10","January 16","true","5.3"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","1"

The other day I was doing a little spring-cleaning, and stumbled over Death Goat. I don't remember getting this game, but whatever. Maybe my Steam account has become sentient, and it's just adding games on its own.\n\nIt's more likely that I recieved this game as part of an indie bundle, but why should I bore you with facts?\nI'd rather bore you with opinions instead.\n\nDeath Goat is a pretty cool little game. You're trapped in the 19th circle of Hell, and there's no chance of survival. All you do is slaughter demons until you run out of lives. Over time, you learn the ins and outs of how this game works, and slowly but surely you learn to stretch your limited resources further. All you're really playing for is the high-score, but there is enough depth to keep you entertained.\n\nLike the arcade classic Smash TV, your primary means of survival are the weapons. Your default gun/stave/??? is pathetic and wimpy, relying on it will get you killed. So as soon as a monster drops a weapon orb, you grab it and start kicking some butts. There are four weapons, and you're going to want the purple orb. Why? Because it's a spreadshot that clears the area quite nicely. The catch is that all of the weapons are temporary, and the orbs are only on-screen for so many seconds. Still, in a game like this, every second matters. If you have a purple weapon, and a purple orb drops, don't just rush over and grab it. Let that orb sit there for a little while, so you can make the most of your current weapon.\n\nIt's fair to say that luck plays a slight factor in your survival. If you're not getting good weapon drops, or you just can't seem to get your shields and bombs replenished, then you'll probably have a bad time. It's important to learn the ins and outs of enemy behaviors/spawns and your movement. Basically, it's all about preparing for the dry spells. If you can handle bad situations with no weapons, then you're sure to improve your score.\n\nIt's also nice that games of Death Goat are extremely short. Some twin-stick shooters take awhile to get challenging, and that gets old quick. Business starts to pick up after the first or second minute of every game, so you're never relaxing for long.\n\nOverall this is a simplistic game, and will only retain your attention for as long as you're trying to top the online leaderboards. It is pretty solid though, so give it a look.","April 12","true","6.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","13","16","3","1"

Death Goat is this game's flagship character but every marketing bone in my body is screaming that it should be the also-selectable DEATH GRANNY, a vicious old bat that roams the wastelands with one hand steering her wheelchair and the other unloading eldritch firepower into the hordes of Hell. Such is the fear that this decrepit devil cleanser commands that the stage announcer can only bellow 'PRUUUUUNNNEEESS' before she begins smearing wandering affronts to Christ across the desert floor to a rampaging (and fully customizable) metal soundtrack.\n\nAt the moment, DEATH GOAT is a basic twin-stick shooter with a clever, albeit niche, cosmetic theme, flooding the senses with blood, bombs and breakneck music. It's obvious that there needs to be much more added to allow it to compete with other shooters at the same budget or seriously pique the interest of hardened genre fans but the core gameplay is lightning fast and, thanks to the sheer amount of times you will die, doesn't feel as stale as its current straightforward build dictates that it should. One to watch.\n\nYou can also play as a cat in a suit of armour. It... seems wrong not to mention that.\n\nFull review below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIcB-g0dvL0","December 8, 2015","true","5.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","14","19","8","0"

It doesn't really matter who you choose though because all the characters seem to function the same - although the tank does seem pretty difficult to monitor the protection aura level.\n\nDeath Goat also has a lot going for it music wise. If you like metal, you're going to like this. You can select what you want to listen to, or just go for shuffle track on death which is the best way to go really until you've heard it all and picked your favourite tracks in the game.\n\nIn terms of actual game play you move about on a fairly empty wasteland - there aren't any environmental obstacles like mountains; it's just you and tonnes of demons (though being in early access maybe some environmentals will be added later). The worst of all the demons you will encounter is the tiny skull spider, and although they are the easiest thing to kill, there's lots of them, and they move fast. Your character is surrounded by an aura and each time a demon touches it (regardless of its size) the aura degrades a level and that demon dies. Once the aura is gone you're ready to be eaten by the next demon you come into contact with unless you find an aura refill. If you're eaten you lose one of your three lives, and explode killing everything before respawning. I found it not uncommon to run into a couple of small spider skulls at the same time and suddenly lose all my aura. The aura could probably do with having a brief moment of invulnerability when you get touched to make the game a little fairer, but then Death Goat isn't really about being fair. As well as the aura pick-up there's also nuke style pentagrams (of which you can hold three) and various power-ups for your weapon. Weapon power-ups are timer based and do not stack which made me a bit sad when I realised I couldn't combine effects. My favourite power-up so far is what I would describe as a psychic chainsaw, though most attacks are variants on your base projectile style weapon.\n\nDeath Goat is made in Unity, and it works pretty well. It automatically detected my ideal resolution, and I haven't found any bugs or anything that makes it difficult to play. My Xbox 360 controller worked really well with Death Goat - you use the analogue sticks and the triggers only, so you never have to shift the position of your fingers. One stick to move, the other stick to shoot in a given direction, one trigger to run, and the other to pentagram (nuke). Death Goat is just pure twitch: dodge and shoot twin stick badassery.\n\nBeing in early access Death Goat shows a lot of promise, and the dev seems to be very active in the community, and the current price of $2.99USD is pretty fair. The fact that the game appears to be bug free at this point means that development is going to focus on adding new features as asked for by the community, which is pretty exciting. I'm particularly looking forward to the possibility of multiplayer modes being added.\n\n7 out of 10 would RELEASE MORE CRACKHEADS \m/","December 7, 2015","true","4.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It follows the more arcade style top-down shooter road with a score system rather than a level system with 3 lives and a lot of power ups along with a speed boost and what we can only describe as a nuclear pentagram. There’s plenty of enemy variety to keep the player coming back, and (upon death) enemies explode into a pile of gore, guts, and an otherwise unruly corpse that looked amazing. We managed to stay alive (at best) for 8 waves, but I’m sure there are other players out there who are far better than us. During the game, you can also find temporary shields, weapons boosts, and other power ups to aid the player. The gameplay is simple, but fun and we enjoyed our time with the game. It’s a different flavor of top-shooter, and it’s more enjoyable then one might initially suspect. Coupled with its $3.00 asking price, even if someone is on the fence about purchasing the game due to it being in Early Access; the low price of the game combined with it’s fairly professional look and interesting pallet of color choices and the ‘death metal’ ascetic would make those who are on the fence most likely jump on the purchase. It doesn’t have a story, but it doesn’t claim to. Unlike when we harped on Gone Home for it having a weak story, Death Goat doesn’t try to put one in at all. While I think a story along the line of Serious Sam layered on may have brought some added humor, it’s fine as-is and doesn’t really need to be there.\n\nOverall, if you’re looking for a cheap top down shooter that may see improvement over time, enjoy heavy metal music, and you can risk not having that Starbucks coffee for a one whole morning, this game is probably for you. It’s cheap, it has a cool look resembling a heavy metal album cover, plays great, and got hooked trying to beat a friend’s score."\n\nFor the full review, here's a link: http://yourwolfsdengaming.com/2015/12/19/death-goat-review-something-something-metal-music/","December 19, 2015","true","3.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

That is what Death Goat is all about.\n\nPros:\n- Good selection of metal\n- Teaches you how to kite (walk backwards while shooting at the enemy while also avoiding damage)\n- Micromanage your character to his/her fullest potential\n\nCons:\n- Bombs. Sometimes bombs will go off twice, thus using them up (you start with three). I think there should be a one second delay each time you hit the right mouse button (bomb button)\n- On the ice stage it's hard to sometimes see the power-ups due to it blending in if it's in a certain spot\n- Power-ups feel too random. What I mean by that is you're going to always be looking for the shield and purple (spray gun) power-ups. The others: blue, green and orange seem to be lacking and not up to snuff with the purple power-up\n- Too luck-based. If you're planning on getting a high score you're going to need luck. Now, I know a lot of people don't mind this, I just thought I'd let you know that power-ups could make or break your game. If you don't get the one(s) you need you're good as dead.\n- No spawn armor. You get three lives, and if you happen to die you'll start back in the middle where you initially began. Sometimes an enemy will hit you before you even have a chance to move, thus causing you to take damage on your shield. I think there should be a 1-2 second spawn armor where you take no damage until either: a) those 1-2 seconds are up, or b) you shoot and/or use a bomb\n\nOverall, it's a fun game worth playing.

Fun.\n\n\nGoing into Death Goat I was planning on writing a serious review but really how can you with a game such as this? It really is mad stupid fun. It's exactly the type of game that you want to play when you only have a short time available to play and want to let off some steam.\n\nThe first thing that is addictive is the music. I'm not the biggest metal fan in the world but the music in this game is absolutely perfect. And it sounds great too. Really works for it. The graphics are just fine for what the game is as well. The range of power up weapons really gives the game some variety. You'll find that you love some of them and when you misstep onto one of the ones you don't it becomes a mad scramble to find something else. Even then, however, it's more of a case of actually learning how to use that weapon efficiently rather than it being a dud weapon.\n\nDeath Goat is just a really cool game. I honestly wasn't expecting it to be as cool as what it is. It may never win awards but it'll win the heart and the admiration of much of its player base and deservedly so. At $2.99 at full price or at $2.00 during the Steam sale it's certainly worth the price of admission into this Death Goat killing spree.","December 28, 2015","true","9.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

(The art style, music and enemies are definitely metal!) The game is pretty simple from what I have seen so far; pick a location, pick a character, and pick a heavy metal track, then start shooting demonic creatures before they can reach you. With awesome gore and blood splatter, fantastic creature designs, upside-down crosses for lives, and pentagrams for bombs, this is by far the most metal twin-stick shooter I have ever played. As a metalhead, this game appeals to me a lot, and I'd probably be willing to pay twice the asking price.\n\nThe only real negative at this point (note: it is still in early access at this point) is the lack of variety. Each location and each character affects nothing except what the location and character looks like. The locations have no unique enemies, traps, obstacles, powerups or anything else, and characters don't have different stats or abilities. (I haven't unlocked the tank, so that might be a little different.) So, it probably won't take long to get bored of. Also, if you're not a fan of blood and gore, or metal music, you should probably keep away, but then you probably should have looked at the videos and pictures and deduced that before making your way to the user reviews.\n\nBut for its price, it's definitely an easy game to recommend. Like twin-stick shooters? Like metal-themed games? If you answered yes to both, get this game. It's great for what it costs.","January 15","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like the concept, you have many to choose from.  Death Goat attempts to distinguish itself from the 'others' with its soundtrack, which is damn fine if you are like me, and enjoy well structured death metal.\n\nUnfortunately, the game totally fails at executing this distinguishment by preventing you from actually listening to any of the music, forcing a restart of the song each time you lose all of your 'lives' (which takes less than three minutes, as the game is ridiculously difficult).  How hard is it to keep the music going when your character dies off?  Must be impossible, as the game has been updated several times without this (seemingly necessary) feature.\n\nThere are many other negative nuances of the game; the lack of real choice of character (it's only cosmetic), choice of map (again, cosmetic), etc...   I can't recommend it to anyone with an attention span. As a pure twin-stick shooter, I've played at least a dozen free games that are better in various ways (powerup indicators, zoom in/out capability, perk system, better sound effects/graphics, more creative weapons, and so on...)","March 23","false","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

With a little bad luck you don't get any weapon powerups, and then you're are pretty much screwed if it's wave 3plus. Yes you have the "panic button" and can use a bomb, and hope one of the enemies drop a weapon powerup. It's going to make you curse in the beginning but after awhile you start to get a hang of your character, how fast he moves, and the same with enemies, making it a little more pleasant experience. The other characters contribute little to nothing to the experience, you get the same weapons and as far as I can tell no movement difference. After 1.000.000points total you unlock the tank, which is a massive thing, but same movement and weapons, the big difference here though is if you hit an enemy straight on you kill him, but you're still fragile from the sides. The game don't offer much new after you played it a few times at the moment, but it's still a decent game, I just hope they fix it, so the characters are different and make you (a little) less dependant on power ups, because at the moment, the run is too dependant on good drop rate. All and all, a decent game still in early access of course, decent controls.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordbalder/recommended/340770/","lordbalder","Balder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordbalder/","927 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst and foremost, since music is main selling point of this game, I must say that, although I do sometimes listen to metal music (though, rock and punk are my favourite), I generally don't like death metal... Because of that, I won't be commenting music, but will talk about gameplay (or the lack of one) in the game...\n\nAnyway, Death Goat is a simple twin stick shooter in the style of Crimsonland (that I played and loved, long time ago); So you play as a Death Goat (or as Death Granny, or Kitty, or...) and while running around relatively small area kill everything that tries to hurt you...\nThe controls are responsive and feel nice, graphics are ok, but screen tends to become cluttered after some time, interface is generally ok, not too pretty, but in style and readable enough...\nWhat I did find frustrating is that hitbox for "shield" is very large (as large as shield xD), and you cannot just squeeze through enemies and run away. I usually like that last second squeezing about this type of games. Not a special problem, but it did get on my nerves... :)\n\nSo, why I don't recommend this game... In its current state it has no content... I know that it is in early access, and that devs say that they plan on adding content when (if) more people buy the game, but currently it is more like a demo than a game (and they also say that 'Death Goat is a complete game in its current state', which it ISN'T!)... You can choose between 3 locations, that are completely the same as far as I can see, and between 5 characters, of which 4 are completely the same (gameplay wise), as far as I can tell... Other than that, you start the game, and kill the same hordes with same weapons (stronger weapons show up from time to time as power ups, but you lose them after some time). When you lose all 3 lives, you are back at the starting point without any progress (except overall point count).\n\nSince pretty much whole description of this game is the list of bands that contributed to it's soundtrack, and that Music is the second on the list of planned features (though I have no idea why is that), this game feels more like 'Let's do something while I listen to this music', which is pretty much the same as playing snake on YouTube videos (if that is still possible xD)... Or playing actually finished games (like Crimsonland), while listening to audio of any band you like...\n\nPros:\nMusic (if you like it)\nIt has potential to be good twin-stick shooter once it becomes the game, and not just the demo\n\nCons:\nIt generally has no content\nMusic (if you don't like it)\n\nSince I like twin-stick shooters, and it has potential, I will check this game again in a year (or so), to see if they added anything... I really hope they will... But at this time, it is, just, not a game; even for this price... Unless you buy it for the music...

On the plus side, the soundtrack is pretty neat, and they are continuing trying to expand it. The game runs smoothly, which is nice.\n\nThen we go to all of the negatives. The combat feels weak. The sound design is poor, and lackluster. The enemy design tries to look cool, but it just lacks that special "oomph" when you're splattering them. This game tries to copy Crimsonland and manages to be worse in every way except for the soundtrack.","May 18","false","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
