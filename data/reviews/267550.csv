The Amazing Spider-Man 2 can be enjoyable for Spider-Man fans, but the average gamer will definately find a ton of frustrations in an otherwise enjoyable game.\n\nTHE PROS:\n· The story is pretty good, with some interresting villains like the King Pin and Kraven the Hunter.\n· Refferences to both the movies and the general Spider-Man lore.\n· Completing Hide-Outs will grant you with a new Spidey suit.\n· Collectibles offer a lot for Spider-Man fans. You can view your collectibles in Stan Lee's comic book store!\n· Spider-Man's web will (most of the time) realistically stick to buildings.\n· Spidey has some sweet lookin' moves in both his swinging and comat.\n\nTHE CONS:\n· Even though the camera has been greatly improved over the original Amazing Spider-Man game, the combat feels a bit unresponsive and too stiff. It's safe to say they're trying to copy the Batman Arkham-series' combat, but it often feels like you're punching thin air because the henchmen you're beating up react unrealistically to Spider-Man's punches and kicks.\n· A terrible presentation. The menus looks dull and boring, like they were back on the days of the Playstation One.\n· I wouldn't call these Side Missions actual side missions, because you're sort of forced to do them. If you don't do them, they people will start to see Spider-Man as a mennace in stead of a hero. This wouldn't be a huge deal if the side missions were fun, buy they're largely boring and downright repetetive. You don't get a good enough chance to explore the city when uninterresting side missions pop up randomly across the map for a limited time.\n· Visiting Aunt May's house to change costumes requires you to hop on a train that's only on some points of the map. Sure it makes sense, but changing costumes on the fly would be a lot easier. You can easily lose a couple of minutes to find the train, web onto it, get your costume off and get in your Peter Parker clothes, go upstairs, pick a suit, go back outside just to find out it's not really the costume you really want to wear. Cosumes grant a slight bonus (which is very welcome) but in order to avoid going through this time consuming and boring process of switching suits will probably just leave you playing with one specific costume.\n\nTHE VISUALS:\n· The overal detail in the world is very good... if it was 2007. Textures on Spidey's suit look bad and blocky, faces look like they're made out of wet clay, the camera will sometimes clip through an object like a wall in the middle of a cutscene. It's basically a pretty bugged game with very few pretty skyline sights, but they mostly look like a downgrade from the original.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n· If you're a big Spider-Man fan, probably pick this up on sale to scratch that itch for a decent Spider-Man game. It feels like a rushed product that is a general downgrade from the original with only very few improvements that quickly fade away in the game's frustrating issues. 6/10","August 30, 2014","false","10.6"," 254 of 288 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","254","288","8","6"

Web swinging was fun for a bit but its lack of control meant ending up always using the webzip system and just watching Spidy do the swinging for you. Coupled with a punishing crime system that closed the world instead of opening it as you played, it just can't compete with the good old Spiderman 2 for Gamecube....","April 2, 2015","false","15.0"," 112 of 131 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","112","131","11","0"

That being said it's not a terrible game, it's not particularly good either, but it's not terrible. If you played the first Amazing Spider-man game you will notice that this game is basically a carbon copy of that with a new story.\n\nSome changes however that make it ultimately worse than the first Amazing Spiderman:\n\n1. The new swinging mechanic, which they implemented cause people complained about Spidey swinging from nothing, adds in that you have to attach webs to buildings to swing. Sounds like a positive point right? It would be except they did it in the laziest way possible. They kept the swinging mechanic exactly the same and just editted it to say you can't swing unless a building is near. This combined with the map being the exact same means you spend 90% of your time web zipping and 10% actually swinging. If you try to seing more than that you get to hear this "blip" sound over and over ... or have spidey say "this just in, webs need something to stick to" for the 400th time.\n\n2. Related to #1, they left the swinging mechanic within mission exactly the same as the first game ... which just tosses in utter confusion for players after they get used to the new mechanic. Was anyone really bugged that badly by Spidey swinging from thin air that we needed to break the game this badly?\n\n3. The side missions are technically optional, but in reality they are mandatory. If you don't do them regularly you become labelled a "menace" and have to fight off cops around the city. Sounds like no big deal, and maybe a bit of extra fun. It would be except that early in the game they introduce "the task force" which will attack you so mercilessly that simply swinging around the city with a menance level of 3/3 will make you dead in about .... well can't finish that sentence cause you're dead already.\n\nOther than that the game is the same as the first ... which means the same issues: All missions indoors in isolated maps negating the whole idea of "open world," a stealth mechanic that is encouraged but terribly broken (though in this game if you wear the Spider-man Noir suit you can fix the mechanic and make it usable :P), boring one button combat, an upgrade system that is useless cause you can (and I did) play the entire game without purchasing any upgrades.\n\nSo ya ... not the best game, but if you like Spidey you'll get some enjoyment out of this game there is no doubt about that, but wait for like a 75% off sale or something. Bottom line don't pay more than $20.","January 8, 2015","false","10.7"," 119 of 142 people (84%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","84","119","142","14","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuelGaultlent/recommended/267550/","SamuelGaultlent","SamuelGaultlent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuelGaultlent/","640 products in account","This game gave me the strong impression that the developers intended to make the money piggy backing off of the film release and not make a polished game.  I was disappointed because Beenox has made very good Spider-Man titles previous to this one.\n\nThere are many issues, only magnified by the fact that I found Amazing Spider-Man 1 to be such a good game.  There are no improvements to the combat system (I found it to be buggier and less satisfying than the original game). Web-swinging took some getting used to, which only made the fact that the game required you to travel long distances in a short amount of time more obvious and frustrating.  The mechanic of requiring random events took all of the fun out of saving citizens, and the lack of any impact other than making your life harder made it unsatisfying.  Some of the events were similar to older games, and the fact that it made me irritated rather than nostalgic showed me that there was little thought to making completing them fun.\n\nThe story of Amazing Spider-Man 1 game was not during the film and allowed for the introduction of some iconic villains while building on the plot, while making some epic boss battles with huge and difficult adversaries.  Amazing Spider-Man 2 lazily makes the game's plot during the movie, forcing lackluster introductions and battles with very good villains, creating large holes in the movie plot, and making generic enemies not on par with the varied and satisfying plot and enemies of Amazing Spider-Man 1.\n\nA positive aspect of the game was that it does have a lot of nods to fans, the unlockable suits were satisfying, but they made the most desirable premium DLC, which removes the positive in my opinion.  I liked being rewarded by being able to read comics by finding the collectables scattered throughout the world, and there was some insinuation of what was to come.  Ultimately, this game made me question pre-ordering a Spider-Man game again.","January 9, 2015","false","1.4"," 104 of 133 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","104","133","3","0"

You basically get given an entire different story to the film that seems like it was written with less thought and less time than this review. That was the main reason for my 29 hours on the first game that the game took place after the events of the film so it wouldn't have to try and follow a storyline that was already given so amazingly (heh, get it?) within the film.\n\nI enjoyed the combat system from the first game as the developers actually tried to make different animations for the attacks and counter attacks, this time around it just seemed sloppy and lazily thought out.\nThe upgrade system is easily the worst i've encountered in the last 10 years, even the worst of games wasn't as terrible with their upgrades. You got given abilities and then had to spend "Tech Points" (A nice comeback from the first game) on the 4 upgrades for them. You got given about 6 or 7 abilites with 4 upgrades for each one and they're not even that great an upgrade, it's quite easy to go through the game ignoring the combat upgrades as the only useful ones were the travelling slingshot upgrade that took about 5 seconds to execute and within that 5 seconds you could of travelled further anyway. it was more of a gimick than an actual upgrade, something to impress the fans - Didn't work!\n\nThe web swinging was always the most fun of any spiderman game, Spiderman 2 onwards seemed to nail the webswinging, I even enjoyed the webswinging of the previous game despite not clinging to buildings. This game seemed to reduce my enjoyment. That slingshot was the only enjoyable thing about it and even that got boring after using it twice. your web reach was tiny so you were reduced to being never more than 3 meters away from the walls limiting your freedom. Spiderman also gave out a snide comment when he had nowhere to swing despite a building being right next to him, this just made me angry as it just seemed like another uncompleted feature of the game.\n\nContinuing on from trying to impress the fans is the inclusion of a few great comic book villains, such as; Shocker, Kraven the Hunter, Black Cat, Kingpin, and the most impressive, Carnage.\nEvery boss fight was basically the same. punch kick punch punch, webpull, spidersense, webrush, punch some more. Every boss had some sort of difference, but they all seemed so last minute. Your first boss is the shocker from there you obtain his "seismic blasters" which only seemed useful to fight the kingpin 3 hours later. It took 4 seconds to charge up just to knock them down, when the enemies are down you have to wait for them to get up to attack. It was like being a superhero suffering from ADD and he just seemed to forget that he could of webbed a guy to the floor. This upgrade is not needed and was just another way to make fan boys ♥♥♥♥ in their little spiderman pants.\n\nCarnage. As great as it was to see cletus kasady, he seemed tame. He seemed less crazy than the 1995 spiderman cartoon casady and that was a cartoon! this is a video game rated 16! The carnage symbiote is meant to amplify everything about a person hence making kasady even more dangerous. There was no difference in his behaviour. Just his voice. It was as if someone just hit a distortion switch but there was no tonal difference. just a clear talking person saying he will kill spiderman.\n\nAs great as seeing some of my favourite spiderman villains in game, fighting them was more boring than watching slugs race. This game spits in the face of a spiderman fan and twists and distorts spiderman enemies into simple weakling incapable of landing one punch on the webhead.\n\nI don't recommend this game and makes me think twice about preordering the next one from now on.\n\n3/10","April 30, 2014","false","7.5"," 346 of 501 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","346","501","4","23"

The main story can be finished in roughly 3-4 hours, but if you do all of the monotonous sidequests I guess you can add 5-10 hours to that number. Add to that that it's an extremely poorly optimized port, with constant framerate drops and the fact that it follows an entirely different story than the movie and bam; we have a winner for yet another movie cash-in game, even if it isn't identical. They just had to release this close to the movie.\n\nIf only they worked on this for 6 months longer this could've been semi-great. The first Amazing Spider-Man wasn't without its problems, but at least it was somewhat polished, and definitely longer.\n\nNow, the graphics, on the other hand, are pretty good, even if it could've used more detail on street level (swinging through these streets is really cool, though). The game in general has a colorful look.\nAnd it's a real shame that they didn't use the movie actors for the voices. Things felt a bit forced I thought, and the one-liners were repeated way too often (why the heck is it called an one-liner if it's repeated every couple of minutes ?). A missed opportunity.\n\nPlay this if you're a big Spider-Man fan, or if you've played all of the other titles before. Or just wait for a sale if you really, really want to play it.\n\n[Rating: 63/100]","May 4, 2014","false","4.9"," 125 of 178 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","125","178","2","4"

The first Amazing Spider-Man game was a surprisingly fun Batman Arkham clone with a few bugs and a pretty fun campaign with even decent to good side missions. Amazing Spider-Man 2 however just flat out feels rushed, very buggy, and was obviously shoved out the door to come out around the same time as the average to mediocre film. The hero and nemesis system sucks and feels restricting, the character models look even worse than the first game, and the web slinging, combat, and movement just feels really floaty with no impact at all.

Now 10+years later and somehow that basic experience feels even worse, not to mention it doesn't feel nearly as acrobatic or fluid in the slightest.\n\nThey've managed to take a mediocre game and just make it too tedious to even enjoy the novel aspects of.  A relatively short period into the game and you're forced to repeat the same 9 crime stopping missions in tiny areas preceded and followed by quickly tiresome cutscenes as often as possible, and it only increases in frequency as the game goes on.

The game is much more cartoony (in comparison to the first Amazing Spiderman game) and so the graphics do run smoother but do not look as visually pleasing in some respects. Because of this though, the game is a lot more stable than the first game which would crash regularly. I completed this game and didn't personally suffer a single crash, but the first game would crash approx every 2-3 hours.\n\nBecause it is more comic-based and cartoony, there are a lot more spider suits that can be unlocked that have their own benefits to using them. each suit can be "levelled up" as you complete missions and so their stats will increase as you play. That being said though, I played the game on normal difficulty and regularly changed my suit (about every hour) and so the highest level one I had was the starter suit and that was at level 6. Personally, I didn't really notice a big difference in the benefits of each suit. I am pretty confident that you can play the whole game in one suit and it never really be a big deal. It is nice that they have added the variety, but the level system just seems redundant to me.\n\nAs with the first game, there are a ton of repeatable side missions and once you complete one type then you know exactly what you need to do next time you do it. There is variation in having different crime missions to complete, but there is zero variation in each type of crime. For example, I completed four burning building missions (where you save hostages from the fire) in a row and every time the mission was at the exact same factory with the victims being in the exact same location. Basically the game just kept spawning the same mission over and over and you don't know until you accept the mission and it loads in. The real annoyance here is the fact that they have added a Menace/Hero system where every time you complete a mission you will get Hero Points and every time you fail (or miss, more on that in a moment) a mission then you will get menace points. If you fall too deep into the red (menace) then the Oscorp goons will send everything they have after you and make it pretty hard to get from A to B without being attacked. This system is inherantly flawed as the menace/hero meter drops way too quickly and so it becomes a requirement to complete the non-variable side missions on an almost constant basis if you want to avoid being attacked. What is even worse is the fact that the side missions spawn at random on the map and are on a timer. If you do not complete the mission before the timer runs out then you "miss" that mission and automatically get menace points and as it is frequently spawning missions on the other side of the map, you will undoubtebly miss a ton of these. As someone who suffers a little with OCD, seeing so many side-missions automatically "fail" due to time out is a real annoyance. Personally I preferred having the missions spawn depending on where you were in the story and so you could take your own time to explore and complete them.\n\nThat is another thing with the menace/hero system. Because you are under constant scrutiny and you are almost constantly losing missions to timeout and so you feel like you are in a mad rush to get from A to B to complete a mission before you lose too much hero status and the Oscorp goons come out to get you. This really makes the game feel like a mad dash to the finish line and destroys the feeling of freedom to explore that other spiderman games (including the first Amazing spiderman game) have given you. As with it's predecessor, there are hundreds of comic book pages to collect as you play but due to this enforced urgency I have to say that I hardly found any whereas in the first game I had collected most as I was playing the main story.\n\nThey have made an effort to improve webslinging and swinging from the first game, as in the first game it was as simple as just holding one button and pushing forward. Spider would continually through webs as he needed them, even if it didn't look like there was anything to swing from. Well in this game, you know have a button for the left arm and one for the right. This means that you need to swing from whatever side has something to swing from in order to get to where you need to go. This is a little strange at first (I had just finished playing the first game when I moved on to this) but does feel more natural than just holding one button down constantly. However, this system also has it's flaws. On a regular basis you will be next to a skyscraper or have buildings on both sides but you will press either of your webslinging buttons and just hear an error noise. This seems to just be a random occurance and can be particularly annoying when trying to get somewhere in a hurry or trying to follow someone on a chase mission.\n\nAnother annoyance for me is the fact that you have to get the metro to go back home to change your suit. The suit picks up damage very easily and quite often is shredded after one or two side missions, which made me want to change it quite often. In order to do this I would often have to get from one side of the city to the other in order to use the train so I could load in Aunt May's house where I could change my suit. What made this even more annoying is that you have to wait for the train to come out of a tunnel, which usually means swinging forward and backward for a minute until the train is out and you can land on it. In the first game, Spidey was staying in an apartment that was right in the centre of the map and so it was easy to get to from pretty much anywhere on the map. The train in this game though is in the upper right corner of the map and so there are times when it seems a long way away. What is even more frutsrating is that they have "shared" the functions that were in spideys home in the first game across two locations in this game. Aunt Mays house has the suits, everything else is located at Stan Lee's comic book store which is in the bottom left of the map (again not an ideal location!). As nice as it is to see a stan lee cameo in this game, it is frustrating having to gop to one place for your combat mission replays and one place for your suits, both of which on opposite sides of the map. With the urgency of the menace/hero system, it made me spend almost no time at Stan's comic place as it was just totally out of the way and opposite to where you need to be for your main missions.\n\nAnother annoyance for me was the photography missions are just terrible. In the first game, you would have to photograph two or three items at a location and there was a bit of a back story. In this game, you photograph one thing to get a sound clip of someone talking. Makes sense? Not at all. Even more annoyingly, you would often have to photograph the SAME things to complete these missions. Usually it was a laptop on the back of a cop car or a "CK" painted on the wall. These missions just made no sense and were a time waster.\n\nFinally, The game itself has less gameplay than the first Amazing Spiderman game by several hours. This is quite a lot considering just how much of the game is already copy and paste repeatables. What is surprising is that this game actually boasts more villains than it's predecessor, but just has less for you to actually do and so you end up spending less time playing the main story than you would in the previous game. In total, I had completed the main story in this game in less than 2 days (obviously that is not constant gaming either).\n\nI would only recommend paying for this when it is on severe sale.\n\n","April 2","true","13.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","0"

It is known for being an unoptimized console port, but I was able to run it fine with maxed settings even though the games graphics aren't all that great anyway. Only thing I liked about the game was swinging through New York, and the costumes.\n\nThe game's story is completely different from the movie, as I was not expecting. The only connections it has to the movie is Electro who feels like he just makes a cameo appearance in the game, so he's hardly in it. Harry Osbornes disease, the Green Goblin and that's it from what I can remember. The story is just so bland and easily forgettable. I found myself several times trying to remember what was happening and such. The side missions are terrible, it's just filler that Beenox tried to pass as a "game".\nTL;DR: Bad game is bad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NexxCR/recommended/267550/","NexxCR","Nexx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NexxCR/","261 products in account","I beat it in about 6 hours last night so I thought I would break down what I thought of it into different categories.\n\n-Story-\nThe story starts off when Ben first gets shot, but then quickly goes 2 years into the future. Obviously this timeline is in a alternate universe because you are still looking for Uncle Ben's Killer 2 years later. The story felt random, there wasn't really a main villian (I guess Kingpin was suppose to be the main one, but he didn't feel like it) Overall the story just didn't seem to pull you in. For movie spoilers, I'm almost certain there are none, but I think you do learn a bit about how Harry Osborne becomes the green goblin, other than that it seems basically spoiler free.\n\n-Gameplay-\nThe web swinging seemed to work really well, although sometimes when going over certain areas like parks and such, you will latch onto nothing. And anytime you are in some mission area you will have this weird web swinging mechanic that you can barely control, and it also latches onto nothing. Also using any special move like that Vertical web swing move or the slingshot will also latch onto nothing (although the slingshot technically will, just third web he makes doesn't)\n\nThe combat seems alright and pretty fluid, there are many different enemy types, so you have to think about the best way taking them out. I made a review about this earlier on how I disliked the stealth since it seemed to be unneeded, but I changed my mind. Stealth is always a good option, especially if you are dealing with a lot of heavy armored enemies. They are way easier to take out using stealth than fighting them.\n\nBoss battles are like any other generic boss battle, you hit them with some special move, they get dazed, you punch them around, they get back up, repeat. Most boss battles were easy, only trouble I had was with Kingpin, cause he had heavily armored backup, and they were a pain to take out while dealing with Kingpin.\n\nNow the different suits you could get I thought was pretty cool, you could unlock new suits by invading russian hideouts and stealthing your way to the suit. Each suit has 3 different perks that increase as you level the suit up by completing various things. I found the Flipside suit to be OP since it had Fast Healing, Damage Resitance, and More Damage. Its basically the perfect suit for everything. Although the Alien looking suit (can't remember the name) is good if you are doing anything that requires stealth since it has a lot of stealth perks.\n\nAnyway, I guess the last thing to talk about is the morality system, basically in the overworld there are a bunch of little mini missions you can do to boost your morality (which means bonus stat boosts to your suit perks) there seem to be a lot of different kinds of them, which is nice so it never feels to repetitive, and if you fail, you usually end up gaining a bad morality. When you start getting into the bad morality area, these enemies called the "Task Force" start appearing all over New York, and they become worse the more of a menace you become. You also gain negative boosts to your suit. The morality type system seems like a nice addition, but I didn't really care for, because most of the time you won't be in the negative area.\n\n-Graphics-\nNow I'm one that doesn't care about graphics that much, but good god. The graphically glitches in this game was too damn high! Shadows were always glitching out and casting a weird screen effect instead of a solid shadow, this game just doesn't seem optimized for PC in general, I have a 660 ti that can run most games on high, and this had trouble running this game. I'm pretty sure I had about 20 FPS in any fight sequence and anytime I was webswinging. It didn't kill the game that much for me, but definitely was a annoyance.\n\n-Overall-\nI see that this game is definitely worth the $40 if you are any type of Marvel fan. Anyone outside of that, I don't think they will enjoy it as much. This seems like a game that is in the right direction to becoming as good as Spiderman 2, but just isn't there yet.","April 29, 2014","true","8.3"," 92 of 158 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","92","158","0","4"

At first I thought Uncle Ben had a heart attack since there was no blood, the only hint I had he was shot was that it said "investigate gunshot".  Warning, this game is heavily made for very young children.  Yet oddly the controls are made for black belt game masters.\n\nFor an example of how bad the controls are picture Assassins Creed, then multiply their crappy controls times one thousand.  Many missions rely on precise controls, such as entering burning buildings.  There can be a civilian right in front of you at a window but you cant rescue them or save them unless you find a flagpole to enter the window, yet hes right in front of you leaving you to stare at the civilian contemplating their life as they die rather than saving them.  Finding these flagpoles is almost impossible since you need spidersense to find the victims and the building is heaving impossible to see through black clouds of smoke.  Combine that with the races that are almost impossible that are way to long meaning if you make a mistake there is no restart race option you sit and wait 1-3 minutes for the timer to just run out.  What a mess.\n\nThe campaign is only three hours long.  In the last spiderman the game was fun enough with random crimes to make it fun to keep playing, this game offers none of that.  The fire alarms are useless, and the car chases are all the same.  After doing one car chase which is a series of quick time events, you can relax knowing you did every car chase event in the game since every single one is the same.\n\nRating:  1/10  Value:  $0.99","April 30, 2014","false","10.7"," 54 of 91 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","54","91","0","4"

The first The Amazing Spider-Man game was served as an epilogue to the main film. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 video game takes a different approach as it has a unique storyline of its own that has little sprinkles from the actual movie.\nAmazing Spider-Man 2 the game starts with you as Peter Parker on the night his uncle, Ben Parker is shot and killed. The game then flashes forward somewhere in time between the first and second films, with Peter still looking for the thief who killed his uncle. The game then proceeds to meander through encounters with main-stay villains in the Spider-Man universe such as The Kingpin, Kraven, the Green Goblin and Carnage.\nThe game is an open world style game. The main missions are too short and the side missions are not very plentiful. Nearly all side missions are also in the first game, also most achievements are the same.\nLike in the first game you can choose different Spider-Man outfits. Some costumes can be unlocked in the game, while others are featured as DLC.\nOne of the biggest changes compared to the first game is the web slinging. The first game had poor web slinging physics as Spider-Man would attach his webs onto the sky. Not to mention Spider-Man floated too much and it did not feel fast paced. In this game however, webs attach themselves to building this time and feels much faster. It’s a major improvement over past games, but still does not match the perfect web slinging physics from the 2004 Spider-Man 2 game.\nThe fighting mechanics in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 appear to have been simplified compared to the previous game. The previous game had a unique system that was similar to the fighting style from the Batman Arkham games. The combat just feels cheap and not as innovative as it was in the previous game which is a shame.\nThe graphics look outdated, they were even better in the first game.\nThe voice actors do only a passable job.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 seems to be a lazy attempt to replicate the Batman: Arkham games with Spider-Man in the lead role. If you played the first Amazing Spider-Man game you can skip the second game, it is nearly the same but worse.\n\nSounds 5/10\nGraphics 5/10\nGameplay 5/10\nAtmosphere 4/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","May 26, 2014","false","23.9"," 28 of 44 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","28","44","3","1"

I know Amazing Spider-Man 1 was trying to be like the original Spider-Man 2, well this is the next step forward. I think the web swinging is great and unique, it will take some getting used to at first but once you figure it out it's amazing.\n\nThis game has a hero system where if you act against crimes you will be loved but if you ignore them the police will track you down. It's quite cool and good. But maybe to good. So good its bad in fact. You can finish one crime and get points towards being a hero while 2 maybe more crimes will fail on the other side of the city causing your points to deplete. I would not mind this however if this did not put a penalty against skills while wearing a costume. Every costume in this game has different bonuses that can help you in how ever way you want.

TAS2 fixed a lot of the issues I had with the first game and added some interesting mechanics. Yet, the game feels rushed, uninspired and   tired.\n\nTo date I've played this game for about 27 hours and most of that time I've spent on swinging around NYC, which to this game's credit is the best part about it. Developer Beenox should not be blamed though, they have been making Spider-Man games for years with A VERY tight schedule. I don't think Beenox has any enthusiasm left in them to make Spidey games anymore. Much like Spider-Man, they need a well deserved break. On top of that, publisher Activision is known for rushing games to meet a certain deadline/maximize their profit and not caring about whether or not the is game ready for release. And nowhere is this more apparent than in TAS2.\n\nThis game would have needed a lot more development time to create a truly memorable Spidey game. Instead, we got a bland, rehash of the first game with nice additions and fixes, but this game just ended up being below average. I still like it personally though.\n\nPros\n+ Swinging around in the open world are\n+ Fighting crime (Even though it can get a bit tedious at times)\n+ Collecting different Spidey costumes\n+ Spider-Man himself\n+ You can collect and read many real Spider-Man comics\n\nCons\n- Uninteresting story\n- Lackluster graphics (It's a next gen game)\n- Boring boss fights\n- The story has no focus whatsoever\n- Bad optimization\n- Tons of bugs and glitches\n\nTL DR ;  The game is at it's best when you are swinging around New York.

So here's what I realistically experienced:\n\nGraphics: Well, the graphics are decent, nothing ''amazing'' about them, except for Spidey's character model which is cartoonish but nicely done (as well as the other available suits). You won't be impressed by anything else though, graphically speaking.\n\nAudio: The quality of the sounds is impressive, it is very well done. The voice acting, the music, everything is very nice. Spidey's jokes are on point, and funny as always. What is dissapointing is the main menu music, which is just a elevator music type of sounds, very boring.\n\nStory: Well, it's obvious this game was rushed, because the story is not at all polished and tied in. It's basically just a bunch of villains that are being thrown at you, and the theme of ''With great power comes great responsibility'' is heavily exploited. The Comic Book Stand and Stan Lee are a welcome breath of fresh air though. And the ending is, altough simple, kind of sweet and moralizing.\n\nGameplay: The Gameplay is practically taken from The Amazing Spiderman and tweaked. The Combat is similar, punch - dodge, evade system taken from the Batman series, but somehow it doesn't get boring that easily, i think because of the fact that when you hit someone it feels like you hit someone, the impact is felt. The Web-Swing mechanics are AWESOME, this is the best swinging game since the PS2 Spiderman 2 days. The Webs actually stick to buildings this time. There is an upgrading menu where you can upgrade Spiderman, and through the story you will unlock two Web-Based abilities which prove very useful. There are also Russian Hideouts which are EXTRAORDINARY, because they force you to think your next move, otherwise you will get caught and lose. Every hideout as well as other missions grant Spidey new unlockable suits which are looking SUPERB! All of them grant bonuses while wearing them, but some of them have rather useless bonuses (Spiderman 2099's bonuses are useless for example). The Boss Battles relay on patterns, and no boss will ever do something that you never expect (they all have around 2-3 type of attacks, so nothing hard at all). By the way, the main menu is pure garbage, looks like it was rushed in the last moments.\n\nI will say this however: THE HERO OR MENACE SYSTEM IS UTTERLY GARBAGE. The side missions through the city are nice and all, and varied: car chase, petty theft, bomb defusing, civilian rescue, police deadlocks, etc. but the system is very rubbish. Each time you do a side mission you ''Heroic'' Level increases accordingly. BUT, if you ignore them too much, your ''Menace'' Level will increase to a point where the Task Force (The Elite Police) will start hunting you using several annoying methods. It wouldn't be such a rubbish system, but it all happens too fast. If you ignore just 10 minutes the sidequests while doing other things in the city (like collecting comic books) your Menace level will rise like crazy, which makes free roam almost IMPOSSIBLE. And on top of that, at the end of each side mission you witness a bland, stale Daily Bugle article which shows a picture of you and Whitney Chang presents the heroic act which you just did. A big minus from me !\n\nOverall, if you are a fan you can ignore all these minuses, but if you don't have the nerve, avoid this game. I also recommend you buy it on sale (like i did) because it's not worth the full price.","May 1","true","27.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I loved the new web swinging and the combat system. Also I really liked the boss fights, they challenge you until your limits. The game also brings new side missions such as rescue people in buildings which are on fire and take bombs that are about to explode on the city. In comparison of the first game, this one brings much more stealth missions and the spider-sense mod, that is basically the detective mod of batman arkham franchise.  However, if I compare to the first  amazing spider-man, the first spider-man has a better story. The game also need to improve in the part of the glitches. I already got tired of seeing the enemies dissapear in walls. In other way, I totally recommend this game because I had a lot of fun playing the story, I completed the game in 8 hours and I'm still having fun swinging around the city. You have many more collectibles and the skins you unlock are really cool, because each one has its own abilities. I cant say that the city is a lot bigger, because its not. They just increased a little the southern part of the map and the central park also looks a lot bigger. If you are excited to play as Peter Parker in this game, forget it. You just play as Peter Parker to interview people inside the buildings. He doesn't fight or even free roam around the city that is kind of dissapointing for me because I wanted to see Peter Parker as other important part of the story.","May 1, 2014","true","22.6"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

Max this bad boy out and you get a beautiful spider-man-esk comic graphic style. The lens flare may be a little much at times but that can be forgotten for how well the overall city landscape has been done.\n\nLength wise, the game is lacking a bit. I had finished the main story and the majority of the "side quests" and I have only clocked in six hours. There is the opportunity to carry on playing after you finish the main story to collect the rest of achievements and collectibles, and some people may be into that sort of thing but not me.\n\nThe original game kind of had a button mashing feel to it, this however is different in that you have to use all sorts of maneuvers to overcome the enemies. The camera work is certainly an improvement over the last too.\n\nI used the Xbox controller, and it worked brilliantly for the most part, takes a little while in the beginning to get used to the controls but it's worth it.\n\nAction/Adventure and Spider-Man fans should certainly play this!","June 28, 2014","true","6.0"," 42 of 75 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","42","75","4","0"

You are given the possibility of choosing what to say during most dialogues, but it has zero consequences, and just changes the order of topics. The story is mostly uninteresting for non-Spidey fans, and for them it feels like a \"been there, done that\" situation. The stand-out moments are definitely the ones with Kraven: he is very fascinating, and has the better story arc of all the characters in the game.\n\nGRAPHICSI am usually not picky on graphics, but when a game not only has blurry textures, bad post-processing effects and glitchy shadows, but also awful performance drops, I get very angry. The character model and suits for Spider-Man are the only ones that feature some detail and variety, since the city is very boring to look at and the enemies are generic as hell.\n\nGAMEPLAYThink Arkham combat and stealth but without the gadgets. This means that it controls very well, but it lacks a lot of variety. The game has action and stealth sequences that are well balanced in the story, but the boss battles are very disappointing and very trivial. My favorite feature is the open world with its activities: you can attack mobs, save civilians from fires, find bombs, and take part in police raids and car chases.\nI enjoyed the variety of it all, but after a while it started getting more and more repetitive, until a new mechanic was implemented: the hero system. Completing these side missions increases your hero status, but when you don\'t complete them, you will start becoming a menace. This will start spawning a task force that will stop you right in your tracks to kill you, at least until you complete some more side missions. This is fun at first, but increadibly annoying later, forcing you to grind every mission as fast as you can in order to safely travel the city with the smooth web-swinging controls (but beware of weird camera angles!).\n\nCHALLENGEThe combat is very easy, the boss battles are trivial and repetitive, and the side missions are kind of a joke. The only real challenge comes from Russian Hideouts, where being seen by an enemy will make you lose the mission, thus forcing you to be careful with your stealth. Otherwise, it is very easy to beat the game and its activities.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting goes from fine to horrible, with barely any standouts. The sound effects of the punches didn\'t play some times, and the soundtrack is incredibly forgettable, with none of Hans Zimmer\'s score.\n\nREPLAYABILITYMultiple activities, races, comic books to collect and read, collectibles to find in missions, and suits to upgrade will keep you playing this game for over 20 hours.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent \"sale\" game: buy it for 10$ and you get some decent fun and good replayability, even with the disappointing production value. Recommended for Spidey fans.\n\nStory: 6.5\nGraphics: 6.5\nGameplay: 7\nChallenge: 5.5\nSound: 6.5\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 7\nFRUSTRATION: 4.5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","June 1","true","7.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Players seeking for an enticing tale probably wouldn't favor this game, as the story delivers most villians rushed introductions and quick defeats.  Players seeking for a game filled with gratifying nods towards Spidey lore, great combat; and opportunities to create imaginative stories may enjoy this game.  The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not based on the movie it was named after; rather a game in it's own universe with (coincidentally) black Max Dillon.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 carries a decent balance between Peter Parker and Spidey throughout story missions, though most levels are repetitive and often feel "the same."  Boss battles and investigation missions often carry similar situations, though with different environments created to (hopefully) distract the player from this lack of diversity.\n\nThis game was enjoyable for me; mostly because I spent most of my time looking for 1994 Spider-Man connections.","July 11, 2014","true","7.2"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

It's no wonder why they no longer retain the Marvel Comic Book rights to Spider-man.\n\nIt's sad that we have to keep referencing "Spider-man 2" when that is a 10+ year old game. With the technology we have now there should have been a sucessor.\n\nIf Beenox makes another Spider-man game it needs to be level based. Open world gameplay just isn't their thing.\n\nIf your wondering the game is poorly optimized for the PC. I have an Intel Core I5 (3570k), 16Gbs of Ram, and an Nvidia Asus GTX 660 OC edition Video card but the game still chugs along with a poor frame rate even with all the options turned on low.\n\n(Update: New Patch fixes this problem for me.)\n\nBeenox LIED when they claimed that webs now stick to buildings. If you pay close attention when swinging near the water (on the outside of the map) Webs still stick regardless of their being no structure to swing from. Beenox only restricted the animation and limit your swinging height so that it appears that he is swinging from buildings. There is no actual physics to his swinging. (Web of Shadows did this as well but it looked great and was fun because they stuck to the rules of the swinging animation.)  This causes plenty confusion when you have no idea when, how, or what you will stick from. There are points in the game where Spider-man totally ignores these rules and can swing from the air once again. I'm sure you can imagine how confusing that gets.Webbing was also marketed as being able to "freeze and blow up things on impact".\n\nIf you can PLEASE tell me what part of the game you do this in. The only upgrades your webs get is a seismac (shocker) blast that knocks enemies down or stuns heavy enemies and the ablity to dissolve metal.\n\nThe game is horribly rushed. The story starts out fine but than it just abruptly ends.\n\nKind of like a kid who had a week to do a 3 page book report and procrastinated until he had an hour to only read the first chapter. So he prays that the back of the book has enough information to spread thin across a 3 page report.\n\nThe Combat is awful. The first games combat was responsive but I found myself getting hit often or not being able to use certain mechanics because it would not aim properly or because the enemies could interupt any animation Spider-man has. Not so bad when fighting small groups but good luck fighting large ones.\n\nSpider-man is my favorite Superhero and he deserves better than the 'talent' Beenox has to offer. Activision and Beenox should be ashamed of the product they released. When I was watching the "developer walkthrough" I was wondering why Thomas Wilson never web swung during the final part of the video. That's because you air swing and they continued to market the game saying that you CAN NOT do that. *sigh*\n\nI feel bad for the decent people that are talented and put in some effort when they worked on this game because Dee Brown leaving the company is an obvious shake up and a great loss for them. I think poor leadership is the cause of why this game is the worst out of ALL the Spider-man games they have produced thus far. There are things to like about the game but every aspect lacks decent polish.\n\nPros -  Bonus Costumes and Unlockable Comic Books.\n-  Game looks prettier than the first.\n\nCons - EVERYTHING else.\n\nI don't know about you but I can't stand to be deceived when I purchase something. I will never be buying another product from Beenox ever again.\n\n2/10","May 1, 2014","false","33.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Webslinging your way around the city feels reminiscent of the 2004 Spider-Man 2 release, but still feels somehow lacking.

The web swinging is a high point in the game, but it's terrible performance makes it unenjoyable. With every swing my framerate fluctuates between 30 and 60 fps. The new stealth system is excellent, and resembles that of the Arkham series somewhat, but is much more difficult. I had a lot of fun with the stealth.

This game has to be one of my favourite spidey games so far (even though I haven't played any other, I've seen descriptive walkthroughs). With the web-swinging, you don't just attach to nothing like every other spider-man game I've seen so far, you actually have to have a building near by this time. I love the combat because it is much like that of Batman: Arkham City/Origins, so it is very smooth. I love the cutscenes because their very captivating and don't make you feel like "Hey, a cutcene! Now I can finally go to get my snacks!" like most cutscenes in recent games. The Stan Lee cameo, don't even get me started, it is the best one I've ever seen (and I think I've seen all of the movies that have one from him) and it's not too short, but he also doesn't take up too much time that you could be using on more pressing matters. Although, the bad things are the fact that (in my opinion) some missions are hard to figure out, the web-rush mode is hard to do precicely with a controller, and (even though I don't really mind this, it's still a concern) the story is a bit short. But hey, besides that stuff, this is a fantastic game and it is definitely worth your money.

This is indeed so. However, they never said that webs also don't stick to the sky anymore. They do this still as well. Like, 80 %~ 85% of the time, webs stick to buildings, but will sometimes choose not to (which is more or less evident depending on where you are). I'm guessing this is for gameplay reasons, so that the player has an easier time. Or they were lazy. You know, whatever. Is it still fun? Yep, to me anyway. It doesn't take too long to get into a rhythm with swinging. If you don't mind sky webs every now and then, you'll still have fun doing what Spidey does.\n\n-Combat - 3/5\n"A cheap Arkham knockoff" is what most describe it as. It's pretty accurate. The thing with Batman is, he has a ton of quick-fire gadgets, skills, unique counters and takedowns, and other stuff to keep his repertoire fresh and fun while in combat, making for long sweeping combos as you dominate 20 enemies at a time. Comparatively, Spidey has basic attack, counter, web-zip, and his web shooters for combat. It comes off as a lot more button mashy than Batman since Batman has so many more unique moves than Spidey does. Basically, it's not Arkham. I don't get why Beenox ever ditched Web of Shadows' combat (it was perfect for a Spiderman game), but, as it is now, it feels a bit lackluster.\n\n-Web Rush - 4.5/5\nFor new people, this is basically a mechanic that allows you to select a point within range and have Spidey automatically zip over to that point in a fancy display of aerial acrobatics. Actually very well done, useful, fun, and great for keeping momentum and showing Spidey's true skill. You can tap the key and the point your cursor is facing is selected, or hold and have the game enter slow motion, and pick a point of your choosing. Probably my favorite feature so far. However, it's range is kind of short, so you may find yourself being just out of reach more than you would like, but it's far from bad. (NOTE: Web Rush is only dependent on range, buildings need not apply.)\n\n-Story - 3.5~4/5 (Or less if length is very important to you)\nIt's 14 missions long. Records in the forums say it takes about 3-4 hours to beat. Not exactly up to par for a single player game. In terms of actual story, it's a movie game that actually doesn't follow the movie at all (except maybe in length). There are a lot of characters that are spotlighted, some who haven't been seen in a while, so it's pretty good while it does last.\n\n-Hero or Menace System - 2.5~3/5\nTo many, it's a real pain. Not so much to me, but I would've preferred a more refined system. Basically, help out and save people, you get bonuses. Ignore them and continue on your merry way, and get penalized. What makes many angry is that this counts when you're anywhere on the map (like the opposite side from the event), and even on missions. You can go in a hero and come out a menace. Doesn't exactly sound great. The worst part of it is that eventually you will get harrassed for being a menace, which can detract from the whole fun factor of free roam. And with infinite crimes, you will have to do something eventually. I personally don't mind it so much, as I love just swinging around and doing random events, but I understand how easily it can be annoying. A system like InFamous: Second Son or even turning it off would've been much better.\n\n-Suits - 4.5/5\nSuits are very well done in my opinion. You can level them up permanently (independent of hero or menace system) and most look great. Each suit also has 3 unique attributes that level up with the suit, such as stealth, damage, element resistance, etc. I'm sure that there's a suit that suits you (see what I did there :D), and it adds variety to the game. Very cool feature.\n\n-Upgrades - 3/5\nActual universal upgrades are a little disapointing to me. There aren't many, and while it does take a while to earn them all, they don't seem to add that much to gameplay that the game doesn't already give you. Just not enough "game-changer" feeling to them.\n\nCollectibles - 5/5\nIn addition to extra stuff pertaining to the story, like audio logs and stuff, there are 400 comic book pages to collect, which allow you to read those comics in-game, which is pretty cool. You can also unlock concept art and figurines. Basically, there's a lot of stuff for collectors and completionists to find in-game.\n\n-Wrap Up\nI'm not too far into the game, so I don't have too much, or rather anything more I can think of to speak on, so all in all I give it a 7.5-8/10. If you're a Spidey fan or liked TASM 1, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you we're looking for Spider-Man 2, you might not be a happy camper. Either way, a sale would be an ideal time to pick this up if you can wait. ~$20 is a great price for what the game offers. Sorry for the long review guys and gals, and I probably won't bother to spell or grammer check because of it. Farewell, True Believers, and happy swinging!","April 29, 2014","true","11.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

Failure to comprehend any events will reduced the stats.\n- Stealth take-downs are improved. They are not noisy like in the first game. In fact, it's similar to the stealth mechanic of Noir Spiderman in "Spiderman:Shattered Dimensions".\n- Dialog Event - It's a good adaptation. Now you feel more connected to the main character - Perter Parker.\n- Graphic is OK. I really like the way that suits get torn over every time u engage in combat (similar to the concept in Batman Arkham game). Costumes' design is too simple and bland.\n\nOverall, I would give this game 8/10.\nThere was a lot of potential in the first game, but the developer screwed up the big time when the first game was not well-optimized for AMD video card users. However, ASM2 is very well-done and there are many good improvements implemented in this game. The only thing i find annoying and funny is that Spider-man's behavior in this game like a comedian.

Ok let's first start with the few positives.\n-Graphics are very good\n-Swinging is damn near perfect\n-Combat (although repetitive) is very fun\n-TONS OF COSTUMES!!!\nNow for my full thoughts on the game.\n\nSpider-man is my idol and i love every little bit of him. I've loved spider-man every since I was a little boy. But this game truely ruins everything about my BELOVED idol... Let me start off by saying the trailers for this game made it seem 10x better than it's outcome. Beenox got our hopes up for something that they delivered poorly. I was led to believe this would be a Web of Shadows type game, where you make choices to affect your ending. And they have TONS of those aspects: Dialogue options, Hero/Menace system, open map missions, etc. However NONE of these affect the game in ANY WAY!!! There is absolutely 0 decisions to make, no multiple endings, and no Good or Bad choices!!! Dialogue options are pointless. All they do are tell stories. You're able to choose each of them multiple times (not sure why you would) or continue the story. Open map missions wasn't really as much of a problem as it was pointless. Each mission would have an open environment to take down enemies how you enjoyed: Stealthy or Loud. But no matter what, you'd always end up in a big rumble because 1 person managed to see you stealth takedown the guard. and now for the worst part.... The hero/menace system... After playing MANY games that involved good/evil meters, i was SO excited to find that another spider-man game would use it! I was a big fan of Web of Shadows, Mass Effect, Bioshock, and StarWars: Knights of the Old Republic. Which all of them did great good/evil systems. but this is just a joke. It affects the story in absolutley no way. All it does is ruin free roam and make it a chore. In free roam there are crimes happening around the city. You stop these crimes to fill the hero bar. These crimes have timers on them, so if you ignore them, your hero bar depletes. There are about 8 (not exact) crimes happening around the city at once. and they keep coming as others are either finished or missed. You can see how this gets annoying. Constantly it's "bleep bleep you missed a mission" and once you're bar reaches menace, the task force comes after you. It's not so bad at the beginning of the game because at first they don't throw all the bull crap at you. but towards the end of the game, the task force decides to start putting up energy walls that stop you from swinging and damage you in the process. This completely ruins free roam. Which is a shame because the swinging is damn good. probably the best swinging ive had in a spider-man game yet. This is a huge disapointment to me, I LOVED the first Amazing Spider-Man Game. and this one had SO MUCH POTENTIAL!!! But Beenox screwed it up. The Amazing Spider-Man games were supposed to be the Batman Arkham games for Marvel fans. But unfortunately, they screwed it up beyond repair... :/ There is alot more i can rant on but it's 1:00 in the morning and i'm too tired to be doing this...","May 3, 2014","false","24.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm going to spend some time listing the negative things I read about the game before I bought it, and rebutting the point with my own experience.\n\nFirst, I heard it was a short game, but it took me 20 hours to complete the main story because I was having so much fun in free roam, stopping crimes, leveling suits, and collecting the extras hidden around the city. If I rushed between story missions, it probably would have been short, but there are a crazy number of distractions along the way that I just couldn't help myself. Between the races, combat challenges, photo ops, and collectibles absolutely littered around the city, there are hours of gameplay.\nAt one point I just started following the city grid to find the collectibles (your Spider-sense shows them on your map when you get within a certain distance, which can be augmented by which suit you're wearing). I covered the entire city, stopping briefly to complete some Heroics to get the Taskforce off my back, and still I'm missing some audio tapes.\nI read every single one of these audio tapes when I come across them. I'm not sure if the complaints about shortness come from people who ignore the lore and story, but for comic fans I think they're a big bonus, altogether. They help flesh out the story a bit more, and I'll be adding even more to my 23.3 hours playtime to find the 9 that I'm missing, which could take a while because I have no idea where to look and I have a whole city to cover.\n\nI read that the combat was cookie-cutter Arkham style and became bland and boring quickly. Well, the resemblance is uncanny. I'll admit you can probably get through every fight in the game by mashing the attack button while occasionally stopping to mash the dodge button. However, you actually have several other options in combat. The Seismic Blast, for one, can stun foes long enough for you to pin them down with your webbing. You can quickly swing out of sight and get a stealth takeout even while in combat. After a certain upgrade, you can lure enemies close to a wall, then jump over them and pin them to the wall. The "Arkham" format is just the baseline for a more intricate combat system full of moment-to-moment choices, and only the uninspired will rely on it throughout the whole game. That said, however, the boss battles get repetitive even during your first fight with them, as you have to fall back to the Arkham format to even cause damage to most of them (dodge to make them vulnerable, then counterattack).\n\nMy final point will be on the game's technical performance. It's not great. My computer is built to run much higher-intensitve games, but even after setting this game's graphics to the minimum I got plenty of FPS drops.

The game starts off really laggy (I hear people who have the gtx 780 ti's game lag), but I think I'm about half way into the game and it seems to have left. Also if you're worried about the game spoiling you for the actual movie like the first game did, don't worry, the game takes place ALONGSIDE of the movie, and very tiny, minors are released. You might recongize a few lines from the trailers but I doubt that anything I've actually seen is going to be in the movie. The graphics are really disappointing considering the amazing spiderman 1 graphics are way better, I know they were on a budget but if it was really that tight, the least they could do was copy and paste the textures.

Webs stick to buildings again and you won't find your self cloud swinging anymore.\n-Combat is much more responsive. It's still an Arkham clone as far as combat goes, but this time it's tackled leaps and bounds better than the first game.\n-Stealth is much more fun to use along with spider-sense (another Arkham clone this time taking a detective visionesque approach)\n-Upgrades are handled better and there is a section just for web travel.\n-The camera is scaled back a bit and it makes it easier to manuever the city. It also makes the city seem larger, which was a huge problem in the first game to me, I felt like I was a giant sometimes in ASM1.\n-Along with the camera Web Rush is much more intuitive and less floaty\n-Humor. It feels like Spider-man with these wisecracks. Another major improvement over it's predecessors lackluster script.\n\nCons:\n\n-Optimization is an issue yet again, but not as big of one as before. All I do is turn off motion blur, vsync, and take antialiasing down a little and I play on otherwise Ultra with 60fps using my AMD HD6850.\n-Keyboard controls are kind of a mess. I can't imagine playing this without my 360 controller.\n-Voice acting rarely matches the on screen mouth movements. I'm not expecting Pixar quality animation or anything, but come on.\n\n\nOverall I give it an 8/10(negated in the edit). For $40 it's definitely worth it if you have any interest in the Spider-man franchise. With the release of this game it's actually given a place in my top five Spider-man games.\nFor comparison I gave Amazing Spider-man (2012) a 5/10.\n\nEdit:\nAfter nearly 100%ing this game I'll sadly be taking my review score down to a 6.5. It's still a good spidey game, but for the amount of content it offers, and the end game boss fights it's not as great as I held it. I still don't regret spending $40 on it, and I still recommend it over some other spider-man games.","April 30, 2014","true","19.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Web swinging has been revamped and no longer feels dull and to easy to manage. You still miss a little momemtum, but you don't swing from the sky anymore 90-95% of the time. They also removed the weird option were you could just hold down the right trigger and just continue swinging without any consequense.\n\nAdded improvements to car chase, added fire situations and bomb threats to the city are present. It gets repetitive at times, but fires happens a different building at different time, so a little variation is present.\n\nDreadlocks returns and gets different location, under construction sites, hospitals or on rooftops. There you can choose wheather to be stealthy or head right on.\n\nCombat stays the same, taking elements from the Arkham series, but still feels repetitive. They compensate this with new attacks like Seismic blast, Web-Pull and the improved Stealth. Those who enjoyed the combat last time will look forward to this.\n\nStealth takedowns have been improved. More variated animations and longer range. Reminds more of the stealth from Spider-Man Noir on Shattered Dimensions. Still, most times you end up with the same animation, so it is about where you are standing when taking him down. Stealth missions are alot harder, as enemies have a sight range when you trigger your spider-sense. A meter also present the awareness the guards have on you.\n\nA few costumes from the last game returns, with the exception of Sam Raimi's red and blue, and black suit, Future Foundation, Negative, Cross Species and ASM black suit. New costumes are added instead, like 2099, Superior, Spider-Armor MKII and MKIII, Miles Morales, Ricochet, Hornet, Flipside, Electro Proof (PS3 or PS4 exclusive on pre-order) and a surprise costumes once you beat the game. Pre-order costumes available on all consoles except 3DS are Iron Spider, Classic Black Suit, Cosmic and Noir Spider-Man. The ultimate wardrobe, and most of them are unlockable by visiting russian hideout, where you take out all the guards silently and decipher Oscorp data.\n\nStory is interesting, It begins with a flashback of Peter seeing his Uncle Ben shot by a mysterious murder. Two years after that he hunts for him and meets Herman Schultz before coming Shocker. He encounters Kraven, who teaches him the ways of hunting. Catches up with old friend Harry Osborn, and fight Wilson Fisk, The Kingpin. Cletus Kassady also makes an appereance, the rest you have to find out. The game includes elements from the film while being an own story taking place after Beenox last Amazing Spider-Man game. This time Beenox don't spoil anything from the movie, they only retell some facts that of course were spoiled on all the trailers from the new movie.\n\nThe are some bad thing that the game struggles with. Repetitive mission, some times a clumsy story. Bugs are present with stuttering, and lag who even occurs on high end hardware. The game do have much better graphics than last entry, but still isn't on the same lvl as the newer games like GTA V, Crysis 3, AC IV Black Flag and more. Bugs due to lightning, shadows, motion blur and more are a little present.\n\nAnd the biggest dissapointment is the lack of possibility to use your unlocked costumes when entering a new game, like in the previous entry. Hope Beenox fixes this later with a patch or a code to unlock the costumes from the beginning.\n\nOverall, this game stands a better chance than their last entry. It will grant you the possibility to really be Spider-Man in many ways and is definitely recommended for the veteran Spidey fans or for those who likes superhero videogames. The price is also cheap, on 29.99 euro.\n\nPositives:\nMore side activities\nImproved Web-Swinging\nBetter story\nMany villains\nEndless mode (always crimes in Manhattan)\nNew powers and attacks.\n\nNegatives:\nStill a little clumsy story\nRepetitive combat\nLittle variation to the crimes\nBugs (they may be fixed later, we can hope)\nRemoved the option to keep unlocked costumes when entering a new game","May 1, 2014","true","86.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

It's a weakness.\n-Amazing Spiderman (2012) disgusted me. It was a step backward. A huge step backward.\n-Spiderman Web of Shadows is my favorite game.\n-Amazing Spiderman 2 takes a huge leap toward the rigt direction again, and I am enjoying it.\n\nYou play as Peter Parker in this game, that much is fairly obvious. It feels like you're in a lot more control, and not just some walking suit this time. Web Rush has been regined and I actually use it sometimes to get around quicker and more precisely. It adds a depth to the versatility of Spiderman's movement, and speed to boot.\n\nThe good outweighs the bad, as you can stick to buildings this time, and not the sky. Thank God. But the bad news is that the voice acting takes a ♥♥♥♥ from time to time, and is not quite on par with next-gen titles. The graphics are classic spiderman, good in some areas, but some of the textures look like they are straight out of Spiderman 2.\n\nI'd reccomend this for a fan of the series, otherwise skip it or wait for the price drop (that may never come, as the first game is still 50 dollars on steam)","May 2, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I like Spider-Man games. This is part of the reason I gave it a thumbs up, the other reason is because I enjoyed the first game, and this one is better. But it does have its faults.\n* Boss Battles fealt the same: They were almost the same thing, which just made them feel too-easy.\n* Hero or Menace: I understand why its there, but it just makes me feel as if i NEED to get the most out of the game by doing the side missions.\n* Confusing: You get to see Max for a few minutes and then there is a huge gap. Next thing you know, you're fighting him. I do understand that there isn't that much that Spider-Man could do in the way of electro (as in it's not like you can fight his minions or try to find his base of operations or anything).\n\nDon't worry, I'm not just counting the bad things. Things that I love about this game are:\n* Web slinging: Feels much more realistic that the first game. I would have liked it better if Spider-Man doesnt auto let go of his web if you hold the trigger for too long.\n* Costumes: More costumes! I love being able to be the different Spider-Men, and I love how they have different abilities.\n* Peter Parker: Adding that otherside of Spider-Man to the game was a bit of a gamble I think, and it paid off. I find it fun being Peter sometimes, as it opens up other story opportunities for the game.\n* The City: Now it actually feels like I'm in a city, rather than just a map.

But coming from a HUGE Spider-Man fan, the game isn't that bad. It's a game you can sit down and enjoy, with lots of references to the comic universe and different adventures that don't relate to the movie. If you don't know this game takes place in a seperate universe then the movieverse which removes a lot of spoilers from the game. This game also has a pretty decent story idea that was brought out in a not so great way. You basically go back and forth between villians and repetitive side missions to do. If you like to collect stuff in this game, you will be semi-satisfied with collecting a bunch of comic pages, posters, and my favorite suits. (Suits have different perks and are really fun to collect because you recognize them from the comics). I feel if we had more well made superhero games like Batman does, this game would be a disgrace, but since this is all we get it satisfies that spidey need. I could go on longer but to wrap up, the game is enjoyable to big spiderman fans, nothing to take serious, and it does have it's problems (big problems storywise if it follows the comics at all) .

There were many things i wanted to change about it, and things i wished it could be. This game solves every single problem of its predecessor. The combat, the web swinging, the story, the exploration, mechanics, etc. This game is great. In my opinion it is one of the best, or the best spiderman game.

At first I was like a drunk, but you get used to it.\n-Keeps you entertained - for a while\n-Stelth options available, play the missions your way.\n\nCons:\n-Playing the prequel, I have to say that tje graphics were pretty much the same if not worse\n-Poor PC optimazation (web-slinging in the city feels laggy and clunky)\n-Hero or menace system. Altough I get he idea of it, you dont get any benefits from being a menace, and they kind of force side quests down your throat in order to avoid annying tast force offciers chacing you.\n-Horrible voice acting\n\nVerdict:\n-A solid 7.5\n-Altough it had the potential to be something great, all the cons dont take it over the top.

However I might want to point that the swinging speed is not as fast as the swinging speed in web of shadows, even the first amazing spiderman. Still the combat is a lot better. The suits are amazing. Everything else is good except the missions. There should be more missions like 15 more. I mean I personally feel that the game was a bit rushed and I completed it in 5 hours actually. Inclusive of getting all the spidey suits. So yeah I think the game could do with more missions. Or maybe and this is just a thought though, perhaps the creator could allow the players some sort of program or something for us spiderman players to get a chance to create custom levels. I mean that would certainly be cool! I'm not sure its possible though. Overall though this game is stunning and great.

The original was horrible, but after hearing how they changed the web-swinging, I became interested.\n\nInitially the game felt slow, however once past the tutorial the speed really picks up.  The web swinging, while not perfect, is very nice.  The combat is fluid, and while not as meaty as the arkham games, it serves its purpose very well.\n\nThere are a few grievences, like the web rush mode still being in the game, but those are rather minor.\n\nI've seen some reviews saying the game doesn't run very well, this is not an issue I've experianced.  I get 60fps consistantly on the highest video settings, but do keep in mind that other people are having framerate issues, I may just be one of the lucky ones.\n\nAll in all, the game is very Spider-Man 2 esque.  It feels like an updated version of Spider-Man 2 and I'd reccomend it to anyone who is a Spidey fan.","May 1, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While web-slinging has been improved in that you actually need to use momentum and attach your thread to buildings, everything else seems to be a step down.\n\nThe combat is clunky. The first game wasn't perfect in this, but I quickly got used to it and it felt pretty responsive. In TASM2, you never really feel in control. Spider-Man feels like a weak character and whereas the first game was almost a stealth game at points, where you could strategically retreat to the ceiling at any time to strike from above, in TASM2 you cannot quickly zip out of danger and most of the combat encounters aren't set up to even allow you to. Instead, it forces you to play a brawler, a not fun one.\n\nSpider-Man's abitlities are now partially tied to the costume he's wearing, so you'd think they'd made switching costumes would be easy, right? Not so. You need to go to specific points on the map and take a train (a cutscene) to Aunt May's house, change costume, take the train back (another costume), and then make your way back to whatever mission you wanted to change the costume for. Needless to say you will likely stick to just one costume and if you're smart, it'll be the default one since it will be the most upgraded one.\n\nThe game also has a really annoying menace/hero 'morale' system. "Random" encounters are constantly spawned, and Spider-Man has a short period of time to get to them and beat up the thugs, rescue someone from a fire, etc., If you don't get there in time or fail, you become more of a Menace. If you win, you become more of a Hero.\nIn theory this is a good idea, but the encounters spawn far too quickly and often on the opposite end of the map so you have to "choose" between taking a hit on the meter, or abandoning whatever you were doing (like going to a story mission) to get over there.\nIf you're too much of a menace, the city becomes filled with hunter squads which prevent you from just webslinging about, taking away even that bit of fun.\n\nThe story is the only high point, tieing in perfectly to the movies and featuring characters like the Kingpin and Kraven.\nIt's also more stable than TASM 1, at least it doesn't crash all the time. It's still tied to 30FPS though.\n\nI cannot recommend this to anyone but huge Spider-Man fans, and even they would be far better off with part one instead.","July 16, 2015","false","2.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

Otherwise this is a mostly solid and competent but wholly uninspired action game.\n\nIf I was rating it I would give it 6.5 out of 10 but it is worth a punt if you pick it up on the cheap.

I enjoyed the combat, and I enjoyed the swinging. I would have far more hours played on this game if not for one horrible mechanic:\nThe Hero-Menace System.\nYou have to permanently be doing the extremely repititive side missions, or else you become a menace, which causes the "Task Force" to be more abundant. By the time you have finished the game (because the story is probabaly safer than the "free-roam") you unlock the ability to achieve level 3 menace. IF you manage to stay out of that, well done, if not, prepare for hell. Every corner has about 5-10 of these Task Force soldiers, and their machines, which disable swinging, shoot you, whatever.\nMy point is, if you want this game to swing around and do whatever, you're at the wrong place. I would suggest the previous Amazing Spiderman game. If you enjoy the side-missions, then this game is very fun, and I had fun playing it while I actually could play it.\nSo, for a TL;DR:\nFun game, but don't expect any good free-play. You will be forced to do the side-missions or live your life fighting the Task-Force, which believe me, is NOT fun for long.","June 4, 2015","false","17.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The story takes place after the first Amazing Spider Man game with much of the back story in place. That being said it wouldn't be a Spider-Man game without the mandatory Uncle Ben back story. This story follows much of the plot from the movie with some deviation. The story is rather short but overall not bad.\n\nAppearance: The game plays fairly well. The city is rather beautiful and the web slinging is a lot of fun as normal. However the problems occur with the PC optimization. I may not have the highest end gaming rig but even on medium to high settings the game ran well for the most part but FPS dips happened and happened often. The worst was during the web slinging which I enjoyed the most.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay really hasn’t changed a heck of a lot over the course of the past few revisions. Go from point to point on a pretty standard city map by web slinging to achieve a given objective. It’s really that simple. Go to point A and perform the series of task, beat up a boss type, and swing off to the next objective. The story is fairly fleshed out but the gameplay is really repetitive.\nWhat’s worse is that the side missions are really bland and bad. It’s the same missions over and over again. One would think you could just ignore the missions and enjoy the story but no. You must do missions constantly through the game to keep your public opinion in the positive. If it dips into the negative you will be faced with extra enemies and a greater struggle. This feature is poorly enacted and only serves to artificially increase the game play.\n\nAchievements: The game, at this time, offers 46 achievements of which I have achieved 39. I occasionally fire up the game and work towards the last 7 achievements. Most of the achievements are easy, are story related, or are pretty fun to do. The last few I have require a bit of work and mostly grinding. The last few achievements are mostly because I have a fondness for working towards completing the game but honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if people didn’t want to dedicate too much time to getting all the achievements.\n\nBottom Line: This game is a pretty straight forward, pretty bland, and overall pretty standard Spider Man game. I got 15 hours of gameplay out of this and expect to have to put another five hours into the game before completion. I picked this up on a sale and if you really would like a spider man game this could do the job but I would not pay full price at all.\n","June 13, 2015","false","28.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Yes there are minor bugs but what game doesn't have bugs *cough* battlefield 4*cough* my point is this is a great game with a lot to do and the crimes will keep you busy. It also includes lots of time consuming task such as collecting comic pages. The game may stutter from time to time but that can be resolved by lowering the draw distance. I do say if you're a big Spider-Man fan and love web swinging this is your game plus the never ending crime makes you stay on your tippy toes. The price is very fair for this game, NOTE, on consoles you pay 59.99 plus tax so they are really showing the PC gamers love.\n\nPeople now and days are never satisfied, have short attention spans, and always complain about stuff. When I was growing up we dreamed of games like this. This game is the closest thing to Spider-Man 2 that released years ago on xbox. This shows homage to Maximum Carnage and also Spider-Man 2. Children of this day and age have way more then I did growing up and I can say don't let them sway you away because they're wanting exactly what they see out the movie.\n\nLastly, the game may be some what short depending on your style of play through if you're someone who just plays story mode without doing anything else then yes it will be short. The Devs spent a good amount of time putting lots of effort into details in the city, most people wouldn't give two sh*ts about that though, yet people complained the city wasn't live enough. The combat has been refined and feels polished. Although, one thing I can say that was left out was the ability to crouch or crawl while trying to be stealth per se rather than just on the side of a building. Hopefully most trolls haven't doomed us all maybe they may listen to the community and add additional features to upcoming DLC.

Don't bother with the previous game, though.  Skip straight to this one.\n\nThe previous game was bugged to the point where it was unplayable after just a couple missions.  It also had not-so-good textures on the Spidey suits.  The swinging wasn't as complicated, and the overall feel of the city wasn't quite as engrossing.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 fixes what was wrong with the previous game in almost every way.  The Uncle Ben origin story is shown this time, though very briefly.  The characters have better textures.  There's less use of the movie counterpart's story material.  Granted, this game's story assumes you already know the characters from the first game in the series, but you can probably figure it out if you are a Spider-Man fan.  If you're not a fan, you probably will not care enough to get this game, anyway.\n\nOverall, it's a great game to play on a controller, and if you're a fan of Spider-Man, it has a lot of iconic characters.  The combat is decent, perhaps a little repetitive and unchanged since the previous game, but the swinging is fun and the collectibles are actually kind of cool.  I wouldn't buy this at full price, but I was satisfied with the $10 purchase price, which included all the DLC.","June 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Controls are clunky, TONS of loading screens, side missions have small load sections and then a "mission complete" re-load screen that can't be skipped, the cut scene animations are silly and poorly done, the boss mechanics are REALLY predictable and not really challenging; the overall game is just watered down and really boring\n\nI'm kind of shocked that in 6 years since Web of Shadows, that the open-world spiderman games have not gotten better, but have actually gotten worse. I'm pretty disappointed in my purchase and my gameplay experience. If you enjoyed the older open-world games, I really don't think you'll enjoy this one :/\n\nAgain, super disappointing. I REALLY wanted to like and enjoy this game, and even going into it with a positive attitude there is just a bad taste in my mouth about this game.

Otherwise get Spiderman 2 for the Xbox and PS2.\n\nGood:\nYou get to save Stan Lee from a burning building at the start of the game.\nThe web swinging is good. You can only swing when there are buildings in range to swing from.\nThe map of Manhattan is pretty big so you never feel like you are boxed in by any invisible walls.\n\nDisputable:\nCombat is similar to that of the Arkham games, but reduced in quality. Spiderman can do everything ever really fast so this turns combat from perfectly timing all of your attacks and counters into button mashing the attack-button and then mashing counter-button when your spidersense goes off.\n\nStealth is also similar to the Arkham games. You have a spidersense view where you can see all the enemies and where they are looking then plan your attack. It's easier to just take people out by walking around the map than it is to do so as you would expect Spiderman would rappelling people from a ceiling.\n\nThere is a load of suits you can get so it's nice to customise your Spiderman but the way they give them to you is silly. Spiderman suits created by Oscorp and then stolen by the Russians which you then liberate as your own. This would work well for suit upgrades, but now actual suits.\n\nBeing a photographer for the Daily Bugle you can actively take pictures in the game whenever you want. You can't look back at pictures you have taken. And the only point where you do take pictures is to do appallingly bad detective work. There is not enough use of this feature to justify giving it a dedicated button mapping\n\nBad:\nPlaying as Peter Parker is the most boring part of the game by far, doing all the talking options in a conversation doesn't change how the game responds it just bores you with more cutscenes and often they will give you a general idea of everything when you close the conversation.\n\nSpiderman has five lines that he says throughout the game.\nIf you are not doing the main objective then he will whine about it, even if you are doing a side quest.\n\nThere is a Hero/Menace bar which determines whether you get a buff in your abilities, but also if you become a menace then you get hunted by a police task force. It is not fun and is infact very tedious.\n\nMini games are as follows;\n• stop a petty crime,\n• rescue people from a burning building,\n• save some woman from a car kidnapping,\n• lift a small piece of rubble off of a civilian (including a man who has crawled under a train and got stuck),\n• throw a bomb (which is always placed next to the same car in a parking lot) into the sea.\n\nThe mini games are shіtty and if you've played it once then you've played it a thousand times.\nDon't forget that you have to repeatedly do these mini games to prevent yourself from becoming a menace because it is the only way you can get Hero points.","June 29, 2014","false","12.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BMO7/recommended/267550/","BMO7","Marshall Leigh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BMO7/","1247 products in account","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not a great game, let's get that out of the way early, and after 2012s surprisingly ok ‘The amazing Spider-Man’ it is both a disappointment and a definite backwards step for the series.\n\nThe first major complaint that can be put against the game is that even on a high end PC the frame rate is constantly choppy, with visual screen tearing and seemingly random frame rate dips even when nothing to crazy is happening in game. The combat retains the style defined by 2009’s Batman Arkham Asylum but still doesn't manage to match its finesse and quality, making it no more complicated than wailing on a single button before dodging the odd attack and carrying on with the button mashing. I managed a 42 hit combo in the very first encounter of the game and as I'm not even particularly good at this type of action that's got to count for something.\n\nThe biggest grievance that can be had with the game however is its increased focus on what has always been the worst aspect of the series. The random side quests that require you to beat up some thugs, stop a shootout or rescue a hostage from a car have all returned. Rather than being optional like before, ignoring them adds to a karma style meter. Let it get too out of hand and special task force agents will actively hunt you across the city, stopping you from enjoying even the simple act of swinging around picking up collectables at your own pace for too long before you are forced back into more of the same side activities. Even when you finish the game there appears to be no way to switch this off meaning few will have the patience to see through collecting the 300 comics, multiple checkpoint races or many costumes.\n\nOn the subject of the swinging Beenox appear to have listened to fans of 2004s Spider-Man 2, with webs now requiring a building to stick to. Each of Spider-man’s arms is also controlled by the left and right triggers respectively and while not a terrible system in theory it leads to a lot of awkward situations in which you have very little control of the action while Spider-Man cycles one of a very short list of sarcastic quips about how webs need a building to stick to. It's almost as if he is mocking you for the control system fans asked for and how impractical it is to use.\n\nIt's not all bad though, the story while a bit slapdash is filled with a rogues gallery of villains from across the series and has some interesting moments and even some good twists. Collecting the suits is also still a draw and will bring out the inner comic book geek in almost anyone.\n\nOverall the amazing Spider-Man 2 is a disappointing sequel, inferior to the first game in almost every way it smacks of something that had to be out in time for the release date of its theatrical counterpart and it's a shame. With a bit more time and a bit more thought I still think Spider-Man can have his Arkham Asylum moment.","July 12, 2014","false","9.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

First, this is a console to pc port...which, if you have read my reviews before, you will know I HATE with a passion.  Why?  Because they never port it well.\n\nLet me begin...\n\nFirst, there is no way to change keyboard settings in the game.  The way this port works is that when you start the game a window pops up where you can manage pc settings.  When you are done you can enter the game.  In order to change pc settings you have to exit the game and restart it again to get the window to appear.  Seriously, what a LAZY way to do that.\n\nSecond, web swinging in general.  Now, if you just want to slowly get from point A to point B, web swinging is no big deal and actually done nicely.  But if you are in a rush it will become a headache.  This is especially true if Spiderman gets in reaching distance of a building.  I can't express how many times I spent cursing over and over at the screen because Spiderman will go wherever he wants to no matter what you try to make him do.\n\nThird, stupid programming mistakes in movement.  Imagine you are perching on a railing of a balcony.  You want to get on the balcony.  You would think a simple push of the movement button would accomplish that.  You would be wrong. In order to go down what would be realistically 4 to 5 feet you have to jump.  Not just a short hop...but an actual high jump to get Spiderman to move those precious 3 inches so you can go from the railing to the balcony.  There are a plethora of these types of movement mistakes in programming that occur in this game...sometimes they will kill you.  Most of the time they will anger you and cause you to yell at the screen.\n\nFourth, stupid programming in "events".  This I will divide into two parts.  First will be the random encounters.  Second will be the main fight "events".\n\n1.  There are some random encounters that you will just not be able to accomplish without great frustration.  The best example of this are the "take a picture" events.  This involves zero fighting.  But this does involve spending a lot of time trying to get the best angle for the picture and the best zoom.  There are no hints as to what makes the specific picture worth taking.  I've spent over 20 mins angrily trying to get the best picture until I just gave up.  These "random encounters" ended up being the most worthless wastes of time and added nothing to the game.  I can tell they were only added in to lengthen the game.\n\n2.  In the main fight "events" or even other fight "events" you are forced to watch the ENTIRE opening sequence.  You cannot skip these.  Normally that would be fine.  But if you lose a stealth event and have to wait for the opening sequence to finish it gets extremely irritating.\n\nFifth, in the vein of 4-2...  After most every random encounter, except a few, you are forced to endure a short "news report" where the reporter gives a glowing review of what you just did...each and every time...without fail...  You are allowed to skip these but they shouldn't have been in the game in the first place.  It became one of the MANY irritants that made this game so completely lackluster.\n\nSixth and last...  This game is still buggy.  When I first started to play it none of my steam achievements would appear.  Just recently they began to appear.  But the trade off was that in the game, no matter what I did I could not get the game to accept that I had completed a heroic act.  Instead, I watched at the "Menace/Hero" meter topped out at me being a level 3 menace.  I spent time being a hero, I saved everyone I could...but it didn't help.  What is that a problem?  Because if you are a menace the police will send out a taskforce to attack you.  Imagine trying to play the game and being hunted and attacked so regularly that trying to finish the main storyline became difficult.  None of this would have happened if the programmers had just done their jobs better...instead of being the lazy pieces of #### that they are.  I stopped 15 car chases, saved 11 people, helped people out of burning buildings 7 times, got rid of 10 bombs, etc...etc...  And doing all of those had ZERO effect on my "Menace/Hero" meter.  It stayed maxed out at a level 3 menace without change or movement.\n\nTo wrap up...  This game is NOT worth it.  It is just another worthless movie tie-in that was rushed out to the console market and as an afterthought, hurridly made barely compatible with the pc market.\n\nAVOID THIS GAME.","July 12, 2014","false","13.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story also suffers from this regard, by trying to be close to the movie but with a different take at the same time and breaks a few narrative ideas, like SPOILER: Carnage being a character without Venom showing at all! And then we have the Hero or Menace system which is a mechanic design to force you into side-activities to give that sense that the game is longer than it actually is.\n\nIf you can run the game as intended, then swing through the city alone is enough to get this at a promo. If you can't, don't bother, as the lack of visuals will seriously hurt the fun trips.","August 6, 2014","false","14.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

By far the most interesting character is Stan Lee himself as he owns a comic book store in the game and it's just fun to interact with him instead of fighting the villains as they don't provide much of a challenge, other than Stan Spider-Man is done perfectly he has a great sense of humour and often mocks his enemies and will even comment on your web swinging if you fail to attatch to a building, though his jokes fall rather flat after hearing them multiple times.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is a open world web slinging adventure with Arkham City esque combat, along with a stealth mechanic from the first game which I found really enjoyable but this one I didn't enjoy as much, the combat itself is very simple it has one attack button, a counter button and a web button that's it, it doesn't have the large variety of options like in the Arkham games which this game is really trying to be it had the nerve to take the detective vision  via spider sense, even though it works well and you may as well keep it on just to see the enemies easier it makes the game look really ugly.\n\nThe stealth sections are fun you have at least more variety on how to take the enemies out particulary in the Russion Hideouts missions they are just the right length and at the end of it you can unlock a suit, which there are a lot of so I appreciate the suit variety as I recognize most of them from the comics, and they look really good too which is very faithful to the source material, the suits actually impact the combat as they have different bonuses like a faster healing rate, more damage, it's just a shame that the upgrade system doens't have as much variety which gives very little reason for replayablity, the only thing this game seems to do right is the web swinging which has improved from the first game and feels a bit closer to Spider-Man 2 most of the time webs stick to buildings, but in missions physics go out of the window and spidey is able to swing on nothing again come on Beenox this is 2014, games with physics like this shouldn't be allowed.\n\nAnother gripe I have with this game is that the frame rate is horrendous it's locked at 60 fps but most of the time you won't even hit that high, which means a lot of configuration in the settings to try and figure out what the hell the problem is. It's a pain to enter the settings too because Beenox decided to have the settings in a launcher now I don't mind that but when the game is constantly dropping frames, it means you have to exit the game and reboot it in order to change some settings it's frustrating, all this doesn't help that the game is fairly buggy often you will find enemies walking into walls when they don't see you, texture pop in during cutscenes which leads me to believe that this game was incredibly rushed as you could finish it in 4 hours, possibly more if you try to complete the side missions but even they're not always enjoyable to the extent you want to finish them all.\n\nThe reason why the side missions aren't always enjoyable is because of the new Hero/Menace feature it works like a reputation system where if you ignore crime you will get the blame and will be hunted down, if your a hero you will be praised and the Task Force which is Oscorp's police force will ignore you, this is understandable but when your a menace the Task Force which consist of flying enemies who constantly try and shoot you down is very annoying and this happens during main missions too which the game keeps reminding you to do, as it means ignoring the crime rate for a while dropping your morale to menace level meaning you have to repeat the same old side missions over again in order to regain your reputation, in which the side missions become a chore I've lost count on how many citizens i've saved from fire buildings, disposed bombs or beat up petty thugs as I just did it to raise my hero meter then ignored them most of the time, and the city has the most boring presentation of New York I have ever scene most of it is just window dressing as the villains don't interact with it neither can Spider-Man apart from web swinging which i'll admit is done very well here.\n\nGraphics:\n\nNow this is the fun part this game looks nothing like a current gen game even on PC with 16x AA can't save this game from looking blurry and low res especially the buildings, the texture on them is just awful as well as the character models which don't look that bad unless you take a closer look and you can see how out of date they are, there are a lot of texture pop-in as I mentioned earlier and you can see a lot of graphical glitches while swinging around the dull looking city, and it doesn't even perform that well either this is what happens when developers try to rush a game in order to be released with the movie you get a lot of problems that can be fixed with a patch, which I highly doubt Beenox will even to try to fix this game might perform better on consoles but other than that it's a very average looking game which is dissapointing because the first Amazing Spider-Man looked much better and performed better too.\n\nSound:\n\nAs for sound the voice acting in this is very cheesy some of the voices are good I liked such as Alli Hills who voiced Felicia Hardy/Black Cat who did a good a great job at portraying her character for little screen time we got, I liked Spider-Man's voice his dialogue is funny and I found myself chuckling from time to time at his quips sometimes I purposely missed the buildings just to hear one of his many jokes in the game, at least they got his personality right my favourite though has to be Stan Lee he intereacts with Peter Parker as sort of a father figure and it's great to hear some monolouges from the man himself.\n\nThe music is fairly standard nothing really stands out too much there's no electrifying soundtrack when fighting villains which is a shame because the movie had a good score and I was looking forward to the Electro fight but yeah nothing amazing about the soundtrack here.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a passable open world marvel game and I can only see the most die hard Spider-Man fans like myself buying this game at full price which it's not worth it even for the costumes the pre-order bonus comes with, you can find some enjoyment from web swinging but the city is lifeless and i'm pretty sure New York isn't that boring so i'd give this a miss even unless it came at a really deep discount, which doesn't seem likely considering the game is published by Activision, save your money and you're better of playing the 1st Amazing Spider-Man at least until a better Spider-Man game comes out and does the web slinger justice however I believe they are on track with the web swinging, they just need to polish the graphics and gameplay elements then we might just have the spidey game we've all been waiting for since Spider-Man 2.","May 3, 2014","false","14.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The best spidey game ive played but... this seems weird but... i always wanted spiderman to become the batman of marvel, a dark game of stuff. obviously not though as its spiderman. If spiderman wants to continue it may have to take that turn if it wants to remain in the game world. no not like shadow the hedghog (never playing that again) but just sort of like spiderman noir. this may be a little bit far fetched but if theres going to be an amazing spiderman 3 on pc, it has to take a turn. maybe a choice system that links with the hero / menace mechanic. Any way enough about that the game is good but not great, side missions need to be more varied and the news flash at the end of the side missions just interupts the game eventually. so after completing the story theres no reason for you not to put the game back on the shelf and ignore it.

And parts of it, I did. However, I find the way everything flows to be really annoying and crappy, too much so to be enjoyed. The combat, for the most part, is alright. Nothing too spectacular, but it works. But it's really the moving part that sucks, to me. Web swinging becomes obsolete almost immediately, in favor of "Web Rush", which is an ability where to shoot web at a surface and pull yourself toward it.\n\nTo add on top of the obsolete swinging, if you DO decide you want to swing about in honor of Spidy, you will quickly find yourself swinging just high enough to not be able to swing anymore. "Okay" you say, "Let's just stay near the ground and swing." Sure! Cool idea, but since you're required to swing with one hand or the other, using LMB and RMB, you sway in that direction. So, you often find yourself off course from your objective and have to change direction, but that's not easy to do.\n\nAll in all, I'm sure some will flame me for not giving the game "A fair chance", but I would argue that if I can't endure the frustration of one of the core aspects of the game, perhaps I already did.

It had it's flaws but it still had fun gameplay mechanics and overall it was well done. It was a step up from all the other licensed games.\n\nSadly, this one isn't like that. Their swing mechanic, similar to the original Spider-Man 2 game works, but every time (and i mean EVERY time) you cannot hold on to a building you will get notified by Spidey. Every. Time. This is just annoying and reminds you that you don't pay too much attention. And sometimes you don't even know that you can't swing because you're just barely out of reach, which happens more often the higher you get. Instead of Spidey reminding you that you're failing there should just be a very short sound telling you that a swing is not possible at the moment. That's it. I don't need him telling me "Can't do that!" all the time. That is just bad design.\n\nGraphical bugs happen a lot in this game. Maybe it gets patched, i played it right at the beginning. But in my three hours i had over five graphical glitches because Spidey couldn't climb correctly on weird buildings or trees. Oh god the trees. The park is a restart-trap. I got trapped three times in the trees with no way of getting out. Spidey was just freefalling next to a tree. Had to reload the save and play the part again without landing near a tree.\n\nThe overall gameplay seems also rushed a lot. In the first mission where you are supposed to be stealthed to gain another suit i could not stay stealthed in normal. I am pretty sure i just did it totally wrong, but people seemed to be able to see me unless i was at the highest points. The AI didn't give me a lot of chance to take out individual enemies without getting noticed and i had to replay this part a good six to seven times. Again, this can very well just be my fault and i just brainlagged through the whole part, but out of the top of my head i don't know what i should've done differently there.\n\nMy biggest problem is the new helper system. You need to help civilians and rescue people in danger. This is a typical superhero thing. But you have a time limit on it. And if you do not do enough rescue missions you WILL get the police on you. This is just a very annoying mechanic. Instead of enjoying the game and doing missions how i feel like it, which was great in the first game, i HAVE to play these to be able to stay mostly out of sight from the police. That is just very annoying and i don't have fun doing that.\n\nAlso a flaw in my opinion is the rescue mission from the burning building. For one you don't see anything in the building. It's way too hard to navigate. And if it's a bigger building and you have to get in a specific window it's oftentimes even hard to get there. Because Spidey will gracefully jump away from the fire while climbing the building (not IN the building though) and you are stuck trying to get to the window without luck.\n\nOverall i commend them for trying to make the game better. But really, in the end you get half-working and annoying mechanics that should not be there. This is again a typical licenced game from a movie, whereas the prequel made a good attempt to break this tradition.","May 28, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is clearly a movie cash-in that even the most hardcore fans should have issue with.   The good that is here is done well, such as the new swinging mechanics that does have a learning curve, but with practice has you swinging from building to building like a comic book hero can.  Spider man's animations are also some of the best in the series so far. The graphics are nice overall if you have a good PC, but still lack greatness, and at times can look basic.\n\nThe stealth sections of the game are terrible and require little thought, the AI is nonsense, the cities crimes are repetitive and dull. The story is weak and boring and you end up caring less about any of the characters in the game.  I purchased my copy very cheap so got lucky.  There's nothing here worth paying the full price asked for, so don't. You would be better renting on console or waiting for a sale. Unexceptionable movie cash-in that should be shunned, its obvious the developers have the skill to make greatness, but are tied down with budget and deadlines.

Although, I'd pretty much only reccomend it as a Spidey fan.\n\nI'll be honest when I say I wasn't exactly too optomistic about the game when it came out, but after playing it for a few minutes - I was instantly proven wrong! The game introduces a couple of new mechanics that I definitely would like to see kep in the game.\n\nPros:\n-Many interesting villains to combat; all of who's boss battles, although being repetitive, are at least visually appealing enough to have you return\n-Slightly improved combat system\n-New web-swinging mechanics and improved web rush\n-A for the most part interesting story\n-A mainly decent voice cast\n-Interesting Peter Parker segments\n-Spidey quips that really tickled my ribs!\n-Many refernces to comics; particularly the Ultimate Spider-Man comics\n-A decent array of costumes (Note that the black suit isn't the 'true' black suit unfortunately)\n-Soundtrack very similar to original film's OST\n-New side missions and an unlimited supply too\n\nCons:\n-Frame rate is capped at 30FPS if you keep Vsync on; be sure to disable this if you want smoother gameplay\n-Short; I've finished the story in a day's worth (9 hrs) and the game is realtively easy too. I probably died only 3-4 times\n-Story, although interesting, appears to become very rushed towards the end. Many plots appear to be poorly closed off and some just felt thrown in. Some moments are incredibly strong; notably around Kraven, Kingpin and Cletus Kasady but around the movie villains and tying everything together....it felt incomplete\n-Whilst villains from the film are used (Shocker appears to have taken Rhino's place), important plot elements appear to have been thrown out entirely. The previous game heavily featured Gwen, this one only appears to reference her. A pity, as a battle with goblin in the clock tower could have made a VERY interesting boss battle.\n-Glitches; there are quite a few. One or two that could require you to restart from the last checkpoint\n-Awkward camera\n-Although dynamic, some of the new side missions can get really repetitive\n-(Personal Gripe) Some of the voices; namely Goblin's and Shocker's really don't seem to work for their characters. Also Carnage with no Venom to lead up to it? (It's okay if this was the last game of this series, but it likely isn't...) And using something closer to the current film's OST would've been cool too\n\nAll in all, I'm a HUGE spiey fan and I loved this game. If you're a big fan too, who doesn't mind some of these details, it's worth a try - maybe wait for a sale on it though.\nA decent spidey game that makes good with what it has (Movie licenses). Just start an original game series now with some of the new features and the best from previous games, add a little more stuff to it and we could soon have a Spidey game to rival/exceed the Arkham games of batman!

I even enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman for what it was, just a beat up spiderman game. However man does this game just take a huge dump on all the fond memories of my past with Spiderman. Lets start off by saying that it looks like very little effort was put into this game, it looks like they quit half way through. The character models look decent but the rest of the whole looks like trash. I know every open world spiderman has always had a garbage looking world but this one takes the cake. There are so many AI glitches and weird twiches that almost every thing in the world has.\n\nI played through the whole story and the only thing I remember is that you fight the King Pin for whatever reason? The city morality meter Beenox has introduced is in this game is a nice try at an interesting mechanic, but becomes played out after 30 mins. I would not recommend this game to anyone, it is broken and should not be fixed.

The mechanics feel like you're playing wearing mittens.  There are missions that should be easy that are nearly impossible because even though Spidey can crawl or swing directly up to a hole in the wall, you're unable to crawl through.  He goes for cover when you want him to jump and he jumps when you want to go for cover.\n\nEven the web-swinging and web-rushing mechanics have been spoiled in the Amazing Spiderman 2.  You would think they'd at least be able to keep the most successful aspects of the previous game.  I've tried playing with both a controller and a mouse and keyboard and it's simply a chore to get through the most basic missions.\n\nI'm sorry to say this game is a complete failure.

It controls horribly and often makes me wonder how it got past playtesting. It seems like Beenox have gotten tired of what Spider-Man games were and decided to cash in on a flawless system which wouldn't be too bad if they managed to get it right rather than make it feel like a cheap bootleg.\n\nControls are godawful and I found that the game would often be unable to recognise my mouse, a problem I've only had in this game. The button mappings cannot be remapped if I recall correctly making it very annoying to get used to the button mappings. Wallrunning is completely broken for me on KBM and makes it constantly switch to crawling and running when on a wall.\n\nThe Voice Work is absolutely horrible, the quality isn't too bad, but some of the things Spider-Man says isn't the witty dialogue or one liners we've come to expect from reading comics or watching older films, this game has about 10 lines and they repeat, constantly at an annoying rate.\n\nThe story is nothing to special, nothing as cool as Clone Saga (it was cool, just dragged on too long), or Clone Wars, or Back in Black or any of the Spider-Man stories that the comics are famous for. It's really generic and forgetable.\n\nThe one thing that the game that I liked was the inclusion of many costumes only seen in the comics and how you unlocked them as the game went on, and as a plus side, they included Scarlet Spider and the Symbiote Spider-Man.\n\nThere is no redeeming factors to this game unless you buy it at a bargain bin price cause 30 euros or the price I paid (€12.94) was not at all acceptable for the quality this game has.\n\nI'm glad to have refunded the game and I do not want anyone else to fall into the same trap I fell into because they like the hero aswell.","June 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Take a look at the Spider-Man game from a few years ago for the PlayStation2. Pretty much the same game except controls worked better back then.  Oh yeah you can swing left/right individual now ... great improvement and it took only about twelve years. But for that feature you have to sacrifice a useable control over your character ... thats totally understandable (fyi, that was sarcasm!).\n\nBut seriously, same game like the one 12 years ago just better graphics and linked to the new movies instead of the old ones.\nI dont know who is to blame, the merchandise people who want to release the game as close as possible to the movie release, or the developer who decided to accept that and release this crap. If you want to do a game for a movie thats fine, but take your time with it. History has already proven that rushing things like this barely works.\n\nAs for the rest of you, dont buy the game. It might look good at first but it is not worth the money. If you dont mind a bit more outdated graphics then get the old game for PS2 ... you get more for your money there.","May 24, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From the gameplay to the graphics and story, this game is just a broken mess. It tries to mix elements from the movie while taking its own liberties, leaving a story that can not sustain itself for no longer than 30 minutes. The new "upgrade" system is far less than from the first amazing spider-man and you can max yourself out right after the 2nd chapter. The new menace or hero mechanic is completely worthless and doesn't do anything to change the overall game. The new suits are cool and each have special stats to make them different....on paper. You really won't notice most of the stats while playing. Combat is still the same "mash x till you need to counter". Overall, this game was clearly rushed to make the movie deadline and I'm sure Beetox is probably getting tired of making spiderman games. IF you really need to play this game, wait for a significant price drop. I'm talking $5-$10 steam sale.","May 24, 2014","false","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Swinging amongst the skyscrapers of NYC is much more fluid and fun once you get used to it. The boss fights are each unique testing your skills that you've learned in game. But the side missions can get very repetitive but still fun. The introduction of the Spidey Sense vision feels very similar to the Batman Franchise but makes for a more strategic playing experience.\n\nStory: To be honest the story is quite honestly very "comic booky" but if you're a fan of Spider-Man will definitely entertain you. The villains rooster is quite large including Shocker, Black Cat, The Kingpin, Carnage, Electro, Green Goblin, and Kraven the Hunter. Each very similar to their comic counterparts. Except for Goblin and Electro who take major back seats in the game as villains each with very little development without listen to their respective audio journals.\n\nBonus: Multiple outfits, Comic Books, and Audio Journals are the main collectables in the game, which really do make the game enjoyable if you're a fan of The Amazing Spider-Man.\n\nIn all honesty, unless you're a big spidey fan like myself, wait for a sale. If you do want to purchase it I can definitely say it is worth the $40 Steam price tag, but nowhere near the $60 Console price tag\n","May 9, 2014","true","49.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I know it probably sounds stupid, but I'd like a Spiderman game grounded in real life physical rules, where I have to earn money, manage my studies and relationships, and fight crime .. that kind of Spiderman experience would be awesome.\n\nAnyway, wish in one hand, spit in the other ..  until I have that, this game is a satisfying and fun spidey fix.","April 15","true","23.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Honestly, it seems like this game was rushed out the door. The dialogue is terrible, not like cheesy comic book dialogue like you would expect, but dialogue like they're trying to appeal to an audience much younger than anyone who would play this game. The graphics were about as good as the graphics for the spiderman games that came out with the other spiderman movies. Those were amazing games for their time, but that was ten years ago. The FPS is really bad, and anytime you look around everything slows down and the screen goes blurry for a second. The rendering is very slow and only occurs when you're basically touching the building you are trying to see. Because of the FPS, the combat ends up consisting of a bunch of random clicks and hoping you can dodge in time, because the game is lagging so badly. The idea about having to use to different hands for web-swinging was really cool, but the Spiderman 2 game that came out in the early 2000's did a better job of the web-swinging mechanics as far as how you attach to buildings and nearby objects.\n\nAltogether I would rate this game a 5/10, because they tried, I guess.\nHad it been the early 2000's, and if they correctly optimized this game to PC it would be phenominal.\nSince it's 2014 and compared to the caliber of games that have been coming out recently,\ngame that actually work and are fun to play, just don't buy this game unless you like being dissappointed.","May 1, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The last AMS game was held up in regard towards it's open worlds design, but still lacked in overall varitey and actual letgitiamte fun web-slinging. The best thing about the ASM2 game is that the web-slinging is the best it's ever been in the series of Spider-man games, however everything else seems to be lacking a whole lot. For one the game not only copies Arkham's combat, but it's stealth predeator sections as well. At the very least the combat looks cool, but the stealth sections are a bit of a drag. Especially since the annoyting camera, doesn't at all help with the sneaking. If you get caught you can just as easily succumb the foes by disarming everyone. These are by far the worst part's of the game, since they drag on for too long and make me think about playing a better version of this like, the Arkharm series. In fact, the only thing I kept thinking about was how cool Arkham is and how utterly reptitive this game is. Now don't get me wrong. TASM2 has it's moments, but it's far an away from being a Spiderman game we should all jump out for. Now going to the last bit I did not like. The last three missions are basically the movie's villians and the video games main vilian back to back to back. Now usually having three bosses in a row, would be awesome, but since the bosses don't really require a change in tactics, it soon becomes one of the most reptitive hours in the entire game. The final boss reveal is awesome if somewhat dissapointing, that the game didn't just feature him as the main villian.\nFor People: Who love Spiderman! I mean really love Spiderman. I like Spiderman, but not enough to recommend this game to the average gamer.\nNot For People: Who have anything less than a huge fandom for the web-head.\nNow don't get me wrong the game has it's moments, and I personally enjoyed parts of it, but ultimately it's too reptitive and lifeless to recommend to people other than fans. This game is good, but it can be great or even amazing! It has the potential. Sony just has to let Beenox adequate time to make an amazing spiderman game and not just a slightly above average one.","May 2, 2014","false","8.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The controls are horrible, the mechanics are sketchy, and the graphics are lacking. This was very obviously designed for a nine year old console.\n\nUpdate:\nQuite often I find myself almost doing harm to my keyboard in an attempt to get the commands to register. It will flash "c" on screen, telling me to pull the camera out yet the command does nothing. Or "r" to rappel, yet I fall instead. I also findy mself falling to the streets on multiple occassions as, for some reason or another, the game doesn't recognize that there are 30+ story buildings on either side of me to attach webbing to.\n\nThe interface is that of an XBox 360. Literally. If I look at the control scheme it brings up a 360 controller and no way of viewing the keyboard and mouse's controls. I don't know much about programming but it seems as though they could have fixed that with about an hours worth of effort and a stock image of a keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe story so far isn't bad. It has recycled themes (The intro is Uncle Ben being killed, there are quotes which are all too similar to the "with great power..." speech,...) which make it a little stagnant and in all honesty there isn't anything "outside of the box," from what I've seen so far. It is all very "cookie-cutter."","April 29, 2014","false","2.7"," 23 of 49 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","23","49","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiderman555/recommended/267550/","spiderman555","NH | Carnage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiderman555/","375 products in account","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an action packed adventure which will keep your heart pumping. It provides crimes around the city for you to the do to take a break from the main missions. One of the new features in this game is the Notoriety level. Whenever you do not do crimes and instead just skip over them, your Notoriety level increases and once it reaches a certain level, the "police" will be shooting you whenever they see you. As it increases more and more, they will be more aggressive. This can get dangerous as you are trying to roam the city. Doing Story Missions will not lower your Notoriety. The only way to lower it is to do crimes constantly or your Notoriety level will increase. This is an annoying feature introduced by this game and has caused me to give it a lower score. It will make you unable to roam the city for more than 10 minutes without doing a crime as you will get shot on the way as your Notoriety increases. They use all sorts of things to stop you to disrupt your free roaming experience, not just shooting you. The Story Missions are fun and exciting and the story overall is pretty good. However, the missions are quite little and once you finish them, you can only roam the city, do crimes, unlock stuff and redo the missions. This makes the game boring after you finish the Story Missions as the crimes do get repetitive after doing them for a while. It took me around 6 hours to finish the Story Missions without stopping other than to do crimes and collect things occasionally. This should give you an idea of how short they are. Loading screens in this game are okay but crimes do not feel like they are part of the city. Whenever you go to a crime, you see the crime marker and once you go there, you don't see any criminals and instead a loading screen appears and you get spawned somewhere with a few criminals. After the crime, a news report screen will appear and you will return back to the city. This makes it feel like a missions and not part of the city unlike the other Spider-Man games where when you go to the crime, you can see the criminals and fight them on the spot without any loading screen and once you are done, you can instantly go back to roaming the city. Lastly, there are some minor performance issues that might affect you but they are not too big of a problem. Overall, this game is pretty short but its missions are fun and exciting. The graphics are okay and the crimes do get repetitive and do not feel like they are part of the city. Notoriety levels are the worst and they are annoying whenever you just feel like roaming the city and there are some minor performance issues. I would recommend this game to those who do not mind the bad points I have stated. I, personally, am fine with it but it definitely could be improved.\nScore: 6.5/10","October 4, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The villians like the kingpin Carnage or even the Goblin are awesome to fight i just see flaws in graphics so if they can realese any fix to make ut look like the ps3 or xbox360 it would be greatly apreciated","January 6, 2015","true","46.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mordraneth/recommended/267550/","Mordraneth","Iam8Bit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mordraneth/","272 products in account","Over the last decade and a half Spiderman games have ranged from simply amazing (Web of Shadows) to relatively good (PS1) to abyssmal (Spiderman 2 on PC). Many follow the same formula of open world free-roam play mixed with story elements, indoor areas, a large selection of alternate costumes you can wear in style and crimes in progress you can foil.     Ultimately the last point is the issue with TAS2.\nWhile the majority of the game is great it is the random crimes that detract from the over all experience. In TAS2 many crimes will appear on the city map and you have a set amount of time to complete them before they vanish. These areas are cookie cutter encounters; repeated over and over with the same location, NPCs and objectives, and range from rescuing a car jacked woman to breaking a stand off between police and thugs. Failure to complete them removes Hero points and ultimately affects how the citizens of NYC view Spiderman and how they will react to him. Drop too low and the police will become hostile to you and attack you on sight, as will the Oscorp security forces dispatched to deal with the events in the game; including flying drones.\nBeing forced to complete these events becomes a monotonous chore after doing the same encounters over several dozen times and other than the Hero points, minor experience points and acheivements, does nothing to further the game or reward Spiderman in any significant way.\nThe major improvement over previous titles is the individual costumes you can upgrade along the way, each with its' own series of bonuses and they are very well done; both visually and the various bonuses they provide.\n\nIf you are a hardcore Spiderman fan and simply must play another free-roam Spidey game then by all means, pick this up. It is very fun (minus the random crimes) and the story is quite entertaining.\n\nIf you aren't a Spidey fan or simply don't want an experience where you must chew glass so you aren't attacked every 3 city blocks then I recommend you stay away from this title.","May 15, 2014","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangeland-archives/recommended/267550/","strangeland-archives","Lucas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strangeland-archives/","252 products in account","I bought this game in the hopes that I would find a worthy rip-off from the "Batman: Arkham Whatever" series, but my dissapointment knows no ends. On the upside the game feels great when swining around NY, albiet the buildings and districts all look too similar. The light RPG element introduced by the various suits (that level up independently) was a very nice feature as well. Anyone who reads Spider-man comics, will know that there are often alter-egos in play (ie. The Clone Saga, Identity Crisis, The Symbiote and Superior Spider-man to name a few).\n\nOn the downside, you do not get the same feeling of "Be the Batman" that the Arkham series promises and delivers upon. When I play Spider-man he is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥, confused most of the time about where the hell that burning building is, that he is trying to save a bunch of people from. There is no measure of stealth in the game, worth mentioning. Spider-man always runs, and never jumps less than a few meters in the air, which is a dissapointing lack of control. Especially when your run through the city gets stopped by a small object, which would be much less than a skip for Spidey.\n\nAnother way the game takes away the feeling of being in control, is the forced cut-scenes with nearly any encounter. You dont get to approach villans or events on your own discresion, instead a cut-scene forces you to a certain point, whereafter the challenge beings. Why can't I (as spiderman), sneak up on my enemies underneath the overhead pass, like a spider? Why am I magically transported to the top of the nearest bus instead?\n\nAlso, the UI looks like something from the Alpha that the development never got around to updating. It would be equally suited for a football manager game, and leaves no impression that you are about to go for a thrilling game of webslining.\n\nThis game is so bad, it's not worth anything less than 75% off.","May 17, 2014","false","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I am gonna go to its level and think of everything that is in this game. I think its a decent game being that its a game based off of the movie. I mean its not gonna be the top of the top but first you have to realize that Activision being a greedy company that only put it's money on Call of Duty published/developed this game. They put barely any budget into it and wanted it release before the movie so with the time and no money for the developers this is the result. Not the developers fault it was Activison's fault. They literally didn't even hire the voice actors from the movie to play their roles had to get different low paid voice actors. The graphics could be a bit better but its not garbage graphics. The gameplay and combat is great though. The combat copied Batman Arkham series which is not a bad thing and actually makes more sense for Spider-man to even have that combat system due to his spidey sense. The Spidey Sense felt more like a high tech item than like a power. The story is kinda bleh like it doesn't go with the movie I don't think they had the chance to see the movie before releasing the game. But I do like how Spidey was chasing after his Uncle Ben's killer since in the first movie he started to chase after him then just totally forgot about it and also again forgot in the second movie (not spoiling anything). No mentions from like Gwen Stacy or any cameos like that but it has Stan Lee XD. But the best part from this game (as with the other Amazing Spider-Man game) is the web rush feature its a great feature only had one problem with it in this game is that the camera control really really sucked and the swinging from building to building feature was the worse. I think this game is like a 5 or a 6. I think its worth checking it out when its low in price or on sale.","May 17, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off, this is better than the first game all around for one reason, and one reason only: It runs, and it runs without crashing at all (For me anyways). I played the entire game on the hardest difficulty (Super Hero) and beat it in 5 hours with no crash issues whatsoever. I wasn't expecting a massive story, but I'd say for sure I got my money's worth. What this game lacks that the first game did a better job in was the web-swinging mechanic; In the first game, you could just web-swing left and right like any other Spider-Man game has done, but with badass camera angles. In the second game though, the developers fell short: You can only web-swing if you're at some distance below buildings so if you're at an odd angle up in the air or below buildings, you're falling, my friend. Don't worry, though, there is no fall damage.\n\nI won't spoil anything, but the game's story did put in some things that not only made no sense, but also spat in the face of the Spider-Man franchise as we know it today. I don't fault them for it, but I wish they would've done something that fit better to merge with The Amazing Spider-Man origin story. If you've seen the movies, keep in mind the games are supposed to take place after (somewhat during-ish for the second one) the movies, so don't think the games are perfect representations of the movies in video game form.\n\nI do recommend this game completely for any average Spider-Man fan, but I cannot recommend it at full price. Buy it on sale, but dive in knowing you shouldn't take the game too seriously, and you'll enjoy it more. I hope my review cleared up any doubt or questioning as to whether or not you should buy it. It is worth a play in my opinion.","June 25, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a huge Spider-Man fan, and as much as I hate to say that this game is not on my fave list. It's a good game. But it's been rushed into the market so it can meet the release of the movie tie-in. I'm only gonna recommend this to die-hard Spider-Man fans or just people who will be okay with mediocre titles like this. I play it occasionally, but not as much as I play Web of Shadows. I know this game could have been better if it wasn't rushed. All I'm saying is Beenox is an awesome Spider-Man game developer. And all they need to make the best Spider-Man game is the time to do it. They were rushed into this. They KNOW how to make a Spider-Man game. Shattered Dimensions is an example of an awesome game. This game could have been better. But it just doesn't meet the other Spidey games they have developed. The only upsides are the Swinging mechanic, the expanded Open-World, better Web-Rush, and the wide variety of suits to wear in the game. The downsides with this game are the graphics, boring boss battles, short storyline, hero or menace system, and the fact that upgrades are useless really. Hero or Menace system was terrible. It gave me so little time to swing around the city. I always had to do city events so the task force wasn't always on my a**. Average 5.7/10 it's an okay game. Hopefully the next open-world Spider-Man game will be way better than this, and there will be time to make it great.","May 31, 2015","true","191.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's about it. Everything else is just meh. And for whatever reason the developers decided to use outdated 2005 grade graphics is beyond me. Everything except for the Spider-Man suit looks like it was made by some 12-yr old who just came out of a 3D design class. And the combat system is just a cheap imitation of the Batman Arkham series with a few added twists. It sounds good on paper but doesn't really give you much control over the fights. Not a huge fan of the 'spider-sense' either. Does a very poor job of tracking down enemies, unless your enemies are ridiculously close to you. Just turns your screen blue and makes it difficult for you to navigate through the map. They added a new Hero/Menace thing in the game which sounded interesting in the beginning but gets really annoying in the long run. If you don't attend to the city events your menace level increases and the Task Force starts bugging you and slowing you down. In order to balance the Hero/Menace meter you'd have to attend EVERY SINGLE crime scene, fire etc. and the frequency at which these city events take place would just ♥♥♥♥ you off and divert your focus from the main storyline events. And yeah, during the fires from which you have to save civilians you need to rely on your 'spider-sense' to track down the victims. Sounds fun but it is a PAIN IN THE BUTT.\n\nThis game had a lot of promising ideas but their execution is simply horrible and unsatisfying to say the least. If you have never played a Spider-Man game before, you 'might' like this game. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. There are way better Spider-Man games out there.","July 11, 2015","false","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the upside the game feels great when swining around NY, albiet the buildings and districts all look too similar. The light RPG element introduced by the various suits (that level up independently) was a very nice feature as well. Anyone who reads Spider-man comics, will know that there are often alter-egos in play (ie. The Clone Saga, Identity Crisis, The Symbiote and Superior Spider-man to name a few).\n\nOn the downside, you do not get the same feeling of "Be the Batman" that the Arkham series promises and delivers upon. When I play Spider-man he is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥, confused most of the time about where the hell that burning building is, that he is trying to save a bunch of people from. There is no measure of stealth in the game, worth mentioning. Spider-man always runs, and never jumps less than a few meters in the air, which is a dissapointing lack of control. Especially when your run through the city gets stopped by a small object, which would be much less than a skip for Spidey.\n\nAnother way the game takes away the feeling of being in control, is the forced cut-scenes with nearly any encounter. You dont get to approach villans or events on your own discresion, instead a cut-scene forces you to a certain point, whereafter the challenge beings. Why can't I (as spiderman), sneak up on my enemies underneath the overhead pass, like a spider? Why am I magically transported to the top of the nearest bus instead?\n\nAlso, the UI looks like something from the Alpha that the development never got around to updating. It would be equally suited for a football manager game, and leaves no impression that you are about to go for a thrilling game of webslining.\n\nThis game is so bad, it's not worth anything less than 75% off.","May 17, 2014","false","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I am gonna go to its level and think of everything that is in this game. I think its a decent game being that its a game based off of the movie. I mean its not gonna be the top of the top but first you have to realize that Activision being a greedy company that only put it's money on Call of Duty published/developed this game. They put barely any budget into it and wanted it release before the movie so with the time and no money for the developers this is the result. Not the developers fault it was Activison's fault. They literally didn't even hire the voice actors from the movie to play their roles had to get different low paid voice actors. The graphics could be a bit better but its not garbage graphics. The gameplay and combat is great though. The combat copied Batman Arkham series which is not a bad thing and actually makes more sense for Spider-man to even have that combat system due to his spidey sense. The Spidey Sense felt more like a high tech item than like a power. The story is kinda bleh like it doesn't go with the movie I don't think they had the chance to see the movie before releasing the game. But I do like how Spidey was chasing after his Uncle Ben's killer since in the first movie he started to chase after him then just totally forgot about it and also again forgot in the second movie (not spoiling anything). No mentions from like Gwen Stacy or any cameos like that but it has Stan Lee XD. But the best part from this game (as with the other Amazing Spider-Man game) is the web rush feature its a great feature only had one problem with it in this game is that the camera control really really sucked and the swinging from building to building feature was the worse. I think this game is like a 5 or a 6. I think its worth checking it out when its low in price or on sale.","May 17, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vulcanjew/recommended/267550/","vulcanjew","VulcanJew","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vulcanjew/","114 products in account","This game is godawful. Horrible graphics that chug on my brand new rig, terribly awkward camera, laughably bad dialogue and motion capture (Spidey acts like a spaz in EVERY cutscene, waving his arms for no reason at all) and painfully boring missions. The only fun I had was the web swinging, but even that can't save this pitifully bad game. Don't waste your money like I did. Not worth $10, let alone $40.\n\nThe main problem this game has is the Hero/Menace system. It is completely broken even at best. To explain, there are side missions throughout the game that pop up frequently. They are boring, repetitive and tediously simple. If you do not complete these mission, they will expire after a few minutes and drop you down from a Hero to Menace. While you are a Menace, the city's Task Force will come after you, throwing up nets to block your progress and constant Hunter robot chase you. If that sounds really stupid, that's because it is.\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad if the missions were actually fun, but they aren't. Plus, you can't just roam around and collect comics like you could in the first game because if you neglect the side missions for even a few minutes, you'll end up a Menace and have no fun at all. This one simple mechanic kills the entire game, because it means you cannot roam around and webswing for fun without having tons of enemies and nets after you.\n\nUntil someone mods a fix into this, the game is literally unplayable unless you just beeline from one mission to the next. But in a Spider-Man game, who wants to do that?","May 11, 2014","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callmecougarbait/recommended/267550/","callmecougarbait","EasyBake-sama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callmecougarbait/","146 products in account","This game shows that an Arkham Asylum-esque game (that is: good) for other comic heroes is entirely possible. The downfall is that they keep the idea of a comic book in mind rather than a good game. There are obvious faults, and obvious strengths, however if you're looking for a great game, the faults will win out. Side missions are repetative, and numerous. One could easily get lost saving people from burning buildings, car chases, and random debris all around New York, however each mission is introduced with a short scene and closed with a news report. These extend a quick side venture into a fight against J. J. Jameson, whom you never really witness, nor do you actually make headway against.\n\nThe combat is reminiscent of other beat-em-ups. Pull off easy combos, dodge enemy attacks, pin them down, and disarm them, leaving Spider-Man feeling easily heads above the thugs, while also being very quick and flighty. There is also another path, stealth, which gets favored in certain missions with an "awareness meter" preventing you from being too direct in combat. The stealth side was easily more entertaining and rewarding for me, as I found myself picking off enemies left and right and saving the big battles for bosses and larger enemies all together.\n\nSpider-Man's spidey sense winds up being identical to the "detective mode" in the aforementioned Batman games, except it is also used to answer for counter-attacks, as well as during boss battles and major plot points, adding a neat feature that could have easily been expanded on, yet was left disappointingly empty. Couple the sense with Peter Parker's classic camera and the detective side of Spider-Man comes out. There is little extra in this, a picture here and there for a bonus or to move the plot along, and sensing enemies locations and facings in order to best attack every situation. The simplicity of it prevents it from seeming too much like a direct rip of Batman while keeping it in direct correlation to the source material.\n\nThe game promises better web-swinging than other games, which have you swinging from clouds, and while it succeeds in some respects it also manages to fail to live up to the expectations. If there are no tall buildings for you to attach too, you will simply fall, but this is buggy as certain buildings don't always register depending on your location in respect to them, leaving you to let out a quip about not knowing what you're trying to do. However, swinging down streets can be satisfying once you get the hang of it, but there are still corners, and walls where you'll find the camera flipping and trying to catch up with you as you're trying to go from one building to another. This also clashes with the wall climbing, couple two buggy aspects together and you get a camera that spazzes out and leaves you debating on just dropping the controller for a moment until you can figure out where you're meant to be heading. It's ambitious, but the camera kills the attempts. Also, when free-falling from a building, one can easily adjust the camera to watch the webs shoot into the clouds, saving Spider-Man from a deadly fall.\n\nThe creators added a "Menace" feature to the game, that acts as a shallow and punishing morality meter. The "Menace Meter" becomes a menace to players as it causes Spider-Man to be attacked by a special task force working along side the police. While the idea of Spider-Man being a menace is not new, it does become difficult to maintain the hero persona as failing to address one of the many side-missions results in the Menace Meter pulling Spider-Man into menace territory despite continuing along the main story path. It becomes worse when in between missions the meter will reset to neutral, and yet a missed event pulls you back into menace territory. The task force will then seek the player out specifically, causing travel to become a problem rather than fun. You become a criminal, not by doing bad things, but by being unable to keep up with the bad things happening. It's shallow, and incomplete, though getting in good standing provides a bonus to certain attributes, falling into bad standing becomes a detriment to those same attributes.\n\nSpider-Man's costume adds a layer to the gameplay that allows the player to augment his or her play style while also improving in that play style as one would in an RPG style game. Each costume has three attributes  adding bonuses to web power and speed, stickiness, damage resistance, stealthiness, and more. Each costume can also be leveled up in order to increase the bonuses as the level increases. Certain costumes do become more useful at certain points, i.e. Spider-Man only needs electricy resistance for two, maybe three points in the game, and only comes on one or two costumes. However the costumes do add to a variety of play styles. I used Spider-Man Noir in order to go full stealth in most situations, and that held out until I maxed the suit and tried to work on another, The Iron Spider, in order to try a more heads on approach. The best part about the bonuses and suits however, is the simple fact that the player can actually see a difference between suits that goes beyond cosmetic. Switching from a suit that favors stealth and distance, to one that favors survivability, will have you reconsider how you address the same situation.\n\nFinally, as the player progresses through the game, beaten missions are unlocked to re-play, and Spider-Man can collect figures, suits, comic pages, and all manner of items to view in Stan Lee's Comic Stand, allowing the player to read original comics featuring the enemies the player faced, read character bios, and help expand the story of not only the current game but also the Spider-Man universe. The collectables unlock some in game bonuses, such as new suits, and are sure to leave completionists happy.\n\nOverall this is a fun game. However the faults can weigh heavy at times, and prove that this is not the "best" Spider-Man game. The main story is short, and has clear movie tie-ins, which are disappointing if one is looking for an overall original plot-line. More excitingly this game proves that, if taken in the right direction, there is a chance for a very good Spider-Man stand alone game, one that fully utilizes spider sense, web swinging, and the full breadth of New York city to engage the player in the Marvel Universe.\n\nI recommend this game to fans of Spider-Man, otherwise I suggest caution to other gamers, as it may not be worth-while to those that aren't fans, especially not at full price.","May 11, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sound effects for hitting an enemy sound like poor stock sounds they drudged up from the early 2000's, it just didn't feel or sound like I was hitting bad guys, just tapping them.\nThe voice acting.   This is bar none still the worst voice actor for Spider-Man I've ever heard; he's the same guy who voiced Starscream from War for Cybertron, and he still just as annoying.  Most of the other actors don't sound like they give a damn about whom their voicing, like they're just going through the motions.\nThe complete lack of Gwen Stacy.  She's completely absent from the game with no good reason, mentioned once in a cutscene, and since this game isn't a sequel to the Amazing Spider-Man 2; and takes place within the same time period, it just feels rushed and lazy not to include such a beloved character.\nElectro and Green Goblin are shoehorned in with little explanation.  While theres something of "Build-up" to the Green Goblin, Electro comes completely out of nowhere, we see him as Max Dillon, and then he just shows up, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at Spider-Man for no apparent reason ripping apart Times Square.\n\nSadly, given Beenox's decent track record, this is a major disappointment and a poor movie cash in.","May 11, 2014","false","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And this is basivcally all I've enjoyed so far.\n\nThe web slinging is fun and easy to use, for about 10 minutes, then theres only so many times you can enjoy swooping through the city. There are definitely some issuses with the swinging, when spidey swings too low he seems to have his body dragged across the ground, and going too close to a wall seems to cause an instant collision, which would be understandable but spidey seems to just start running directly up the building. I can unbderstand how this makes the game a bit easier to handle but I would have found a bit more of a realistic and challenging web slinging a bit more entertaining.\n\nThe graphics of the game seem a bit poor in my opinion. They arent ridiculous, but I'd place them at high end PS2 era, ESPECIALLY the cutscenes, with charatcers whos limbs look like a series of tubes. This is with the game running on the AMAZING settings, which i have seen through most of the reviews that alot of people are struggling to achieve, so i shudder to think what the rest of you are putting up with for the semi-enjoyable web slinging.\n\nThe fighting, as stated, is repetive and simple, smashing X (or square) untill all spideys foes are vanquised, occasionaly countering when your spidey senses tingle. Its nothing really too chalenging, and though seemingly fluid, characters will often snap to position when you enter a preset counter/special move. again, nothing wrong with this but when i know whats possible (i.e. batman arkham series) the fighting just seems to have been brushed over.\n\nThe game menus are poor to say the most. boring black background, white text, more or less just there to say YOU HAVE PAUSED THE GAME! Its not attractive, and its not tasteful. I would have though, seeing the pause menu is supposed to be peter checking out his phone, that surely the pause menu would have been a little mobile screen. This would have been alot more engaging and just seem less...again, PS2 era.\n\nOther areas I would have like to have seen changed include spideys interactions withhis surroundungs. yes you punch a baddie near a waist high wall in a construction site and it explodes everywhere, but I want to see more. even just like a cracking of walls as spidey thropws his foes into them, some type of enviromental interactiopn would take the fights a long way, having spidey run up walls, thow people into them, bounce off them etc, this would all make the game much more engaging.\n\nOn the sma enote, I would have liked to be able to interact with the citizens of new york. I'm not saying I want to be able to throw a taxi at them, but just being able to pick up a taxi would be a start! It seems to me that haviong a menace/hero scale should imply that ypou are able to act like a mennace. As it stands the meter should really read lazy spidey/hero.\n\nI ahvent put alot of time into the storyline so i cant comment on that, but i will update this at a laterdate.\n\ntl;dr version, This game would have been amazing 10 years ago, for now I'd advise that this is one for your steam summer sale list.","May 12, 2014","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot of the game had really no conection to the movie other than the 2 boss battles with villians from the movie, and even then Electro and Green Goblin only appear for one battle each. The Hero and Menace system that the game implimented was a great pain to deal with especially when the story calls for you to have a max level menace status and it automatically sets you to said max level. The cut scene that shows what happens at that point is enough to show what happens at each of the menace levels. On the plus side I really enjoyed the web swinging. I enjoyed the whole each arm controled seperatly, it made things a little more fun. Combat is the same as the last game exept for the addition of the ability to pull enemies towards you and to pull weapons away from enemies. Web rush could have been better. The multiple suits that provide some sort of buff to some thing is, in my opinion, a fun little thing. It a good little thing that is like something out of the comics. As a fan of Spider- Man  I enjoyed the game but the story really ruined the game for me.

The main problem is the new "hero/menace" mechanic. The idea is that random crimes happen and if you do not stop them you are seen as more of a menace. The problem is that there are only 4 or so types of crimes, there is a cut-scene into and out of each one, they appear all the time, all over the map, and if you get too much of a menace reputation you will be attacked by tons of police. This means that 90% of your game time will be stopping the same boring random crimes over and over, just so you can web swing in peace.","February 15, 2015","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mordraneth/recommended/267550/","Mordraneth","Iam8Bit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mordraneth/","272 products in account","Over the last decade and a half Spiderman games have ranged from simply amazing (Web of Shadows) to relatively good (PS1) to abyssmal (Spiderman 2 on PC). Many follow the same formula of open world free-roam play mixed with story elements, indoor areas, a large selection of alternate costumes you can wear in style and crimes in progress you can foil.     Ultimately the last point is the issue with TAS2.\nWhile the majority of the game is great it is the random crimes that detract from the over all experience. In TAS2 many crimes will appear on the city map and you have a set amount of time to complete them before they vanish. These areas are cookie cutter encounters; repeated over and over with the same location, NPCs and objectives, and range from rescuing a car jacked woman to breaking a stand off between police and thugs. Failure to complete them removes Hero points and ultimately affects how the citizens of NYC view Spiderman and how they will react to him. Drop too low and the police will become hostile to you and attack you on sight, as will the Oscorp security forces dispatched to deal with the events in the game; including flying drones.\nBeing forced to complete these events becomes a monotonous chore after doing the same encounters over several dozen times and other than the Hero points, minor experience points and acheivements, does nothing to further the game or reward Spiderman in any significant way.\nThe major improvement over previous titles is the individual costumes you can upgrade along the way, each with its' own series of bonuses and they are very well done; both visually and the various bonuses they provide.\n\nIf you are a hardcore Spiderman fan and simply must play another free-roam Spidey game then by all means, pick this up. It is very fun (minus the random crimes) and the story is quite entertaining.\n\nIf you aren't a Spidey fan or simply don't want an experience where you must chew glass so you aren't attacked every 3 city blocks then I recommend you stay away from this title.","May 15, 2014","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the upside the game feels great when swining around NY, albiet the buildings and districts all look too similar. The light RPG element introduced by the various suits (that level up independently) was a very nice feature as well. Anyone who reads Spider-man comics, will know that there are often alter-egos in play (ie. The Clone Saga, Identity Crisis, The Symbiote and Superior Spider-man to name a few).\n\nOn the downside, you do not get the same feeling of "Be the Batman" that the Arkham series promises and delivers upon. When I play Spider-man he is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥, confused most of the time about where the hell that burning building is, that he is trying to save a bunch of people from. There is no measure of stealth in the game, worth mentioning. Spider-man always runs, and never jumps less than a few meters in the air, which is a dissapointing lack of control. Especially when your run through the city gets stopped by a small object, which would be much less than a skip for Spidey.\n\nAnother way the game takes away the feeling of being in control, is the forced cut-scenes with nearly any encounter. You dont get to approach villans or events on your own discresion, instead a cut-scene forces you to a certain point, whereafter the challenge beings. Why can't I (as spiderman), sneak up on my enemies underneath the overhead pass, like a spider? Why am I magically transported to the top of the nearest bus instead?\n\nAlso, the UI looks like something from the Alpha that the development never got around to updating. It would be equally suited for a football manager game, and leaves no impression that you are about to go for a thrilling game of webslining.\n\nThis game is so bad, it's not worth anything less than 75% off.","May 17, 2014","false","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I am gonna go to its level and think of everything that is in this game. I think its a decent game being that its a game based off of the movie. I mean its not gonna be the top of the top but first you have to realize that Activision being a greedy company that only put it's money on Call of Duty published/developed this game. They put barely any budget into it and wanted it release before the movie so with the time and no money for the developers this is the result. Not the developers fault it was Activison's fault. They literally didn't even hire the voice actors from the movie to play their roles had to get different low paid voice actors. The graphics could be a bit better but its not garbage graphics. The gameplay and combat is great though. The combat copied Batman Arkham series which is not a bad thing and actually makes more sense for Spider-man to even have that combat system due to his spidey sense. The Spidey Sense felt more like a high tech item than like a power. The story is kinda bleh like it doesn't go with the movie I don't think they had the chance to see the movie before releasing the game. But I do like how Spidey was chasing after his Uncle Ben's killer since in the first movie he started to chase after him then just totally forgot about it and also again forgot in the second movie (not spoiling anything). No mentions from like Gwen Stacy or any cameos like that but it has Stan Lee XD. But the best part from this game (as with the other Amazing Spider-Man game) is the web rush feature its a great feature only had one problem with it in this game is that the camera control really really sucked and the swinging from building to building feature was the worse. I think this game is like a 5 or a 6. I think its worth checking it out when its low in price or on sale.","May 17, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm only gonna recommend this to die-hard Spider-Man fans or just people who will be okay with mediocre titles like this. I play it occasionally, but not as much as I play Web of Shadows. I know this game could have been better if it wasn't rushed. All I'm saying is Beenox is an awesome Spider-Man game developer. And all they need to make the best Spider-Man game is the time to do it. They were rushed into this. They KNOW how to make a Spider-Man game. Shattered Dimensions is an example of an awesome game. This game could have been better. But it just doesn't meet the other Spidey games they have developed. The only upsides are the Swinging mechanic, the expanded Open-World, better Web-Rush, and the wide variety of suits to wear in the game. The downsides with this game are the graphics, boring boss battles, short storyline, hero or menace system, and the fact that upgrades are useless really. Hero or Menace system was terrible. It gave me so little time to swing around the city. I always had to do city events so the task force wasn't always on my a**. Average 5.7/10 it's an okay game.

That's about it. Everything else is just meh. And for whatever reason the developers decided to use outdated 2005 grade graphics is beyond me. Everything except for the Spider-Man suit looks like it was made by some 12-yr old who just came out of a 3D design class. And the combat system is just a cheap imitation of the Batman Arkham series with a few added twists. It sounds good on paper but doesn't really give you much control over the fights. Not a huge fan of the 'spider-sense' either. Does a very poor job of tracking down enemies, unless your enemies are ridiculously close to you. Just turns your screen blue and makes it difficult for you to navigate through the map. They added a new Hero/Menace thing in the game which sounded interesting in the beginning but gets really annoying in the long run. If you don't attend to the city events your menace level increases and the Task Force starts bugging you and slowing you down. In order to balance the Hero/Menace meter you'd have to attend EVERY SINGLE crime scene, fire etc. and the frequency at which these city events take place would just ♥♥♥♥ you off and divert your focus from the main storyline events. And yeah, during the fires from which you have to save civilians you need to rely on your 'spider-sense' to track down the victims. Sounds fun but it is a PAIN IN THE BUTT.\n\nThis game had a lot of promising ideas but their execution is simply horrible and unsatisfying to say the least. If you have never played a Spider-Man game before, you 'might' like this game. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.

This is a really bad game, Spider-Man 1 is better.","July 21, 2015","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As I am a fan of a lot of comic book heroes and villians, their comics, their stories, their superpowers, their weaknesses, their cartoons, their movies and their video games.  With that being said, I wouldn't simply put this game off.  I would however, consider purchasing this game when it is on sale between $20-$30 because this game could have been so much better than what it is, had Beenox taken a little more time to include longer missions and include either:  1). More of Spider-man's foes,  2). Longer running boss battles (instead of having you chase down petty crimes, car jackings, bomb disposal, ect.), or  3).  Incorporated a little extra detail into the game such as bricks, stones, glass and concrete shattering on impact during these fights, and 4).  Included those enormous Oscorp exterminating robots back!\n\nI do enjoy the Hero/Menace system, but without having to swing across New York City for an hour or two just to level up to Hero Level 3, and then having it immediately drop back down to Hero, Level 2.  The visuals are also really good as well, there are quite a few of Spidey costumes to choose from, once you complete extra tasks to gain access to them.  And the villians' stories add a lot depth and substance into Spider-man's world/universe.  I really enjoyed how Peter Parker/Spider-man has both allies and enemies within most of these villians and how Peter Parker/Spider-man sympathizes with these enemies and doesn't kill them, but rather gives them a good whooping and attempts to teach his fallen enemies to see that there are other people out there who have things much worse [than the villian who Spider-man is fighting] and that they need to use their gifts to try to make things better within themselves and the world.\n\nThe storyline is short and sweet.  I could easily finished the game by now, but I like to try to collect all of the costumes and complete those sidequests just to max out Spider-man's suit's abilities.  Since Spider-man's suits level up by gaining Experince Points, the only way to make Spider-man as strong and resilient as possible is to collect as many suits as possible and level up whichever suit works best with your own individual play style. There have been quite a few epic boss battles, such as Electro, the Green Goblin, the Shocker......And I personally cannot wait to square-off against Carnage!\n\n","May 7, 2014","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are occasional minor glitches but they really dont affect the gameplay, and are usually the funny kinds of glitches. This game is basically a Spiderman 2 reskin with better combat and some pretty fun car chases. I'd probably give this game a 7/0.

Also, i did like the consept of the swinging mechanics, but ovrer all I couldn't get on with them. i found my self having to go down the streets some time instaed of just cutting across them due to the camera having a fit each time i came neer a building. I loved the idea of the left and right trigger being used for the swinging, but the actual swing felt, to coded, scripted if you will. having something like the mechanics of the swinging combined with the swinging in Spiderman 2 the videogame would have been amazing. (no pun intended.) i just found the game meh, and it didnt really bring me in, i really only braught it cause i thaught that it couldnt be as bad as everyone says and decided to give it a try, but now see that they were right. shame my spidey sence didn't tingle on this one. 2.5/10 would prefer the pc port of arkham knight again.","May 14","false","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
