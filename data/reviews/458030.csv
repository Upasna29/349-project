A somewhat slower, more Micro intensive RTS. By that I mean it would be like playing an RTS converted into a Turn Based Strategy and then converted back in Real time. So certain normal RTS mechanics which have become staple have been lost in translation so to speak.\n\nHowever that sounds bad, but from the Dad's Gaming Addiction video and what I have played, it actually isn't bad at all. As an RTS gamer from the Dune 2 days, I've seen RTS complexity and innovation in the 90's turned into simpler and simpler ultra streamlined Multiplayer focussed pap with no real personality.\n\nStarFringe however, goes back to the 90's and does what no RTS in years has done and that is having a shot at being innovative.\n\nYou have a mothership to look after, you have to plan bases, not build orders. Positioning of structures and research is a crucial key element, and one thing I really love in RTS games, You've got finite resources. Once a system has been sucked dry, you have to move on. This means eventually forces are going to collide in the centre of a galaxy and the strongest player who has set up their army, economy and system expansion correctly will prevail.\n\nThe main part of the game works on what I'd now call the staple points capture system whereby every galaxy you own will give you victory points towards the total goal. Obviously the player who hits the set amount first is the winner. Which with finite resources is rather essential. There are also a "Kill Them All" and "Destroy Mothership" modes which is self explanitory. But unless somehow there's a resource spawn mechanic added, that will likely just end up in a painfully woeful deadlock until everything runs dry, thus a draw.\n\nI like what this game is going for though. It has its own systems and mechanics in place. Not neccesarily original as I have seen all these mechanics in several other RTS games. But for me it works and it feels rather fresh. I hope those who purchase this game do not want it dumbed down and heavily streamlined, because I really really like it.\n\nAt this point in time, there is no tutorial, only a wiki which is mostly in Google Translate style English (It is a Russian Developer), plus there's the usual odd crash expected of early access, and a few interface and information niggles but I'm sure those will be worked on.\n\nQuite frankly with just the Skirmish mode activated at present, you're gonna get your money's worth in about 2-3 games. It is a steal, and to be honest I believe this game should be double the current asking price in Early Access as it is too low. Full release in my opinion should be somewhere between £9.99 - £12.99 in my currency I feel. By the time the campaign and Multiplayer is added, you'll still be getting a tonne of game for that price range.","April 6","true","5.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

Thought it would be more like standard rts games with moving ships anywhere but you have to move ships to certain spreadout points.","April 6","true","0.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","2"
