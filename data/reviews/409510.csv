Then you're free to explore! Explore the 15² block of nothing.\n\nAfter laughing intensely at it's awfulness, you're ready to go meet other people. The first 2 people I met was "Springs" and "♥♥♥♥♥♥".\n\nYou haven't seen ♥♥♥♥ until you've played Genesis Online, if you even call this ♥♥♥♥, it's fecal matter that's exploded out of a hippos ♥♥♥♥ while it was muckspreading. Playing this game is like wiping your ♥♥♥ with your toothbrush, then using it to brush your teeth for the rest of your life. Oh, and the micro-transactions? Awful, it would be more fun to throw your money off a bridge or give it to someone in need, than to spend $30 for a ♥♥♥♥ing house.\n\nMy final rating for this "game", is a "Ride To Hell: Retribution" out of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, 10/10","November 16, 2015","false","1.5"," 181 of 216 people (84%) found this review helpful 215 people found this review funny","84","181","216","215","13"

But to be honest here, they look like bobbleheads, only 5 times creepier.\n- World Design is not that well, and I am considering the scars left by other players.\n\nPros\n- Minecraft for the poor? (Then again, there's Trove)\n\nCons\n- Microtransactions in a building game? Really?\n- The Biomes NEVER reset (as far as I could tell), so you'll be scrounging for wood.\n- Your house won't have much space unless you spend real money on the game (Thanks, Microtransactions!).\n\nConclusion\nUnless you feel like playing an obvious clone of Minecraft, don't play this game.","November 28, 2015","false","0.4"," 77 of 88 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","77","88","15","1"

This bring nothing new to the table. I suggest buying Minecraft or playing Trove for free before coming to this. Any buliding games in general really.\n\nPros:\nMining sounds like a beat.\nYou get a home world and invite friends to it.\nYou can visit other places\nSocial Element...Just Hold Y and drag your mouse over and let it go. ( I Think )\n\nCons:\nMircotransctions\nBugged Quest *Get 10 Stone,,,,,(has 10 already and not complete)\nAwful mining sounds\nYou have to pay to expand your home world with real life cash. ( No you can't build under, you have a limit)\nFor a game with many features, it can atleast tell you how to navigate\nYour home world sucks and it's very empty with nothing on it.\nFurnace is a big confusion. I suggest turning down the sounds. And instead of telling you what it will make. It says "Make A Random Craft y/n?"

If you're trying to replace Minecraft or any sandbox adventure, this is not the game you're looking for. You have what seems to be a good chunk of lonely floating land to build your "house" on, for the most part it's extremely isolated for an MMO. Okay now on to crafting, if you just so happen to figure out the one machine that decides to craft everything from wooden built parts, to blocks that waste your materials...feel free. There really needs to be a more explained way of crafting, this one I just found confusing. Now even if those were still a thing, and unchanged I would still consider not playing simply because of the quest line. Right now to grow wheat it takes well over three in real life time days. .. That's just tooo damned long. Waiting on wheat to grow has literally haulted my game play, but atleast it has given me a reason to check up every now and then and see if the wheat is done growing.\n\nNeedless to say, it's a good thing this game is still close to just being released, hopefully Dev's notice these problems and implement something that'll fix them.. As for now, I would not recommend this game to anyone, not even my nephews. Simply to put, wasted quite a bit of time on this one.","November 14, 2015","false","13.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

It got stuck at the 75% mark after waiting 15 MINUTES! No one in their right mind would ever...EVER wait 15 minutes for a game that, like many have said before, barely functions.\n\nAs much as I would love to give an in depth review about this game, I just cannot muster waiting nearly 15 minutes for the damn thing to load. Hell, even Warframe loads faster, and it's infinitely nicer than this cancerous garbage!\n\nTake my word on it, do NOT install this wretched piece of trash.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE: 12-4-2015\n\nIt would appear they fixed the issue with the loading screen taking half a millenia to take you to the game, but it's still a steaming, festering pile of excrement on the face of the sandbox genre. The game itself feels like I'm playing something that's still in alpha rather than something that's a full release. The audio is janky and widely inconsistent when you're at a stand still as opposed to when you're walking. The mining worlds are extremely empty and small, and just the entire experience is horrible. It's like trying to swallow peanut butter with an allergy to the stuff.\n\nI don't understand why someone would knowingly release a game that's this unfinished and expect people to fork over their hard-earned cash for it through microtransactions. It's like putting whipped cream on a pile of dog poo.","November 17, 2015","false","0.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

See those flying bushes?you get wood from them. See that stuff on the ground?its nothing,just free exp. I could go on with this but I guess you get the point.\n\nGameplayIncase of you being unfimiliar with minecraft,this game is basicly ♥♥♥♥	 a game where you survive in a world with other players. You have your own private space where you can build, but watch it as it is not really large(it has a decent size so maybe you can build something there) but getting anything is tidious as ♥♥♥♥. There is different servers for other areas,farming materials?you do that on those.You can level up your character by getting experience,which you can get by farming blocks.What do the Level ups do?increase your health,but since this game is kind of dead and since there are no monsters,its useless through. There is a shop in this game which brings me to the next point\n\nP2w? I did not play for too long, but from everything I have seen in this game? Yes,it is.\nWhat did you except anyways? The dev that made this game is also the same dev that made Blockade3D- another trash game that should really not be on steam.\n\nOverallHorrific minecraft clone with p2w features and dead servers.

Bring a friend.\n\nHi. So i decided to try this game, with my friend.\n\nmy friend gave up in an hour\n\ni stuck around for the second hour.\n\nit was a bad mistake.\n\nPros:\nI like the music\nVery simple (Not really a pro but hey, at least its easy?)\nUnique idea i suppose....\n\nCons:\nMy friend claims hes gonna hang himself\nyou need THREE people to enter a dungeon. Hell i had a hard time trying to find ONE person.\nIn gods name is this stupid furnace?!?!?! it makes random items?!?! The hell?!?!?!\nRecipies dissapear after using them. This is what really made me give up all hope.\nFarming takes far to long, seriosly you think im gonna log back in just to water my plants? they can go burn.\nIt took me and hour and a half to find the tutorial. I kid not. The game didnt guide me at all. i was so lost\nWhy are there no trees? just floaty leaves? the floaty leaves give wood but still... WHen was the last server wipe???\nOnly one ore in the game and it gives you ALL the metals\nThere are no caves, as a result i wanted to shoot myself trying to mine\nMy friends only wish was too die after this game, he kept tring to jump off high things in game. It failed.\nNo fall damage?!?!?! At all??? I feel like this game was made for 3 year olds who cant handle sharp corners\nWhere in gods name do i get a weapon? i really wanted to try a dungeon.\n\nAfter looking at this game enough, i litterally tried to find a history on the devoloper to see if he commited suicide because the thought scared me, oddly enough a rich russian by the same name (Shumkov Dmitriy) commited suicide a month after this game was made.... I hope this was a different guy and it was just a odd coincidence...\n\nThe game has promise i give it that...Maybe just maybe there could be a way to enjoy this game.... I REALLY wanna say it was a good game but i cant. It has promise... I give it that much,... At least i stuck around to learn the basics of everything unlike those 0.1 Hours guys.\n\nIn the end, the game is fun for about a hour if you invite a close friend and just play to have a laugh at its stupidity. I cant reccommend seriosl playing the game though, as serious game play is very boring. and will end in like zero results\n\nI say, try the game, just try it. You probably wont like it but its worth the laugh with close friends\n\n","January 24","true","2.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","3","7","4","0"

Basically it's like a Minecraft skyblock where you get resources by going to different 'servers', or dimensions. The controls aren't very smooth right now, and the gui interface is irritating with little to know instruction outside of the quest system. One of the first quests you get is to harvest trees, of which I've found none on five different dimensions.\n\nLet's just say it needs work.

Honest. Screenshots look okay, but the game's hardly polished and the interface is terrible (no shift-clicking, crafting/furnace window is not intuitive).\n\nDownfalls:\n- Tools have no durability, and the pickaxe tool seems to work on everything, regardless of the material (dirt, stone, wood).\n- You also cannot jump and place blocks directly underneath you, so I hope you like digging stairways.\n- Trying to build a bridge out from a hill, the game won't let you place blocks unless you hang off the block and place while jumping. (At least in Minecraft you could sneak off a ledge and slap a block on.)\n- Physics on this just feel wrong: jumping from block to block you may sometimes miss or just jump up faster than you anticipated.\n- The textures are atrocious and hurt my eyes after a while. With no outline of the box you are targeting, things can get disorienting, especially in caves.\n\nAlso, many maps are ravaged: trees gone (floating bushes), obscene words spelled out in text, abandoned dirt huts, etc. It just feels like the land has been pillaged for someone's personal cache.\n\nTL;DR - Crappy F2P voxel game with item mall to get you to spend money. Take your hard-earned cash and go buy Minecraft instead. It is a much more satisfying experience.","November 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Which automatically means i will enjoy games like minecraft. Because as we all know, only auristic kids play Minecraft. So i got my fedora and my minecraft creeper hoodie. And downloaded this game. The first 3 minutes were spent trying to create a character that looked like me. But like every other customizable characters in games, you can never make them look like they are autistic. After crying for about 7 and a half minutes, I started to play. I played this game for more than 5 minutes, which was a lot more than i should have played it. Upon closing the game, i had recieved a huge stroke. I was hospitalized for around 3.5 weeks, and was in a coma for 2 of those. Once i woke up the doctor told me i had brain cancer, and diabetes. And on top of autism, those are the two things you do not want. Soon after my family left me outside of the local food market.\n\nI would like to rate this game Brain Cancer / 10","November 23, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The positive reviews are actual negative, they are just trying to be funny giving it a positive review. So download at your own risk.\n\nThis is the worst Minecraft clone ever. You start off in your own world, a blank piece of land with no terrain, plants or animals. You can teleport to other worlds to gather materials for building. When you travel you start off on a small platform with a big guy where you can buy stuff. Yes buy stuff. You earn gold in the game that you need to get furniture and other things, no crafting. Some thigns require gems which require real money. Gems can also be turned into gold. This is a pay to do anything good game. You jump off this platform to get to the world you teleported to. Once you land you can mine all you want and take it back home. No enemies that I can see, no challenge at all. And the loading times are slow. I think I covered all the negative and I can see no possitive. Want a good and free Minecraft clone, get Creativerse.","January 19","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess that's what they were for) but boy was that "special offer" pretty clear on the screen.\nCouldn't use mouse wheel to scroll between items.\nOne of the forest areas (I guess thats what they were) was just wrecked. Tho, since you can't die from falling, guess it doesn't matter.\nWalking on grass sounds like your trudging through mud.\nI did a bit of a recording, and directly after I stopped recording, my screen resoution changed to 640x480, and wouldn't change back (or change at all to begin with).\nNo clue how to activate the chat, though it did pop up a few times, randomly. I thought it was M but that didn't do anything.\nAnd mostly, it felt like a "Pay to win" style game. Which, to be honest, should have been implimented after the game was running for a bit and worked out the bugs.\n\nI did like the menu icons being on screen, so you know what button does what (since this has many things you can do in it) but there should be options to make it more scaleable. Cause if you get stuck on the 640x480 screen, you can't see some things on the screen because the side and bottom bars are covering it.\n\nI'd also like to know what some of the stuff meant on the screen. I worked out some of it but a bit of didn't make any sense.\nFor being a free/pay-to-win game, it was alright but there are better games out there that work much better (even in their early stages) than this and I really didn't see much of a point to the game besides building things *cough*Minecraft*cough* and do mini quests.  The quest tracking system should also tier the items needed cause I had plenty of stone but seems I needed to get the wood first. Which is a waste of time.","January 20","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which automatically means i will enjoy games like minecraft. Because as we all know, only auristic kids play Minecraft. So i got my fedora and my minecraft creeper hoodie. And downloaded this game. The first 3 minutes were spent trying to create a character that looked like me. But like every other customizable characters in games, you can never make them look like they are autistic. After crying for about 7 and a half minutes, I started to play. I played this game for more than 5 minutes, which was a lot more than i should have played it. Upon closing the game, i had recieved a huge stroke. I was hospitalized for around 3.5 weeks, and was in a coma for 2 of those. Once i woke up the doctor told me i had brain cancer, and diabetes. And on top of autism, those are the two things you do not want. Soon after my family left me outside of the local food market.\n\nI would like to rate this game Brain Cancer / 10","November 23, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/recommended/409510/","lordofwatermelons","Twitchy Nemesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/","23 products in account","I couldn't not give this a look, what with how people have been tearing this apart in the reviews section. Unlike RotMG, where I had expectations going in due to prior experience, and was hoping that the skeptic reviews were just hyperbole,\n\nthis I knew was a descent into madness at minute one.\n\nAfter I made my character, the game unceremoneously throws me into my home plot, a 15x15x15 cube populated with only grass and dirt. After 20 seconds of immediate shock, laughing and thinking this was just the tutorial map, that good spirit immediately died when I realized the game's not joking; no matter where I went, I always had to come back to that worthless patch of grass.\n\nBefore I went adventuring, the first thing I did was attempt to jump off the side. Sadly, I discovered I wouldn't be escaping this game so easily, as every time I'd be jolted back. No size of jump can possibly kill you, either, to my dismay when I built a hole to the bottom of my plot and then leaped into it. After that, I decided to do 'quests' the game had in store for me. I start off on the first quest....and quickly lose interest, opting instead to dig out my entire plot into an empty husk; rather, emptier than it was. But as I was, maybe, 1/50th of the way done, I realized I didn't want the game to think I was putting in more effort than it took to make it, and just gave up. Then again, I did clock 2-1/2 hours on this, so you can't say I didn't spend more time than the developers spent on QA.\n\nThe second lie, with a trip to the shop, is that you won't be making the 'house of your dreams.' No, that would require creativity, something this game would like to discourage as much as possible! Instead, you PURCHASE actual houses for, roughly, $30. Ah yes, this game is far from free; It's loaded with what I now like to call 'macrotransactions,' cluttering every corner of it. Want a blueprint for a table? money, please. Want seeds to grow in your garden? Money, please. Want a noose and a chair to end the suffering? WHAT SUFFERING? YOU'RE HAVING FUN, RIGHT? GIVE US MORE MONEY. To a very minute credit, there's a normal currency you can earn off the quests, but it won't buy you much, and the economy is so ♥♥♥♥ed, you'll never earn another coin off whoever may still play this.\n\nAfter dealing with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥y involving the shop, I decided to go on my first real trek, thus finally beginning the grand adventures of HELPME. No shock to anyone, the first thing you ever see when entering public instances is a shop where you can buy all you like but sell sweet ♥♥♥♥ all; opposite that, a bulletin board with advertisements for overpriced ♥♥♥♥ you can make with zero effort. You'll learn quickly that all the realms you enter are just as empty and barren as your homestead: the best you'll be able to find in terms of value would likely be crystals, which're rare, and a couple attempts with the RNG-fueled smelter later, I had no idea what to do with. So my wandering a barren land yielded me more ♥♥♥♥ing dirt, a handful of rocks, and some coal. I guess fun is also in the shop as well, I wonder how much I have to pay for fun?\n\nI'd also touch up on dungeons, but I could never enter one! The community is barren, to the surprise of no one; I only saw one other person logged in at the same time as me, and dungeons required 3 people, in some sort of desperate requirement to drum up more players; I guess you can tell how well that worked?\n\nAfter strip-mining an entire server of all its leaves in a desperate search for planks, since this game has a problem with servers being empty of critical resources due to the fact they never regenerate (ergo no wood,) I made some useless furniture, built a useless well, planted some useless seeds I bought from the useless shop, and then, just as I was experimenting, almost certain I was onto something with the smelter...the game chunked me into a loading screen...then promptly crashed. No better excuse to stop playing, I guess!\n\nIn short, this 'game' is the highlight of the worst of free-to-play; it strips itself down to the barest minimum, shoving everything behind a paywall. Its existence is solely as a ♥♥♥♥ing cash grab; a milking of people's yearn for a Minecraft fix they can get free, but it's never that simple. I'm glad nobody plays this; hell, I think I might just have spent more time playing this than anyone, maybe even the developers of this! Because it's obvious, after one look at this abomination, the best place for it is a recycle bin.","December 20, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difference between those 3 games I mentioned and Genesis, is the distance between clouds and mud.\n\nMinecraft, pay to play, with thousands MODs and many third-party launchers. You can manage your villages, fight monsters, or mod your game and join Pokemon battles. Minecraft offers the original mining, building and survival experience.\n\nCreativerse, it used to be pay to play in early access, and now it's free-to-play. Absolutely not pay-to-win. Currently cannot be modded, but it has better graphics than Minecraft. I started playing Creativerse since the very beginning of its early access stage, and I can say that devs really pour their hearts into it.\n\nTrove, free-to-play. It takes you some time to farm what you want, for example rare materials for crafting cosmic item to decorate your own houses or your guilds'. Trove is more like a MMORPG game, instead of being a pure mining and building game. It has large realms, various dungeons, different classes, and some fun building elements to explore. There's also a dedicated realm for every guild, you and your friends can make your big dreams come true in there.\n\nSo, here's all I have to say: Play Minecraft, Creativerse and Trove. And avoid Genesis Online. For your own sake.","December 22, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/recommended/409510/","lordofwatermelons","Twitchy Nemesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/","23 products in account","I couldn't not give this a look, what with how people have been tearing this apart in the reviews section. Unlike RotMG, where I had expectations going in due to prior experience, and was hoping that the skeptic reviews were just hyperbole,\n\nthis I knew was a descent into madness at minute one.\n\nAfter I made my character, the game unceremoneously throws me into my home plot, a 15x15x15 cube populated with only grass and dirt. After 20 seconds of immediate shock, laughing and thinking this was just the tutorial map, that good spirit immediately died when I realized the game's not joking; no matter where I went, I always had to come back to that worthless patch of grass.\n\nBefore I went adventuring, the first thing I did was attempt to jump off the side. Sadly, I discovered I wouldn't be escaping this game so easily, as every time I'd be jolted back. No size of jump can possibly kill you, either, to my dismay when I built a hole to the bottom of my plot and then leaped into it. After that, I decided to do 'quests' the game had in store for me. I start off on the first quest....and quickly lose interest, opting instead to dig out my entire plot into an empty husk; rather, emptier than it was. But as I was, maybe, 1/50th of the way done, I realized I didn't want the game to think I was putting in more effort than it took to make it, and just gave up. Then again, I did clock 2-1/2 hours on this, so you can't say I didn't spend more time than the developers spent on QA.\n\nThe second lie, with a trip to the shop, is that you won't be making the 'house of your dreams.' No, that would require creativity, something this game would like to discourage as much as possible! Instead, you PURCHASE actual houses for, roughly, $30. Ah yes, this game is far from free; It's loaded with what I now like to call 'macrotransactions,' cluttering every corner of it. Want a blueprint for a table? money, please. Want seeds to grow in your garden? Money, please. Want a noose and a chair to end the suffering? WHAT SUFFERING? YOU'RE HAVING FUN, RIGHT? GIVE US MORE MONEY. To a very minute credit, there's a normal currency you can earn off the quests, but it won't buy you much, and the economy is so ♥♥♥♥ed, you'll never earn another coin off whoever may still play this.\n\nAfter dealing with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥y involving the shop, I decided to go on my first real trek, thus finally beginning the grand adventures of HELPME. No shock to anyone, the first thing you ever see when entering public instances is a shop where you can buy all you like but sell sweet ♥♥♥♥ all; opposite that, a bulletin board with advertisements for overpriced ♥♥♥♥ you can make with zero effort. You'll learn quickly that all the realms you enter are just as empty and barren as your homestead: the best you'll be able to find in terms of value would likely be crystals, which're rare, and a couple attempts with the RNG-fueled smelter later, I had no idea what to do with. So my wandering a barren land yielded me more ♥♥♥♥ing dirt, a handful of rocks, and some coal. I guess fun is also in the shop as well, I wonder how much I have to pay for fun?\n\nI'd also touch up on dungeons, but I could never enter one! The community is barren, to the surprise of no one; I only saw one other person logged in at the same time as me, and dungeons required 3 people, in some sort of desperate requirement to drum up more players; I guess you can tell how well that worked?\n\nAfter strip-mining an entire server of all its leaves in a desperate search for planks, since this game has a problem with servers being empty of critical resources due to the fact they never regenerate (ergo no wood,) I made some useless furniture, built a useless well, planted some useless seeds I bought from the useless shop, and then, just as I was experimenting, almost certain I was onto something with the smelter...the game chunked me into a loading screen...then promptly crashed. No better excuse to stop playing, I guess!\n\nIn short, this 'game' is the highlight of the worst of free-to-play; it strips itself down to the barest minimum, shoving everything behind a paywall. Its existence is solely as a ♥♥♥♥ing cash grab; a milking of people's yearn for a Minecraft fix they can get free, but it's never that simple. I'm glad nobody plays this; hell, I think I might just have spent more time playing this than anyone, maybe even the developers of this! Because it's obvious, after one look at this abomination, the best place for it is a recycle bin.","December 20, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difference between those 3 games I mentioned and Genesis, is the distance between clouds and mud.\n\nMinecraft, pay to play, with thousands MODs and many third-party launchers. You can manage your villages, fight monsters, or mod your game and join Pokemon battles. Minecraft offers the original mining, building and survival experience.\n\nCreativerse, it used to be pay to play in early access, and now it's free-to-play. Absolutely not pay-to-win. Currently cannot be modded, but it has better graphics than Minecraft. I started playing Creativerse since the very beginning of its early access stage, and I can say that devs really pour their hearts into it.\n\nTrove, free-to-play. It takes you some time to farm what you want, for example rare materials for crafting cosmic item to decorate your own houses or your guilds'. Trove is more like a MMORPG game, instead of being a pure mining and building game. It has large realms, various dungeons, different classes, and some fun building elements to explore. There's also a dedicated realm for every guild, you and your friends can make your big dreams come true in there.\n\nSo, here's all I have to say: Play Minecraft, Creativerse and Trove. And avoid Genesis Online. For your own sake.","December 22, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/recommended/409510/","lordofwatermelons","Twitchy Nemesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/","23 products in account","I couldn't not give this a look, what with how people have been tearing this apart in the reviews section. Unlike RotMG, where I had expectations going in due to prior experience, and was hoping that the skeptic reviews were just hyperbole,\n\nthis I knew was a descent into madness at minute one.\n\nAfter I made my character, the game unceremoneously throws me into my home plot, a 15x15x15 cube populated with only grass and dirt. After 20 seconds of immediate shock, laughing and thinking this was just the tutorial map, that good spirit immediately died when I realized the game's not joking; no matter where I went, I always had to come back to that worthless patch of grass.\n\nBefore I went adventuring, the first thing I did was attempt to jump off the side. Sadly, I discovered I wouldn't be escaping this game so easily, as every time I'd be jolted back. No size of jump can possibly kill you, either, to my dismay when I built a hole to the bottom of my plot and then leaped into it. After that, I decided to do 'quests' the game had in store for me. I start off on the first quest....and quickly lose interest, opting instead to dig out my entire plot into an empty husk; rather, emptier than it was. But as I was, maybe, 1/50th of the way done, I realized I didn't want the game to think I was putting in more effort than it took to make it, and just gave up. Then again, I did clock 2-1/2 hours on this, so you can't say I didn't spend more time than the developers spent on QA.\n\nThe second lie, with a trip to the shop, is that you won't be making the 'house of your dreams.' No, that would require creativity, something this game would like to discourage as much as possible! Instead, you PURCHASE actual houses for, roughly, $30. Ah yes, this game is far from free; It's loaded with what I now like to call 'macrotransactions,' cluttering every corner of it. Want a blueprint for a table? money, please. Want seeds to grow in your garden? Money, please. Want a noose and a chair to end the suffering? WHAT SUFFERING? YOU'RE HAVING FUN, RIGHT? GIVE US MORE MONEY. To a very minute credit, there's a normal currency you can earn off the quests, but it won't buy you much, and the economy is so ♥♥♥♥ed, you'll never earn another coin off whoever may still play this.\n\nAfter dealing with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥y involving the shop, I decided to go on my first real trek, thus finally beginning the grand adventures of HELPME. No shock to anyone, the first thing you ever see when entering public instances is a shop where you can buy all you like but sell sweet ♥♥♥♥ all; opposite that, a bulletin board with advertisements for overpriced ♥♥♥♥ you can make with zero effort. You'll learn quickly that all the realms you enter are just as empty and barren as your homestead: the best you'll be able to find in terms of value would likely be crystals, which're rare, and a couple attempts with the RNG-fueled smelter later, I had no idea what to do with. So my wandering a barren land yielded me more ♥♥♥♥ing dirt, a handful of rocks, and some coal. I guess fun is also in the shop as well, I wonder how much I have to pay for fun?\n\nI'd also touch up on dungeons, but I could never enter one! The community is barren, to the surprise of no one; I only saw one other person logged in at the same time as me, and dungeons required 3 people, in some sort of desperate requirement to drum up more players; I guess you can tell how well that worked?\n\nAfter strip-mining an entire server of all its leaves in a desperate search for planks, since this game has a problem with servers being empty of critical resources due to the fact they never regenerate (ergo no wood,) I made some useless furniture, built a useless well, planted some useless seeds I bought from the useless shop, and then, just as I was experimenting, almost certain I was onto something with the smelter...the game chunked me into a loading screen...then promptly crashed. No better excuse to stop playing, I guess!\n\nIn short, this 'game' is the highlight of the worst of free-to-play; it strips itself down to the barest minimum, shoving everything behind a paywall. Its existence is solely as a ♥♥♥♥ing cash grab; a milking of people's yearn for a Minecraft fix they can get free, but it's never that simple. I'm glad nobody plays this; hell, I think I might just have spent more time playing this than anyone, maybe even the developers of this! Because it's obvious, after one look at this abomination, the best place for it is a recycle bin.","December 20, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess that's what they were for) but boy was that "special offer" pretty clear on the screen.\nCouldn't use mouse wheel to scroll between items.\nOne of the forest areas (I guess thats what they were) was just wrecked. Tho, since you can't die from falling, guess it doesn't matter.\nWalking on grass sounds like your trudging through mud.\nI did a bit of a recording, and directly after I stopped recording, my screen resoution changed to 640x480, and wouldn't change back (or change at all to begin with).\nNo clue how to activate the chat, though it did pop up a few times, randomly. I thought it was M but that didn't do anything.\nAnd mostly, it felt like a "Pay to win" style game. Which, to be honest, should have been implimented after the game was running for a bit and worked out the bugs.\n\nI did like the menu icons being on screen, so you know what button does what (since this has many things you can do in it) but there should be options to make it more scaleable. Cause if you get stuck on the 640x480 screen, you can't see some things on the screen because the side and bottom bars are covering it.\n\nI'd also like to know what some of the stuff meant on the screen. I worked out some of it but a bit of didn't make any sense.\nFor being a free/pay-to-win game, it was alright but there are better games out there that work much better (even in their early stages) than this and I really didn't see much of a point to the game besides building things *cough*Minecraft*cough* and do mini quests.  The quest tracking system should also tier the items needed cause I had plenty of stone but seems I needed to get the wood first. Which is a waste of time.","January 20","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also the land is not randomly generated and most of it is locked (due to lack of player interest probably).\n\nIt starts you off with your own "Sky Island" (MC players will know what I mean) where you are safe - that's cool.\nYou can also rotate placed items - very cool. Wished I could do that in Minecraft. But that's where the goodness ends...\n\nOh, and yeah, there's an ingame shop with microtransactions... that, if you played this seriously, would cost you way more than a copy of Mojang's hit.\n\nCan't think of a scenario where you would pick this game over Minecraft, or even other similar sandblox games. Maybe if you're stuck in North Korea? Though I do not know if it is forbidden there to purchase Minecraft.","January 8","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thanks!\nMinecraft is a sandbox construction game created by Mojang AB founder Markus Persson, and inspired by the Infiniminer, Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper games. Gameplay involves players interacting with the game world by placing and breaking various types of blocks in a three-dimensional environment. In this environment, players can build creative structures, creations, and artwork on multiplayer servers and singleplayer worlds across multiple game modes.\n\nMinecraft is available to all players for €19.95 (US$26.95, £17.32). When purchased, singleplayer and multiplayer game modes can be played using the downloadable stand-alone launcher. The official demo is free, but has a time limit. Minecraft development started around May 10, 2009, and pre-orders for the full game started being accepted on June 13, 2009. Minecraft's official release date was November 18, 2011. On September 20, 2014, Minecraft for the computer became the best-selling PC game of all time. On December 31, 2015, Minecraft for the computer reached 22 million sales.\n\nOn August 16, 2011, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for the Sony Xperia Play gaming smartphone. After its exclusivity with Sony expired, it was released for Android devices on October 7, 2011, and iOS devices on November 17, 2011 for US$6.99. On April 2, 2014, Minecraft was released for the Amazon Fire TV. It contains all the same features as the Pocket Edition as well as support for the Fire TV's controller. On December 10, 2014, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for Windows Phone 8.1. On January 10, 2015, Minecraft: Pocket Edition reached 30 million sales.\n\nOn May 9, 2012, Minecraft was released for the Xbox 360 on Xbox Live Arcade for US$20, where it subsequently broke every previous sales record.\n\nOn February 11, 2013, Minecraft: Pi Edition was released for the Raspberry Pi. The Pi Edition was intended as an educational tool for novice programmers and users are encouraged to open and change the game's code using its API. There were never any subsequent updates and the edition is now officially discontinued.\n\nOn December 17, 2013, Minecraft was released for the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Store for US$19.99. The release was almost identical to the Xbox 360 Edition and was developed in tandem with the Xbox 360 Edition from then on.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, the Xbox 360 & PlayStation 3 editions' sales passed the number of sales for the PC edition of Minecraft, leaving the Minecraft series having sold more than 72 million copies world-wide and becoming the third best-selling video game of all time.\n\nMinecraft was released for the PlayStation 4 on September 4, 2014, the Xbox One on September 5, 2014 and the PlayStation Vita on October 14, 2014.\n\nOn September 15, 2014, Mojang AB and all of its assets (including Minecraft) were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. On July 29, 2015, Minecraft was released for the universal Windows 10 platform as an adaptation of the Pocket Edition.\n\nOn December 17, 2015, the Wii U Edition was released.","April 9","true","0.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
