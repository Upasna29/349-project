As you can see the 2600 hours that i played this was one of the longest games i played and if you like more tactical and up close RTS rather than mass production and watching everything explode, then this game is for you.\n\nIn my opinion they also improved alot of the Warhammer 40K models/characters to look more badass, Space marines look more heavy/bulky and...well they just made every faction look more believable and cool looking compared to DOW1\n\nIn terms of following lore they did try their best and improved alot compared to DOW1. but really how can you balance things in a legit game when 1 Marine has the potential to take out a small army in lore wise\n\nIts a good game.","October 2, 2014","true","662.2"," 127 of 142 people (89%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","89","127","142","19","0"

The store page is pretty accurate in describing what it is.\n\nIs it good?\nDepends. Some people enjoy making a massive army and steam rolling the enemy. Others enjoy having a smaller amount of units and managing them using their unique abilities. If you fall into the second of these two, then give this game a go. If you prefer large armies, I'd say pass on this.\n\nThe Warhammer 40k universe is incredibly well presented in this game. The gameplay is mostly focused on smaller squads and managing their abilities. The combat is great with it's array of animations (which you can catch repeating a little too often sometimes) and solid sounds to back it up.\n\nThe single player campaign is good, although I think most people will be attracted to the multiplayer more than the campaign.\n\nWhat I would add to this game if I could would be to add more races (I miss Tau and Necrons) and have more maps to play on.\n\nA solid buy if you enjoyed previous DoW games. Just be aware it does differ from the first and although the addition of Tyranids is awesome, they've left out other races.","November 26, 2013","true","93.3"," 92 of 98 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","92","98","0","0"

You have workers to build up your base so that you can train more powerful soldiers. Resources must be harvested, but there is a finite amount of them. Indeed, this is how the first Dawn of War functioned.  However, the sequel takes a much different approach.\n\nIn the single player campaign, you are given 6 unique squads, and 6 only, to take on missions. No base building whatsoever. These squads can be upgraded with weapons and armour, and can level up to gain bonus abilities. It is a extremely well-executed combination of an rpg and a rts. The story is fairly linear, but you are free to explore the planets and do side missions at your realative leisure (that is, until the space bugs show up. Then you need to be quick or else the bugs will eat the planet).\n\nThe multiplayer is also a genre-masher. Each race has three different "heroes" which act similarily to champions in DotA or LoL. They level up, can be upgraded, and can oftentimes turn the tide of a battle. All of your other units are spawned from you one and only building, so if it dies you're out of luck. There aren't any workers, and you must collect resources by capping points. A capped point will grant you the resource constantly. The more points you have, the more resources you'll consistently obtain.\n\nThe other huge change in DoW II is the "Last Stand" game mode. Three players, each controlling one of the heroes, must survive wave after wave of enemies (top-down horde mode pretty much). You're heroes level up, get more powerful, and eventually die because Last Stand is hard.\n\nIf you enjoy RTS games, but are tired of the same-old same-old style that most RTS's follow, then I would recommend this game (or DoW II: Retribution the stand-alone sequel).","March 23, 2015","true","75.9"," 63 of 67 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","63","67","4","1"

I am also loathe to call it an RTS because it departs from all of the core bits of that game type. There is no base construction at all, or unit construction. What it DOES do well is act more like a real time adaptation of the tabletop game. You command 4 squads on a map to take on various objective. Which squads you take are up to you, within the ones the game makes available, and you can go after 1 optional objective per run. Missions are scored by how you do on several factors, the better you do overall the more XP your squads get. As you level up your squads you can customize their skills and gear. The story is fairly engaging and the voice acting doesn't suck, but also feels like they tried to appeal to a more generic audience than a hardcore Warhammer 40k fan.\n\nReally it feels more like strategy roleplaying game and less real time strategy.  3 out 5 stars imo.

However, it's very different. Basebuilding is nonexistent, you can only have around ten squads or vehicles, and the graphics look better. This is not to its detriment - the small scale of this RTS makes it much more tactical. The Eldar are also far less overpowered, so this is a plus. You gain resources by capturing requisition points and power nodes on the map. The HQ can be upgraded to gain more powerful troops. Squads can only be reinforced when near the HQ. This game is, so I'm told, much closer to the original tabletop than the first Dawn of War.\n\nIn the campaign, you have four squads of space marines each led by an important character who levels up, gets wargear, et cetera, which gives it an interesting RPG aspect. And yes, I said "space marines", because they're the only faction you get to play as in the campaign. Moving between planets does have a great loading screen, though - you see a fleet of Imperium ships shoot off into the Warp.\n\nAnother feature, although this is common to all Dawn of War games, is the army painter - for the fashion designer in you! It brings the whole "custom army" appeal of the tabletop to the PC, albeit in a much more limited form.\n\n\nThere are only five factions in the game. Space Marines, Tyranids, Orks, Eldar, and if you get the expansion, Chaos. Space marines are generalists, Tyranids are basically Zerg (to be more accurate, Zerg are basically Tyranids - 40k came first), Orks have strategy that can be described with the word "WAAAAAAGH!", Eldar are the gorilla geurilla warfare guys, and I don't know what Chaos does. Dawn of War II's Chaos army seems to be somewhat Nurgle-focused, from what I've seen of other players.\n\nWhile some complain about how it's not enough like Dawn of War, it's still a great game in its own right. If you like 40k, I highly recommend this game, since it's great for short battles. The campaign does leave much to be desired for us non-Space Marine fans, though.","March 4","true","55.3"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","26","27","8","1"

Fear its divine power!\n\nIf you're looking for incredibly zealous outcries to inspire your daily actions, then this is the game for you. Dawn of War II is the sequel to the original Dawn of War and all its expansions and it delivers in spades.\n\nFor starters, this game is built on the rich lore and backstory of the Warhammer universe. After their disasterous defeat on Kaurava, the Blood Ravens are down to but a single star sytem from where to recruit their new members to fight in the Holy Emperor's name. One problem; the Tyrannids are coming and they have an appetite for planets and everything that lives on it. You control the Force Commander. A nameless, and voiceless avatar who leads a small taskforce from planet to planet to stop the Hive Fleet before it devours the precious planets of the aurelia system.\n\nContrary to the original Dawn of War, this game is focussed on tactics rather than strategy and plays out on a much smaller scale. Instead of base building and massing armies you control up to four units, each with their own abilities and weapons. The game also introduces an RPG element that allows you to customise your squads with new armour, weapons and other items to smite the enemies of man.\n\nIt is therefore such a shame that there is only one campaign to play. This game offers four different races to play as, but does not allow you to play them in the same narrative context as the space marines. That said, this game's campaign is no slouch.

So big "props" to them about that!\n\nAs I have mentioned before I am a big fan of the Dawn of War series, and I have played most of the games. Dawn of War 2 and Dawn of War: Dark Crusade are probably my favorites out of all of them ( I have not played Soul Storm, Retribution, or Chaos Rising).  I like the Direction Dawn of War 2 went with the single player Campaign, and have enjoyed it a good deal. I am also a fan of the multiplayer of course, but I have got to note I am really liking the Last Stand game mode alot!\n\nI am hoping Sega ( and Relic of course) sometime in the future further the franchise with another Dawn of War game. We Warhammer fans dont get enough "good" games. I have got to say if you are a fan of Warhammer, RTS games,   Sci-fi, or any genre in thereof it would be a shame if you did not look at the Dawn of War series. It may seems a little confusing at first with all of those stand alone expansions, but if you have read this far into my review, do it. Go look at them I am sure if, like I said above, you like any of those genres I mentioned there will be something in these games you will enjoy.","November 17, 2014","true","40.3"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","3"

Now the UI is cleaner. You can easily navigate around during the heat of the missions.\n\nThe only minor grip is that you can't really hear the voice acting too well during the mist of a heavy firefight. What's funny is that once the battle is over with it goes from low sound to high sound in an almost instant. There is also the issue of lack of saves unlike the original one. This game offers online co-op which is cool. The details are much more improved since the last game. Although, some of the last game's mechanics seem to be more "needed" here rather than just the one game.\n\nAll in all it's a good Warhammer game.","September 24, 2015","true","4.6"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","26","33","3","0"

However, the resources you where defending where completely usuless to the actual gameplay, the arena was an interesting idea but I didn't care for it.\nI missed the base building where you could create an army where you could actually flank and use actual army tactics, yes the old one had its mistakes but it actually felt like you could build an amry and have massive, exciting battles. Even in the skirmish mode where you are meant to build armys it takes far to long and the battle generally goes back and forth and comes off as boring, with no obvious units that are clearly meant to be used agaist others and even the ones that are useless for the task they were intented for. The campaign in no way prepares you for skirmishers and multiplayer with completely different rules appling for the each type of game mode, I know there are meant to be differences but I feel that there is too big of a gap and so puts people off playing the other game modes.\nSo yea over all point, this is not the amry building game that it claims to be, expect small squad combat that is slow and tedious where you mircomanage your squad. You can do better than this game, my advise play the older one, as I said before they have plenty of mistakes but are a hell of a lot more fun.","December 6, 2013","false","160.5"," 46 of 71 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","46","71","0","4"

For me personally, it easily beats Starcraft 2, as far as the singleplayer mode is concerned, though. It has a brilliant mix of strategy and light RPG elements that all work together quite nicely. Find some random loot, give it to one of your units and you're all set to kill those damn orcs. It adds a certain layer of personalization. Plus, there's quite some loot to be found so there's always an incentive to explore the levels.\n\nThe levels are set up with a cover system. Green means you get the best cover for your squad and yellow is 50/50. You actually have to set up your units carefully and not rush them towards the objectives. They'll only get killed. You *have* to use the cover properly in order to survive some of the tougher levels. Some of these levels even end with a bossfight, which are epic and awesome, even if they're not all that focused on strategy, but more on action.\n\nThe graphics are, even to this day, beautiful and colorful. Just don't zoom in too much. The voice acting is also still solid.\n\nNow the story I can't remember so that hasn't made such an impression on me. But I admire this game for trying to bring new stuff to the strategy genre. It was really in need of some new and fresh ideas. Relic has done this beautifully.\n\nAbout the multiplayer; I must admit that I haven't really given that a shot, but the survival mode is addictive and hard. I've played that for hours and never once got bored. I don't think any other game before Dawn Of War II has ever introduced that, for the RTS genre that is.\n\nAs of this day I'm still waiting for that Dawn Of War III announcement. Just don't make the same mistake as with Company Of Heroes 2, Relic. Make it refreshing and new once more, just like you did with this gem of a game.\n\nHighly recommended !\n\n[Rating: 92/100]","November 28, 2013","true","42.9"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","1"

Likable characters, good level design, neat cinematics, great progression system but it's not the reason why im down voting this. Its multiplayer is flawed. Not only is it not balanced It's really just a MOBA in my opinion. You have a base which is a single building and if you loose that building you loose the game, you have your hero, and a few other controlable characters that you can build. the squads and vehicles you build, yes, they are the backbone of your force but not as valuable and frequent as the first game. When I play as Chaos (playing Retribution) I didnt build some huge army like in DOW 1 one most strat games, all I did was build 2 Chaos Space marine squad, 2 Heretic squads, an Unclean One, and upgrade my hero and I win. In DOW 1 you would throw up to MILLIONS of of Guardsmen, Cultists, Space Marines, Baneblades, ect untill one side fell giving me the Warhammer 40k vibe.

Dawn Of War was an amazing game, and the three expansions only kept me playing it. To be quite honest I was also annoyed when I found out the base building is now no longer an aspect. That immediately switched all the original fans off to buy this game, I almost did too.\nBUT. The graphics are amazing! Usually I'm not one to play games as long as they have good graphics but DOW2 is a stunning game.\nThere is also a loot system similar to Diablo which you can use to upgrade you heroes, yes heroes. We now have actual main characters with a story. You can upgrade all of them with difefrent weapons, amour and abilities. You also get "skill points" to selectively choose what you want your character to get better at. e.g There is a badass scout calledd Cyrus, you can upgrade his stealth to get better.

Unlike its predecessor, Dawn of War 1, the base building concept is thrown out the window with this one. Instead it's squad-based, like Company of Heroes for example, which happens to be a Relic game as well.\n\nIt ends up playing more like an Action RPG really, with you using the specific skills of each of your unique squadmates, each with their own personality and class, collecting new armor, weapons, to change up your playstyle as needed, and last but not least, leveling up and boosting your characters. Hell, even the boss fights keep you on your toes, with their own abilities having you to keep moving around in order to take as little damage as possible. I enjoyed that, and I also enjoyed Relic's streamlined approach to ye olde RTS.\n\nAnd no, streamline does not an easier game make. It very much punished me for getting my priorities wrong when it came to focus fire on the wrong unit. Wasn't a complete cakewalk on Normal difficulty and I'm thankful for that. Though perhaps that could have been because I largely ignored the cover mechanic, which is strongly stressed in these games, yet seldomly did I feel the need to jump into cover.\n\nNow Relic knows how to make good RTSes. Not only that, they also know how to give the amazing Warhammer 40k universe the epicness it rightfully deserves. Now I'm not too familiar with the 40k lore at all, but this game got me curious to want to learn more about it, because it just reeks of awesome. The voice acting's awesome, the music fits right into the mood, and the ambience and atmosphere is spot on.\n\nThe campaign mode isn't Starcraft 2's levels of inventiveness and non linearity, but it's not slouch either. You get all kinds of optional missions to do, special persistent buildings that you can capture that maintain passive bonuses for you throughout the game, that you have to keep defending every now and then against invaders. Though honestly, the missions do get a bit repetitive eventually, and by the end I just wanted to go to the ending and get it over with. Again, it's not because I found this a bad game, I liked it a lot, but I played the Campaign mode only, and RTS single player campaigns are hard to get right. While the old school RTSes didn't care at all about their level design, (build base, kill other guy's base, repeat) Dawn of War II at least gets points in effort for trying to mix it up.\n\nAs for the story itself, it was admittedly clichéd but again, the epicness of the Warhammer 40k universe is so compelling by itself that I actually want to get Chaos Rising and Retribution eventually just to see how it all unfolds. Dawn of War II was a nice ride, but not one I'd keep coming back to for more over and over again.","March 15, 2014","true","28.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

You get to play with Space marines, scouts, force commaders, devastator marines, terminator squadrons, assault marines, and even a dreadnaught! "I have come to destroy you."\n\n+A very intersting non-linear storyline. A story you can get invested in, especially towards the ending. Many choices to be made in terms of "Shall I defend this, or shall I let it fall and pursue a more-important objective?"\n+What I think are amazing graphics, a huge step up for DoW 2, pretty dang good for an RTS in 2009.\n+The sounds. The sounds of glorious battle. The sounds are great.\n+A huge variety of weapons and armor to equip you 6 squads with.\n+Each mission has a "boss" that challenges you once you fight through hordes of their minions, keeping things challenging.\n\nUnfortuntaely due to its age its multiplayer is nearly-dead, I could not find a match. Though I could find a match to the arena-based 3 player coop mode.That is fun but not many people are still playing that either. It plays just like the singleplayer game except you control one unit rather than a squad or several squads. Speaking of that, the singleplayer campaign allows for 2 player coop as well, I didn't have a friend to try it with though.\n\nI've got to give this game a 9/10, easy. This game trumps almost all others in its genre. It is not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot of fun. I definitely recommend anyone pick it up. $20 seems a bit steep since the multiplayer is dead but if you enjoy singleplayer and coop, maybe you have some friends that will play it with you?

I have played first Dawn of War when it was released + DLC Winter Assault and I really liked it a lot. Dawn of War II graphics is way better, gameplay has been changed but I enjoyed this one as well. Missions are now divided into 3 types - story missions, "normal" missions and defend missions. Story and normal missions are basically the same, story missions just drive the story forward. Anyway, it gets repetitive after some time, as its always the same during whole game - deployment of troops into sector, destroying the enemy, capture all strategic points on map and at the end kill some boss - stronger enemy unit. Together with limited number of maps it gets boring sometimes. At least devs included defend missions where cca 3-4 waves of enemies is trying to destroy your acquired strategic point and you need to defend 3 generators. The best way how to enjoy the game is keep some time between playing it or play something else until you have again need to play this. Why? Because its fun! Its fun to watch how your Space Marines troops are crushing your enemies, its fun to listen to their comments, its fun to improve their skills (yes, there are some RPG elements here), to equip them with better weapons/gears etc. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this game. My personal rating - 8/10","September 24, 2014","true","50.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The missions are challenging, the atmosphere is great and the cutscenes really add to the atmosphere (and I am not a fan of cutscenes). Highly recommended. Plus Relic are definitely good guys when it comes to long term support.\n\nFull marks to Relic for patching out the awful Games for Windows Live and replacing it with Steamworks. They did not have to, but chose to and for that I think they are very cool and it makes me far more likely to buy future games (Dawn of War 3 please!)\n\nDawn of War 2 is a really great adaptation of the 40k universe - it strips out the base building of Dawn of War 1 and focusses on small units and heroes, which is much closer to the fiction and the miniatures game. Some people did not like that, but I definitely did. You control up to 4 squads (or 2 squads each if you are playing co-op) and fight a variety of foes each of which benefit from different strategies of attack. There is also a larger meta-game element of controlling various resource sites and that works pretty well too.\n\nAll in all I highly rate Dawn of War 2 and Chaos Rising.","July 27, 2014","true","40.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The multiplayer is still quite good, although it has a few issues. I appreciate how they made it more like Company of Heroes instead of build massive army and steamroll. I didn't like the removal of base building elements however and the low population cap.

Dawn of War II has more in common with Relic's Company of Heroes series then it does the original Dawn of War, in single-player games anyways, as you are only in command of small groups of Space Marines. No massive armies of vehicles, fliers and Squiggoths in this one.\n\nDespite the reduced scale, Dawn of War II is still one of the best squad-based RTS games available. The graphics still look good, the music is the typical "epic" soundtrack and matches the grim dark setting. Control is perhaps the largest issue as it can be hard to get your squads to go into cover and it gets tough to pick out enemy characters.  Keyboard hotkeys help but it's still annoying.\n\nAll told, for the price, Dawn of War II is a great pick up if you want a small scale RTS or just a decent game in the 40k Universe.","October 31, 2014","true","30.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This was not the Dawn of War I had grown to love over the years!\n\nIt took me some time to set aside my initial prejudices and really delve into the game. When I finally did, however, I discovered an amazingly deep, satisfying and addictive RTS game. The squad based nature of the game and customization options allow for a tactical depth that the first game only barely scratched the surface of, and the campaign missions are consistently entertaining. It's not better than Dawn of War I and its various expansions, nor is it worse - it's just a very different game, but one that is sure to please any fan Warhammer 40k.","September 29, 2015","true","46.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErasmusTycho/recommended/15620/","ErasmusTycho","ErasmusTycho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErasmusTycho/","126 products in account","Dawn of War II is a very divisive game, it's really nothing like its prequel.  Somewhere between the two games, Relic released another stellar RTS (Company of Heroes) that fundamentally changed the way RTS games play; it was a game less focused on base building and throwing huge armies at each other, but more focused on advancing technology and tactical engagements.  Dawn of War II takes over from there, and iterates the formula into the 40K setting.  Gone are the micromanaged bases and huge armies of Dawn of War fighting Epic-like battles.  You will lead smaller and fewer squads and named heroes, with ability progression and customizable wargear, choose your battles on a campaign map, receive rewards/loot, customize your hero and ultimately stick it to the filthy Xenos.  Don't jump in expecting Starcraft/C&C type of RTS gameplay, keep an open mind, and you will be rewarded with an incredibly rewarding campaign experience leading the Blood Ravens and their familiar heroes to victory and salvation.  Dawn of War II has graphics that still measure up to this day, and its requirements should be a piece of cake for any modern system.  Its campaign coop is incredibly fun, so I strongly suggest that you nag a friend into buying it with you.  Final caveat: Do not buy it for its multiplayer; for that, buy the standalone expansion Dawn of War II: Retribution.","December 7, 2015","true","73.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's quite fun and the customising of your commanders is cool, but I feel like once I've completed the campaign they'll be little in the way to keep me coming back for more.\n\nHere's to DoW3 and the return of base building.

The Campaign is the best mode in my opinion or the online area modes and you won't be constructing buildings at all, all you will do in the regular 1 vs 1 mode is producing units. Controlling units, bases and manage economy but there are no build orders you just upgrade your current base to build more units.\n\nA lot of people, myself included did not like this change. I am a big fan of 4X, strategy and RTS games, but this is more of a RPG, I would say the campaign itself is totally worth it if you buy it on a sale, then go ahead, and get ready to gear up your own space marine squad.\n\nAnd the customization in the campaign is awesome, you want to give Terminator Armour to Assault Marines? They pick up the Thunder Hammers, give it to your marines and they turn into regular old Terminators, want some extra range for your assault gun-carrying Termies? Then give 'em the good cyclone missle launcher and let loose havoc.\n\nThe campaign really is the peak of this game and it lets you play from many different angles, but do keep in mind from an RTS point of view, Dawn of War I is the better multiplayer online game. But DoW also lets you play co-op in the campaign so if you just want to enjoy the Epic Space Marine bad assery with friends then totally pick this game up.","October 11, 2014","true","30.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
