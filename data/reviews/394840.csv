It was a fun little sim with some interesting mechanics.\n\nUnfortunately, the developer gave in to the casual crowd this time around and either dumbed down or outright removed most of the things that made Challenger fun.\n\nThe game is no longer about creating a self-sustaining base for a new colony. It is now a game about which team/base has the highest score. I don't know what the developer was thinking by switching the genre of the game from hardcore sim to adventure/sim light, but that's exactly what happened here.\n\nYou can still control most of the equipment and systems from Challenger but now you'll start off with a 100% completely built base with a few NPC's littered around it which is just dumb. You can build your own base in one of 4 corners of the map which isn't anywhere near as fun as it was in Challenger. By the way, there is only 1 map included this time. All equipment comes with the components automatically installed now which seriously dumbs down the entire procedure of building a base as well.\n\nA lot of little but important things like bladder control, EVA suit temperature controls, buttons on air-locks and much more were completely dumbed down or removed from the game entirely in order to make it more "accessible" to the casual crowd and the simulation aspect has suffered greatly from it.\n\nLast but not least, there is NO dedicated server for this game as stated on the store page. You have to run the game to host other players, exactly like Challenger. I find it disgraceful that the developer has the nerve to advertise it as such.\n\nYou can't help but wonder if this was purely a cash grab because of the highly anticipated movie "The Martian" coming out next week.","September 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 122 of 128 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","122","128","4","7"

It is a simplified yet flashy version of Challenger, which was not perfect itself. The devs talk about "dedicated servers" and "dynamic economy" as if they knew what that means when it is just silly looking NPC's staring at nothing selling or buying at fixed prices; and the only dedicated thing is the full fist from the devs. It has three game modes, but since they are broken, you can use only one. It pretends to be a simulation and is just a point fishing arcade with delusions of grandeur.\n\nI feel insulted. A game like this should have never been released to the public, certainly not as a full release. Beta testing must be some kind of heretic ritual forbidden by the gods in the minds of the developers of this game, whose best solution to EVERYONE's common problem (to name a few, game crashing when entering map, player restarting famished and without EVA outside base (after game has crashed, the bug of the bug), or interacting tool stops working just 'cuz) seems to be a condescending smile and a pat to the back.\n\nI waited a bit but no patch, no workaround, not even a fake apology from the devs. So what else to request a refund, and rant about a game so bad it hurts.\n\nOn a side note, my AVG picked this up as a virus.

But I think most would agree that it should of been announced to the public first, the issues facing release and NOT released MC:F, instead of meeting a deadline, which, by the way they didn't do because the game is currently unplayable! To be proud of meeting a deadline instead of delaying UNTIL it is at least playable is not thinking clearly. Just as, in my opinion, the kiling off of MC:C. I think Hyper Kat should of realized the public's attraction to MC:C and taken a step back, and re-approached the project with clarity of mind.

I have played a game in the Competive AI mode for quite a few hours now and have built a substantial base.  Gone are the crashes and game critical bugs.  It is a good balance between real Mars simulation and game play.  Overcome the challenges our first actual settlers to Mars will face - in 10 years or so! I especially like tearing up and down the Martian mountains and through narrow valleys via my trusty rover.  It is civilization-building in a life threatening environment at its best (think The Martian).  Graphics and tutorial could use further improvements, but Mars terraine and inside base scenes are already great, and I'm confident the game will continue to evolve and develop.

My draw to this game was a potential for a deep scientific element combined with imagination as to what life would be like on Mars.  There certainly is an imaginative element to the game, there is understanding of fields of science involved in the processes of crafting items, but it is shallow and lost in the monotony of collecting/buying items and combining them in a game that feels like a Mars version of Minecraft.  Basicially, A+B=C,   X+Y=Z,    Z+C=G,   G+B+B= F,    just a bunch of basic algebra.\n\nAgain, I'm not a fan of the genre so feel free to disagree with my credibility.  I thought it'd be more about the science.\n\nI understand that the game is still under development and that the creators have goals for a more immersive experience.  However, at its current state and based on my experience with the item-crafting genre, there is nothing more that I suspect they will do besides add more crafting opportunities, module designs, a bigger map; none of which will keep me interested long enough to wait for their updates.","September 28, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It's not exactly a perfect Mars simulator, but "and then they all died of radiation poisoning anyway" doesn't make for a good story.  So magic medicines and super-fast growing vegetables are a necessary surrender of reality to make a good game.  What does make it a good simulation is that if you don't gather your air, you'll die.  If you don't feed yourself, you'll die.  If you don't keep on top of things and keep working, something will go wrong and you'll die.\n\nThere are a number of bugs that are being addressed, some I would assume are quite difficult to track down, since they are intermittent.  Some are even quite annoying.  The greatest weakness of the game is not being able to save against these possible disasters.\n\nHowever, I think the game itself is worth it.  The first campaign segment is done, and the sheer amount of control over all the aspects of keeping a breathable atmosphere, crops and mining will keep the player involved even when the story line is quiet.","March 23","true","91.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The thing is that the game is being developed by two guys, ones a teacher/professor. He is very open to suggestions and always requests bug reports, especially if they are game-breaking because he will fix them ASAP. The game has come along way since the original concept demo, which was fun. The one thing, for the most part, the developers will not leave the game like others have done with other titles. They will keep at, even though it might take a while for the next version to come. Now a lot of people that helped test challenger have said many realisitc mechanics of the game have been taken out.

It's kind of like the Sims, but on Mars.  If anyone out there likes science or has a passion for the destiny of mankind, or simply wants their kids to learn something while playing a game, I highly recommend this one.  I got the last one, Mars Colony Challenger, and I've been looking forward to the release of Frontier for awhile.  It did not dissapoint.  The cool thing about this one is it adds an economy aspect and multiplayer competition (though I haven't tried the multiplayer yet).  I especially like the fact that we can build solar arrays and either make or buy all those little things (nutrients for worms and mushrooms, GPR shots, etc) for which we simply had a finite source in Challenger.  Plus, driving the rover just got way cooler in third person!\n\nI was surprised to see a lot of negative reviews, mostly focusing on graphics and lag and a few startup bugs.  Well boo hoo.  I could argue down each of those gripes, but I'll sum it up like this: I use an outdated laptop, so I set the graphics on the lowest setting to begin with.  I have almost no lag at all, the graphics are still great, and in the two weeks since this game was released about half the bugs I noticed have been fixed.  That's better than I can say for most of the games I've played.\n\nKeep up the good work HyperKat!

The "Colony" is established and running - you are here to explore and build your own base; basically make money. I am frustrated with the crappy reviews by folks that haven't spent any real time in the game - or looked at Hyperkat's forums to get an idea of what this edition is about. Dumbed down? No. Simplified to let you focus on a more strategic approach to survival and thriving, Yes. Enjoyed the game despite a few little bugs. I recommend this game!","September 30, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

As of the day after release, the devs haven't acknowledged the bugs. It's fairly dumbed down compared to the previous game, but I think still good. If you're okay with bugs and crashes, go for it. If not, stay FAR away.\n\nEdit: The devs have acknowledged the bugs and are working to fix them.","September 26, 2015","true","7.2"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","1","11","2","2"
