To consider this a final product is a bit short-sighted, and it's not nearly worth $10. Don't get me wrong, I've had a bit of fun with this game. I was actually going to recommend this game until something happened.\n\nI beat the first level. I finally got past the clunky, loose controls and beat the first level. I managed to find the wizard (the boss who I had never found before) and kill him. Then a portal appeared and I got excited to see what came next.\n\nThe title screen. The title screen is what came next. Am I missing something? Was that IT? Imagine playing Risk of Rain but having no items and nothing past the first level. Just the first level over and over again. According to another reviewer you can unlock hats, so that's... something. It supposedly gets more difficult every time you beat it, but that only adds so much replayability, it's more important that the game is enjoyable. Doing the same "meh" gameplay over and over again just doesn't do it for me.\n\nThis game does have some good things going for it.\nThe story is cute, clever and imaginative. It threw me into the world with childlike wonder.\nThe voice acting is very good.\nThe graphic style is very enjoyable to me. It perfectly carries the whimsical feel of the story.\nThe sound effects are well done but can feel out of place at times.\nThe music is good but sounds like it belongs in a mystery/spy game.\nPooping bricks is a fun mechanic, though doesn't really make sense.\nOther issues I had. (In addition to things I listed above)\nMenu system is basic and severely lacking. If you're only going to give us left and right, make the menus left and right.\nThere is no HUD at all. You never know how much health you have or how much damage each creature does. Some are a one hit kill, others aren't.\nYou're given no instructions (this was apparently a conscious decision by the dev who expects you to go to their website to learn how to play the game) and don't really understand what your goal is until you find it. You're also picking up green gems for some reason. Points? The cryptic help screen left me with more questions than answers.\nAny difficulty the game has is purely based on it being difficult to control, not on enemy design. The wizards are the only enemy that adds anything substantial to the combat to make it interesting.\n\nAs it's described in the game's description. "We've put in the bare minimum amount of tutorials and help to make people stop complaining." Who is complaining about being told the basic mechanics of the game?\nIn the end, this feels like the type of thing I would create if I had the time to learn how to develop a game. I would be proud of it, but I wouldn't think it's worth $10. I probably wouldn't even release it. I would take what I learned and start working on the next project. This feels like a tech demo for a bigger (and very fun) game.","July 16, 2015","false","1.7"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","27","37","0","5"

A lot. To begin, after wiping out the entire campaign in a very short amount of time, not a single achievement unlocked, which while not important, isn't cool at all.\n\nClearly artistically inspired by Binding of Isaac, with contextual black and white doodle intro to boot, Amygdala throws you into a visually interesting platformer with a lot of surrealist monstrosities roaming the landscape and a dorky looking wizard to hunt and kill. Taking out the wizard is your main objective to regain your body, but you can take your time exploring the randomly generated levels and collecting gems to make your third eye bigger. That third eye serves as a sort of dual health meter/jetpack gauge, as it shrinks both when you take damager and when you literally ♥♥♥♥ bricks to gain some extra height. It's weirdly fun, and using your buttstuff to save yourself from falling into the abyss is definitely a good feeling. While initially disarming, the lack of a UI is a welcome change, and I appreciate the attempt, even though in some ways this game among others would've benefitted from some sort of number count or something. When you succeed you're presented with a lot of stats, and it was only after a few matches did I connect the third eye was more than just a bulletshooter. Also, for those who do take the dive into this game, where the eye is looking is where the boss is more or less located. Quite well done in both theory and execution, so serious props.\n\nWhere the game faulters is sadly in the gameplay itself. Even after seeing the majority of the game and the monsters it offered, most served little other purpose than to just be bulletsponges. Platforming is wonky but functional, and I could more or less guide my disembodied grandfather head fairly well to dodge stuff and make certain jumps, but the amount of deaddropping I experienced and weird jump lag or random loss of inertia often made me have to ♥♥♥♥ bricks to save myself. I do not regret typing that. The bullets that I shoot I could never tell were getting stronger or weaker either, which wasn't the best, and most fights involve jumping and spamming the bracket buttons (of all things) to win, so prepare for a lot of repetition.\n\nIs it bad? No. It's better than the majority of games on Steam now. Amygdala is a key example as to why a maybe button is keen at the moment, because that would be my choice. This game needs a lot of work, but it's also not that bad in the first place. I can't recommend it in good faith, but I do respect what they've done here. Hopefully whatever MachineSpirit makes next will take whatever they've learned here and really apply it to whatever they do next. Worth a buy maybe if it's super on sale, but otherwise pass this one.","November 19, 2015","false","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The trailer sells shooting mind bullets and pooping mind bricks pretty well. That's why I requested a copy if we're being honest.\n\nAmygdala is the kind of game almost anyone could enjoy for a casual run here and there alone or with some mates. It's easy to pickup and not time consuming, and permadeath love it or hate it, is super well implemented in this case dragging you back for one more run!\nIf you're looking for a more hardcore experience it's still there with the difficulty of enemies and environments increasing with each portal you go through adding to your challenge and potential to be on the leaderboards, and spoilers increasing your chance of finding cool new hats.\n\nI had a blast from my very first run of this game as you'll see in my video (shameless plug). In seriousness if you're still not sold on the game have a watch to get a better undersanding :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvSakTzyG_o","July 15, 2015","true","3.3"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","14","26","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/369060/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Amygdala offers Risk of Rain-style roguelite platforming with runthroughs that are different every time, along with baddies that get slowly tougher the more boss wizards you kill.\n\nFirst looks can be deceiving here - it's easily written off at a glance as a poor man's roguelike. But the original Binding of Isaac had a similar barrier to entry, a game whose graphics didn't appeal to everyone and had player movement that didn't feel right until a few plays in. So don't run away yet.\n\nGameplay highlights video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK7edAbKsSI\n\nAt the heart of the game is a neat mechanism that means you CAN go and kill the boss wizard on each level straight away, but you'll probably die. Instead, you hunt for gems that both increase your energy level and increase the size of the third eye on your face. This eye, once large enough, is a handy compass that tells you where the boss is.\n\nThe other unusual mechanism is that you can poop out bricks. YOU CAN POOP OUT BRICKS. This acts as defence from some enemy attacks, plus sends you flying up in the air to reach difficult places. Doing this saps your energy, so you can't go mad.\n\nAmygdana suffers a bit from a main character that lacks presence in the world - he slides around without much animation and has floaty jumps. But his reaction to being hurt is genuinely funny, his cute look of terror making up for anything else.\n\nThe graphics in general are a touch inconsistent. Most things look great - goofily charming enemies, vertigo-inducing backdrops, large tentacle-waving bosses etc. But a few feel slapdash; one of the basic wizard boss forms has a fairly ugly green shield and tiny missiles that look like placeholders.\n\nAmygdala is an enjoyable and charming platformer with flaws, but has plenty of replay appeal (although it could do with a few more rare and random items). It's not a twitch shooter, so don't expect your heart to pound at every turn. So bring your explorer's hat, get past the occasionally shonky bits and you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nAlso there are hats. Hats there are. Everybody likes hats.","July 16, 2015","true","6.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","0"

A wizard stole your body and you're going after him. On each "level" you got to kill the wizard but it's somewhat required to pick up some crystals on the way there as they are your health and your power which you use to charge up your attacks (make your attacks stronger).\n\nThe gameplay itself is somewhat fun. You run on the platforms in the direction the third eye shows you. You have some enemies on your way. Mobs get stronger the more wizards you kill, which is neat, but you can kind of go past all of them with your jumping skills. The mobs drop crystals, so sometimes it would be a good idea to kill one or two. In general this game is neat as a time waster, but it's average.
