The developer listened to the community's complaints/feedback, and has made updates to the game that make it more ejoyable and playable. I got a few good scares out of the game so far (I'm a big baby though, so you might not find it scary), and to me, it has been worth the $5. The addition of hints made a MASSIVE difference, and progress is now attainable. My only negative is that you might find the enemy models to be comical after the initial fright of them popping up.Thank you to the developers for listening!\n*End Edit*\n\nI really want to like this game, but I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down for right now (which, judging by other negative reviews, looks like bots or something are going to rate this as unhelpful, but whatever). If you want to grab this game, here is what to expect:\nI found that this game is really lacking direction. It is so hard to figure out what to do next. I've been muddling around for 45 minutes and have made very little progress. It seems like you have to work your butt off to get to the scary part. The game looks very promising. Gearing up to defend yourself at night sounds like fun, but the developer needs to either make it easier to get to that point, or give some direction in game. I will edit this review based on future updates/sessions of the game. Here is the first 45 minutes of gameplay condensed down to 10 if you want to take a look. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF0qUPNC2ME","May 3","true","23.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","10"

Can't really figure out the door mechanic. /advice\n\n-Lindsey Lohan crab walk good addition to the game - not sure will sleep well anymore, ty.\n\n- Good idea making the hints a "hold key" option when players are lost in-game, instead of hints constantly popping on the screen.\n\nGreat game so far, keep updating it.

This probably makes the game playable now.  Also, this does not fix the technical issues outside of the car, so most of my review is still valid. Another complaint I had about the game, since the dev seems to be listening to reviews: make the clickable space for interacting with objects larger. I hate having to move my cursor to a very specific tiny point on an object to interact with it.\n\nThis was a game I got in the spirit of, "♥♥♥♥ it, I'm feeling adventurous, why not spend 5$ on a game that has no reviews (in my language) and that literally just came out?" If this game taught me anything, it's that being "adventurous" is overrated. This game sucks. I honestly couldn't even make it past the beginning because of 2 reasons: 1, two of the tools that i think I needed to progress just glitched away through the ground. I had just picked up the axe and was just trying it in vain on every single thing to see if SOMETHING would happen. Something did happen when I used it next to a window: it glitched INTO the window. Couldn't pick it back up so I got a crowbar and the same thing happened except with the ground. The second reason is that godforsaken cat. He just keeps mewing and mewing and the first 2 times he mews you think, oh how cute. The next 2000 times while you're trying to figure out what to do next is annoying as ♥♥♥♥. Animations are ♥♥♥♥, when you jump your hands stick out like some clay model and when you pick things up you look the same. The only redeeming factor of this game is that the car controls at the very beginning aren't complete ♥♥♥♥, but that doesn't matter since that part ends really quickly. Requested a refund, don't waste your time here unless you have a fetish for poorly designed games.","May 3","false","0.2"," 39 of 89 people (44%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","44","39","89","6","4"

I had such an hard time just to drive the deam car that i wanted to quit. Then suddenly it was night and my car was parked magically in front of this house. I entered and touched stuff (NOTE: you have to point exactly to the a specific point to open doors or such... WHY?... i mean... i can open the door? Fine... let me do that without needing to point exactly to the deam handle).\nI entered and opened the door to the bathroom and the water and died... because i didnt have anything in my hand and... i just got killed.\n\nThen I started again and another 10 mins to drive 20m... but this time i got out of the car the right way. The door of the house opened and i started to look around and i found a key that wasnt there in the first try.... i went to the garage and picked up the axe and tried to kill the kitten because it kept meowing even when i was 30495945km far from it. Then i died drowned... i dont know how.\n\nI tried again and did the same and then got lost in the Woods and i started to hear voices and i died out of nowere...\n\nThat was my experience with the game. I dont know if something is supposed to happen, if you can actually use objects or what... i will never know....","May 5","false","1.2"," 12 of 49 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","12","49","2","2"

It might get better as the game goes on, but I didn't buy it planning to invest in slogging through a weak opening to get to the end.\n\nSpecifically, a lot of the little improvements I expect from an indie game with weak (retro?...ish) graphics weren't there. There were a ton of cubbards and doors with nothing behind them, but there were also plenty that inexplicably didn't open. Some that did open were very hard to open because of the controls and height of the in game character (ie you have to target the handle, and can't crouch as far as I could tell. No controls guide, probably to support the minimalist aesthetic). I found a ladder that I could pick up, but after that all I could do was set it down.\n\nThis game just didn't feel like enough was put into the house, which as far as I can tell is the key set-piece for the game.","June 6","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
