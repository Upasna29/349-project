Personally I think the way to get the most out of this game though is running multi-player Co-op.\n\nThis is no Call of Duty or Medal of Honor shoot 'em up, but rather a tactical combat simulator.  If you are a solo player I would probably skip this title.  However if you like to roleplay and really get into your job, then team up with up to three others and run this game in multi-player campaign mode (Co-op).\n\nThere are four roles to choose from. Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Squad Leader.  There is only one squad leader and he sets up and calls out the waypoints and strategies through the missions.  The game can be a bit glitchy at times, but the fun factor far outweighs the technical glitches.  The first mission is probably the worst, so if you pick up this game don't let the beginning stop you.  By the third mission you will be wading through the foliage calling out targets for your sniper while your engineer sets some demo up on an enemy APC.  I cannot emphasize enough that this game is best played with others and is definitely not a solo affair.  You will need to use 3rd party software for headset chat.  You will need to use a headset as well as the in game communication is very poor.\n\nI always played Squad Leader, as I was the host for our game sessions.  One of the most memorable moments in this game for me was when our sniper got pinned down behind a wall and was getting hammered by a .50 cal from an enemy technical.  I sent in the engineer with this heavy weapon and before he reached the wall he went down hard.  He was still alive so I instructed the medic to lend support to the engineer while I drew fire from the technical.  The screaming going on over the headset was intense.  The medic got the engineer back on his feet and behind the wall while our sniper bugged out of the area.  I was getting attention form that .50 cal and hiding behind a tree and was also drawing fire from some infantry that heard the ruckus and started closing in on my position.  Just when I figured that I was going down the technical blew up thanks to our engineer's heavy weapon and the inantry closing in on my position started dropping like flies from our sniper.  We were back in business doing what we did best.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, it's times like this that I game for.  I would highly suggest this title to anyone that likes to game with friends.  Operation Flashpoint: Red River is even better and provides a smoother ride.  If you can pick this title up on a steam sale with Red River I wouldn't hesitate.","November 25, 2013","true","29.5"," 99 of 122 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","99","122","2","0"

Voices are clearer and more natural. Physix, a more advanced tiring system, and individual medical kits were used in this before being incorporated into Arma (3). Overall, the Arma games have more to offer though, with an easier to use mission editor, greater mod friendliness, continued support, the ability to lean, customizable faces and voices, free editing software for a user to produce their own content, aiming without having to constantly depress the aim button, and much more.\n\nHere are some comparison videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWkbNboZwUg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns0-5O1tf1U\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPxoLj1O0UY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8sPQDVJSs\n\n\nHere are some useful sites to visit:\nhttp://sar.n1bus.eu/\nhttp://filebeam.com/folder/6934\nhttp://www.justallinone.com/index.php/component/jdownloads/viewcategory/64-island-wars-2-0?Itemid=493\nhttp://www.tunngle.net/en/","May 3, 2015","true","1.3"," 106 of 134 people (79%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","79","106","134","13","6"

This was a pretty solid tactical shooter at its core, but the inability for Codemasters to give a ♥♥♥♥ at the time has relegated it to an "OK"\n\nTo be certain, this game is *NOTHING* like the original Operation Flashpoint. That's ArmA. In fact, there was a lot of hope for this game since ArmA 1, as in Armed Assault: Combat Operations, was so poorly received.  However, ArmA 2 dropped and made this utterly irrelevant.\n\n1.) ArmA 2 got a demo before it launched\n2.) Dragon Rising got a demo after it launched\n\nAnd, to top this off, the game's biggest drawback is that it suffers from consolization. The control responses for inventory management are painfully slow.\n\nThe AI, is also, hit and miss. At times, its competent. Other times it craps its pants and rolls in the grass. It always sees through cover, through brush, and through smoke.\n\nIn all, this could have been a great beginner's tactical shooter. But, it's just so gimped. For the price?

You're always against the odds and rarely can you relax, one bullet can be fatal. The game is challenging and difficult if you don't play tactically. This is great fun for those who enjoy strategy and realism, you need to stay prone, kneel and take cover.\n+ Cool weapons, but limited selection.\n+ Co-op mode so you can play the game's campaign with several friends.\n+ In singleplayer you can give orders to squadmates, such as flanking and supressing the enemy, defending a position, medicing, repairing vehicles and retreating.\n+ Graphics look nice, the water, forests and buildings are aesthetically pleasing.\n+ Around 30 hours of gameplay in singleplayer, less however for Co-op mode.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Issuing squad orders can be annoying amidst a battle with the enemy and is often an inconvenience. I didn't use any squad orders for the entire duration of the game because it was far too difficult to multi-task while being fired at. The concept is sound, but the execution was poor.\n- Flawed checkpoint save system which doesn't do justice in the place of saved games.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\n\nOperation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is an enjoyable first person shooter and resembles a military simulator.","January 28, 2014","true","32.0"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","31","43","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperbelly/recommended/12830/","pepperbelly","PepperBelly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperbelly/","285 products in account","Underrated game in my mind. I played this originally on the Xbox 360 back when it released, then later on purchased it on PC within a Codemasters Bundle that was on sale.\n\nA lot of people like to say negative things about this game, but honestly, I really enjoyed it. I thoroughly enjoy realistic tactical shooters and milsims, and this game ranks high on the list of available games. That's not to say it doesn't have its problems. The AI isn't the best (although there is a mod to remedy this), and the resolutions are restricted to 1280x1024 as the highest option. To fix this, you'll need to download another .exe and replace the one in the game installation folder. The guides section has this fix explained in detail with links to the file.\n\nThe game has a great campaign, and in fact, it's easily one of the best single-player campaigns I've experienced; very enjoyable and expansive missions that feel very immersive and challenging in a very unforgiving manner. Screw up just a tiny bit, and it'll cost you greatly. There's a few side missions available independently from the campaign, plus you can download a ton of mission packs off of modding websites to further enhance the single-player longevity.\n\nMultiplayer is no longer officially supported, which is unfortunate, however, there is a very simple workaround. Simply use Gameranger and host LAN games and you'll be completely set.\n\nNow onto my gripes. These two issues are single handedly my biggest problems with this game, and if they weren't there, this would easily be one of the top military tactical shooters out there, and would be something I'd put a LOT more time into. These issues are FOV (Field of View) and mouse acceleration. Absolutely unforgivable to not have proper support in these areas. The FOV is locked at around 60, which is horrid. There's no way to change it, at all, by any means. Now, I did get used to it, and didn't let it ruin my experience too much, and I'll get to that in a second.\n\nAs for mouse acceleration, once again, no fix available. You're stuck with it, and it sucks. In this regard, playing with a controller is actually superior, although your aim will undoubtedly suffer from it.\n\nNow if it was one or the other, it wouldn't be that much of a problem. For example, if you could increase your FOV to around 90, but the mouse acceleration was still present, it would still be annoying, but it would be less annoying. If there was no mouse acceleration, but the FOV was still locked at 60, once again, less annoying. But the two combined.... just, it's terrible, and as I said, unforgivable in a PC game.\n\nAside from that, this is easily one of the most optimized games I've ever played. The performance is outstanding, especially on any PC stronger than an Xbox 360. I mean think about it, last gen consoles could run this game. Naturally people would compare this game to Arma, and in the realm of performance, there's no comparison. The EGO Engine is outstanding, and the visuals still hold up well even today.\n\nIn fact, I'd compare the visuals to the newly released SQUAD, and in some ways, it even looks better. To be completely honest, after playing this game through again just recently, I'd say it's very similar to SQUAD in gameplay style, and even the HUD elements (compass, weapon selection menu, etc.), only it has a very detailed single-player experience.\n\nTo rap things up, it's an excellent game, hampered down by two glaring issues that can be mitigated if you play this game the way it was designed... as a console game. What I mean by this, plug in your Xbox 360 controller, sit back farther than usual, and the FOV will be somewhat more tolerable, and mouse acceleration will be a non-issue since you're not even using a mouse.\n\nIf you can get past those two issues, you're in for a great military shooter experience. Calling in artillery and mortor fire is easily one of the most satisfying things you can do in this game, among many other things.\n\nSo with that in mind, given its price, I'd recommend it. Plus with Steams ability to refund, you'll be able to experience enough within 2 hours to determine whether or not you'll want to issue one.","March 2","true","12.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","17","20","3","1"

Compared to the 1st part and the Arma series, it's friendlier and it's a great game for people not familiar with realism-oriented shooters, as it nicely displays the modern day combat, better than most of the today's military shooters. The game's world is a single location, a big island, and unlike similar games, there's no draw distance limit. Despite this the graphics are nice and well-optimized (for 2009). The campaign plot is nothing special and is pretty short, but the missions are fun. You can drive vehicles, command your squad, use different firearms, modeled after real ones, and a level editor is also included, as in the game's predecessor. The main problem here is the fact the development was pushed, which resulted in cut content (some of it can still be found in the game's files), annoying bugs, and not so good AI. If you like military FPSs and like some challenge, you should try Dragon Rising.","January 5, 2014","true","16.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

The interface is and the gameplay works almost flawlessly compared to other titles in the genre (military simulation FPS).\n\nMany people wrongly compare the game to other good games like Arma and such, and opt to take sides in the clonflict between the two gaming companies. I find this silly, as one could easily enjoy both games and simply be glad to have twice as much game.\n\nThe game presents very realistic military scenarios and gives the player a lot of choices about how to handle their objectives. The levels are quite huge and the bullet drop in the game works quite well.\n\nThe few things that work poorly would be (as always) a fairly limited AI (still decent), weird driving physics (avoid cars, or stay on the road! Off-roading even a little can be fatal - it's not a big deal if you just use cars to get from A to B quickly, using the roads, but don't let the AI drive. Only the enemy AI can drive properly) and the lack of ability to pre-select equipment, despite it seeming like this feature was meant to be implemented.\n\nAlso, on the multiplayer part of the game, it seems like it was intended for it to be possible to me quite a few players in each mission, some taking a more "RTS" like stance on the game, as they play officers, but this also seems to have been cut from the final release.\n\nFinally, several missions in the game are only available by essentially typing in certain codes, which is weird... These codes can only be found on the internet.\n\nAlso, it took me and my friend that I play with months to figure out that the game had a few non-campaign related missions that you could play when playing co-op. They're tricky to find, but they are there.\n\nThe game is best played co-op with 3 friends.","September 29, 2014","true","39.3"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

The original Operation Flashpoint GOTY game was one of the greatest 'realistic', tactical, sans-health bar FPS games of all time, with two fantastic expansions which both added huge amounts of content to the game (in much the same way Morrowind was improved by Tribunal and Bloodmoon) and a wonderful gameplay style that gave the game tremendous replayability and gave the player tremendous scope to imagine the world around them.\n\nOf course, after that original title the companies that were responsible for the game split up - Bohemia Interactive making the ARMA series (eternally disapointing in kind of the same way Gothic was: just not refined, polished, bug-free or fun enough to match the technological ambition) and Codemasters making this game.\n\nDragon Rising was many years in the making, and while you can say that in certain ways it was a better shooter than the ARMA titles, you can say that it was nevertheless dissapointing and an inferior title to the original OpFlash in terms of how it contrasted with the titles already available.\n\nIf we are to compare this game with ARMA then you might say that the game is a bit more stable, the missions a bit more cinematic and well paced, the guns a bit more realistic and satisfying to use. These advantages are real and enjoyable, but none of them represent industry leading iterations of the features - the original OpFlash lead the industry in map size, replayability, freedom, difficulty (if you so desired) and scope, but Dragon Rising doesn't really set the world alight in any one way.\n\nThis does have to do with the bugs that, while not as annoying as in ARMA 2, for example, are still present. I once played a mission where a tank somehow got stuck to my soldier by an invisible, 10 meter pole. no kidding, I walked around the map with a many tonne tank spinning wildly ten meters above my head, smacking and clattering into the ground incessantly whenever I tried to get in a vehicle but, somewhat disapointingly, refusing to crush the squad mates that I tired to hard to splatter. Another time I had to give up on an entire playthrough as a certain mission bugged and was simply impossible to complete.\n\nThe zones are still big, the soliders still responsive to orders, the enemies still reasonably deadly, but the island of Skira fails to burst into life in the same way the original OpFlash island of Everon did, largely because the game is let down by instability and unconvincing scenarios. It is a huge shame that this game failed, and while some admirable advertising almost convinced me to give Red River a go it was apparently even worse than DR, and as such sadly I fear we must lay this game to rest.\n\nI am reminded of the classic xBox shooter BLACK. Quite forgotten now, it had a really polished feel and really immersive, solid missions. It is perhaps where the ingredients that would have made Dragon Rising a really good game snuck off to.\n\nI still recommend this game, because it is better than ARMA 2 for as long as it lasts before it bugs out, and it just has a better title, let's face it.","May 21","true","2.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It comes with loads of great addons, maps and mods which give it the potential to be a very varied and exciting gameplay experience but I've only been able to complete a couple missions out of over 30 I played. The check-pointing system doesn't let you save just anywhere and the checkpoints are way too far off between each other so you end up wasting 10min over and over just reaching the objective and trying to setup a good tactic only to be killed withing a couple minutes of being spotted. One time I snuck into a town in one of the missions and I was right downtown unspotted with my squad, I finally give the command to start assaulting some buildings and I start firing from behind a house and some destroyer ship out to see just goes and blows up the building Im standing behind and then 3 others to kill my teammates withing 2min, would a destroyer seriously start firing artillery on their own base to rid it of just 3 guys?\n\n\nYour teammates AI:\n\nThey are terrible, you tell them to drive to a shore about 30 degree's to your right and they go and run into the side of the island and keep trying to shortcut the boat across land, instead of going around the little area, all the armored vehicles seem to be susceptible to small arms fire, the AI wont shoot at enemies when your in a vehicle even though the enemy is in perfect range, if you tell them to board a vehicle and they beat you to it they start driving it around like morons nearly running you over while your trying to get in so you have to give them a stop order. One time I took a couple guys and put them in a chopper and another couple and put them in a different chopper, I jumped on a boat and gave the order to assault an area and I find myself halfway there and them still parked on the beach unable to move. Or sometimes theres extra AI soldiers not part of your squad and your trying to get a strategy going to get a guy in a tank and flank another set around the otherside and the AI you cant control just starts running in like maniacs getting killed, alerting the enemy to your presence resulting in your own squads death too, other-times they wont back you up. Your guys will stand out in the open alot, not start running faster when under fire or just stop altogether and commit suicide practically, they wont crouch or prone and you give them an order to go somewhere and they just stand there. This is even while using a single-player AI enhancement mod.\n\nThe enemy AI: They can see you before you can see them from over 800m away while your crouching in tall grass or between trees in a forest, its almost impossible to sneak up on them plus they must be androids cause they have astounding aim from even 400m+ away always nailing you in the head. If you jump in any-kind of vehicle like a tank, chopper, boat some enemy unit always has an RPG to blow you up after just 1min of beeing spotted from a distance which makes vehicles pointless to use and half the time you cant even see them, you just blow up.\n\nAnother time I put a couple guys in a chopper and another couple in a different one and sent them to assualt a coast while the unmanaged allied AI went in with a boat and they were all picked off with RPGs  withing 2min of being air/sea-born without having fired a single shot.\n\nThis may still be fun as a PvP multiplayer with no AI but the company pulled the multiplayer servers, buy you can still use something like Logmein Himatchi. I think just stick with Arma 2 or 3, I'll never play it again except in multiplayer.","February 3, 2014","false","23.2"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","28","49","0","0"

Using their own "EGO" engine, OFDR is an attempt to bring back the "sandbox military shooter" genre, in trying to get away from the tightly scripted experience of MOH or COD franchise. The result is a bit hit and miss, due to unforgiving difficulty, a tightly scripted experience on an open map, and clunky interface that was not even optimized for gamepad.\n\nSet on a fictional island just off Russia, which has the potential of large oil reserves, China, with some historical claims, chose to invade it for the oil to fulfill its own energy needs. Russia, busy with its problems, requested US for help, and US marines landed, and soo ncame into direct conflict with the People's Liberation Army. You will get to play two characters... a Marine Sgt with his own fireteam, and a special forces lieutenant leading his own fireteam. They have different missions on different part of the island, but together they will find a way to kick the PLA off the island.\n\nThe game is realistic in that you can be wounded by a single bullet, and a head shot will likely kill you. You will need to use the medpack on yourself to staunch the bleeding (else you'll fade out and die), and/or summon the fireteam medic (or anyone else) to bandage you. However, the interface to do so is clumsy and impossible to use during combat. Same with grenades. You have them, but throwing them is a real PITA.\n\nThe game does retail a lot of the open feel. If you can get at a vehicle, you can probably drive it. A jeep, sure. Tank or APC? No problem. Helicopter? Why not, if you catch one on the ground. Killing armor, on the other hand, is a different problem, as clearly they are invulnerable to your bullets, and you have to find anti-armor weapons (Queen Bee AT rocket, Javelin AT missile, etc.) . And you will occasionally get to shoot Stinger or Strela SAM at helicopters.\n\nThe actual shooting, however, leaves much to be desired. You will barely spot the enemy at all, even through the various target scopes, unless you happen across a sniper rifle (usually by killing an enemy sniper, or special ammo crates). There's also plenty of foliage and terrain features. Add it to a very... bland color pallete (it's almost all autumn yellow) and you'll NEVER spot the enemies without a little help from the threat indicator (which is only active at the "easy" difficulty level).  And no, there's no "radar" showing you where the enemies are. This is a sim, not a "game".\n\nThe missions are long and the progress saved at checkpoints. However, the checkpoints are not always placed at logical spots, and you often don't know what exactly you did wrong last playthrough. So you end up repeating the checkpoint over and over until you throw your controller through the monitor. The missions also fail to allow the open-sandbox style map to work its magic, as most of the missions are tightly scripted and often with a TIME LIMIT, such as "you must eliminate the SAM teams before our own gunships arrive in X minutes". Obviously there's going to be a ton of enemies between you and the SAM teams, all wanting to shoot you dead.\n\nAll in all, OFDR is extremely disappointing. It has plenty of potential, as its sequel, OF:Red River showed. However, the execution is marred by timed mission triggers, impossibility of acquiring targets in the scopes, and very clunky interface, even on a gamepad.","May 8, 2013","true","44.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I bought the original retail version of this game 4 years ago, and I've played it for days.\n\nDo you like shooters? Do you like them little bit tougher and more tactical, but are you scared of ArmA's complexity and bored of Battlefield's simplicity? If you answered yes to all the questions, then I've got a game for you.\n\nOperation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, along with its slightly hotter sister Red River is basically a "revival" of sorts of the old series Operation Flashpoint. The concept stays the same since the first game. A tactical military shooter, which throws you into a big, open world and gives you goals. You can either complete them to advance the campaign/mission further, or you can just ♥♥♥♥ around in the big open world with vehicles ranging from jeeps to helicopters.\n\nGraphics are really pretty for an open-world sandbox that came out in 2009, albeit a bit brown, the shooting is solid, vehicles handle like real vehicles, albeit a little simplified, enemy AI is actually smart (I've seen enemy soldiers laying supressing fire on my squad, while the rest of them flanked us and attacked us from behind), your AI companions follow your orders well and are capable of handling themselves quite easily (seriously, for the first 30 or so minutes, you  will  depend on these guys, they saved my ♥♥♥♥ multiple times even as an experienced player) and the story is quite interesting for a military sandbox.\n\nSounds good? Because it is, but it's  not  perfect. Not at all. My first major gripe with this game is the tutorial. Or the lack of it. The game throws you into a mission without any explanation of the basic controls, and you better have Google opened on the Steam browser, because you will have to look up controls for yourself.\nThe second big problem is the artillery support the HQ can give you. It makes the game way too easy sometimes. Seriously, you can just call in a barrage 90% of the time and it will solve your issues instantly.\nThird (more of a nitpick than anything though) issue I have with this game are the aforementioned team-mates. While their AI is good, they sometimes do nothing until you give orders. Which can be a huge problem if you get downed, because the medic  will  not help you by himself sometimes.\n\nOver all, I recommend this game. It's dirt cheap, and great fun when you get used to the strange controls, harsh weapon physics and brown-ish graphics.\n\n8/10, this game along with its sis is a great sequel to a masterpiece of a game.","March 23","true","9.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The Arma franchise went foreward and Codemasters put money into other products as after a few more OFP titles they didn't make the haul in cash they were looking for- probably for the best actually, the later titles were no better then this if that.\n\nThis is almost a Battlefield meets Arma 1.5/2 engine, it still is very much like Arma or Operation Flashpoint in terms of controls, 'jankiness', try-hard realism, but some aspects of the game were made a lot arcadey, forgiving, and catering to the players action packed experiance instead of getting sniped from hard to see soldiers in fields at dusk (though thats still likely to happen in this engine).\n\nIf you do enjoy campaigns in the Arma engine, or you enjoy playing with the mission editors- Mission Editor is pretty much the same it was to Operation Flashpoint if memory serves me right-, and you have a few bucks to blow, this game can give you some more arcade like hours of fun then arma can, though for content it really is no replacement!","January 28","true","11.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Its a good mix of tactics and fun shooting gameplay never bombaring you with situations that require copmplicated orders menus.  You will die fast enough that you will never run into a firefight face first but wont have to figure out how to send your support gunner 400 m left while calling airstrikes simotaniously or some s***.\n\nthe AI can be painful at times when you order them to take cover and your man hides on the receiving fire side of the wall you looked at.  Also i found they could simply decide not to follow you on occasion which can make the game irritating.\n\nThe graphics are nice looking all considering.  The voicing is very robotic and inhuman sounding but thats no different than Arma.  The story for this game is lacking any depth and easily gets forgotten about making the game purely about killing the enemy and never about saving the day.  You are always stuck using whatever weapon was preassigned to the mission.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable, and worth the playthrough if its on sale.\n\n6/10","October 2, 2014","true","11.0"," 31 of 61 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","31","61","4","0"

Awesome... NOT!\n\n- AI? Decent, actually. But enemies are way too accurate considering ranges the fights are going.\n\n- Graphics? Good, and the game is optimized very, very nicely. That's actually the best thing.\n\nAnd here we come to conclusion: it's boring, it's relatively nice, it's boring again, and then some more boredom.\n\nAnd yeah, this is NOT Flashpoint. This is bad version of CoD that wants to be Flashpoint. Avoid.","July 20, 2014","false","0.4"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

Operation Flashpoint simply prided itself on being a hardcore simulation of infantry combat. So any follow-up, such as the new Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, has quite a legacy. Which it clearly didnt stand a chance :) Thanks to Arma well pre-Arma 3 Arma.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros\n\nBuggy\nStupid AI\nVehicle control is too arcade-like\nRealism effects such as projectile paths and damage effects\nAttention to detail (In almost every aspect)\nFirefights at range\nOutstanding visuals (For 2009 that is)\nExciting voiceover work\n\n\nCons\n\nBuggy\nStupid AI\nVehicle control is too arcade-like\nRealism effects such as projectile paths and damage effects\nAttention to detail (In almost every aspect)\nFirefights at range\nOutstanding visuals (For 2009 that is)\nExciting voiceover work\n\nAn Ending\n\nNo Pros and Cons arent in the wrong place and I was ment to copy and paste them in both sections because the bugs make this game fun but also frustrating at times.","January 9","true","16.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I have to say that for a 2009 FPS game it looks pretty good but there's no way that I would enjoy this game with so many other superior games out there. To be straight to the subjet I must mention that the graphics are absolutely terrible compared to other 2014 games and the gameplay is also horrific. The menu is really not that well designed and from a optimization point of view it's one of industry's worst, I kid you not. I had something like 40 fps on game's dafault graphics (which are also locked) and it felt really sloppy when shooting.

I started the mision, witch start's with a movie about the history, and it tells you why you're fighting. Its a good storyline. The game has many options, you can drive cars, fly planes, there are many weapens. I think this is a way cheaper Arma 3, it has a bit recoil at the guns and you see the fire from shooting in the aim. The enemy's are weak but there are much like in Call of duty. It's an open world. In my opinion it's a mix of\nCall of Duty and Arma.\n\nI realy recommend this game to everyone.

I did have a lot of fun playing with a few people online, however it seems you might have to use a VLAN to play online now.

Also i would say shooting is pretty realistic,its really hard to hit targets over 200 meters. but where this game fails,first of all AI is terrible,im stuck in mission over and over again cause i need to destroy some tanks or something else and the problem is i dont have any weapon to destroy them,but no worries you got your team,you click engage tank and thats it...NOT.. your team,if they even manage to get your command will start shooting the TANK with assault rifles,even tho you have team member that has C4 or god damn RPG.\n\nGame also fails with dificulty settings,you want realistic game well thats not gonna happen,if you choose normal dificulty,your team members will respawn after dead..so you have to choose hard,then your team doesnt respawn but guess what theres also some other changes to normal so you really have to be good with this kind of games if you want to complete game without losing your nerves. also you cannot choose your weapons,youre put to combat what ever developers wanted. Also some mission have "time limits",when you have fought youre way through all enemies they decide to send you chopper and you have to rush half way map just to kill some damn tank or it will shoot your chopper down. How ever i enjoyed this game lot,even with bad AI and other ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf you want war game that has huge area and realistic shooting,this is game for you. if you want real missions this is probably game for you. Overall its decent game with terrible AI and no more online support.\n\ni still advice you to start with the normal dificulty even if its unreal that your team respawns,otherwise you will just get stuck like me.\n\n6/10","June 22, 2014","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Maps are huge. Vehicle gameplay is pretty good I guess, I like how you can actually turn on and off the lights and engine. You can call of artillery and shout orders to your team like a maniac through radial menus. That's nice.\nYou can carry two primary weapons, one secondary, lots of other equipment, and also loot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you kill. Buildings are destructible. Missions are your typical war game missions, what would you expect? Eliminate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, blow up radars and things that pose a threat to friendly vehicles, secure a place and hold it, etc. Occasional stealth, too.\nThere's not much weapon variety, but most of them have several variants with different attachements. I guess that's something that makes up for it.\n\nStory is pretty average, but I'm OK with that.\n\nAI is stupid, as with any game. Sometimes radio lines are not heard (but show in the subtitles). Sprint speed is pretty pointless as there's barely any difference from the normal speed. Sometimes enemies take about 15 rounds (half a mag for most weapons) to take out, even at point blank. This seems to be random, as sometimes I kill enemies with a single shot on the foot. That, or I'm missing something here.\n\nIn short, not the best there is, but not that bad. It's interesting. If you like war games that are a bit more realistic than usual, you should give it a shot.\nTake into account that this is not a war simulator.","December 20, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/corumeach/recommended/12830/","corumeach","corumeach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/corumeach/","50 products in account","Yes I review a game here everyone else had played years ago and I won't state anything new here, too. I left the series after the very first OF, my computer back than was struggling with the graphics but the game left a lasting impression on me- especially the mission editor was great. I am not a multiplayer guy, online MP is to tough for me, LANs just don't happen anymore. So I am just testing and reviewing the solo player mission here.\n\nWhat can I say:\nIt is hard. Maybe I just suck, but I rarely have played a game that is so frustrating. The realism is good, although I think the ability of your team mates and your enemy differs a lot. My team rarely hits anything while the enemy snipes you from 500+ meters, whether you lie down or you run zigzag. I like the AI (they flank you when you camp or throw grenades) but all tactics on my side seem to be completely bugged or useless. Telling your team to flank or to suppress simply makes them act stupid (they advance but don't fire OR they start firing wildly but stand still). The team is great at spotting enemies, often long before I see them, but they completely fail at shooting/hitting them. Even a soldier standing still facing his rear side or non moving targets at 25m distance! Then it seems to be impossible to sneak up at someone. I tried at night, crawling through high grass towards an enemy outpost overwatching the other direction. At 25m he turned around and started firing at me. And this triggered the alarm for ALL troops in the mission area. How did he radio/set the alarm while turning around and shooting?\n\nIt is good that you cannot sneak/knife through entire missions, but the missions rely on stealth/avoiding contact or firefights. The game spils this everytime you try. It gets pretty annoying restarting missions simply because the game balancing is crap. Everytime you make a tiny mistake (although you did what was expected) combat helicopters show up and blast you to kingdom come. Or entire companies of enemies appear out of thin air and encirlce your position.\n\nI play this game on a medium laptop with just ok settings. This does not work well. Zoom and vision are pretty realistic, enemies at 200m are a handful of pixels only. This game only works well on full resolution and large monitors. You should also be able to have good to max video settings at hand, otherwise the surroundings are rendered so roughly that it is almost impossible to tell enemies from objects.\n\nThis is not an action game. In large parts it asks you to crawl/sneak through forest or brush land, avoiding being seen. You advance a few dozen meters, then check area with your binoculars. Changing weapon to binocular and back takes awfully long, though.\n\nYou can not choose weapons/equipment freely for your missions. You will often wish you could bring a sniper rifle along, but you are not allowed to. You will run out of ammo fast, especially if you don't switch to single fire always. Calling for ammo resupply does not work. Your team mates won't share a single mag with you. Looting dead enemies only works if you get to them fast. They disappear after a few moments. Usually they only carry a minimum equipment set (often their rifle has a single mag left, no spare magazines). I wonder how they can shoot at you endlessly while alive, but when they die their ammunition magically vanishes...\n\nTeammates in vehicles don't fight. They do mount the MG on a jeep while you drive, but don't expect them to use it. Regardless of commands you have given them. They are also not able to drive a vehicle while you mount the weapons... pretty much sucks.\n\nIt feels like this game was made for multiplayer and got a handful of bugged and annoying solo missions attached to it later.\n\nIt was ok for 10€ but I was pretty disappointed by it. I have to check out the editor options yet, but so far I could not find anything that compares to the easy to use and flexible editor from the original game.\n\n","December 5, 2015","false","20.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If anything it has similarity with actual combat in that it is stressful and not exactly the best choice for a recreational activity.

The first mission of the story itself isn't bad and it gives you the idea of exploring the first map for the first time to 'force recon' your way to discover secondary objectives which are simple to achieve in example 'Destroy this' and 'Destroy that'. In every way, it does sound like the ancestor of the ARMA series but that's only as far as it will be able to achieve.\n\nPassing over to the second mission, you will almost immediately face ultimate frustration as you will have realized that your AI teammates are so useless and somewhat of a burden on you that they make ARMA's AI teammates bearable because they at least know how to follow proper orders with swift and precise action. You got shot up badly into a heavily wounded state and require urgent medical aid before you bleed out? It would be a bloody miracle if one of your teammates manage to arrive to your easily approachable position that is well sheltered from gunfire because they will ALWAYS approach your position from exposed areas so they could get shot up too. Even if they arrive to you with plenty of time left before you bleed out, they will just stand there and do nothing. Really, nothing. They won't return fire against enemy units or provide medical aid to you until you either bleed out or they get wounded too. Concerning enemy AI, it's of a mixed bag. They're either very incompetent or ridiculously overpowered in different situations. Examples are when you're behind cover against some large numbers of regular infantry, despite your cover being nothing but a thin tree barely large enough to shield incoming fire, they'll constantly miss like the iconic stormtroopers in the Star Wars franchise but when you're out in the open against at most 3 'support gunners' with LMGs, they'll mow you down with lazer aimbot accuracy at ranges of 400m. Enemy AFVs are also highly overpowered as they have the same accuracy as those aimbot support gunners and the HE splashes from them will always 1-hit kill you. At certain times, you'll feel cool like some tactical operator as his team is winning in a landslide until you experience such encounters that will leave you deciding to quit the game.\n\nWeapony - Decent at best. U.S. weaponry is better to use in every way except for the problem of limited ammunition. Compared to the enemy weapons, you have the benefits of a faster rate of fire, accuracy, recoil, scopes and reload time. The only benefit of using the enemy's weapons is: Ammunition.\n\nTL;DR - HORRIBLE AI allies, Biased 'Murica Weapons, OVERPOWERED enemy AI, frustrating missions. Game is only worth at a HEAVILY DISCOUNTED price like those super 80% sales. You're better off getting ARMA, I now know the reason why the games had split into Operation Flashpoint and ARMA, because Flashpoint was nothing but a sinking fishing trawler.","October 14, 2015","false","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This can ruin a mission trust me , how many times i have wanted my team to move to a safe fire location only to have them walk straight towards the enemy having their happy little AI heads blown off straight away and seeing as how you only have 4 members at your disposal including only 1 medic if you loose them all ......yea your ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nall in all i feel that if this game got a few little changes it would be an amazing game but these things i have just listed really do make me feel the need to give this a negative review. but hey who knows with a simple update all this could change/","October 23, 2015","false","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If bohemia would only take what these guys did right arma would be unstoppable. I particularly like that your team will always seek cover, and not just stand in perfect formations.

The gameplay is fun and challenging, and the sandbox battlefield is fun to run around in. My only gripes are the A.I. and the guns.\n\nEither my team is programed to insubordinate, or they never refined the friendly AI. I find my teamates running into invisible building, not moving on command, standing around in open fire, etcetera. It's very frustrating to have your "team mates" be the death of you time, and time again. I know that you can play online co-op with friends, and all these problems would be fixed, but none of my loser steam friends play. FOR SHAME!\n\nI know this is a little bit nit picky, but for a game that boasts "an incredible realistic depiction of war with careful attention to the detail of the weapons" they should have researched how to do a reload on a M4/M16 platform! The fact that my character pulls the charging handle after every reload really bothers me. Also why can't I change my gun before my mission starts, or customized it? Having a scoped M14 varient would have so much better than my little "pew pew" M4. Have you figured out I'm a gun nut yet?\n\nI can overlook all this and still have fun. But I still find wishing for just a little more...

The first mission of the story itself isn't bad and it gives you the idea of exploring the first map for the first time to 'force recon' your way to discover secondary objectives which are simple to achieve in example 'Destroy this' and 'Destroy that'. In every way, it does sound like the ancestor of the ARMA series but that's only as far as it will be able to achieve.\n\nPassing over to the second mission, you will almost immediately face ultimate frustration as you will have realized that your AI teammates are so useless and somewhat of a burden on you that they make ARMA's AI teammates bearable because they at least know how to follow proper orders with swift and precise action. You got shot up badly into a heavily wounded state and require urgent medical aid before you bleed out? It would be a bloody miracle if one of your teammates manage to arrive to your easily approachable position that is well sheltered from gunfire because they will ALWAYS approach your position from exposed areas so they could get shot up too. Even if they arrive to you with plenty of time left before you bleed out, they will just stand there and do nothing. Really, nothing. They won't return fire against enemy units or provide medical aid to you until you either bleed out or they get wounded too. Concerning enemy AI, it's of a mixed bag. They're either very incompetent or ridiculously overpowered in different situations. Examples are when you're behind cover against some large numbers of regular infantry, despite your cover being nothing but a thin tree barely large enough to shield incoming fire, they'll constantly miss like the iconic stormtroopers in the Star Wars franchise but when you're out in the open against at most 3 'support gunners' with LMGs, they'll mow you down with lazer aimbot accuracy at ranges of 400m. Enemy AFVs are also highly overpowered as they have the same accuracy as those aimbot support gunners and the HE splashes from them will always 1-hit kill you. At certain times, you'll feel cool like some tactical operator as his team is winning in a landslide until you experience such encounters that will leave you deciding to quit the game.\n\nWeapony - Decent at best. U.S. weaponry is better to use in every way except for the problem of limited ammunition. Compared to the enemy weapons, you have the benefits of a faster rate of fire, accuracy, recoil, scopes and reload time. The only benefit of using the enemy's weapons is: Ammunition.\n\nTL;DR - HORRIBLE AI allies, Biased 'Murica Weapons, OVERPOWERED enemy AI, frustrating missions. Game is only worth at a HEAVILY DISCOUNTED price like those super 80% sales. You're better off getting ARMA, I now know the reason why the games had split into Operation Flashpoint and ARMA, because Flashpoint was nothing but a sinking fishing trawler.","October 14, 2015","false","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like ARMA or games that require strategy and actual planning instead of the now so common "run and gun" FPS games then this game is for you. BUT heres what i felt have ruined this game for me\n\n- HORRIBLE AI , you would be better off having a squad of braindead ducks at your disposal as oppose to the AI squad you command in this game as they cannot follow a simple order of "suppressing fire" or even to move to another location.\n\n- LAG SPIKES , this could just be my computer but the framerate goes from a sexy 60fps to under 20 quite often making the already difficult gameplay even harder.\n\n-SLOW MOVEMENT, ok i get that they have tried to make a game that makes you really feel that you are a fireteam leader in a heavy warzone but for the love of god , swapping guns takes AT LEAST 5 seconds which doesnt seem like alot but in this game how 1 bullet can take you out for good it makes quite the difference.\n\nUSER INTERFACE- it does take time to come to grips wiith and get a feel for the in-game "give order" feature without having to look at your keyboard for a few seconds to make sure that you are going to give them the right order wether it be fall back , suppress or even move to another location. This can ruin a mission trust me , how many times i have wanted my team to move to a safe fire location only to have them walk straight towards the enemy having their happy little AI heads blown off straight away and seeing as how you only have 4 members at your disposal including only 1 medic if you loose them all ......yea your ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nall in all i feel that if this game got a few little changes it would be an amazing game but these things i have just listed really do make me feel the need to give this a negative review. but hey who knows with a simple update all this could change/","October 23, 2015","false","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The landscapes you'll travel are absolutely massive! The firefights are difficult, the AI is... in some ways reliable. It's a great game but wait till it's at least $10. The multiplayer is horrible because there's only ONE server that's occupied and you'll be stuck sitting in a lobby for 3 hours just to start playing, get shot, and wait 4 hours for the round to end. The story is long but has a lot of bugs and can be frustrating. Give the game a chance if you really like pretending your a marine.","November 30, 2010","false","12.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","5"

Only beaten and ♥♥♥♥♥. Everything was made to be more "accessible" to casual players, but in the end it is neither for casuals nor for fans of the original game.  The graphics are average, so is the audio, the AI is dumb, the physics are terrible (tanks banging off small rocks etc), the UI is annoying, the missions are bad, and the gameplay itself is boring. There's also a health regen (like in ArmA3), which says enough. Best to stay with ArmA2 or good old Operation Flashpoint.","December 11, 2015","false","1.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

I cannot imagine how much sickeningly worse this is since it came before that one. If Battlefield 3 is a masterpiece painting, these games are stick figures drawn on used toilet paper from a taco bell bathroom on 50 cent taco Tuesdays.\nCodemasters started a new studio on the side called "Codemasters Guildford" to handle making these Flashpoint games. They sucked so bad that Codemasters shut down that side studio and went back to focusing on their racing games.

To je odlična igra za mene i uz Dragon Rising sam se dobro zabavio, unatoč činjenici da je igra pokazala neke svoje nedostatke. Taktički aspekt igre daje lijep realizam, ali članovi AI tima nisu toliko baš previše inteligentni. Gameplay je realan i zabavan za bilo kojeg ljubitelja taktičkih pucačina ili vojne simulacije, ako vam je draže to ime.\n\nIgra normalno radi na Windows Vista-i!\n\nPersonally I love this genre of games, so I downloaded a game from the Internet (torrent) 2011 (and finished in a few days with a smile) because game was not well received by critics of  fellow players and I did not want to throw my money... and I was thrilled with this game. It's an awesome game for Me and I had fun with Dragon Rising despite the fact that it showed a lack of polish. The tactical aspect of the game gives it a nice realism but the AI team members are not always that intelligent.

Enemy AI has an aimbot which allows about 150ms reaction time after coming around a corner. Enemy AI surprised from close range can and will kill two players in less than a second.\n\nAnother annoyance is the "MOVE HERE TO PROGRESS" indicators.

Did it save right before something really crappy happened towards the end of the mission?  Sorry, either load your last checkpoint or start the mission over.  FOV is awful too, feels like I'm looking at everything through a toilet paper roll.

At first i thought it might be fun, but then i was killed instantly almost every time from weapons far more innacurate than mine from a massive range. Then i experianced the horrid checkpoint system, few and far between. The waypoints dont help either, as they can ruin your side objectives. Stealth is bad, with the enamies being hawks, and sniper rifles being more inacurate than ever. The AT weapons take forever to set up with no way to stop it, and terain and off-road driving is poor. The helicopter controls are what puched me over the edge. I had decided to try and maybe finish it and then never again, but on the mission to take the navel base, it instantly kills you if you get too close to the base on the ground, so i had to take a helicopter. First i found no way to make it move easily, then it flipped over. The auto-pilot isnt auto at all, it just messes up the gyros. And the tactical view.... The team members are useless and so is commanding them. The only time i commanded them is when they just stop following me, or when they frustrate me so much I send them to commit suicide, which they do no damage while doing. Spawning is delayed, so the enamies sometimes just appear on you, even with a good PC like mine. I tend to never hate a game this much unless it's this bad. I instantly delated my campaign, and uninstalled the game and its sequel. Only FPS i've played worse then some of the CODs.","November 7, 2014","false","26.6"," 11 of 45 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","11","45","0","0"

Unfortunatley, there a few glaring problems with it. First off, the friendly AI on the campaign is terrible, never following your directions and really adding nothing important to the game. Secondly, like the first Operation Flashpoint, western weapons are SEVERELY outclassed by their communist counterparts. And thirdly, helicopter controls in this game are terrible. At least they were pilotable in the first Flashpoint, but not so much now. Overall, this game is very difficult, and indeed a bit bland, possessing no story, an extremely realistic difficulty (one shot you die) just like the original Flashpoint, and endless fields to run through, just like the original Flashpoint. The one saving grace is, if you love military shooters and you love a challenge, then this game would be perfect.  Overall Score: 7.5/10","October 18, 2012","true","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SUCKS: AI will not consistantly follow commands, and if it does follow them and decide to stick with your command it will often do the worst possible attempt at your command. Like walk up as a team to the door of a building you wish to assualt, tell them to assualt, they line up and the proceed to not go in the front door but all around it in all availbale doors. Great if there were only enemies in that one building. Heaven forbid you want your units to hold a building, shoot from windows and stay inside, nope, they are going to go outside and hide behind the one tree. Your soldiers will stand up in direct fire when holding position instead of prone or crouch. Your medic will fire instead of revive despite having cover fire or being right next to you.\n\nCant change weopens while running.\n\nPROS\n\nGraphics are decent\n\nMissions are decent\n\nPrice is right\n\nRealistic player deaths.","December 2, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original had a extensive campaign with a strong story, characters you could relate to and had you play in many different roles. As the campain progressed you would get to play as infantry, special forces, helicopter pilot and tank commander with increasing responsibillity and freedom in complex missions.\n\nIn this game you never get to play as a tank commander or pilot. There is no real story beyond "Islands have been invaded. Libirate Islands" and the characters have no personality. Missions can only really be played in one way and you are never given command over larger forces.

Its not the greatest FPS in the world. The AI is seriously lacking in some places, there's a few graphic bigs here and there (I giggled watching Chinese Riflemen suddenly fly 500 ft into the air for no reason, land on their heads then get up and start returning fire), there's sometime a big gap between checkpoints (going back and playing 30 mins or so of play about half a dozen times got a bit frustrating) and there isn't a plot to speak of. But then its a Mil-Sim. In real combat there isn't a plot other than go in, kill bad guys, secure objectives. Which I think it what I quite liked. It is just a pure tactical shoot-em-up. The squad control elements work well but take some getting used to, and its fairly unforgiving if you get shot. One shot kills are relatively common. But overall its a decent game. The multiplayer has been switched off, so didn't get a chance to try that out. But Campaign mode was entertaining enough for me to play through to the end.

Unfortunatley, there a few glaring problems with it. First off, the friendly AI on the campaign is terrible, never following your directions and really adding nothing important to the game. Secondly, like the first Operation Flashpoint, western weapons are SEVERELY outclassed by their communist counterparts. And thirdly, helicopter controls in this game are terrible. At least they were pilotable in the first Flashpoint, but not so much now. Overall, this game is very difficult, and indeed a bit bland, possessing no story, an extremely realistic difficulty (one shot you die) just like the original Flashpoint, and endless fields to run through, just like the original Flashpoint. The one saving grace is, if you love military shooters and you love a challenge, then this game would be perfect.

On one hand, it's refreshing to have a realistic military shooter that incorporates the squad command element, and it's also nice to have a break from the typical meat head CoD and Battlefield franchises; but on the other, this game just falls short in a lot of ways.\n\nThe game unpolished in terms of the mechanics, but also in terms of the animations and voice acting; none of which are individually damning by any means, but together, they make this game very difficult to enjoy.  The biggest problem though, the one thing that just kills this game for me sometimes is the AI; that stupid, clumsy, indescrete, terminally dopey AI that gives away your position, and still manages to get into combat when you've told them to hold their fire.  Seriously, I'd rather have four Elmer Fudds follow me around with pop guns, because at least then they'd just hide behind a rock or something so I could do the mission myself.\n\nThe HUD system for issuing commands is also way too complicated and insanely frustrating at times.  I know it's not realistic to be able to stop an enemy attack just so you can call in an airstrike, but it's just too clumsily executed to be anything but another major pain in the ♥♥♥.  All that aside, it is a fun game a lot of the time, and it's kept me relatively entertained.  6.5/10.","December 5, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
