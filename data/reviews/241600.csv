"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123412640/recommended/241600/","76561198123412640","Sam Lilly","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123412640/","306 products in account","I first played Rogue Legacy at a friend's place, trading off the controller at each death. It wasn't much, but it got me instantly hooked on how fun it was. So hooked, that I downloaded Steam, bought the game for the full $15, and bought a $30 wired Xbox 360 controller... and I don't even have any Xboxes. All this for this one game... and it was worth it.\n\nRogue Legacy plays like Castlevania and Super Ghouls N Ghosts. You move, jump, attack, and use a secondary weapon. The uniqueness comes into play when you die, which you will... a lot. Once you die, you will be brought to a selection of three hiers to play as next. Each one has a random character class, secondary weapon, and set of traits. Classes determine certain stats and abilities. Secondary weapons, or spells as they are called, use up MP. That's all pretty basic stuff. But the traits are very interesting. Some traits are helpful, like a speed increase. Others are harmful, like giving your attacks no enemy knockback. And some are just... well... neutral things... like making everything black and white. Your heirs have a chance of having two, one, or none of the traits at random. With all the random factors, you have to really get lucky... or pick the lesser of three evils. Is getting your prefered class worth the traits? Are the spells to your liking? It also makes you think about the next area... skills.\n\nAfter selecting your heir, you are then brought to a skill tree. You inhereit the gold of your dead relatives I guess, and you can spend it on upgrading all kinds of things, from stats, to passives, to new character classes. Do you want to build up a magic or melee character? Maybe focus on a specific class? Or do you want to play it safe and try to build up well rounded skills to work with the random factos? It's a lot to consider when purchasing points in the skill tree. And be careful. Every time you buy an upgrade in the skill tree, all of the others become more expensive. So plan accordingly. And try not to spend it all in one place because...\n\n... there's another screen. Yes, another screen where you can do even more character customization. IF you buy them in the skill tree, you can open up three different shops outside the caslte: The blacksmith, the enchantress, and the architect. The blacksmith sells you armor and swords with different stats and perks, but you'll need to find the blueprints first so he knows how to make them first... some blacksmith, eh? The enchantress does roughly the same thing. She sells you enchantment of your armor and sword after you've found the appropriate runes. The big difference is that the blacksmith's wares have weight, meaning you can only carry certain pieces until your carrying capacity improves, while the runes are weightless. It give you lots of customization options between the two and the skill tree. The architect has only one purpose. He locks down the castle. The levels are randomly generated every time enter, but if you agree to give the architect a percentage of your gold on the current life, he will lock down the previous map so that you are not lost in a random new place. This can be helpful for retrying bosses, but be warned. Enemies will be back, chests will cannot be reopened, and as mentioned your gold gain is reduced for this entire life. So consider it for saving time and getting around.\n\nLastly, at the gates of the castle, you are faced with Charon, the gatekeeper. He will allow you to enter at the cost of all of your gold. This is where a lot of the motivation is built for the game. You'll want to spend as much gold as possible between the skill tree and the shops since you'll be losing it all anyway. You can't simply keep amassing gold over a number of lives. If you want a nice, expensive upgrade, you'd better not die and keep getting that gold. It's a nice way to give death some gravity, as getting upgrades and new characters already seems like REWARDING you for dying, and that needed to be checked and balanced somehow.\n\nThe basic goal is to become strong enough to survive the four areas, beat their bosses, and then defeat the final boss. There are lots of cool extra things to find along the way, like super bosses, passive items, challenge rooms, and even some cool secrets here and there. The game CAN become grindy, and if you don't enjoy grinding, then you might get a little upset at the difficulty. However, you always have the option to not buy anything and just try to beat the challenges old school style. Nothing bars you from doing so. So it's a nice duality. The game also goes from being a platformer in the earlier stages to being more akin to a bullet hell in the later ones. Master your movements, improve your aim, and pick your battles.\n\nNo game is perfect, so I had a few complaints. My main gripe with the game, though it's not a HUGE one, is that it doesn't really give you much incentive to stay alive. There's the thrill of getting more gold to get more upgrades, but eventually you'll want to keep dying so you can actually purchase and USE the upgrades. The only reason you'll want to NOT die, aside from adding to your gold count, is to beat a boss or, in the case of the final boss, beat the game. There are a good number of different room layouts and enemy combinations within, plus the challenge rooms the pop up now and then. However, after playing for so many hours, especially if you're like me and get really grindy with it, you'll start to recognize all the room types repeating. Even though the four areas are supposed to be different, they are all pretty similar. They have the same room types with different skins, more or less. And the enemies aren't really all that different between areas. They're mostly just more powerful versions of previous enemies in the harder areas, with maybe one or two new ones added. More variety would've helped, but there's already a lot of different things to deal with that it may be too complex to have more of everything, so I understand. Also, there weren't a lot of instances of this, but a handful of times I found weird floor glitches where gold fell through and I couldn't get it. That, and every once in a while my character would fall through and start randomly appearing in all the adjacent rooms for a few seconds. Nothing game breaking nor frequent, but a little spooky when they happened. Also... the music will wear away your sanity, but then again, so will anything when you play the game as much as I have.\n\nThere are lots of customization options, lots of random elements, lots of strategy involved, lots of skill required... and lots of hours of playtime and replayability in this game. I got 96 hours in my first playthrough. I love Rogue Legacy. The gameplay, the music, the sound, the graphics... everything comes together to make a game that feels like it was made for ME. It's the first time since Banjo-Kazooie that a game has felt like it was made just for me. It's an amazing feeling, and I can't recommend this game enough. Easily my favorite game on Steam and has instantly worked its way into being one of my favorite games of all time. I'd really say to just buy it now. Sure, you can wait for a sale if you're skeptical... or cheap. But it's definitely worth the $15 price tag. I mean, I ended up esentially putting down $45 to play this game, and it was well worth it.\n\n10/10 Would complete entire skill tree again\n(And yes, I seriously did that. How else do you think I got 96 hours in one playthrough?)","November 2, 2014","true","146.9"," 484 of 511 people (95%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","95","484","511","19","16"

You'll die a lot. But you'll never have to start over. While doing a run through the castle you'll earn money. This money can be used if you die to upgrade your skills, unlock classes and buy gear. You'll then start as a new character with these specific upgrades. Every time you upgrade a skill you'll also level up; killing enemies won't earn you experience, only money and items. It keeps the game fresh and gives you incentive to collect as much money as you can before dying. However, every time you start a new game the layout of the castle resets (ie, the castle is randomized). Later on, you'll be able to keep the current layout, thanks to the Architect. You'll have to unlock him first though.\n\nYou have to beat 4 bosses before you can defeat the final boss. Depending on your skills these bosses range from fairly easy to incredibly hard. Selecting and upgrading specific skills is really important here.\n\nThe layout of the castle isn't big. If you're properly equipped you'll be able to speedrun through it within 30 minutes. But you'll hardly ever make it out alive. In fact, it's so tough and challenging that it should take most of us gamers 15-20 hours to complete. Yup, for a small game like that that's looooong.\n\nLike a few other games out there Rogue Legacy will never frustrate and will always be fun to play. I sincerely hope that they'll make a sequel.\n\nThere's definitely room for improvement and more features, and as negative as that may sound, it's meant in the most positive way possible.\n\nAwesome, awesome game !\n\n[Rating: 87/100]","July 5, 2013","true","26.2"," 266 of 293 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","266","293","0","2"

It invokes a certain level of nostalgia while still being able to feel modern. In the game, dying is permanent. But your current character passes down his fortune and stats to an heir when he dies. That heir then picks up where their mother/father left off. And just like in life, your characters have traits; some whacky like Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Vertigo, while others require serious skill like Giantism and Anorexia. The controls are a bit tricky with mouse and keyboard. Personally I recommend to use a PNP 360 controller.

Yes there are some similarities, "Rogue" in the name, you have only one life at each play, and a bit randomization.\n\nThere are also many features of this game which makes it not a roguelike.\na)\nIt lacks proper RPG gameplay, since each class has only two upgrades and these upgrades are for between playthroughs not included in them. so you get stronger each time you die, but your strength is constant for only one gameplay time.\nb)\nBosses are predefined. Some memorization or... grinding is required for a usual player. Reflexes do matter, also your grinding time. Mostly, your strategy does not.\nc)\nYes, there is grinding. SInce there is persistance between lives. The game also gets harder by your newly bought upgrades, but it scales a bit slower, so yeah you are expected to grind as hell.\nd)\nsince I already said that ur strength wont increase between two deaths, after getting enough "level"s rushing through bosses is a viable strategy. Think about average roguelike and you will see that calling this game a roguelike just because it is hard, semirandomized is stupid.\ne)\nApart from looping with ever getting harder enemies, this game has a goal. So you can finish it. By finishing I am also meaning, being done with it, in like 20 hours or so. Yeah there is replayability, but you will be grinding the same stats all over again.\n\n2) Saying this is not a roguelike is not a negative criticism like many thinks, just a categorization.\n\nIt is a nice game, I enjoyed playing it, and finishing it. Mechanics are weird, most are solid. I had my fun. For me Barbarian and Shinobi seemed much more stronger than the others but I guess they are actually balanced. Music were quite nice, atmosphere is also nice. Not many are on with me with this I guess, but writing in Prince's Journal was quite high quality material, and one of the strongest aspects for me. I kept playing until I see the end of the journal, and slowed down afterwards. There are some unique mechanisms like Architect, and insanity in the fiber of the Castle is really well thought.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/241600/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","Rogue Legacy is a 2D platforming action game by Cellar Door Games, an independent Canadian studio.  It’s categorized as a roguelike, which for the uninitiated, is a sub-genre that typically includes procedurally generated levels and permanent death (meaning once you die, you start over from the beginning).  Rogue Legacy has both of those, but it adds in some RPG mechanics which make the imposing threat of death easier to swallow, while not altogether curbing the difficulty that fans of the genre have come to expect.\n\nAt the beginning of Rogue Legacy, you are a generic sword-wielding hero who is tasked to fight through a dungeon.  There’s some reason for doing so, and there are diaries strewn about the world to help piece together exactly what’s going on, but for the most part the narrative is in the back seat throughout Rogue Legacy and that’s totally fine.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate just how much fun the minute to minute gameplay is in Rogue Legacy. Controls feel tight and the mechanics are all-around solid and enjoyable.  Any fan of 2D platformers such as Spelunky will find themselves at home here.  The dungeon is split into four separate areas, and while they are distinct in aesthetic and difficulty, they do tend to blend together after ten or twenty hours in the game.\n\nThe main distinguishing factor of Rogue Legacy is the way in which death, and subsequent life after death, occurs.   Upon dying (which will happen -- a lot), you get to choose a new “heir” among three choices to attempt another run through the game.  Each heir can have all sorts of randomly assigned genetic traits which affect how the game plays.  Discovering the novelty of some of these traits is fun in and of itself, so I won’t ruin them here, but I will say the traits are pretty well balanced, creative, and occasionally good for a laugh.\n\nThe other unique aspect of death is that your character continually gets stronger in whatever way you choose.  As you traipse throughout the dungeon, your character collects gold from chests and enemies.  You can invest gold after dying in a huge amount of ways; you can boost stats such as strength and armor, unlock new classes, or buy new equipment.  It’s almost impossible to beat the game during the early hours because of the upgrade system, and how weak your initial character is.  Having to rely on more than sheer skill may be a problem for some, but the feeling of progression through boosting your inherent power is pretty satisfying (as in most RPGs) and makes the whole experience very addicting.\n\nToward the end of Legacy, when your character is strong enough to make it most of the way through the dungeon before dying, each run can take about 30 minutes or more, and I found it becomes a bit of a grind.  Luckily the grind doesn’t last too long (at least it didn’t for me) before you become powerful enough to beat the final boss and finish the dungeon.  There is a nicely done New Game+ option, and it’s a telling sign that I immediately dove back in upon completion my first time around.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time with Rogue Legacy.  The RPG mechanics do an excellent (or evil, depending on how you look at it) job of cranking up the “Just one more run” factor that roguelikes are infamous for.  Blending rewarding and difficult gameplay with a really smart way to make death a little less punishing goes a long way to make Rogue Legacy one of the best games in the genre.","November 10, 2014","true","16.3"," 61 of 72 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","61","72","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/241600/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","If nothing else, Rogue Legacy gets points for having probably the best setup for a roguelike possible. You hail from a long line of adventurers, delving into the ever-shifting halls of a forgotten castle, and when you die, you take on the role of one of your children, random class and quirks and all. The story fully utilizes this setup as well, which is really cool when (if) you reach the end and see how it all ties together. It would be a shame if that hook was wasted, but luckily the game is a pretty solid platformer and roguelike to boot.\n\nBefore each run, you get the option to upgrade your manor, buy new gear and enchantments, and lock down the castle. The first two should be obvious, allowing you to customize and upgrade your heroes through the unfortunate generations. The third lets you enter the same castle layout as your last hero did, at the cost of most of their gold. It's an interesting feature that's not common among roguelikes, adding a layer of strategy that gives you a better shot at finding specific upgrades or reaching bosses at the cost of your other treasures.\n\nThe actual platforming inside the procedurally-generated castle is probably the weakest part of the game, but by no means bad. The tradeoff for randomization seems to be very simple room layouts, mostly spruced up by liberal application of breakables and traps. There are special challenge rooms, miniboss rooms, and stranger secret rooms to find as well which help keep exploration fresh. However, the game can be pretty aggressive about murdering you with its elaborate traps and vicious enemies. Each of the four wings of the castle has a general difficulty level, but it can be hard to tell where exactly you fit at the moment, especially if the place has not been kind with upgrades. My first dozen generations passed without finding a new sword, for example.\n\nThere's a certain attitude to the game, as well. NPCs enjoy berating you for failing at nigh-impossible tasks, and challenge rooms will happily trick you into failing them with cheekily-placed monsters and spikes. It feels like a very mean game at times, especially if you're not doing well. But if you stick with it, learn to synergize your gear with your class, and grab all the treasure you can, it'll end up being one of the more rewarding games to complete.","December 14, 2015","true","9.5"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","43","49","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LumpyJumbo/recommended/241600/","LumpyJumbo","Lumpy Jumbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LumpyJumbo/","66 products in account","This is an amazing roguelike game!\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou start off with a very basic character and challenge a castle filled with many monsters. Your goal will be to plunder as much gold and equipment as possible before you die. Dying is inevitable and a recurring feature of this game. The catch is that the gold you collect will be passed down to one of three children to choose from. They can have different classes and different traits. Traits can either be good, bad, funny or obnoxious. I won't be spoiling them. So, your bounty gets passed down and now you get to spend your money on a skill tree. From there you can unlock new features such as the smithy, from which you can buy equipment from. Equipment is important as it is a quick and cheap way to raise stats such as armor, health, mana and strength. However, these stats can be upgraded on your skill tree as well. As you play through the game, you will proggressively get more and more gold, getting better and better characters with which you can delve deeper into the castle and, perhaps, complete the game. If you aren't into difficult games with permadeath, this might not be the game for you, even though this game has very forgiving and enjoyable deaths. You won't mind dying as much as with other games. Definitely a fun and unique experience.\n\nVisuals:\n\nA lot of people would say that graphics are very important and, as such, this game isn't very appealing. I am not one of those people. Although the visuals are an important element to games, the deciding facor for me has been gameplay. Nonetheless, I would say that, despite its graphic limitations, this game looks incredible. The artstyle is fun and simple, yet beautiful and charming. It kind of gives off a retro aura that I really enjoy. It doesn't matter that it isn't realistic, that's not what the game is going for. I would say it's very well made.\n\nMusic:\n\nFinally, the music! I must confess, when I loaded up the game, I heard a very beautiful song playing. It kind of mixed electronic sounds with orchestral instruments in a way I had never heard before. As silly as it may seem, I didn't realize it was the game. I thought it was from a video I had been watching or something. But I was wrong. So amazingly wrong. As stupid of an assumption as it is, I never expected an indie game to have such beautiful music in it. A lot of work and effort were obviously put into it. So yeah, I really enjoyed the entire soundtrack. It's very unique and amazing.\n\nStory:\n\nAt first, the story isn't very apparent but it gets very interesting as you discover more. Note that there are a bunch of references to the history surrounding the fountain of youth. It's pretty cool.\n\nControls:\n\nI have not had the opportunity to play this game with a controller yet, but yes, it does have full controller support. Regardless, the keyboard controls work pretty much perfect for me. They're responsive too. Overall, I just think there's no problem with them, there's not much else I can say.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis is, in my opinion, one of the best Steam games out there. I bought it less than 2 weeks ago and I've played over 50 hours! I'm completely hooked. It is astounding. For the amount of enjoyment you'll get out of it, 14 euros is a complete steal. If you're interested, go buy this game. It's worth it.","December 13, 2013","true","80.6"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","37","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004885007/recommended/241600/","76561198004885007","AxemJinx","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004885007/","663 products in account","I wouldn't call this a bad game, but in the end, it feels too grindy to me, and often feels more like an RPG hybrid than a roguelike hybrid. I'll try to break down this impression across a few different points, and use The Binding of Isaac (BoI) as a foil to help elaborate.\n\nFirst off, something you should understand is that pretty much all character progression happens in between sessions, not during them. Every item you find has to be purchased after you die, so apart from health and mana, pretty much nothing you come across in a given session is going to be immediately useful. Contrast this with BoI, in which every item you pick up either activates instantly or goes into a slot for manual use. In its first few hours, Rogue Legacy (RL) has constantly given me the impression that I simply won't have any success until I build up enough gold to purchase useful gear- and that's assuming I even find the gear in the castle to begin with. (99% of gear can't be purchased until you find it in the castle first).\n\nMoreover, re-entering the castle costs you all of your gold. You can reduce this to 50% by upgrading a particular stat, but doing so will cost lots of gold that you probably won't be able to accumulate for at least the first several hours. In addition, upgrading one stat increases the prices for every stat across the board. So, you'll be in situations where you have a bad run, but you still want to spend the small sum of gold you collected on something before starting the next session. The problem is, doing that will make it harder to get the upgrades you really want in the long run, so overall, having a bad run really makes you feel like you wasted your time, even if it was only a few minutes' worth.\n\nIn BoI, you didn't have to worry about shops all that much; they could give you a helpful boost, but you could do fine without them for the most part. RL, on the other hand, wholly revolves around the concept of a shop; you can't really accomplish anything significant without going through it first. As I mentioned before, every upgrade has to be purchased- everything. Some of the stats can be upgraded 25 or 50 times, though you probably wouldn't want to target those first because of the constant price increases. I think I would have enjoyed RL a lot more if the creators removed some of the minutiae from the early game. As it stands, I don't think it respects my time.\n\nFinally, something to keep in mind is that the enemies' levels are scaled up according to which of the four major areas you're in. Not only do they take more hits to kill with the same equipment, but their attack patterns (often projectile-based) become more complex as well. Until you accumulate better gear and really learn the enemies through death after death, you're probably going to be spending most of your early game in the same two first areas over and over again, unless you're okay with repeatedly ramming against a difficulty wall. In BoI you did have to learn enemy patterns, but if you were able to learn them quickly, then the game wouldn't hold you back from claiming victory. It nearly always provided you with something useful along the way, thanks to its diverse item pool- most of which you didn't have to buy in shops, mind.\n\nIf none of the above points concern you, feel free to ignore this review. I just want to caution people against impulsively buying roguelike hybrids just because one particular title was a lot of fun for them (which is what I have done, regrettably). In my experience, these kinds of games vary significantly, and often you really have to take a closer look before committing to them.","December 21, 2013","false","11.6"," 536 of 850 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","536","850","4","38"

Each death does indeed end your run, but then you get to continue as one of your descendants, able to spend all the gold earned by your unfortunate ancestor on equipment, runes and the expansion of the family's manor, which is basically a gigantic tree of permanent upgrades that will help subsequent playthroughs.\n\nAny boost will be very welcome, as you start off very weak. Working your way through the randomly generated castle and its three surrounding areas will be a painful journey at first, but it will get more and more rewarding and satisfying as you crawl further and further with each run. You might even be so fortunate as to end up slaying one of the four bosses, whose spirits seal off a mysterious room!\n\nThe second stroke of genius is the way your descendant's abilities are defined not only by their class (barbarian, mage, paladin, etc.) but also a gazillion of unique traits, which might provide benefits or be hugely detrimental. Your chosen hero might have A.D.H.D. and gain a speed boost, while also being near-sighted making everything far away blurry. His/her hypochondriasis may well result in hilariously exaggerated reactions to any damage taken, not to mention a number of purely cosmetic or anecdotical traits such as baldness or same-sex attraction. You only get a choice between three random heirs on every playthrough, meaning you'll likely end up having to work and compromise with most of these characteristics at one point or another.\n\nWith all these twists that keep every playthrough refreshing as well as the sense of progress and accomplishing things in the bigger perspective of your heirloom as a whole, Rogue Legacy is as charming as it is oddly addictive. Although the final few achievements may require a bit of grinding, it also has a bit in store for the hardcore gamers with five vicious secret bosses and the option to advance into ever-harder "New Game +" modes everytime you complete the game. I'd say it's worth at least a good 40 hours if you want to accomplish everything, and you'll more than likely keep playing the occasional run after that just for the hell of it.\n\nYou are a fan of the man/10","May 8","true","46.9"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","6"

The overall concept of the game is that you must spawn various heroes to grind your way up to defeat various bosses in order to complete the game. This is one of the weaker points of the game in a way however. If you do not like repetivity then stay away as for the first 20-ish lives (depending on how good you are and how much gold you get) especially, you will constantly loop through the first area just learning the mechanics and enemy types and also trying to defeat the first boss. I have to admit it was a little frustrating and I could only manage like 5 runs before needing a break. It's not all bad though, as when you die you keep any gold you rustled up and that is then used to upgrade your castle (It's an upgrade system that unlocks more as it grows, like a skill tree) You can increase stats such as health, mana, damage and even unlock new class's for your future heroes as well as giving them extra abilities. There's a fair amount of upgrades to choose from so you can tailor it to your personal preference for the most part.\n\nOkay, so let's talk mechanics and gameplay (a bit more in depth) So, as already prefaced, Rogue Legacy has you enter a randomly generated dungeon to face off against various enemies and bosses. The combat is quite simplistic and yet a bit difficult to master, especially downward attacks in my own experience. (This is with a keyboard by the way) Much like the controls themselves it's somewhat tight and has a nice feel to it. You are also given a spell and a class ability to play with which vary in strength and usefulness. The spells are selected at random at the start so this can be a factor which makes you pick Lady Chun Lii III (this game also has references) The Barbarian Queen over Sir Charles the Assassin. The spells are more-so a personal preference of what each person likes and also what you intend on doing with that character as some enemies and bosses are easier to fight with certain classes and spells. Another Mechanic which I have yet to talk about with the Legacy feature is that the characters each have traits, some of these effect the game visually, others gameplay-wise and some just comical. You can have a Giant, a Dwarf, a skinny person, someone who is colour-blind, someone who is permanently roided and the list goes on. Some of these have little effects such as IBS which just makes the character do fart sounds when jumping or dashing. Other traits such as Dwarfism allow for you to get into secret areas for free loot and other little shortcuts. This brings me to another element of the game which is Blueprints and Runes. As you explore the Dungeon you will encounter many a chest, these contain, gold or blueprints with special chests containing stat boosts and Runes. Any blueprint you pick up allows you to craft some new armor and any rune you pick up grants you the ability to add an ability to your character. The Rune Chests come with a price however as you must find them hidden in certain locations or you must complete challenges. Some of these are easier than others. There a many varying abilities which can be stacked to become more powerful, this further adds to that personal customization to play in a way that suits you.\n\nTime for Graphics, Sound and Aesthetics. As you can see from the screenshots and trailer up above, the game does not boast any amazing graphical fidelity, it is quite basic. The Aesthetic however is rather quite pleasing to the eye and has a rather Paper Mario feel to it. When the sprites turn around they flip sides.  It's a nice little nod and it looks quite neat. The designs on the enemies and locations are all pleasant to look at and you can usually tell an enemy from the background (There are enemies that are paintings which can catch you off guard if you don't notice them shaking). The sound design for most of these areas is awesome and is definitely one of the top points of this game. Each piece fits it's location and is enjoyable to listen to. The sound effects of taking damage, dashing etc are well suited and feel right.\n\nI know I have yet to mention it but there is also a story behind Rogue Legacy. I'm not going to spoil it but basically there's an adventurer much like yourself, who's traversing the dungeon. As he goes about, he leaves journal entries behind which allows you to read his story and gives you hints on where to go and such. It's a nice way to add a story to the game which isn't entirely necessary. Also, this guy who's leaving these journals must be pretty good at the game as he goes through the entire thing without dying which is literally impossible for the player. Throughout the game there are also paintings that the devs have left of their previous games with some insight into them. It's a quiant touch that is interesting to read if you are interested,\n\nSo that's Rogue Legacy, I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy Rogue-Likes, Dungeon Crawlers or MetroidVanias as this game is a mash of the three. It's a fun 10 hour + raunch through a trap filled, enemy infested loot dungeon that will have you dying for more.","April 4, 2015","true","14.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","17","18","4","1"

The platforming actually is rather good (with a tendency to use too many spikes for my taste) as is the funny genealogical system. But the major sticking point is the permanent STATS progression. At first it sounded great, you get the blood rush of permadeath with something to carry over! Unfortunately it means that initially you can't get very far without being completely destroyed, and that later on the early parts of the dungeons will likely be no-challenge pieces of cake (can't tell if they put mechanics in place to prevent this, didn't get that far with the unlocks).\n\nAlso, unless you're the absolute god of platformers you'll sooner or later hit a progression slowdown where you just can't get a run that's profitable enough to unlock anything.\n\nI think the lesson from this, and I'm gonna repeat it in every rogue-lite review I do, is that permanently unlocking new alternate classes and new stuff that gets fed to the random generator for a run is great, but permanent stat progression just doesn't work in a roguelike, it makes it GRINDY.","November 13, 2014","false","46.9"," 101 of 172 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","101","172","4","0"

While the randomized progeny do add some variety to the game, generally it is in the form of either amusement or frustration, rarely strategy. The metroidvania platforming style calls for skilled manuvering, but bizarre hitboxes and sluggish controls will interfere with your mastery more than the difficulty of the enemies themselves. Each area of the game feels the same as the last, sometimes even generating identical rooms with a different coat of paint. Even the enemy challenges presented in more advanced areas are merely faster, more projectile-y versions of their smaller-sprited counterparts. Rogue Legacy will certainly entertain for a short time, but eventually the monotony of raiding the castle and dumping your gold into various stat-sinks will start to feel like more of a chore than a diversion.\n\nRogue Legacy is perfect if your gaming appetite is sated by spending twenty minutes saving up enough gold to raise a single stat, then dying and playing the same areas over again with a slightly different character. In other words, this game is built for players who have the patience to endure the least pleasant aspects of the procedurally-generated platforming roguelike. For everyone else, I recommend you divert your attention elsewhere.","February 13, 2014","false","20.3"," 36 of 55 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","36","55","0","1"

Is it really a rogue like ??? oh sure, in a sense... I mean there is no real save and you restart your adventures in a procedurally created dungeon every time... on the other hand not really because you actually do improve each time over and thats a fundamental no-no for rogue likes....\n\nAt the end of the day its a hybrid, that will appeal more to non rogue-like fanatics, rather than the true fans of that genre.\n\nThe thing is that if you look past all that, its a truly fast paced, fun-filled plat-former that will make you swear, cry and smile every-time you give it a go and believe me you will give it a go and another and another and so on... its so compelling to just try to do a bit better each time.\n\nThe main concept of the game is that each time you die you can start over with one of your descendants all of whom carry over the abilities of their ancestors (and their flaws). So you gather money with each run and but abilities and equipment and each generation is a bit stronger - mind you you cant keep your gold (or at least most of it) between runs, since you need pay death each time you enter the dungeon (except in cases where you have found a special item that you turn on instead of gold).\n\nA similarity to rogue like games is that it starts out very hard and that will frustrate most players (but you will come back for more). However as you progress and improve it becomes easier and I must say (this is one of my grievances with it) after a point it becomes, perhaps too easy.\n\nThe bosses are somewhat easy (with the exception of the four special bosses that are insanely hard - but those are not necessary to finish the game) and each new play-through increases the difficult (ala Dark Souls New Game +1 ect).\n\nOne thing that ticked me off, which becomes apparent when you master it, is that it is actually short and it really makes you yearn for more.... perhaps with some expansion or dlc but you would like to do more much more (and this is another point where it differs dramatically with true rogue-likes).\n\nThe graphics are pix-elated but beautiful and the retro style suits it so well, the music can get a tad annoying at times but then again its very reminiscent of 8-bit era game music.\n\nOverall I have to say I loved the game and I truly wish it had more to offer, but it doesn't. Is it worth playing in spite of that ? Hell yes - its so much fun....\n\nBut after 5 play-throughs and all achievements equipment the only thing left was the special bosses. I did spent the time to kill one of them but its for the true hardcores... perhaps I may go back and try them again for the achievements alone, but at this stage there isn't a lot of re-playability.\n\nAgain, regardless of any shortcoming I described, its so much fun and totally worth it (which is why its a bit disappointing at the end).","December 8, 2015","true","56.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

This is my favorite game of 2013.\n\nEverytime you die, you can choose between 3 randomized children and you get to keep your unlocked weapons, armors and skills. You can find rare chests which contain permanent boosts to your character and the monster difficulty scales based on your level. There are 10+ big bosses to beat and a vast amount of enemies.\n\nI cannot explain how good this game is! It is cheap, addictive and great in all aspects! 41 hours in, I have completed the game and new game+ once. It was well worth playing and I had alot of fun! Lasted longer than most games I've played. Keep in mind that with the infinite new game+ and ranodmly generated levels, it wouldn't surprise me that you would play the game for longer than I did! If you haven't played it yet and are not sure if you should, you can check my personal score below.\n\nCategory        Rating /10        Details                Gameplay        9.2        A pure hardcore roguelike action platformer (for those who are not familiar with the term roguelike, it means that the levels are randomized and death is permanent, even though you keep your upgrades and gear in Rogue Legacy). Very hard to master, stiff controls (which fits the genre of Nintendo-era games, execpt for "Down-attack" which is just weird in my opinion), lots of weapon, armors and runes to unlock. You have a full skill-tree you can eventually max-out if you gather enough gold! The game is not frustrating because whenever you die, as long as you gathered enough gold or found +Stats bonus from chests, your character gets stronger. Keep in mind that monsters scales too! Multiple save-files and new game+ (infinite amount of ng+ and new gear for those who can succeed in ng+)! The game could have more monster variety, but for an indie game it's just fine!                Graphics        8.8        Retro graphics that you will just fall in love with! In Rogue Legacy you will find funny, yet beautiful, 2d art with well-done animations that goes perfectly with the style of the game. The UI and menus are simplistic but gives you just enough information, fits with the rest of the art and looks fine overall. Plus, there's plenty of different visual effects you will discover based on your character traits.                Atmosphere        9.5        The soundtrack of Rogue Legacy is EPIC! It is definately one of the best soundtrack I have listened to in my entire gaming career. The sound effects are very satisfying to listen to and they're unique to the game. Your character attacks have a wide bank of sound, so they are not repetitive and they don't get boring to listen to. Rogue Legacy doesn't feature any voiced dialogues, so there is no voice acting for this game.                Performance        9.5        I have noticed barely any bugs while playing through the game. Nothing annoying, just very few glitches, like being able to move during some boss cutscenes (which might be fixed). Also, another thing I need to point out is that in my 41 hours playing this game, I have not crashed a single time, which is great. The game runs totally smooth, I have never experienced any fps drops.                Story        7.5        While the story is not bad, it's really short and litterally only a few pages of text left by Johannes and some boss dialogues. I'm surprised such a wonderful game has got such a simple story. As I said previously, it's not a bad story, just very confusing. As far as the NPCs goes, they don't really have dialogues and there's not many of them, but those dialogues are fine. Honestly, it's an amazing game and the story doesn't really matter in this case, because the gameplay, graphics and sounds are all fantastic!                Singleplayer        9.0        Since Rogue Legacy only offers singleplayer, this will be a resume of my review. Rogue Legacy has a fantastic singleplayer experience, it is totally addicting, it has tons of replayability and it is challenging. Definately a game to try if you are a fan of hard games and like 2d action platformers! There's items to farm, a huge skill-tree to unlock and level-up your stats and skills and unlimited randomly generated levels. Rogue Legacy also features unique boss mechanics, challenge rooms and secrets to uncover                Multiplayer        --        This game features no co-op or multiplayer.                Playtime        9.0        Rogue Legacy takes a good 20 to 40 hours to complete depending on if you want to simply kill the last boss or complete ng+, collect all items, collect all runes, etc... Overall, you will probably spend around 40 hours playing Rogue Legacy, which is huge for a singleplayer indie game. As for the replayability, don't even worry! Multiple save-files, random traits, randomly generated levels, infinite new game+... You will have to play for a while before getting bored of the game!                Prices        9.0        Rogue Legacy is totally worth the asking price of US$14.99 (As of late 2014), as it doesn't have any DLCs or microtransactions, it's developped by indie developpers and it's just a great game overall.                Steam Features        8.0        While Rogue Legacy doesn't have Steam Workshop and is lacking a few Steam features, it does have the most important ones. The achievements are pretty good (and some are quite difficult, because most bosses are difficult anyways) and the game has Trading Cards. The game also features full controller support, which is always a great thing to have in a retro game!                Game Score        9.0\nInformation        Time        Details                Time required to complete the game.        ~16 hours.        Reaching and killing the main boss.

The combat is fast-paced, you can upgrade your character however you want, and the character descendants are often humorous.\n\nBut after a few hours, it gets *extremely* repetetive. The game's hook is that you will die, and you WILL indeed die A LOT. I thought games had evolved past the 3-decade old idiocy of being "touched" by anything hurts you, but apparently this game didn't get the memo. Often you are surrounded by half a dozen monsters, which means dozens of projectiles flying at you and even more chances to get "touched" by monsters. Ranged attacks would help greatly but mana is so limited for even the most basic of ranged attacks that you can't rely on it. So you're forced to melee most of the time against projectiles flying all over the screen. It makes for a very frustrating experience. So you die. And then die some more.\n\nDying often could be forgiveable if you're progressing. However, in this game, you are literally playing the same level over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It gets old fast. The only way to progress is to grind the same level repeatedly for gold, while memorizing enemies. But with limited HP and each hit taking so much HP away, not to mention the annoyance of accidental "touches" as described previously, you'll die often no matter what you do.\n\nThe upgrade system seemed really great at first, but every time you upgrade your character the price of all other upgrades increases. Essentially the carrot in front of your nose is being moved farther and farther every time.\n\nNot only that, but every time you die, you have to give up all your gold before restarting the level. So you have 1000 gold and spend 500 on an upgrade, with the next cheapest upgrade at 510? Too bad, you have to completely waste the rest. Idiotic beyond belief. After a while, all the upgrades become so expensive that if you don't farm thousands of gold before an accidental death, you have to give it all up and you just made 0 progress. After a few hours, the game expects you to play perfectly, or you won't progress at all.\n\nI was indeed getting really good at the end of my play time and really memorizing all the enemies and how they moved. But then I took a step back and realized that I wasn't having fun any more. Because of the extreme repetition in this game and the frustrating nature of combat, I would certainly give this game a DO NOT BUY. I bought this on sale for $2.99 and wish I could get my money back.","November 15, 2014","false","2.9"," 85 of 147 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","85","147","4","8"

Other than the fact combat is real-time, most of the elements of a roguelike are present.\n\nThe most notable feature of the game is that, although death is final, you never truly start from scratch when you die. Currency is carried over to your heir and you can use it to permanently unlock classes, perks and stat increases before each trip into the dungeon.  Additionally, you will find equipment blueprints and enchantment runes on your adventures and may pay to equip these at the blacksmith and enchanter, respectively.  An architect offers you the option of locking the dungeon design down for future generations, rather than having it randomly generated with each visit.\n\nEach time you die you must select from three heirs to use as your next character.  Their classes are randomly drawn from the pool of classes you’ve unlocked, and each will also have one or two genetic traits which positively or negatively affect your playthrough.  These can be anything from color blindness to obsessive compulsive disorder to irritable bowel syndrome.  The devs attempted to make these conditions and disorders humorous with awkward results, but it’s a very small part of the game that’s easily overlooked.\n\nRogue Legacy is appropriately difficult for the genre and gets harder with each new game+, where enemies and their projectiles increase in size and density.  Players can expect some grinding regardless of their skill level.  Gamepad is fully supported and it will take most people several completions and 20-30 hours to 100% the game and achievements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/241600/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Rogue Legacy is the sort of modern retro classic that dreams are made of.\n\nEntering the looming castle, unaware what awakes you inside, it quickly becomes apparent that this is not the simple 16-bit platformer it first appears. It cleverly blends genres, from roguelikes to RPGs to traditional platformers and bullet hell shooters, into a consistent and dangerously addictive blend of beautiful originality that feels fresh yet instantly familiar. It's also constantly and abundantly rewarding, making sure your many, many deaths feel worthwhile instead of frustrating as you continually rush back into the castle hoping this run will bring greater victories.\n\nThe concept is deceptively simple. You are the descendant of a dying king, embarking on a quest to find what lays inside this castle that will allegedly cure the king. But within moments you are struck down long before you can make it anywhere near the deepest layers of the castle. Thankfully you were rather, ahem, "friendly" in your life and know it's up to your incredibly large number of offspring to take up the sword in your place.\n\nThis then leads into RL's broad progression system, which incorporates a level of randomness while also allowing you to level your hero to better confront the monsters within the castle. No two children are ever the same, with each being a random combination of a huge amount of classes, traits, and special items they can use. For instance you could be a giant colorblind mage, or an ectomorphic shinobi that gets sent flying with every hit. It's a tad disappointing that some of the traits are merely for laughs (for instance one that causes you to pass gas with every jump), but there are enough that drastically alter the gameplay for it to be considered a success that plays largely into how you intend to approach a given run.\n\nThese runs are what I love most about RL, because they take the most compelling elements of roguelikes (such as randomized level designs), and combines them with a more approachable leveling system and patterns that can be learned and mastered. Although you lose all your gold each time you enter the castle (at least at first), what you manage to attain can then be used to buy better gear, equip skill runes, or level your skills and unlock more classes. This leverages the difficulty away from impossibly hardcore, into something far less daunting. I constantly like like I was making progress even when I died, and it's this constant drive that makes finally overcoming a particularly challenging boss or section so satisfying. Overcoming RL's obstacles was easily some of the most rewarding moments I've ever had while playing a game, and finally beating it felt like the epic accomplishment it ought to have.\n\nDon't take this to mean RL is an easy game, because rest assure you will get pounded into the dirt more times than you can count. But it's not an insurmountable challenge, and it's in this that I feel it most succeeds at turning hardcore design philosophies into something everyone can enjoy. It makes the difficulty something you can realistically see yourself beating if you just try one more time; upgrade one more stat; find one more blueprint. It's the best sort of "hard" game that knows when to reward you and when to hold you up, only long enough to keep the hunger for victory ever present and relief just out of reach.\n\nEven though I've conquered the castle, beaten the bosses, and discovered what lays within I don't see myself putting Rogue Legacy down anytime soon, and that more than anything is what sets it apart as a brilliant experience that I want to play over and over again. Every element of its design is polished to a glorious sheen, glued together by it's fantastic artwork and mind blowing soundtrack, and it's relentless attempts to empower you while always leaving you something more to accomplish. Everything about it is just freaking rad, and hopefully you realized that already and are now  metaphorically running to pick it up.","September 11, 2014","true","22.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Most rogue like games have perma death. Where if you lose thats it, its done you start from the beginning. Personally I did not like the idea of perma death in my games. I like to feel like I am working towards something and not losing everything just to try to do it again. With this said, many people who like rogue like games will disagree whole heartily with my decision and I understand that. Well with this game people get a little bit of both worlds.\n\nThis game has perma death and progression. Each character that goes into that death trap of a castle will eventually die but his or her's gold will be sent to their child where he or she can spend it on upgrades to their castle (that supplies skills, armory, stats etc) and to buy armor, accessories and even lock the previous dungeon so you can attempt it again. Then that child will die and send it's money to the next child and so on. So people get their perma death and progression all in one.\n\nThe gameplay is fun with platformer elements to it as well as rpg. Its a 2d side scroller where you go around in a randomly generated dungeon looting for gold, trying to survive and fighting bosses. Thanks to the option to lock the previous dungeon you can keep retrying the bosses again and again, without searching for the boss door. Which is nice because the bosses can be extremely hard if your not prepared. Also the dungeon itself is hard as well and you will find that it will take many attempts before finding the boss doors.\n\nSo overall, the progression system as well as the gameplay makes for an addicting game. With this said, their are a few issues I have with the game. When your character dies you get a selection of three (maybe four) randomly generated characters to choose from. All of these characters have different classes, special attacks and/or different qualities. Although the qualities like vertigo can really mess with you, most of the other qualities are forgettable after a while but it does add another element to the game at times. The random generated abilities on the other hand, were for the most part useless because most of the classes (except maybe mage and spell sword) had very little Mp to work with. I found that the normal attacks were sufficient in getting me through the dungeons.  It could have really helped if the characters had a bigger Mp pool to work with and maybe some different spells and abilities.\n\nOverall, good game with a few issues with the characters abilities, still very fun to play and has a game plus mode so good replayability as well.","October 5, 2014","true","27.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","1"

You're given infinite lives. However, every time you die you have to reroll all of your character traits.\n\nThat is essentially the gimmick behind Rogue Legacy. The only difference is that instead of infintie lives, you have infinite heirs. Each heir is given any of a whole slew of different modifiers that can be useful, harmful, or simply funny. Each heir gets to retain anything their predecessors unlocked and make another go at the pseudo-randomized castle (certain regions of the castle are always in the same general location, but the rooms and layout are randomized).\n\nIt is admittedly an exercise in grinding as most runs through the castle early on you can expect to die. And die. And die. But you do get this certain feeling of progress and learning how to cope with the variety of traits you can get. But there's nothing quite like that feeling of seeing a boss for the nth time and finally kicking its ♥♥♥.\n\nThe story is fairly basic but is entirely fitting for the game. It is, however, somewhat predictable if you can catch on to certain things as you make your way through the game. If you enjoy the gameplay a lot, the replay value is high as each iteration of the game gets progressively more difficult. Plus a patch some time back added special versions of the bosses for added challenge beyond the original game as well.\n\nOverall, I found it a very enjoyable game.","June 26, 2014","true","55.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","2"

Now about the game.\n\nRogue Legacy is a very challenging game, you will die...a lot, it's pretty much the premise of the game.\nFight, die, upgrade. Rinse lather and repeat essentailly but it's a bit more varied than that.\n\nGold is king in this game as your wealth carried over upon your ancestors death determines the upgrades you can afford thus improving upon the spawn of your hero.\n\nCareful being greedy though in Rogue Legacy, it may just cost you your Heroes life.\n\nThe castle in which you will be entering in (and mostly dying in) will be where your Rogues Legacy begins, in addition to that it will also be your grave.\nEvery new generation that enters the castle will find it has shifted and moved around with semi-randomization.  I believe this is so it is never the same experience twice.\nEnemies seemed to be strategically placed in set rooms as if to add a more difficult element rather then just being in random locations.\nYour only solace of preventing the castle from shifting each generation is via the Architect, but beware for he wants 40% of your gold earnings so weighing in the extra financial loss is something to consider.\n\nWhile upgrades are done via your manor estate which can improve stats to gold gain there is also a Blacksmith and a Lady who can sell you runes. These two npcs can help you greatly in giving you an edge wether it be a weapon that returns 50% damage back to the enemies or a rune that can make you double or triple jump. You'll need to loot chests to aquire these first however which mini bosses or special condition chests usually contain.\n\nAnother thing is upon choosing your child to follow in your foot steps Traits & Perks are most likely given to each of the 3 you have to choose from (Occasionally will a child with no traits appear). These can range from I.B.S (Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Your hero tends to fart while jumping) to Dementia (You see and hear enemies that are not real and they attack you which doesn't hurt you.)\n\nYou start off with some pretty basic classes at first. Knight, Barbarian, Mage, but upon upgrading your manor which is only done after death you can unlock a few more such as Shinobi and lich, in addition classes can be upgraded i.e Knight to Paladin and given a new ability such as "block".\n\nPlatforming is a thing in this and a bad jump or fall can hurl you into some spikes or enemies so eager to end you.\n\nThe story while subtle is not shy of being rich.\n\nThe comedy is also subtle but still there. Probably nothing to make you rolleth on the floor in a histerical fashion.\n\nIt took me a plethora of generations and frustration to master the patterns and eventually defeat all of the bosses. Patience is important is so is studying the patterns and attacks of everything.\n\nRogue Legacy is truly a Gem and a tough one to boot.","May 12","true","10.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Then again, the oldest games out there are fun just because you keep trying to beat your old high score.\n\nThis game begins as one of your fore fathers goes into a castle and tries to battle his way through. I'll be honest, I didn't pay attention to the story line I just wanted to start playing. The game works as so : every generation (or every time you die) there is a new line of blood that comes to challenge the castle. This new blood line comes in many forms, some have ADD, some are colorblind (to the point where your screen is colorblind), some generations are smaller or larger than usual with different classes (mage, paladin etc...), some are dyslexic (to where your screen is as well) and some are far sighted. Mixing up classes (or choosing to stay the same) is a nice feature. As you progress and collect coins you are able to unlock different sort of classes and even upgradable classes (or upgrade your HP, mana etc...). You can save your coins instead and spend money on new armor or weapons. These require the player to unlock "blue prints" before such purchases can be made. There is also the ability to "lock down" the previous castle your player died in... meaning you are allowed to go back into a castle you already explored previously however the treasure chests that were already opened remain opened.\n\nThe game play itself is relatively simple, with a few buttons to use for attack and mana capabilities (each vary with different class of player). It's a plat former with simple up, down, left and right game play. I wish there was an ability to roll as some levels get crammed with sprites shooting all sorts of weapons every which way. Yes of course the game does suggest to go back or to another dungeon room but sometimes you get caught. I like the idea of the game more than I like the game play.\n\nI like this game, I really do but I can't go as far as to recommending it to buy for it's full price... heck maybe even on sale. I don't have on indie games but I do find they cost more than they should... especially when it's a platform game.I will give it an indie rating of 7.1/10 but it's real rating as a game :\n\n\nRATING : 7/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	B-\n\nCould be funner perhaps with local co-op? Also, there is double jump in this game... eventually. You just have to unlock it. UPDATE : After playing the game for over 5 hours, I'd like to say having better dodges or attacks against certain enemies would be nice. Seems like some levels/rooms are simply impossible without the right movement.

The gameplay in this is very solid. The combat mechanics are fluid, and for me are what makes this game worth playing at all. Great gameplay with tight controls.\n\nThat being said I wouldn't reccoemdend this game for the price they ask for. This game is a weird case, it doesn't do anything particularly wrong, but it just isn't intresting enough to be worth playing. It's fun enough to endlessly go through the dungeon and getting further and further each time. But it's a long long road, and it feels like a grind.  And there will be times where you wont gain enough gold to do anything with, which feels horrible because I wasted all that time. It's not fun to have to search every room for gold over and over. The enemies can really screw you over fast and the level generator can get a bit too extreme in giving you good stuff, or really bad stuff on a run.\n\nMy big problem was it just all felt pointless after awhile. I'd work up life after life to beat a boss. And its not an easy boss fight. And in this game the bosses are much more stressful than they are fun. You have to go through a lot of fighting to become good enough to handle a boss. So you go from room to room fighting harder and harder enemies until you finally want to devote the next 10 runs to just beating the boss. ANd you do it! and you feel great! but then its like... now what? I get to do that entire process all over again now, but its going to be the same thing just a lot harder.. and that cycle will never end.\n\nThe upgrades you can buy are pretty standard, there's nothing particularly intresting with the leveling mechanics, or the class  changes.\n\nOn a personal note I also think they underplayed their theme a bit. I was really attracted to this title because of the whole legacy thing. Each life is the ancestor of your previous life. But they never use that for anything outside of context and what they call things. The legacy stuff is just there to slap names on things really. There's no actual gameplay to go along with it, and personally that bums me out. They could've made it so if you choose to play as a certain class, you get that class or some of that class' traits in your next life. To be a sort of genetics passing between lives. They could've made it so that if you killed the monster that killed you last time, you get a boost of some sort. They could've made it so that if you died by a certain type of enemy, like a skeleton, then your next life deals extra damage to skeletons(to sort of simulate anger that they killed your dad or something so now you hate skeletons and they must all die). They could've made it so each time you die you say a last word, which could've been an in-game tip system. Like if you die by a skeleton his last words are like "skeletons attack this way, maybe if I had tried to do this I would've lived. They could've given an ancestoral fund thing you could sink extra gold into, and you can see which ancestor donated the most, it would also help make it so that no run is completly worthless. I dunno, there's a LOT of ideas and they did none of them and it makes me sad. They have a really intresting hook with their context, and it was part of the reason I bought this game to begin with, but I was let down by the way they used it.\n\nBut the gameplay is balls out solid, so you will definititly have fun with this game, but I don't recommend it unless you can get it for $5 or less.","January 1, 2014","false","6.0"," 101 of 181 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","101","181","0","1"

There is a large variety of traits you can get to either benefit or harm your Rogue Legacy run as the heir to a hero trying to save the king with a cure that can be found in the castle. There’s even a pretty interesting amount of different spells you can get, ranging from throwing a dagger, to a circle of fireballs around you, to a couple crows that will home in on enemies and kill them.\n\nYou might have heard that this game is extremely difficult, and in a way, it is. It’s hard to start out against the new monsters and the weird mechanics of the game, but once you get the hang of it, there really isn’t much else you can do to get better other than upgrade your castle. So rather than it being particularly challenging, it’s more just time consuming. I’m not saying this in a bad way though, I rather like it. It’s still never extremely easy, and as you complete the game more it still gets more difficult. It’s really fun to slowly upgrade your character, barely managing to pay for that upgrade and having to do another run to get some more.\n\nThe world generation in this game gives you a lot of different rooms that you will experience a lot and eventually get the hang of. There are spike traps, wall turrets and platforms that only come out when you hit them, all used to add to the challenge of moving around, which is a very important mechanic to get the hang of. Some rooms will be extremely challenging with valuable prizes when completed, and some rooms will be a simple stroll through a hall.\n\nSpending your money properly is vital to performing well. You need to buy the things that will benefit you most and improve your runs. If you find yourself running out of mana quickly, maybe you should increase your mana capacity, or if you find yourself not doing enough damage, you should increase your health. If you find yourself playing as certain classes a lot, you should upgrade them to improve their abilities. And then there’s always the blacksmith and enchantress, who will get you very important items that may even benefit you more than a manor upgrade. You can buy swords and armour and capes from the blacksmith, along with runes from the enchantress to allow your character to do all sorts of different abilities like draining the health of your enemies and being able to fly, or making the difficulty a bit harder for better rewards. What do you think is more important? That will determine the success of a Rogue Legacy run.\n\nThough the storyline isn’t one of the bigger aspects of the game, I find it kind of intriguing to learn things from the Prince’s Journal that you’ve experienced yourself. After completing the journal, I haven’t gone back to read them all in order but it was fun to find the journals scattered around the castles randomly and read a bit of the backstory of the game.\n\nAlthough this game does last a lot of hours, and you will be able to play it for a while, it doesn’t have infinite replayability. Once you get through all the bosses enough times, all that makes the game harder is increased damage/health, and not new enemies to fight. It does get boring eventually, and once it gets to a certain point there’s just no reason to continue. Still, this game will last enough hours to be worth buying.\n\nThis game may not be worth $15, but any sale that happens for this game makes it probably worth looking into if you like Rogue-lite platformer type games. It’s extremely fun, a challenge worth looking into and plenty of gameplay to go through. I recommend Rogue Legacy to anyone who likes this sort of game.","July 19, 2014","true","44.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom2450/recommended/241600/","phantom2450","phantom2450","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom2450/","564 products in account","Rogue Legacy is a standout title in the roguelike crowd that deserves attention due to its satisfying platforming elements and unique randomization premise, though its system does inhibit replayability due to difficulty issues.\n\nThis game's trademark is its dual-randomization aspect, in which both the character the player uses and the layout of the castle that the game takes place in are randomized each playthrough. The backstory under which these factors are justified is equally intriguing: for every character that dies during their journey, one of three of their descendants will be the next to journey into the castle, which is apparently renovated in between each excursion. The usage of the lineage system to limit character choices keeps the game fresh by not allowing the player to avoid bad traits or unpreferred classes when they appear. However, this method does have issues due to the limited quantity of bad traits and the fact that they often are either "not impactful to gameplay" or "downright game-destroying"; some more meaningful downgrades that players would not necessarily spell defeat for players would have benefitted the game.\n\nFurther deviation from the normal roguelike setup comes from the fact that Rogue Legacy contains an RPG-like permanent upgrade system. Money earned in the game during a run carries over beyond death to an skill tree which grows to include unlockable classes and buffs, alongside general stat increases, over time. The game also features a basic armor system, with blueprints to be found in-game that unlock different pieces for purchase. Due to a lack of customization options for the attributes attached to the armors, however, by the end of the game there will only be around two different sets of armor that are feasible to use, since all the others would generally leave you too weak. Unlockable improvements to the armor to make the lesser sets more valuable would have made the armor system much more deep. To make up for this lack of customization, though, comes the final perk system, which allows the player to attach up to five perks before a run. These perks can acclimate to various playstyles and balances out the luck effect of the roguelike factors with the skill of the player in their preferred method of playing.\n\nOther aspects of this game are on-point. The gameplay as a platformer is responsive and adjusts accordingly to traits and perks, helping players concisely feel the effects that they're playing under. Combat is sometimes too floaty, as many flying enemies recoil too far from attacks for the player to prepare for/respond to naturally. Largely, though, the game feels fair in how enemies and rooms are designed in order to give players a fighting chance. Bosses vary widely and require strategizing from players, especially underleveled ones, in order to be defeated. The game's aesthetics are aided in part by its catchy chiptune soundtrack and the creators' humor, which is incorporated throughout the game in unexpected places. The game's lore is even decent, as diaries laid out by a previous denizen of the castle detail prior occurrences and tease some endgame events. The castle format smartly balances randomization and predetermination by allocating certain extremities of the castle to be certain areas (and thus certain degrees of difficulty), meaning that players that wish to face challenges above or below their own level can travel in certain directions - a useful mechanism that both rewards learning the attributes of different areas and surprises new players with unexpected challenges.\n\nThere are some downfalls that occur due to Rogue Legacy's mixing of genre elements. One significant issue involves the game's difficulty in later playthroughs. The game's balancing system levels out permanent upgrades in the skill tree with huge improvements to the enemies after the player beats the game. This system works for a number of victories through the game. However, at a certain point during games, the skill tree will eventually max out. At that point, further progress becomes largely impossible past whichever current playthrough that player is on. This issue can be exploited much earlier in a playthrough with abuse of the aforementioned perk system. With overuse of the "enemy weakening" perk, players could potentially inadvertently ruin their saves by beating the game so many times with reduced rewards (a downside of the perk) that the game may be unable to beat even with the perks, impossible to get past the first room without any of the perks and the player won't have enough resources to improve themselves. Such an exploit should have been either worked around or patched out altogether in order to protect the integrity of players' runs.\n\nThe RPG implementations cause unforeseen issues with the levelling system and prevent this roguelike from possessing the endless replayability that the genre is known for. However, as a venture into uncharted territory, this game provides an admirable experience that is driven by strong fundamentals and a memorable randomization system that fittingly gives this title a "legacy" of its own.

Every monster wants to kill you, and then you have to start again from scratch. A lot of games hold your hand, dust you down and sit you right back where you left off, as if nothing ever happened. Not so in Rogue Legacy, death is the most important thing. Death may start your game from scratch, but it also allows you to move on, to grow your dynasty and make them stronger. It’s also about killing things and trashing furniture for spare change, but that sounds far less impressive.\n\n\n\nRogue Legacy is a ‘Metroidvania’ game, a platformer where your character navigates a location, backtracking where necessary and trying to solve puzzles while on your way to a final boss. As you find out pretty quickly, Rogue Legacy is not as forgiving as those games were. Your first character runs, jumps, hacks monsters, loots gold and dies. You get to see images of everything you killed and are told to press A to move on.\n\nAnd move on, you must. Instead of starting from scratch, you pick one of three children, but now there are different classes, traits and spells. The opening classes are all fairly limited and the spells are pretty basic. What really stands out are their traits, and I’ll get on to those shortly.\n\nOnce you’ve picked your character, you spend your dead parent’s gold on improving your home, then pay the rest to a grim gatekeeper to enter the monsters’ castle and start again. The interior of the castle will change each time, presenting procedurally-generated rooms filled with monsters and traps. You traverse the castle trying not to die and lasting as long as possible, delving deeper into the castle.\n\n\n\nIt sounds simple, and it pretty much is. The progression and the randomly-made characters make all the difference in each playthrough. Your home helps improve your chances with each successive generation. You can upgrade classes, add new ones, get stat bumps and even buy new equipment which will inevitably be passed on to your next of kin, and oh what glorious children you’ve had.\n\nI said before that you have three children to choose from, but sometimes it’s less a choice of how you want to play your next life, more like having to pick which dysfunctional mess of a child won’t hinder you the most. Your first kid looks to be the most powerful, gigantism doubling his sprite size and his class is barbarian king, but he has vertigo and while you play as him the screen’s flipped upside down. Your next choice is skinny and easily knocked back, but he’s a mage with OCD and will gain mana for each piece of furniture he cleans away (destroys). The third is the weak knave, but his dyslexia jumbles any words you read as him around, and his nostalgia simply puts a sepia tone on the game until he’s dead. Do you play it safe with the knave or pick the mage and hope to hang back from any monsters? It’s a difficult choice.\n\n\n\nEach trait could potentially add something minor, although bald or gay characters have no difference to play style. You might be blessed with no feeling in your feet and not set off pressure traps. You might be totally immune to pain though, and that means you can’t see your health bar. Gigantism makes your sprite tougher and taller while characters with dwarfism are able to slip through secret passages. Each combination of traits puts the game in a new light, along with the different layout and the incremental improvements.\n\nThe improvements is one of the ways they hook you. After dying, you ‘move on’ and you can only spend your rewards after starting a new life. Then you earn more money, die and want to upgrade again, so you press A and pick a new character.\n\n\n\nThe game adopts a fairly standard ‘retro’ look, with a simple enough style to the castle, better than the original Castlevania but worse than most outings. It’s cute, but the main feature is the way each character looks slightly different depending on their traits and gear. Even though this is a PC game, it feels best on a controller, just like the Metroidvania games of old.\n\nRoguelike games have become increasingly popular of late and it’s great to see one which rewards you for all the time spent by allowing a form of character progression. It’s mitigated to a point by having you lose all your money before entering a castle and each purchased bonus makes all the others more expensive. As much as I have enjoyed the Binding of Isaac and FTL, Rogue Legacy is a game which cares about constant progression even in a roguelike game and lets you invest in dozens of generations of knights all on their doomed quest to conquer the castle.\n","November 13, 2014","true","2.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

The platforming controls are finely tuned, the random dungeons are designed well, with pretty much no choking points that affect progress (and you have the option to revisit a dungeon after dying if you want to), the challenge does not feel unfair, and the customization options like the runes and upgrades (not to mention the character classes) let you taper the game pretty much exactly to your liking.\nI have to say I enjoyed this game more than Borderlands 1 & 2, for example, where difficulty feels too level handicap biased and you run into tough choke spots all the time.\n\nLooking forward to playing New Game+ and recommend everyone to pick this up, even at full price.\n\nPS. If you're a Mac user like me, rest assured the port is great and the controller support is flawless (I'm using a old Logitech Rumblepad 2).","December 15, 2013","true","41.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

You will die a lot.\nBut it is not just because the game is insanely hard (although it is a little bit), but death plays a very fundamental role here.\n\nWhen you die with a character, you won't be able to play with it again. Instead, you will have to choose among three of his or her heirs. Every character is randomly generated, with classes and traits that directly affect gameplay in very interesting and clever manners. The map also changes for every generation, so you'll have new challenges, treasures and secrets after every death.\n\nThe point is that every generation will be more powerful than its predecessor, once you'll have the opportunity to buy status, equipment and abilities with what was found in the castle by the previous character. So there is going to be a very clear feel of progress even if you die a lot in the beggining of the game, being able to survive a little bit more with each character generated.\n\nSo don't get frustrated when you die. Don't give up, because this game is totally worthy! Every single element was pretty well planned and applied, like the controls, graphics, sound, music etc. A really enjoyable, fun, addictive and remarkable game. Without a shred of doubt this is a must-have to all fans of the metroidvania genre.","April 21, 2014","true","12.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Everytime you purchase an upgrade the other upgrades become 10 gold more expensive. So if you have a bad run, you spend your gold so its not wasted (the game takes your money when you re-enter the castle)-- and then the expensive upgrades that you DO want are just that much further out of your reach.\n\n2. The randomly generated castle is an artificial thing meant to extend the game's lifespan. You can learn about the (small) handfull of enemies in each area, but you'll spend 90% of your time in the first two zones, over and over, just trying to progress. Progression is stunted even further by the game's general concept. You get just a LITTLE bit further each time, or the castle generates a room full of spikes and you take 75% of your health in damage before getting anywhere. Better get used to that first room, mate, because those four candlestick holders and that chair are always gonna be there for you to hit every. Single. Time.\n\n3. Bosses are bullet-hell creatures. Given this game's "tough but fair" philosophy and how easy it is to die, this was completely out of left field. The sudden difficulty ramp when it comes to killing any of the bosses will be like crashing into a brick wall, and made even worse if you're using a keyboard. The game only has five bosses, and rightly so considering how it all works, but the sudden spike in difficulty is not only unwelcome but punishing to the unwary gamer. I like difficulty so it's not a cakewalk, but I don't apprieciate having almost no chance at all. This is a cartoonish platformer, not Dark Souls.\n\n4. No difficulty adjustment.\n\n5. You can't use a mouse on any of the menus, which just FEELS wierd.\n\n=-=-=-=-=\n\nDon't get me wrong, I liked this game a lot when I first got it, but I'll never be able to finish it. The constant grind-grind-grind for gold with almost nothing to show for it 80% of the time, coupled with the VERY difficult boss fights make this game a little too hard for a casual gamer like myself.

I had a cup of tea with The Binding of Isaac a couple of years ago but thoroughly disliked it. See, my problem with rogue-likes is that I feel that they inherently waste my time, if I die then I lose all of my progress and have to start from scratch. As an adult with a full time job and limited free time to play games, this experience is not enjoyable to me. I do not like the feeling that my time is being wasted, and when I played BoI this is exactly how I felt. Yes, I know that part of the rogue-like experience is learning new things about the game each time but this is essentially just trial and error. Again, if I had all the free time in the world this wouldn’t bother me nearly as much. Thankfully, Rogue Legacy mitigates this concern a great deal.\n\nRogue Legacy is a rogue-like with progression. What a novel idea! It takes your standard 2D sidecrolling platformer and ingeniously adds a family legacy mechanic: each time you die, you pick a family member as a successor giving you a sense of history and context for your playthrough. Each successor you pick will have specific traits as well that affect the game: this might be colorblindness (the game is black and white), glaucoma (blurry screen), ADHD (you move faster) among countless others. This smart addition makes each run through the castle seem fresh and interesting.\n\nAnother aspect that carries over from run to run is the gold that you accumulate. Any gold collected during a run can then be used to permanently upgrade your family tree (HP, mana, damage) or buy new gear for your heirs. This added progression, for me, fixes my biggest problem with rogue-likes, I always feel like I’m chipping away at a goal. So even if I died quickly during that last run I can grab a new helmet that will help me from there on out. In addition to this carry over, you can also lock down the dungeon so the layout is no longer procedurally generated. Just had a long run and loved the layout? Lock it down! This, of course, comes with a reduction in the amount of gold you earn though.\n\nSo while I may not be very good at Rogue Legacy and will almost assuredly never beat it, I appreciate what it has done for rogue-likes. It has taken a genre that I have never cared about and given me pause to explore it a bit more and see what variations are out there.\n","April 29","true","4.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rafaelmorais/recommended/241600/","rafaelmorais","Rafael M.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rafaelmorais/","444 products in account","The first hour of Rogue Legacy is frustrating. You don't have the power needed to overcome the huge amount of enemies. But when you start to learn the monsters patterns, collect gold and equip your characters, the game becomes much more enjoyable. Yes, there's permadeath here, but the gear you buy stays with you forever.\n\nLevels are randomized, but you can lock them if you want. It's good for practice, but bad for looting, because when you "lock the castle" you need to pay a high fee, so you'll earn a lot less gold. I recommend to do this only if you found a boss area and feel confident to fight him (you can teletransport to the boss area since the beginning).\n\nSo, you might be thinking: "how I'm gonna beat all the bosses and finish the game with the same locked castle, earning almost no gold?". The answer is: thankfully, when you beat a boss, you don't need to lock the castle. The game register that you've already won that fight, even playing with different castles over and over again. With this feature, you can play with no pressure to beat all the bosses in one sitting.\n\nAll in all, if you're seeking for a great challenge and enjoy games like Castlevania and Ghouls'n Ghosts, you should play Rogue Legacy. There's a long and tough way to go, but I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride as much as I do.","June 16, 2014","true","8.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I had played through and beaten the four major bosses, leading to the final one, and I had gotten to the point where I was unstoppable at that level, but barely able to dent the final boss.  Through amazing luck, I managed to take him out, and thus began a New Game+, where I was regularly getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by enemies that hit far harder and took far more hits than the hardest enemies presented in the previous game.\n\n"Mind the gap," as some would say.\n\nThe multiple different unlocks in the game help increase the variety to how you play, though it is quite random, you cannot selectively breed your lineage to consistently be Barbarians, you end up with many flaws that randomly occur, without the ability to strengthen your bloodline by not allowing weaklings to move forward in the family.  Between the runes and the armour and the various unlocks, you have a lot to work with as long as you can make the money, and oh what money you must make.  Dozens of playthroughs that must end in death in order to apply your money to the next generation, never to your current character.\n\nIt would have been nice to be able to spend your money where and when you wanted, instead of depending on the mechanic of death.","January 5, 2014","true","50.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Similar to other recent roguelike games such as Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, Rogue Legacy features an ever changing dungeon filled to the brim with ridiculously lethal monsters and flagrantly unfair traps, all presented with a perversely masochistic glee. Where it differs from it sadistic peers is its sense of continuance. While each hero may only have one life to live (and impale upon a spike), the treasures and items he or she accumulates is passed to their next of kin. Bizarre elements foreign to the roguelike mindset, such as stat upgrades and ability expanding items, enter the mix.\n\nUnlike Isaac where the entire game is a mission to see the end (or at least how far you'll get), Rogue Legacy has more of a gradual slope. You know it's unlikely you'll take your first few heroes all the way to the end, or maybe even to the first boss. But that's okay, because success in Rogue Legacy isn't just determined by how far one gets, but what they amass and pass on.\n\nIt's a lovely blending of genres that, like many blindingly brilliant ideas, is so amazing that it somehow becomes obvious in retrospect. Of course someone had to make a game like this. It's the perfect entry point for a new audience just dipping their feet into roguelikes.\n\nDespite the fluffy exterior of being a new audience friendly "rogue-lite", it's still damn tough. For such a cute looking game, there is a lot to learn and a lot to screw up. I played the absolute hell out of Rogue Legacy and made my fair share of boneheaded errors and dumbfounding revelations figuring things out.\n\nIf you like good games, you should play Rogue Legacy.\n","March 14, 2014","true","18.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/241600/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","Rogue Legacy is an expertly crafted game with a confusing title.\n\nThe rogue-like is an obtusely defined genre of games focused around permanent death, random environments and unforgiving mechanics. There have been suggestions for better descriptors, including the Procedural Death Labyrinth (or PDL[www.proceduraldeathlabyrinth.com]) which I personally prefer, but with Rogue prominently featured in the title I guess there's no denying that this is a Rogue-like, Rogue-like-like or Rogue-like-lite.\n\nThe player character is tasked with conquering a magical castle filled with devious traps and dangerous monsters and he/she will fail and die horribly.\nLuckily your character had the foresight to leave behind a legacy and you'll cheerfully head back into the castle as one of your character's children.\nThe castle changes each time you enter it though, so even though you will get the benefit of knowing the types of things it can throw at you you won't be able to memorize the castle's layout and breeze through it.\n\nWhy would this next generation have a better shot than the ones that came before it? Because you get to buy upgrades before heading in using the gold your ancestor found in the castle.\nThese are permanent improvements that will usually influence your character and always influence your offspring. Things like increased strength or armour, but also unlocking new classes for your children to be. Each time you choose a new character you have a choice of 3 randomized character classes, and upgrading in such a way that you unlock more of them keeps the game varied and helps to make the castle easier to overcome.\n\nYour basic warriors will soon diversify into wizards, barbarians, rogues and a handful of other classes that I don't feel like spoiling. They all have their place in the game and I never felt that a class didn't have any use (though I definitely had my favourites). Each classes can also be upgraded to get a unique ability, warriors become paladins that can expend MP to block any attack with their holy shield and along the same lines you'll get Barbarian Kings/Queens, Assassins and all sorts of colourful characters.\n\nAs if that wasn't variety enough, each character has up to two randomly assigned traits (on top of their gender, class and spell) to differentiate them. These range from the comical (being bald, occasionally passing gas when jumping or being stereo-blind which will flip each sprite Paper Mario style when it turns) to the useful (remembering where enemies are, not triggering spike traps, getting MP by destroying furniture) to the hindering (colour blindness, dyslexia, being short sighted).\nThese are all charming and often funny traits that will help set each character apart, and you'll go through a lot of them. Over my course of playing the game (and its extra challenging New Game+ mode) I went through 138 generations of characters, and even though I wouldn't be able to recall any of them specifically I never felt that two consecutive runs were similar.\n\nThe castle you explore is divided in four different regions, which all have their own look, set of enemies and imposing boss at the end. The Castle area (you start here), the Maya high among the castle's towers, the Forest to the east and the Dark, deep below in its cellars. Beat all four bosses (in any number of runs, this is one of the things that does carry over between runs) and the large door in the foyer that you've run past dozens of times will slowly swing open allowing you access to the game's final boss.\n\nThis is not a perfect game though, even though almost all parts of it are excellent, my main gripe with it is that it can get quite grindy. The main aspect to blame here is the gatekeeper, Charon. To enter the castle you have to give him all the gold you have left over after buying upgrades / equipment. This means that, as you get the cheaper upgrades and gear, you'll soon get to a game state where you'll need a minimum amount of gold from a run to be able to afford any upgrades and it can sometimes feel like you've 'wasted' a run.\n(There is a late-game upgrade that somewhat mitigates this problem by convincing Charon to only take 50%-90% (depending on upgrade level) of your gold).\n\nOverall though, this is an amazing game and definitely one where you're vulnerable to "one more try" situations turning into gaming sessions lasting deep into the night.\nAs long as you can stomach that not every run will contribute to your progress through the castle and you feel like playing an excellent 2D platformer, this is definitely a game to pick up.","January 12, 2015","true","14.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I think this is my favorite type of Roguelike game. Doing well enough in a run will get you more money, thus allowing you to buy more classes or upgrades for your characters. Everyone run is different. Before you start a run, you get to choose an adventurer. The adventurers you get to choose from are all random, so you could have a really bad pool to pick from sometimes. Other times, it'll be great.\n\nThe concept is really well done, and definitely has it's humor to it. One of the quirks your hero can have is IBS, which just makes them fart occasionally. It does nothing else. People can have really silly names, and it's just generally a lighthearted game.\n\nIt's also addictive as hell. It's really easy to set goals in the game, It's really easy to just keep playing. Just one more. Just one more. 3 hours later, you bought that health upgrade, but you probably should have gone to sleep 4 hours ago. I say 4 hours, because it's 4 in the morning, and you meant to go to sleep at 12.\n\nThe bosses are also well designed, and enjoyable to fight. Even the super hard versions of the bosses, although they are really damn hard.\n\nThis game does have NG+, but I really didn't play it too much, so I can't comment on it.\n\nFor $15, I'd thoroughly recommend this game to someone who wants an rpg-ish roguelike game.","February 26","true","43.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Personally, I am not into platformers but after playing this game, it has changed my mind. The game features randomly generated levels where the player has to go through in order to get to the bosses. After all of the four bosses have been defeated, the final boss door will unlock. However, there is a catch to this… You will not be able to kill all of the four bosses and the final boss in one run. You would have to die over and over again but with each death, you’ll get stronger and stronger and eventually, you’ll be able to slay all of the bosses.\n\nPros+Fluid gameplay\n+Great soundtrack\n+Great variety of heirs\n+Great variety of enemies\n+Good sense of humour (character traits like I.B.S which stands for Irritable Bowel Syndrome)\n+Unique bosses\n+Full controller support\n+Steam trading cards\n+Able to run on low-end PCs\n\nCons-No Steam Cloud\n-Gold farming may get a bit repetitive over time\n-Controls are not as good on the keyboard and mouse than it is on the controller\n\nMost of the charm that comes from this game would be its difficulty. It is a pretty challenging game and there has been comparisons of this game with Dark Souls. Some people have dubbed this game to be the platformer version of Dark Souls. So if you’re into hard games, then I highly recommend that you buy this title and try it for yourself. This game also has many other good points going for it such as the ones I’ve listed above. It has one of the coolest soundtracks I’ve ever heard from a video game. My favourite soundtrack from this game would be the one during the third boss fight. Rogue Legacy is 15 dollars and I would say it is pretty much worth every penny but if you’re still doubting whether you would like this game or not, then wait for the sales to come and grab it when the right opportunity arises.\n\nFINAL RATING: 8/10","May 22","true","41.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Boy, was I wrong! Instead, Rogue Legacy gave me the funnest and hardest experience I ever had. This genre of rogue-like games is a blessing to other game genres out there. Instead of a linear story and a one way approach, Rogue Legacy pitted me against the unknown.\n\nThis unknown was the part of the charm of the game. I never knew what to expect in the next room because every version of the castle differed from the rest. However, there is a way for the heroes to keep the same version of the castle and it is by reducing the amount of gold earned. Speaking of this feature, the other features that Rogue Legacy presented broaden the aspects of the game.\n\nRogue Legacy offered the ability to upgrade the castle so that the heroes would have better skills and more job advancements. In addition, every hero is unique due to the randomization that the game does. Some heroes may be of a certain class or possess a certain trait that would be vital to complete certain areas of the game.\n\nTo recap, I ventured into this game with a completely different mindset. After completing the game, I realized the potential Rogue Legacy has and how satisfying the gameplay was. Even though the game provided me a few hours of enjoyment, it's a good game to purchase when it goes on sale.\n\nRating:  7.8/10 (78%)\nAchievements: 26/28 (93%)\nGame Done.","November 8, 2014","true","25.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It's basically a Castlevania style RPG but with more of a twist on it. Using characters with abilities (and disabilities!) that effect things like having the entire game play upside down, being able to avoid all floor traps, being massive, small, or just neutral random traits such as balding, being gay and flatulence.\n\nThe progression is somewhat grindy with randomized loot chests and expensive upgrades for your keep. Especially in NG+ it just kind of got jokingly awful with having tiny minimal health upgrades that would take me 10-20 minutes just to get. Still, the classes are interesting and mostly allow for unique playstyles and can help with puzzles, specific bosses or just navigating the castle.\n\nThere's a somewhat interesting story to follow if you don't mind a bit of reading and exploring, I personally loved it and was disappointed when I ended up missing a few journals before completing the game. Though it definetly starts out slow.\n\nThe game is painfully hard as well, which is unfortunate at times. I wasn't a fan of the idea that early levels are basically what dictate how far you can get. It's disappointing that I would sometimes barely kill a boss in an area but end up stuck because all the other enemies in the next zone can one hit me. At least leveling through your first playthrough is fairly quick though.\n\nBelieve it took me around 8 hours to complete my first run. The game is a little short but if you can get it on sale it's definetly worth the money, and if you're a completionist there's plenty of skills, armor parts, and weapons to collect.","August 4, 2014","true","4.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is simple, yet addicting. You could just play a quick run for 10 minutes or you can play for hours on end to earn upgrades and try and make more progress in the castle.\n2. You will always have more milestones to reach. When you're starting out, struggling to defeat enemies, and have no mastery of the controls you will be motivated just to have runs that contribute anything to your game. Whatever money you make is lost if you don't spend it, and everytime you buy an upgrade, the cost of all the upgrades available slightly increases.\nYou're motivation is just to improve, however you can. Strive for runs where you get just far enough to afford something that can make your situation a bit easier. As you start to acquire upgrades and get used to the controls, you find you can make more money, but you also need to earn more to keep upgrading your characters. Then you may get far enough to fight the area boss, but you will probably get decimated by them. So you're goal is to fight them more, to learn their patterns and try to defeat them.\nThen you finally defeat the boss, but you have 3 other areas to explore, which means going deeper in the castle to fight tougher enemies and surviving enough to challenge 3 more bosses, who will also demand a similar learning curve and challenge you to reach them while earning upgrades to increase your chances. This excellent pacing makes it so the game is constantly rewarding.\n3. The game has a lot of variety thanks to the randomized layouts, traits, character classes, and rune/weapon unlocks. It's really fun to experiment with different classes and test out new gear and runes. There are also a large variety of enemies with various patterns to keep you on your toes.\n4. This game has a nice metrovanian art style and a good soundtrack as well. I especially like Ponce de Leon's theme.\n5. Unlimited New Game +'s.

Every time you die, one of your children picks up the mantle, and trots off to their chiptune-scored fate.\n\nAnd these kids can be seriously messed up.\n\nColorblindness, coprolalia, irritable bowl syndrome, your descendants have traits both positive and negative.

Being a dwarf, for instance, will quickly become your first choice, as there are paths inaccessible to any other size and they can more readily dodge projectiles. But the gender, lack of hair or sexual orientation of your character has exactly zero effect on gameplay. I like that.\n\nThis game gets to have its rogue-like cake and eat its RPG-like stat progression, too.\n\nIf you like addictive, difficult, beautifully designed and procedurally composed sidescrolling video games, buy Rogue Legacy.","December 18, 2013","true","58.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It takes old platforming and RPG elements and combines them with rogue-like gameplay and makes a whole new kind of game. The difficulty is gradual and you can take it at your own pace. Personally I liked to go in, get as much money as possible so I can upgrade, and repeat until I thought I was ready for that boss. Definately an improvement over the game that they made about the guy trying not to ♥♥♥♥ his pants.

It's also a whole bucket of fun. Big thumbs up.\nI recommend viewing this trailer. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLD8VzhhDjQ\nI also recommend using some kind of controller. God help anyone who tries to use keyboard and mouse.\n\nGameplay: Run and jump around a 2D world killing things, dodging things, and collecting money to spend on upgrades.\n\nPresentation: Fun and colorful. The crunchy sound effects are satisfying. The flavor is funny, right down to the ever-hysterical run animation; a sword outstretched, head held high, sprinting high-step that all but screams "CHEARGE!"\n\nGimmick: When you die, and you will die a lot, your character dies permanently. The game ends and you return to the main menu. To continue your adventure, you select one of the 3 generated heirs of your recently deceased playable character. They each have a randomly assigned class and various genetic traits. Some traits are useful, like dwarfism, which lets you access areas a full sized person can't. Some of them are harmful, like near sightedness, which makes things farther away from your character blurry. Some of them are amusing and useless, such as hypochondria, which falsely exaggerates the damage you take... for example, being hit for 10 damage might cause a big red "2,308" to pop up over your head.\n\nYour selected heir will inherit their predecessor's collected money, unlocked passive skill tree bonuses, and purchased equipment. So while the character himself/herself is essentially rerolled upon death, everything aside from their name, class and traits are retained. A quick sample of what the skill tree looks like can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9entjQ2hU-8\n\nDying also regenerates the dungeon, so your offspring don't have to retrace any identical steps.\n\nI wasn't too sure about this game at first. I was terrible at it, and often died before obtaining enough money for my heirs to purchase anything of use. But Rogue Legacy's amusing presentation helped me to stick with it through the initial difficulties. After a couple of hours I was competent enough to make some decent runs and became hooked for good. I'm now 18 hours and 160 dead ancestors in. Still going strong.\n\nYou'll get your money's worth here.","January 18, 2014","true","33.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It was then I realized, I was close to victory."\n\nRecommendation Bonus if you liked games such as side-scrolling adventuring Castlevanias (Simon's Quest, Symphony of the Night). Recommendation Bonus if want to try Rogue-like games in a platform setting.\n\nBackground: This is my second rogue-like game. This game has been hard on me with the random traits and classes only furthering that difficulty and killing my enthusiasm for it. Still, I saw this game had a lot of heart from its developers embedded into the game and that kept me going.\n\nSome points, may be pluses for some, negatives for others, or neutrals.\n* Enjoyed the 2D graphical style\n* Enjoyed the music overall that sometimes harkened back to that early 90's video game music\n\nGameplay:\n* Side-scrolling platform adventure with RPG elements and permanent death\n* Played with a gamepad, did not try to play with keyboard/mouse yet\n* Controls may sometimes feel unresponsive when performing two actions simultaneously such as jumping and swinging a sword or moving and swing a sword ~ if you adjust to it, you may sometimes use this lag to your advantage to swing while stepping backwards, but can initially lead to missed swings and/or death by not stopping the enemy's attack\n* Fight monsters, avoid traps, explore a single large castle with four major areas, find coin and treasure, gambit with statues or encounters of luck or misfortune, fight bosses to progress the main story, read through the logs of those that ventured the castle before you to piece a greater mystery, die and leave your wealth to your descendants to improve their odds of success before paying the gatekeeper all of your wealth to ensure that to buy upgrades, you will need to have a good money run\n* You have access to a standard sword swing, a jumping down stab, a magic attack that is often randomly assigned to your hero at the start and if applicable a class-special ability\n* You choose one of three heroes each attempt from a random selection of traits and unlocked classes\n* Classes consist of such things as knights who are balanced with the ability to block, barbarians with a large health pool and the ability to shout enemies away, wizards with a large mana pool to use more magic, ninja who can move quick with strong sword attacks, miners who have low combat attributes - but find more gold and can locate chests on the map and more\n* Traits can drastically alter gameplay and are randomly selected, such as dwarfism which allows your hero to fit in narrow passages that may avoid some enemies or find treasure, as well as make it easier to dodge, but shorten their sword arm - or hypochondriac where you hero exaggerates how much damage they take, making it difficult to tell how dangerous an enemy really is - or vertigo, that makes the screen upside down and reverse while making half of your controls backwards ~ you may end up with one or more of these traits to make for an interesting, frustrating or nauseating experience\n* You can spend the gold of your predecessor to increase health, mana, strength, intelligence, encumbrance limit, unlock new classes, increase the gold found on subsequent playthroughs and more - however, increasing any aspect will raise the price of the others, so you may want to consider the direction you would like to take as you unlock more upgrades\n* You can discover equipment recipes and attachable runes in chests or completing challenges, equipment such as a sword that reduces the damage received, armor that allows you to drain health from enemies at the expense of less max health, runes that let you make an extra jump or runes that give you mana when attacking an enemy\n* Dungeons are mostly randomized with four major areas that remain in the same general directions - this may result in dungeons that are too brutal for a new player to places too easy for a veteran ~ when exploring, you can hire an engineer-like character to lock the current dungeon design at the expense of much of your earnings, giving you a chance to continue exploring the same setup if you like the layout or if you want another shot at a boss\n* Optional Challenge Rooms that do not count toward destroying your game progress ~ using a preset hero against advanced versions of a boss\n* New Game Plus with enemies of greater stats ~ have not tried to explore more to see if there may be new enemy types or enemy attack patterns (edit: just finished New Game +1 and +2, the spike of difficulty with new enemy attack patterns created so much screen chaos and bullet hell that I ran to the bosses for safety, I don't have it in me to try New Game +3 or go achievement hunting)\n* Easter eggs and references to various sources throughout the game's content, gave it a light-hearted or personal touch\n\nDifficulty:\n* The game's difficulty varies greatly based on what hero you have available, your personal play style, what dungeon you're presented with and if fighting a boss, if you're adapted to the overall boss tactics and taking advantage of your class/trait (if applicable) tactics ~ overall, the game is on the harder side and can be rewarding as you clear out areas or go through past locations with greater confidence\n* Does not appear to be a guaranteed way to recover health or mana in the castle, leading you to eventually run out of recovery items and die as you make mistakes\n* The game auto-saves, so if you're having a bad run and losing health, it's going to remember that, sometimes it can be more convenient to you as the player to accept the sweet embrace of death\n* Most deaths were attempting to adapt to boss mechanics, died approximately 118 times over 9.2 hours or approximately one death every 5 minutes ~ the hero that cleared the main story is one hit away from death (edit: 135 times over 14.5 hours and three playthroughs, just going to put this game down now before the amount of screen activity on New Game +3 causes an epileptic seizure)\n\nESRBish/Content Advisory:\n* Some characters are depicted farting with visual trails of their mishaps and may decrease the enjoyment of the curry you're eating\n* Some characters see the screen upside down and backwards, which may disorient some players\n* There is an image of an 8-bit man sitting on a toilet, could not recall if his genitalia was drawn with three pixels or if it that is part of his first two legs\n* There may be some occasional language when reading murals such as "sh*t"\n* Some dark themes","December 23, 2015","true","18.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Rogue Legacy is a roguelike game where if your character dies, he dies permanently, but don´t worry! Your child will inherit your gold and castle as well as your burdens and responsabilities. Even when you die all the money you get can be spent on upgrading your castle (meaning you will upgrade your stats, gain new classes and abilities), buying armor or runes so the future generations will be stronger. It´s a creative and well balanced system that challenges the veteran players while at the same time gives an opportunity to the newest ones to the genre to beat and enjoy the game. The story is simple: You must find the traitor, who killed the king, inside a cursed castle. This castle will have different rooms every time you enter with another character (unless you want to give up 60% of the gold you find inside if I´m not mistaken) which is also a good mechanic as it makes the game more dynamic. You will also have many differrent classes to choose from as well as hilarious characters traits. The soundtrack is also nice. Now for the most challenging yet rewardind thing in the game: The Bosses, in particular the Remixed Bosses. I don´t remember the last time I had this level of difficulty in beating a boss! Thank you Cellar Door Games, it was rewarding as it was difficult, I even recorded beating two of them, which I never did before in a game. It is indeed a challenging game but given enough time, you will learn to be better and better until you´ve mastered all the mechanics of the game. There are other features in this game like new game plus or new game plus plus or ... Well in fact there´s countless. What I mean is everytime you beat the game the enemies get stronger and stronger (they level up but not only that as they will be upgraded versions with more deadlier attacks). I saw on youtube a person who was playing a game 40+! Well I beat the game twice doing everything and beating every boss and I have 41 hours of gameplay so I think it´s a pretty good game in terms of longevity.\nOverall of course I recommend this game, if you like the genre and want to be challanged than this game is for you!

I usually don't like roguelikes, but this game added the most important part of enjoyment for me; being able to upgrade your character after every run. You have a castle that you upgrade with all the gold you earned from your last run. These upgrades consist of making your character's statistics better and all sorts of different things related to the game. This makes every run feel worthwhile to me, instead of having to start at basically nothing everytime I start a new run.\n\nTheres a lot of equipment and abilities to find in treasure chests. Your character's visual appearence will change with each new piece of equipment you put on (I love games that do that). The storyline is also simple, but I really like how the game told it. There are a lot of interesting journal entries that I recommend reading to add to your gameplay experience. It really puts what your character is doing into perspective.\n\nThe boss fights are all excellent. None of them are cheap and all of them are expertly designed. If you can't beat them at first, then just focus on trying to find more chests with equipment and upgrades, or finding more gold to upgrade your castle.\n\nAfter beating a boss, you will be able to challenge the remix version of that boss. These are the same bosses that you fought while going through the castle, but they have all been changed to make the fights more difficult. They are A LOT more difficult. You will use a specifically made character for each fight, instead of the one you have been using throughout the game. Levels and equipment effect nothing. Its all about your skill for these fights. Look at how low the Steam percentages are for the remix boss achievements. They are still a ton of fun trying to beat though.\n\nThe music is also great in this game. I have a couple new favorite songs now after playing this (I'm looking at you title screen and ending theme). The game will last you around 25 hours and you can go through New Game + as many times as you like. Everything keeps getting harder the more playthroughs of the game you complete.","May 4, 2014","true","28.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I highly recommend it to anyone interested in difficult platforming. Even with 100+ hours, I have yet to beat it, yet I still have fun everytime I play. I did have to restart once as it is not supported by Steam's save game sync. And yet, every night when I sit down and think about what I want to play, Rogue Legacy is always thought about.\n\nAbout the game:\nStart off as a naive, so weak you probably won't make it past the first few screens. Kill enough monsters and get that money so you can upgrade your skills. Hopefuly you get enough to upgrade SOMETHING, or else you must surrender a portion of it to the gatekeeper in order to play again. Just make sure not to buy an upgrade you don't need as every purchase will raise the cost of any future purchases. Run through the castle and discover chests with recipes for armor, weapons, and runes; all of which add to your base stats or include special abilites such as vampirism, flight, double-jumping, dashing, extra gold pick-ups, and so many more. I've never ran through the same castle twice but I have seen the same room on occasion, usually just a simple hallway or great-room or something. Each run through the castle features it's own surprises. Pick your hero wisely, and don't forget to equip the right equipment for the right hero for the right type of run. Eventually, get strong enough to tackle those bosses. One of the great things about this game is that, even if you are bad at reflex-based platforming, if you play it enough you will eventually be powerful enough to tackle the bosses without even flinching. Also full of fun mini-bosses that drop their own 'super-chests' .\n\nI can't reccommend this game enough, I have had so much fun with it. I hate buying things when they are not on sale, but if you are looking for something to get lost in and make you feel like a total castle-romping badass, Rogue Legacy is the game for you and you shouldn't wait to play it!","October 10, 2014","true","205.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The dying is a main, if not essential part of the Rougelike Genre of games. This game utilises dying to improve your "legacy" whether it be a new class to choose from, an upgrade to a class you already have or a stat boost, the game makes every upgrade a little more expensive each time you buy one but thats the equivalent to the lowest value coin found in the castle. It is a bit slow to start off with as you lose every last piece of gold you earned to re-enter the castle.\n\nStory wise this game doesn't really have much. You have the tutorial and the log entries, which provide some background to the start of the game. Its not brilliant, but it does provide you with the reason behind the actions done in the tutorial.\n\nThis game also has your heroes with "traits". These are actual known medical conditions (to some extent) and affect your hero in different ways like I.B.S which makes your hero fart to things like vertigo which flips the games screen upside down. Each hero can have up to 2 different traits and may very rarely have none.\n\nThe castle is randomly generated each time, unless you decide to get an upgeade that allows you to "lock it down". Which allows you to practice bosses or try to reach that chest you couldn't reach last time. These chests can provide runes, which can give you different benefits and come in 5 varieties (for each main piece of equipment you have), you can only have 1 rune in each piece of equipment and you can also get equipment blueprints, which allow you to spend your gold after you die to unlock and maybe even equip (providing you have the weight allowance that is).\n\nThe enemies have 3 different tiers basic, advanced and expert, but you won't come across any expert tier enemies till you have beaten the game twice, but they still can spawn and you will be facing expert enemies a lot after you beat it for your first time, the bosses and mini-bosses are a nice challenge aswell as they need you to think ahead. After you beat a boss you can find its "obol" (except the 5th one, you just need to beat all the remix bosses to be able to find its obol) which allows you to face its remixed version where you use a specific preset character, these are a true test of skill and will take many attempts and beating them all gives you a real sense of accomplishment, once you beat the final boss you are sent into New Game + mode, where you do it all again with harder enemies and the enemies are all now at the advanced tier (expert if its NB++ onwards)\n\nI know I have recommended this, but if you don't like games where you die a lot, or games that get repetitive quite fast then this game isn't for you.","June 21, 2014","true","83.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Grind and yes gameplay is based on grinding gold as much as possible in one life, with it you can unlock and upgrade various things in your manor. Search for loot within entire castle either its random rune or piece of equipment. Luckily after beating last boss you can continue to play as NEW GAME+. It's only matter of time when everything will be upgraded and then you can enjoy real challenge of game as it is based on player's skill rather than luck.

There was no cloud save feature at the time (not sure if this has been added in a patch) so I was emailing my save file between home and work every evening. Anyway, the game gets a ton of stuff right, specifically its charming presentation and that sticky "just one more go" roguelike design. There's a very nice mixture of skill-based platforming, stat-based character building, and a dash of pure luck that comes hand-in-hand with procedurally-generated content. Despite its finer qualities, Rogue Legacy does suffer from a pretty unbalanced character progression curve, especially as it relates to the cost of upgrades in the early game. Difficulty spikes throughout, which is also very frustrating. And once you have experienced all the palette swaps, the enemy variety is somewhat lacking. However, like many of my favorite games ever, it is this "rough around the edges" quality that makes Rogue Legacy that much more enjoyable.

I don't normally 100% games or pay attention to "achievements" but I went all out on this one!

Be very aware that every time you beat the game the difficulty will increase substantially. I think I was ahead of the designed curve on my first and second finishes which made my third playthrough feel more like punishment for beating the game rather than any reward. Some thirty or so ruthless deaths later I had stockpiled enough gold to unlock some perks that helped with this issue and I got back to enjoying the game. Other than that issue this game actually avoids ever turning into too much of a "grind". Really scales super smooth.\n\n2. Certain enemy's detection of the player kind of eliminates the perceived appeal of a few specials and dashes. You would think you could use a dash to the opposite side of a turret to land a quick strike but it will instantly be facing and firing on schedule at you the exact pixel you cross over.\n\nNeither are real issues, just trying to find a negative for argument's sake.

It's a great game - the graphics are perfectly thought out as a silly retro platformer, the controls are super tight and worked out of the box with my ancient POS logitech gamepad, the designs are consistently challenging.  Everything you wanted from a roguelike plus everything you expected from the best of the NES/SNES platforming generation of games.\nNo, the reason I will destroy the developers is because this is a great game made by people who hate you and especially hate progression.  Let me explain.\nComplaint the first: Charon.  There is no bleeding reason for Charon to be in this game.  Every time I have to pay the toll without buying an upgrade, I hit alt-f4, because I hate him and what he does to the gameplay that much.\nComplaint the second: Upgrade costs.  The game calculates your upgrade costs by adding an amount, N, to the base cost of every upgrade.  N is figured from the number of upgrades you have bought already.

The cumulative effect of this is to create an atmosphere of wildly upspiraling inflation.\nI would cheerfully endure either of these challenges by themselves, but both together is unforgivable.

It harkens back to the days when Simon Belmont could only take four hits before succumbing to sweet oblivion, or when Arthur's armor burst off his body upon simply touching a defiled zombie. Modern conventions and some wacky characteristics keep Rogue Legacy feeling fresh despite its old-school charm, though these sources of intrigue can prove a bit frustrating at times.\n\nFollowing a short prologue and introduction to death, Rogue Legacy tasks you with exploring a castle with four distinct areas, dispatching bosses as you proceed towards the ultimate goal of defeating the final evil locked behind a gold door. There's a little bit of story told in journal entries scattered about the environment, but mostly this is a tale about killing monsters and gathering loot, and the game is better for it. We didn't need much explanation back in the NES days other than, "Dracula has risen, now go kill him good!" With the recent glut of cutscenes and dialogue in today's big-budget AAA world, Rogue Legacy comes across as a breath of fresh air with its focused and directed nature. "Explore the castle, get stuff, and power up" are reasons enough to scour the corridors of this huge deathtrap.\n\nRogue Legacy takes advantage of a distinct 16-bit graphical palette that adds to its old-school charm. Your on-screen avatars are pixelated and slightly deformed, holding his/her sword awkwardly as they run through the castle on short, stubby legs. Giant skeletons, headless horses, robed mages, and various other nefarious creatures attempt to halt your progress with colorful attacks and old-timey patterns requiring a great deal of memorization. Rogue Legacy isn't going to blow anyone away with amazingly intricate environments. You have a castle area, a forest area, and dungeon-y areas. Familiar almost to a fault, you'd be forgiven in thinking that this game is quant and simple... until you actually play it and get your ♥♥♥ handed to you.\n\nI died on the second room on my first castle run. This was my first real death, and there were many (...many) more before I finally started to get my bearings and understand the mechanics at play. Enemies hit hard and fast, barely giving you any time to figure them out before they fill the screen with large area-based attacks ranging from fireballs to ice blasts and everything in-between. Controlling your character feels almost too precise and tight for this type of game. You can easily change direction mid-jump, and you'll probably overcorrect and hurt yourself if you grew up with the Belmonts. Within an hour, though, the controls feel great and really open you up to pulling off some intense maneuvers and stunts, though the downward strike necessary for some traversal mechanics never feels quite right.\n\nI didn't really understand Rogue Legacy when I first started playing and grew frustrated quickly as a result. Dying so early without any real progress felt odd, and I was rolling my eyes with some of the "gotcha" moments with spike traps and large enemies hitting me immediately after a screen transition. Death, however, reveals the wonderfully modern conventions of RL that make it stand out amongst a sea of "old-school" games released during this massive indie boom in the industry. Every time you die, you select a new character from a list of three, and then you get the opportunity to spend your ancestor's hard-earned loot on upgrades for your family. These range from the ability to lock the randomly designed castle into its previous incarnation to new character classes and stat boosts. Better still, Rogue Legacy incentivizes you to spend all of that money because you go back down to zero upon reentering the castle. Leveling your family yields huge results that fundamentally changes the way you play the game and perceive death. Dying results in initial disappointment, followed by the joy of selecting skills and stats, and then finally a return to the castle to find more loot. It's truly wicked game design, provoking you to play just one more character before turning the game off. You're almost always unlocking new pieces of gear or abilities, and you even get to tailor your play style with runes and special skills. Maybe you like to focus on double jumping, or perhaps you want to lower the level of your enemies but receive reduced rewards as a result. Rogue Legacy feels deeply personal and meticulously constructed, never coming across as a tedious affair.\n\nCharacter selection quickly becomes the driving force when you venture into the castle. The classes all perform differently and most are best suited for certain situations. The speedy, hard-hitting ninja makes regular enemies feel like a joke, but he is probably too squishy for some of the more terrifying bosses. The miner gets a huge boost to gold pickups, making him an essential part of your family's economy. Still, some classes feel a bit useless if you haven't invested enough of your family's fortune into their chosen stat. My mages felt horribly underpowered, making some runs more frustrating than others. This becomes truly detrimental when trying to tackle one of the game's bosses. I waited nearly six generations before finally getting a paladin capable of taking out the last boss, which proved more aggravating than exhilarating. Sure, I was able to power level a bit, but I wanted to get something done, and it's hard to break from that line of thought when you die waiting to accomplish a goal. This was the one time Rogue Legacy frustrated me, but that comes with the randomization of both the castle and your family tree.\n\nNearly every selected character brings along some kind of trait to liven up the gameplay a bit. One guy might be colorblind, leading to a black and white screen, while another character may have irritable bowel syndrome, resulting in a great deal of fart noises coming from your speakers. Usually, these traits provide little more than entertainment and a bit of individual flavor for each excursion, but they can sometimes prove beneficial or outright disastrous to your forward momentum. I was never a fan of getting characters who are giant, for example, as this made them an easy target for some of the nasty projectile attacks enemies like to spam.\n\nRogue Legacy makes a lot of really smart decisions to keep it feeling fresh while maintaining some pretty old-school game design. "Hard but fair" usually comes to mind whenever you finally fall victim to the onslaught, but randomness brings both variety and some frustration to the proceedings. You have to go with the flow and understand that maybe you won't get the right class for a given situation, that some people just aren't meant to vanquish evil. Some of your offspring may be simple cannon fodder, while others are little more than accountants looking to build up your future heroes. Death is almost a reward in a way, and perhaps more designers should look to keep things fresh and interesting even when the dreaded "Game Over" finally appears on screen.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 13, 2015","true","48.6"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","0"

My opinions on Rogue Legacy have shifted substantially since my first review. I still recommend the game, but with some caveats.\n\nAfter some time away from the game, I found the combat to be clunkier and shallow. Armed with short range and a delayed swing, combat can feel sloppy. Once the enemies gain speed and more attacks, your sole weapon feels underwhelming. Enemies are primarily ranged, and you'll eventually wish for more mobility and a smaller hitbox. By my third playthrough,some rooms became true bullet-hells, except randomly constructed instead of the tightly crafted affairs in other games. Later rooms can be more hectic than any of the bossfights, and some rooms will have unavoidable damage with the number of enemies filling the screen with projectiles.\n\nI do feel like the game is very fair in the first two completions, even into the third with Difficulty decreasing runes. Beyond that, the game starts to suffer from an abundance of enemy projectiles without the means to avoid them. The health system is a bandaid fix, with each room slowly wittling your health down unless you get random food drops, or abuse life drain on slimes. By 30 hours, I'd seen (almost) everything, and I don't enjoy the game nearly as much. Unfortunately, even with all my complete runs and dozens of partials, I have yet to see the plant miniboss. Until the RNG decides to bless me, I have to do partial runs just to search for this miniboss. It's the only thing keeping me from 100%, and it's ridiculous. I've killed other minibosses over 5 times, and never seen just one.\n\nI loved Rogue Legacy. It is a great value. But the way it is designed, it ends up running into a wall. This is a rougelite that can (and should) wrap up nicely in 30 hours of play. Rogue purists may dislike that the replayability runs dry. It's a great game to start in the genre, and can be as easy or hard as you want by New Game +1. Just be careful running that +1 much higher, or you may grow weary.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nI'm incredibly hooked on Rogue Legacy since I picked it up. Spelunky was pushing me to improve my skills after I bought that recently, but little issues bothered me. Rogue Legacy hits some of the same points (looting, combat, random areas) but improves on what I want. Runs never feel like a waste, as gold can aid your progression. Combat feels crisp for being mostly melee, and the enemies are appealing. The style is humorous and compelling. It feels great to improve as a player along with stronger character stats. The design pushes random luck down in the equation, since loot is progressive. There is no single game-breaking item that makes winning a run easy.\n\nI don't yet have the words to express why I love the game so much. It's hooked me hard.  A rogue-like with strong combat and a "Just 1 more time" appeal, it's hard to find major issues. The game could get too easy or pointless once you unlock and complete everything, but most games do the same.\n\nThis game has caused me butt pain from sitting and playing so much. I wish I had gotten it sooner. Easily worth full price.","December 30, 2014","true","46.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Expect no less. In the beggining it can be frustrating, but once you get a feel for the game and manage to survive long enough each round to get a nice amount of money for upgrades, the rounds will get slightly easier.\n\nClasses and Runes: Some challenges will be made easier (or "not impossible) if you use the right adventurer class, equipment and pick the right runes (that can give you abilities like double jump and dashing - crucial for some challenges).\n\nSyndromes: Since you can choose which adventurer to use, in most cases you can pick an adventurer that have positive benefits from syndromes (one of them makes you undetectable to mechanical spike traps; another shows the position of enemies on your map), which makes the syndromes not much of a main feature at all.\n\nPlatformer: It may not appeal to you (I personally am not a fan of platformers), but those who like the platformer genre will have it's classical feel - and platforming skills is required to survive longer or beat some challenges. Those who are not very good at it can find a way around it (with upgrades, mostly).\n\nMay feel repetitive: Even though the castle's chambers are random in each round, there's around 4 different types of castle "areas" and their monsters are always the same. Each area has upgraded versions of previous monsters (and some introduces new ones), showing little diversity.\nGetting upgrades and the sense of achievement of surviving previously impossible areas helps, but eventually you'll wonder if all that you're doing is part in a grindfest.\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, a nice little game worth $5~$10 if you're into it, but research a little about it so you won't get frustrated and leave it unplayed in your library.\nRemember that Losing is Fun and make that colorblind, OCD Knight bring in some money!","November 20, 2013","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game expects you to "die" to symbolize working to death for the greater good of the economy. This worker never gets to benefit from the fruits of his endeavors but his children and the various "merchants" will. Sadly the money gained only leads to the next generations dependency forcing them to also enter the "castle" and work themselves to death for the greater good continuing the cycle of economic growth.

This game is very fair, no cheap tricks or absurd situations to prevent you from winning. Success is determined by your skill and how you choose to upgrade the manor, armor and runes. However, you can expect to die a significant amount in this game but unlike most other rogue-likes where you lose your progress when you die, in Rogue Legacy dying is actually a part of how you procede through the game (technically you can beat the game without dying but it is extremely difficult). The game's combat system is very well balanced and places a large focus on using abilities and hero classes properly. The level generation is also very good, I have played through the castle inumerable times and never once has it looked the same. However, the best part of the game for me are the hero's random conditions, they add a new level of entertainment to the gameplay and serve to keep it fresh as well as to provide humor (for those who find IBS hilarious).

But that fact doesn't stop me from enjoying it! I'm a huge fan of the Castlevania series and that's exactly what hooked me into this amazing game.To get you an idea this game is "Spelunky meets Castlevania", it's as difficult as Spelunky (ok ok! maybe a bit less...) and as good as a Castlevania.\n\nBasically you have your hero, the one who increases it's stats every time you level up or add new equipment, and the bad guys, from zombies to deadly plants to cursed knights.But the different thing is that every time you die, "your son" (or daughter) takes your place on this mighty quest.So, every time you die, you'll be given the chance to choose between 3 new heroes, which will be randomly generated with different class, bouns and... imperfections, some of them are stupid (and fun), some of them are more bonus than they look like! and others are just downsides to the character.\n\nAlso the Castle, which is the scenario for this adventure, is procedurally generated, much like Spelunky but with a twist... there are four zones: Castle, Forest, Tower and Catacombs, they will always remain in the same "zone" for example, Catacombs are always at the bottom of the map, but how you get there is what it changes. In each of these zones you have a Boss fight waiting between all the gold, enemies and hidden treasures and that's the goal of the main game. In order to get to the final boss you have to defeat it's four guardians first, but not necesarily in a single play... if your character dies after defeat a boss, it stays dead forever, the tricky thing is on getting to know the castle which you already know, it changes... but! you can stop it from changing thanks to an upgrade bought in you home (oh yes you have a home full of upgrades and improvements, also a smith to forge you new weapons and a gipsy to give you new enhancements and...) which is an architecht who'll stop the castle from changing... for a price of course!\n\nAnd, whats more to say?

Rogue Legacy features simple combat and a persistant upgrade system that allow you to progress your characters, allowing for some forgiveness in an otherwise relentless roguelike.  Designed for short, rewarding runs, you'll find yourself wanting to pick up and play whenever you get a few spare moments.  The constant flow of gold and upgrades hook you in, making you want to keep coming back for more.  Some of the traits are a bit hazy as to their effect, and many of them are downright debilitating but offer a degree of variation to each attempt, as do the spells and classes.  While limited at first, the number of character combinations grows as you unlock classes and equipment.

Music is good, sound effects, graphics they are all good. One thing I really like is that enemies don't respawn after you clear a room. This alone makes this game one of the "fairest" sidescrollers ever.\n\nBeing a roguelike you would expect this game to be unfairly hard, but the developers didn't call this game "rogue-lite" for no reason. This game can actually be considered very easy if you compare it with most rogue-likes. After you die you get to transfer your gold, items, runes and upgrades to your next character, so you will keep getting stronger.

Basically the game starts by picking a hero, then you proceed into a castle and kill stuff until you die.  When you die, your gold items found etc. go to your next hero (your kid/descendent) which allows you to keep building your heroes until they get stronger and stronger.  As you get more and more money you can also purchase upgrades and new heroes.  This makes it so you can kind of focus on upgraded the heroes you really like, but there is never any guarantee that your choices among descendents will ever be one of your preferred classes.  This adds a lot of randomization which is really fun to mess around with.  Also your descendents can have a wide variety of afflictions like being obsessive compulsive, having tourette syndrome, and even irritable bowel syndrome.   Some of these are just simple funny things, but some of them can change how your character works completely (for example if you are nearsighted, everything farther away is blurry).  Overall it is a great game that seems to have a lot of replayability (the castle you enter changes with each descendent unless you activate a certain upgrade) and for as cheap as the game is i'd say you are going to get your money's worth.","November 28, 2013","true","20.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool4279/recommended/241600/","joecool4279","JoeCool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool4279/","4975 products in account","Note: I posted an update at the end. I wrote my original review after a few hours of gameplay. The update is after 18 hours and changes my opinion on the game somewhat.\n\nThis is a really fun game. I've been hooked on it the last two or three days. You start with one hero and you venture off into the castle. The layout is randomized each time you play. You fight enemies, leap over spikes, the usual platform game challenges. I don't really like platform games, but this has become an exception. I'm not very skilled with these types of games and my character dies A LOT. But every time you run through the game, you collect money, runes, and equipment to build yourself up. You also gain levels which appears to boost hp/mp.\n\nWhen you lose, you start again, purchasing your upgrades, then venturing into a new castle totally unlike the one you last explored. There's an option to lock them down (for a 40% cut in gold intake), but it means that when you go back in any treasure chests you opened are already used, so you have to explore deeper to find new treasure. Each time you start again, you choose a new hero, which can range from spell casters to strong melee to heavy armor/high hp, to low hp spelunkers that reveal chests on the map. It's a nice variety. Also, some of the characters have status effects like "colorblind" where the levels are black and white, which can add challenge by making it more difficult to separate some enemies from the backgrounds. There is also near-sightedness which creates a blur on the screen outside a certain range of vision. There's even one that makes you play the game upside-down. I tried that one once and avoid it at all costs now.\n\nI think the main draw of this game is that you can load this up with the intention of killing 20-30 minutes and it's still fun 2 hours later. It can be frustrating though. With randomized layouts, some rounds are going to be significantly more difficult than others. Fairy Chest rooms are the worst, sometimes having rules that just don't make sense like "no jumping" when the entire room is a series of platforms over spikes. Even if you run through the spikes, you still need to jump out of them at the end. Maybe there are runes to overcome this that I will find later.\n\nAs you upgrade your character, the gold cost of upgrades naturally increases. I'd imagine at some point this cost will become excessive, as I am already struggling to bring in enough gold for some upgrades as it is. The worst part is that you have to use your gold or lose it before reentering the castle. You have to give up any remaining gold you have to enter, so if the cheapest upgrade you have access to is 650 gold and you have 640, goodbye all 640 gold. You can reduce this toll but it costs a lot to upgrade and it appears the max is probably going to be a 30% reduction. I've only done 1/5 reductions. They don't really seem worth it, so I've been investing in more useful upgrades.\n\nThe music is good, the layouts are interesting, the game is challenging. There isn't much in terms of story. You uncover short journals as you progress. It's fine that the game is lacking in story, however. It's not the point of the game. It keeps you going with the action non-stop (except for selecting your upgrades).\n\nLastly, boss battles seem disproportionately difficult for the rest of the game. I'm level 60 or so now and it's getting pretty easy to clear the castle (even for someone who is terrible at these types of games), but the bosses are much much stronger than anything else you encounter.\n\nUpdate: After playing for 18 hours, I've pretty much burned out on this game. All I do at this point is run dungeons over and over and over collecting money to spend on upgrades, so that hopefully I'll one day beat bosses outside the first area (the castle). The costs on everything keep going up, so it's an incredibly slow grind to unlock the incredibly large amount of upgrades. On top of that, after 18 hours I'm only level 150. I've read that the level cap is just over 500. Assuming that exp to level up increases per level, it would take 60+ hours to reach level 500. That is way too much of a time investment into grinding. I never minded putting large amounts of hours into games like Final Fantasy 7, for example, because at least you're progressing through a story at the same time. Rogue Legacy has no story.\n\nDo I still recommend this game? Sure. I did enjoy it for 18 hours. That's a nice turnaround on a $5 game (on sale). If you're looking for a game you'll finish, however, this one probably isn't it.","December 12, 2013","true","23.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Your progress in the dungeon is completely lost, however, and the format of the dungeon changes each time you enter it.\n\nThe combat is fun, the sprites are charming, some of the genetic quirks heirs inherit are funny/cute/useful and as is typical with rogue-likes, you feel yourself improving and getting better at the game as time goes on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/241600/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","I ran forward through the castle complex, but no matter how hard I squinted, the world outside the small bubble of clarity around me remained blurry and out of focus. “Damn this short-sightedness,” I muttered before hacking at a beast in my path. Nothing. The damn blade passed right through it. Oh great, I’m seeing things again. Dementia’s a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nWelcome to Rogue Legacy, a game quite unlike anything else I’ve come across. Looking for all the world like a 2D action-platformer, behind the charming pixel art presentation is a consistently surprising experience, packing a dizzying array of variables.\n\nIt’s all anchored by robust Roguelike game design, which means a procedurally generated world and perma-death. Each time you enter the castle, its layout and the challenge ahead will be different, and if you die, well, that’s the end of that hero - it’s time to send one of his heirs in to try and finish the job. Thankfully, the meta-game lets you spend any gold earned during the last run on your family’s fort, which means unlocking new classes and perks, and upping your stats for the next attempt.\nCaption\n\nThe core sword and spell action-platforming is tightly designed.\n\nAnd boy, there’s going to be a lot of attempts. When you first start playing Rogue Legacy you might last a minute or two before succumbing to one of the ghouls, undead, or other nasties that lurk inside the castle complex. It’s a classic 30-second gameplay loop – hacking, slashing, running, jumping, dashing, evading, and spellcasting, repeated until you die. This core gameplay is compelling in and of itself - Rogue Legacy is wonderful to control provided you have a good gamepad - but to make true progress you’ll need to boost your stats, get better equipment and activate perks. Gradually your runs will get longer and longer. Then you’ll wander into a higher-level area and die almost instantly.\n\nThe cycle of life, eh?\n\nIt’s an excellent way to structure the challenge, and really puts the fear of god into you. You may be kicking ♥♥♥ in what amounts to Rogue Legacy’s foyer, but boy, you’re not ready for the forest yet, or – god forbid – the dank dungeons underneath the castle. This is a game where your best option is to turn and run away if you enter an area you’re not ready for. This is a game where it may be several hours before you beat the first boss – despite being able to reach it in a matter of minutes - and many more before you’re ready for the next. Good thing the bosses stay dead after you die, otherwise beating Rogue Legacy would be an even more distant prospect.\nCaption\n\nThe bosses can be next to impossible with the wrong character, but as you'd expect, learning their attack patterns is key.\n\nNow, levelling up is all well and good, but Rogue Legacy has one very unique trick up its sleeve in addition to this. I’ve already mentioned that you send an heir in to continue the fight after each death, but you actually get a choice of three, and each has a random class, random spell, and random traits. Traits? Yup, and they’re glorious, surprising and bewildering. Ever played as a hero suffering from vertigo and OCD? How about a colour blind protagonist who also has Alzheimer’s? ADHD and dementia anyone? Tunnel vision and irritable bowel syndrome? The list goes on and on.\n\nThe really clever part of this system is that many of these traits have significant gameplay ramifications: ADHD means you move faster, far-sightedness and near-sightedness leave areas of the screen blurry, and characters with dementia will hear things and see enemies that aren’t there. Dwarves, meanwhile, are so light and small they don’t activate spiked floor panels and can access areas no other characters can.\n\nOf course, some traits really have been included just for fun. Dyslexia, for instance, means any in-game text is garbled, while a character with coprolalia (Tourette’s syndrome) will swear any time he or she gets hit. Heroes with hypochondria, on the other hand, will have much larger numbers pop up any time they take damage, while you’ll probably avoid vertigo at all costs – unless you’re a masochist – because who wants their world to be upside down? Getting your head around the traits system is all about working out what comes with meaningful changes to the world and how that factors into your play style.\n\nThe world near long-sighted heroes is out of focus.\n\nCool, right? And that’s really just a taste – there’s plenty more for you to discover when you play it yourself... which you absolutely should. The traits are just one facet, too. Once you factor in the ten classes and all the spells characters can have, the list of potential combinations is incredibly long.\n\nIt really is pot luck, and no matter how far through the meta-game you are, you will never know exactly what to expect. Of course, the further in you are, the more you’ve honed your skills and come to know how best to use each class, trait, and spell, and – crucially – how to select the random character that you can best utilise.\n\nThe learning curve is right on the money, and almost every run has something to teach you, whether it’s an epic boss-killing mission with a heaven-sent character that’s able to survive a wide-roaming journey through the castle, or an abject, miserable failure with the best of a bad bunch. Mind you, the random nature of Rogue Legacy won’t be to everyone’s tastes - getting a series of dud characters can definitely feel punitive at times, as opposed to a learning experience.\nCaption\n\nEvery class differs in core stats and special ability, while equipment and enchantments are class agnostic.\n\nThankfully, the mix of enemies is quite compelling. Each area introduces new enemies - ninjas in Hannya masks, headless horses that charge the player - as well as fresh variants on old designs. Juggling a set of monsters with their own disparate attack patterns is a big part of the challenge. The five bosses represent a good mix of bullet hell and precision platforming too, whether you’re facing a huge flaming skull or a gigantic gelatinous blob.\n\nThe castle holds more surprises than just rooms full of enemies. Special rooms abound, including carnival games, shrines, mini-boss battles, and plenty more. Perhaps the most interesting, however, are the fairy chest rooms. Each has a very specific challenge for you to beat. Kill everything! Get to the chest without jumping! Don’t fight! Don’t take damage! You get the idea.\n\nUnlocking a fairy chest will net you a rune that can be equipped for specific perks, like air-jumping, dashes, limited flight, extra gold, reflecting damage taken back onto enemies, gaining health/mana from kills, and so on. Best of all, these runes stack. So if you want to, you can spec your character with highly customised ability sets. Multiple air-jumps? Don’t mind if I do!\n\nWhile some of the fairy chest rooms can be conquered by almost any character, others require particular traits or sets of runes. Thankfully, you can use the Architect - one of three characters unlocked via your fort (alongside the Smithy and Enchantress) - to lock down the layout of the castle for successive attempts. He’s a great inclusion, and indicative of Rogue Legacy’s ability to balance random elements with tight, fair game design.\n\nIn fact, if that balance was wrong, this game wouldn’t be anywhere near as compelling. It’s a testament to Cellar Door Games that the team was able to juggle so many elements and make it work.\n\nIt’s one hell of a meaty undertaking too. The most adept players will be able to beat it in about 15 hours, whereas I sunk in considerably more time than that. It’s a lot of gaming for only $15 (USD $17 on PlayStation), and once you’ve finished your first play-through, New Game + awaits, which lets you keep all your stats, weapons and runes, but gives you a much harder variant of the castle to beat.\n\n9/10\n","April 25","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Once you die, you get to pick one of your 3 randomly assigned childeren to carry on your Legacy.  That's not all though, each child will have a certain set of traits, or lack there of, that they come with.  Such as, Stereoblind(doesn't see in 3d), Far-sighted(everything up close is blurry), Dwarfism(TINY), etc.  Thus in doing so, the randomness of each kid isn't just based on their class, but small elements that will affect your game play, and style.  On top of death being a part of the game, the Castle you are trying to conquer will change each death, later this can be stopped for a price, and again in doing so, keeps you on your toes and always learning.  The game play is intense, and you are bound to get upset once or twice due to sheer bad luck or inability to get your crap together (me) for that playthrough.  The game has a ton to offer in the sense of leveling up, each death you keep your gold, you come back with it, spend it on upgrades, which unlock more upgrades, and in doing so, you improve your chances of moving further along in the Castle to defeat all the bosses.  The game can be simple at times, and hair pulling at others, and once you think you have it all down pat, you'll unlock some remixed bosses that will surely have you cussing at how the level of hard they are shoving in your face.\n\nAll in All this was by far my favorite game purchase this christmas(2013), and I spent many a nights trying to bring this puppy to its knees. Fun graphics, great humor at times, lots of deaths, and tons and tons of fun to finish.  If you enjoy somethign that'll keep you on your toes, and let you feel that old school level of fun again, Rogue Legacy is certainly for you.","January 4, 2014","true","42.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Traditionally, Roguelikes were hard, but they were rarely ever about cheap deaths.  Being cautious is what led you to success in those older Rogue style titles, not constantly being killed.  I wonder if a lot of devs these days ever played the old titles they claim to be tributing, because even though a lot of older RPGs had higher difficulty curves and things like perma-death, it was always sort of an element to the game rather than being its defining factor.  Games with harsh difficult like Dark Souls are offset by the fact that deaths are a learning experience and tactics matter, but none of those things really apply to Rogue Legacy because it's all so thoroughly random.   This, in and of itself, really wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact you are constantly punished by having your money taken away when you restart which effectively makes the challenge far more unreasonable.  I could also put up with the inclusion of ridiculous insta-death crap more if the controls were better but as it stands they are awful.  There's is a detectable lag between button presses and on-screen action (just the tiniest lag, but just enough to make it feel murky), and the movement controls are terrible with a controller or keyboard.  Barely moving the 360 controller stick results in your character moving some random distance from where they were.  performing platforming parts are excruciating because of this.  There is no tight accuracy, like what you would need to play it properly.  I have no problem with hardcore difficulty or random elements, but it all just seems like it wasn't really thought out very well and the game effectively relies on you dying hundreds of deaths just to make progress.  I can see why a lot of people like it, but it didn't sit well with me and might not really work for others.  I got it in a bundle, so I can't say I don't feel like I've been ripped off, though.","January 6, 2014","false","1.7"," 31 of 59 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","31","59","0","1"

The idea is that death is permanent but you can use the collected gold on your new hero (you choose a new hero every time you die). With the gold you can buy upgrades to become stronger. Then when you want to enter the world of monsters again, all (or most) gold will be given to the creature that guards the castle. Eventually, you become strong enough to battle the bosses in the castle.\n\nThe beauty of the game is that almost everything is randomized. The game world changes with every playthrough and the hero you choose at the start (you can pick out of three randomized heroes), will have unique stats and traits as well (Class, Spell, Traits, Etc). So, while the game has a simple concept, there is actually a lot of gameplay. There is also a huge list of unlockables (Runes, Gear, Classes, Bonuses, Stats) which you pay for with gold so the game offers lots of content.\n\nThe controls are top notch and every death feels legit. You are the only one to blame. The game is not easy tho. Especially at the start, death will come swift and often. But the quick games and addictive gameplay will lure you back to the game in no time.\n\nDefinitely recommend buying this game when it's up for sale.","December 25, 2013","true","34.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You finish it and you get to play a harder version, with monster lvls scaling with yours.... yea, its tough, it scales and it allows for hours and hours of fun.\n\nRpg, action, platformer, that will make you laugh everynow and then and get you playing for hours without an end, because when it ends, did it really?\n\nBtw, the story is really legit. It is simple enough to present the awesomeness that is this game and cool enough to make you grin and applaud at the end.\n\n10/10","January 21, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Can be brutally quick at times, a real challenge to make progress. As you "slowly" build up coin and skills, it can start to get easier to pass certain challenges. But the ever-changing design of the level makes it interesting also. Having a random generated castle each time you die makes it so you can't learn the layout and fly through those parts repeatedly, so you do have to be careful for each room you enter.\n\nThe new character (offspring, lol) with different "traits" can be fun, but i dont like that it also randomly selects the class for each one. Several times I could only choose from characters of the same class, and as you get skills for a certain class you want to select that one most often only to not have it show up enough. But this does give it an interesting challenge in its own right.\n\nOh, and the stupid gate keeper guy that takes all your gold each time to enter castle.  FRUSTRATING!\nI realize people enjoy these types of games, just not my cup o tea.  But its fun all-in-all.","January 2, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My first few characters got destroyed. Almost instantly. With each new generation though, I was able to get stronger, and buy better equipment (as well as learn the enemies.) Eventually I could clear out all of the areas (not counting bosses) with ease.\n\nWhen I beat the first boss, it was a turning point for me. I felt accomplished, and gained a ton of gold with which to upgrade my lineage.\n\nThen I spent a fair amount of time grinding gold to upgrade (NOTE: you would not need to do this as much as I did.)\n\nWhen I decided to go after the remaining bosses I was able to easily take out the 2nd, then grind a bit more before the 3rd. By that point, the 4th as well as the final boss were both easy for me (as I tend to grind too much.)\n\nIf you like platformers, with or without rogue-like elements, or vice-versa, definitely pick this game up. I think I put in about 20 hours before going after the final couple bosses (could have done it much sooner probably,) and I am looking forward to new challenges with the Neo-bosses and New Game+ run-throughs.","June 16, 2014","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Controls are tight, tons of loot, a vast array of baddies, and a lot of customization options.\n\nHowever, there isn't much of a story.  Boss battles are fun, but can be quite challenging.  That's good though, as you can get many hours out of this title because of it's challenge and replay value.  There are a good deal of characters you can pick from, each with their own abilities.  It should be noted, however, that each character usually also has a querk, too.  For instance, some characters play the game up-side-down.  Others are color-blind.  Some have flatulence issues.\n\nSo, I HIGHLY reccamend Rogue Legacy.

Your heir inherits the gold collected on your previous runs and can use it to upgrade Castle Components for new classes and permanent benefits, Forge New Weapons and Armor with statistical upgrades and powers and Enchant Runes that slot into each piece of equipment which grant you important skills to customize your character to your play style. All these upgrades carry forward to each heir in succession, slowly growing your legacy and power and allowing you to more quickly dispatch enemies and make more and more progress.\n\nHumorous randomly assigned Traits (some cosmetic, some debilitating, some extremely beneficial) keep things fresh and endearingly hilarious on each run. This allows you to stay invested until your skills are good enough that the challenge of the level matches your understanding of the system and you to begin to use strategy to plan our your next assault choosing the hero with the class, traits or spells that would best suit your next run's goals.\n\nSecret Areas, Chests and Skill Based Challenges make each new room of the castle an intriguing surprise as you hope for another armor blueprint, magic rune, or pile of gold that will allow you to purchase more upgrades and finally defeat that next ridiculous boss that has haunted you for generations.\n\nThe game's nostalgia value, smooth, simple controls and delightful humor draw you in, and it's upgrade and advancement system keeps you eagerly playing. The game overall is an impressive, innovative and rewarding title and aside from the difficulty, there is little not to like about this incredible indie game.","July 26, 2013","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It makes for a great experience. Even though the difficulty is a little much at first once you get stuck in you will have a great time. I think jumping and running through the castle feels really smooth and fun. The upgrades feel solid, but some aren't worth investing in, which makes for a little bit of a grind not like you werent going to do that anyways. The deal with Charon makes it more imperitive that you get enough money for an upgrade and spending most of your money before going in feels like a success. The bosses provide a good challenge and are well crafted. The monsters of the game are pretty unique and all offer their own challenge by themselves and together.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whymog/recommended/241600/","whymog","Whymog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whymog/","600 products in account","I figured Rogue Legacy would be a solid homage to the Metroidvania genre with a nice, difficult twist, but it goes so much further than that. With its compelling progression and customization systems and an excellent use of randomization, Rogue Legacy is a clear and definitive step forward for the genre.\n\nAny action-platformer game hinges on the player developing a set of reproducible skills -- learning how to read a room, confront enemies and chart a path through treacherous territory. Later Metroidvania games like Aria of Sorrow and Other M shied away from this and instead emphasized character empowerment and customization to the point where base skills like dodging and timing became almost unnecessary. Rogue Legacy deftly solves this problem by randomizing every room on each playthrough while also forcing the player to accept a unique set of strengths and weaknesses on each play session thanks to the game's hereditary system. After a couple hours, the player starts to understand the logic of the game: how each region works, where the greatest challenges are, how to chart a path through the castle and how to compensate for unexpected adversity. It's a brilliant example of a game that teaches the player a difficult and complex system at a steady pace over dozens of hours of play.\n\nIf you're a fan of Metroidvania games or a fan of challenging action-platformer games, you're more than likely going to get your money's worth out of Rogue Legacy. But if you appreciate dissecting and understanding great game design, Rogue Legacy is absolutely essential.","August 12, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When you die, you die for reals and you need to pick another descendent. There's a wall that keeps track of all of your failures so you can see how many people have died in the pursuit of a few more shekels of gold.\n\nEvery descendent has random stats and abilities which range from useful (everything you hit goes flying, you're as big as a giant, you can absorb a lot of damage) to stupid (everything is reflected like in a mirror, you have IBS, you are afraid of chickens). Each character also has random magic spells provided to them.

There's also a blacksmith and magical rune person that eat your money as well.\n\nThe goal is to power yourself up to kill the four bosses in the game which reign in four separate areas (since the game is randomly generated, you can generally find them by going far enough in any direction (i.e. up, down, left, right, etc).

Rogue Legacy does a really good job of creating a challenging game, but not making it so challenging to the point where you want to punch your computer screen. It can be hard starting out but once you start clearing out the castle more and beating a boss it feels so rewarding.

First, a controller is almost mandatory for this game. There's no mouse support, and while you can use two hands on a keyboard, it feels pretty awkward (and this game involves a lot of twitch reflexes and precision jumping). Also, there's an option to just press down to perform down attacks in the air or fall off platforms (I forget the name, but it should be obvious in the options menu) that's very helpful. And finally, try not to spend an excessive amount of time on the grind - if it's getting repetitive, clear through the bosses and attempt the next game mode. The Steam achievements for this game are actually a good balance of "difficult but not impossible," and getting all of them should indicate that you're essentially "done" with the game. You'll likely get 20-30 hours out of this game before getting that feeling of " why did I just waste all my time on that? " but if you enjoy a challenge and find it at a good price, it's definitely worth a look.\n\nRegular Review-y Part\nRogue Legacy is an excellent roguelike platformer with a clever continuity mechanic. Gold and items collected during dungeon attempts can be used to provide static stat bonuses for future attempts, allowing the player to shore up their weak spots and fueling the game's progression system. The different classes and powers (via glyphs) provide enough variety to keep subsequent dungeon runs varied and interesting.\n\nThe game can be punishing at first, but this is intentional, as it allows the player to see the effects of their stat purchases and armor upgrades, as well as their improving play. Rogue Legacy is a game that encourages player mastery - better play will lead to greater completion of the dungeon and more gold to spend for the next round. And just when you've gotten good enough to clear the dungeon and defeat all the bosses, the game will ramp up the difficulty with a "New Game +" mode. The new mode allows you to keep all your progress, but is balanced well enough that the previously easy intro part of the dungeon is now challenging again. The game also includes five "hidden" bosses, which are far more challenging versions of the standard bosses. These can be taken on at any time (your purchased stat bonuses don't affect the stats of the avatar during these challenges), but they provide a sort of endgame for players who have found the rest of the dungeon too repetitive. That said, I'd recommend looking up the slightly gamey strategy for defeating Alexander IV, as the "normal" strategy will lead to an absurdly challenging and probably frustrating fight.\n\nThe game isn't without its downsides. The grind can feel a little repetitive at times, and there could be more indication that defeating the bosses on the first run through isn't the end of the game (as it is, it's confusing that by the time you're able to tackle the bosses in the first playthrough you've barely bought into the stats, and you won't have found all the armors). Not helping the repetitiveness is the music. It's not bad, at first, but after a few hours you'll want to turn on something else with more variety. But in the end, those are two relatively minor downsides in an otherwise great game.","July 19, 2014","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far it's my most played game... Yeah, I don't play on my PC much. But that's not the point!\nRogue Legacy is an amazing game in which you play as a knight who travels through an unknown castle in order to slay the man that murdered their ancestor. Or something like that, the game is very thin on storyline...\nIn this game, you can play as a large variety of classes. From Knights and Mages, all the way to Shinobi (And Hokage, if you're a fan of Naruto, you'll catch the reference) and dragons!\nEvery single time you enter the castle, it's randomized. Unless you pay the architect to keep the pattern as it is. The random castles and different classes (I forgot to mention that each character has their own unique traits and/or disorders) really make the fun endless. You can upgrade your stats and armour ( or "armor" for the 'Muricans...) with the gold you collect, which makes the game a lot easier. But don't fear, the game never becomes too easy... The intense boss battles make a challenge, not to mention the bonus bosses bringing an awfully hard test for your skills...\nAs soon as you beat the game, you can go through it again with harder enemies in New Game Plus. At the moment, I'm halfway through NG+2\nMan, I've been typing for a while... So I'm gonna wrap this up and say this game is FAULTLESS! I give it a 10/10 and a nice, gentle, no-homo, hug for the creators. (That sounded VERY homo... How about just a handshake? A pat on the back?

Every time you die, the castle gets procedural rebuilt, and you choose a new character from three randomly generated options. Before beginning each time, you get to upgrade your "manor," which essentially upgrades every character going forward.\n\nI give it a B-.

I'm always interested to see the interesting twists that indie developers put on rogue-likes (FTL, Isaac, The Pit, etc.), and this game certainly doesn't disappoint in that aspect. It separates itself from the rest of the pack with its unique mechanics and progression system, and is just downright fun to play. Definitely worth buying for anyone that is a fan of the genre.","July 9, 2013","true","25.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because gold and upgrades carry over between characters, permadeath doesn't make you feel like your run was wasted when you eventually miss a jump and fall onto a bed of spikes. Combat is fairly simple, but pleasantly fast-paced, and the assorted challenge rooms, random positive and negative perks, and various other nuances make repeated trips into the castle very entertaining. I do wish there was a bit more enemy variety (there's a fair number of palette swaps), and some of the rooms show up more often than I'd like, but overall Rogue Legacy is definitely worth a look for platformer fans and roguelike fans alike.","July 22, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After every run, you'll promise yourself you'll step after this next one, and then three hours later you'll still be playing.\n\nI'm consistently surprised by how many new things there are to unlock with the gold earned during my runs, which in turn improve future characters and enable more options for those future characters to potentially have. Initially, you can use a Knave, a Knight, a Mage, and a Barbarian. At this point in the game, my heir can potentially be a Paladin, a Barbarian King, a Archmage, a Assassin, a Hokage, a Miner, a Lich King, or a Spellsword. Adding to that the numerous traits, like ADHD, Dementia, Dwarfism, etc, many of which have actual gameplay benefits/downsides, and the amount of variables is ♥♥♥♥ing enormous.\n\nYou should play this game.","July 1, 2013","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Controls are tight, tons of loot, a vast array of baddies, and a lot of customization options.\n\nHowever, there isn't much of a story.  Boss battles are fun, but can be quite challenging.  That's good though, as you can get many hours out of this title because of it's challenge and replay value.  There are a good deal of characters you can pick from, each with their own abilities.  It should be noted, however, that each character usually also has a querk, too.  For instance, some characters play the game up-side-down.  Others are color-blind.  Some have flatulence issues.\n\nSo, I HIGHLY reccamend Rogue Legacy.

Your heir inherits the gold collected on your previous runs and can use it to upgrade Castle Components for new classes and permanent benefits, Forge New Weapons and Armor with statistical upgrades and powers and Enchant Runes that slot into each piece of equipment which grant you important skills to customize your character to your play style. All these upgrades carry forward to each heir in succession, slowly growing your legacy and power and allowing you to more quickly dispatch enemies and make more and more progress.\n\nHumorous randomly assigned Traits (some cosmetic, some debilitating, some extremely beneficial) keep things fresh and endearingly hilarious on each run. This allows you to stay invested until your skills are good enough that the challenge of the level matches your understanding of the system and you to begin to use strategy to plan our your next assault choosing the hero with the class, traits or spells that would best suit your next run's goals.\n\nSecret Areas, Chests and Skill Based Challenges make each new room of the castle an intriguing surprise as you hope for another armor blueprint, magic rune, or pile of gold that will allow you to purchase more upgrades and finally defeat that next ridiculous boss that has haunted you for generations.\n\nThe game's nostalgia value, smooth, simple controls and delightful humor draw you in, and it's upgrade and advancement system keeps you eagerly playing. The game overall is an impressive, innovative and rewarding title and aside from the difficulty, there is little not to like about this incredible indie game.","July 26, 2013","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The enimies are varied and intersting, esepcially the mini-bosses, even though at the beginning, you won't last very long. If you continue playing though, your skills will increase, as well as your armour, runes and stats. The 4 main bosses of each area are fun and are diffuclt, being extremley hard to beat them on your first time ( except the 4th boss, he is too weak to be the 4th area boss.) The controls are very good, with all the key assingments feeling natural. The finally thing is that the music in Rogue Legacy is some of the finest indie music I've heard. Overall, If you are a fan of Metroid, or the Metroid-Vanias, or are looking for a great indie game, this is the game for you. Also, on a side note, my longest living character was a midget, bald, assaisan.","September 17, 2014","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, that baby would be monstrous, but its name would be none other than Rogue Legacy. In RL, you attempt to trudge through a randomly generated castle, collecting as much money as possible, beating back baddies, gathering up blueprints and runes, and hopefully taking out a boss or two.  The goal is to take out the four main bosses from the five different areas of the castle, then proceed to the main antechamber where you’ll fight the final bosses.\n\nOf course, you won’t survive. Neither will your child. Or your children’s children. And so on. What gives? Well see, the only way you improve is by spending money outside the castle to build up your fort and buy new equipment and runes…but once you enter the castle, you don’t leave.  Your children will take your place when you die, first starting at the fort to build stuff up, then arriving at the castle to start the journey over again anew.\n\nWith all the ridiculous classes, traits, skills, equipment, and all the rest, the game constantly presents itself as an original challenge each time and is addictive as hell.

Dying in those games is very serious, you lose everything: Characters, stats, items, all gone. In that genre, death really means Game Over. But what if it didn’t have to be that way? Enter Rogue Legacy.\n\nYou are a warrior tasked with exploring a magical castle and defeating monsters within, with Castlevania-like gameplay that should be familiar to everyone. The twist is that, when you die, that character is gone, and you start playing as one of their heirs, with different traits and classes. The money and treasure gathered by the deceased are passed on, and you can spend them on upgrades and equipments for the new generations.\n\nThe game manages to keep a constant sense of progress with the upgrade system; dying is not the end, it’s the beginning of a new adventure where you’re likely to be better prepared. It’s not just about getting better stats and armor, either, you’ll also unlock new classes and mechanical improvements, like dashes and air jumps.\n\nYour descendants are, however, randomly generated. This goes for both class and traits, the latter of which are characteristics like "Glaucoma" or "Dwarfism" that can be very helpful, irrelevant, or highly crippling. The unreliability inherent to the heirs often forces you to adapt to something that "will do" instead of having the best for the task available, which makes victory all the more sweet.\n\nAnd of course, it wouldn’t be a roguelike if the journey through the castle was always the same. It changes, but not simply for each game: It changes on every single generation. This is why you don’t want to die too early: You miss the chance to get a lot of loot, and boss rooms are transferred elsewhere. On the other hand, a new character means new treasure to find, so it’s not that bad. It’s fun, both to win, and to lose.\n\nAnd that is Rogue Legacy: A game that avoids being frustrating, but still without making you feel you’re getting off easy. All the balance in the gameplay elements really shows that a lot of effort was put into making this game, and it paid off, because Rogue Legacy makes for a fantastic roguelike*, and probably for one of the best Castlevanias out there, too.\n\n* “Roguelite”, if you prefer.\n\nPS: Use of a controller is highly recommended.","January 26, 2014","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Several different character types allow for different play-styles and advantages in certain situations and against some enemies. The enemies scale with you and, though your stat, equip, and gamer skills improve, you will notice the enemies do not have to be one-hit kills if you do not want them to be. The bosses add a level of strategy and pattern memorization which is exciting the first time through; however, certain hidden bosses require more than a little luck.\n\nOverall, I found this to be a very fun SotN tribute and the progression kept me hooked for hundreds of generations.

Enter Rogue Legacy. A delightful "metroidvania-esque" game where you constantly die leaving an inheritance to your descendents, most the times with different disorders from dyslexia to dementia that can vary the game play and perception a bit. It's like hitting the genetic freak lottery jackpot sometimes in this game. Can be a lot of fun if you accept the inevitablity of death. As you progress through the game, you will notice that the castle changes with each generation, and every time you die, you leave and inheritance to your descendents which they can purchase manor upgrades that increase abilities and stats of your character or purchase equipment and/or spell runes from blueprints and runes (respectively) that you have found in the castle. After spending some time with this game, it has grown on me. It does a decent job of filling the void from having a lack of Castlevania on the PC (the 3D games are dead to me), and with its own charm, has made me a fan.","May 25, 2014","true","52.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only thing they have in common is that each run is different.\n\nIn Rogue Legacy, you are basically running around in a castle collecting as much money as you can (for your legacy) and killing monsters (for yourself). Each time you enter the castle, it is different inside. Once dead, you must choose a new heir (1 of 3) to explore the castle. Everyone is different. Everyone has a unique name, a class, a gender, and random attributes that make them unique. The money you earn goes to that heir and is used for purchases of items/upgrades/unlocks and must be used before going into the castle. What you choose to purchase stays for every character (equipable items can be switched/unequipped). Everyone gets 1 life to live.

The difficulty scales, so  no matter how much you grind, if you're not skilled enough, you won't be successful.\n\nControls are rock solid, the genealogy gimmick is well integrated and honestly doesn't add or take away much from the core game.\n\nI hope any sequel places a store inside the dungeon/castle so upgrades can be made during a run (maybe at a 15% markup), which would really open things up a bit.","March 13, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game's premise is built around going through successive generations to try to tackle a castle and the evils lurking inside, and with each new generation, you get to choose from among three new characters with randomly-determined character classes and perks.  All of the character classes have their uses (though some, like the Spellsword and Assassin are "better" than others), and the perks range from minor effects to things that VASTLY increase or decrease the challenge level of the game.  It's really fun to get to try out different combinations of character types and attributes to see which ones fit your playstyle the best.\nAnd now for the controls.  Responsive, intuitive, and just plain good.  The game has a great "feel" to it; from the impact and knockback from attacks, to the degree of movements it allows you for jumping, attacking and evading at once (which becomes especially useful on further playthroughs, as projectile and enemy counts get fairly ridiculous around NG+5 or so).\nAs for the difficulty:  yes, it is a challenging game.  However, the first few playthroughs can be gotten through simply enough just by raising your stats and getting fairly good at the game.  And then there are the NG+ modes (and the remix bosses that were recently added, for that matter).  These, which are completely optional, provide a much higher level of challenge to keep more seasoned gamers engaged.  Beating all of the remix bosses gave a greater sense of accomplishment than anything else in recent games for me.\n\nRating?  10/10.

The difficulty can disappear as you buy upgrades before you renter the castle, but it will return when you enter new parts of the Castle.  There's isn't much story to it, but then again I stopped reading the journal entries after 7/20 something. Your playable character is on a mission to find the fountain of youth which is hidden inside an enchanted castle. You will need to defeat 4 bosses, 1 from each section of the castle, then a final 2 part boss near the entrance. The final boss door remains locked until the 4 bosses are defeated. When you defeat the final boss you get a credit line you can't skip through, followed by a NEW GAME + mode where the castle's enemies are strengthened, which further ratchets up the difficulty.\n\nNow if none of this didn't sound interesting enough let me highlight some key gameplay features of Rogue Legacy.\n\n- Every time your character dies, he really dies. All of your stats, equipment and gold are transferred to a selectable heir in the next generation. You can choose from 3 possible heirs that will be randomly generated based on what classes you've unlocked. The next generation can have traits that can benefit or hamper gameplay, so from my experience avoid the upside down one at all cost!\n- After you choose your heir you can unlock stat bonuses, perks, abilities and classes from this FAMILY TREE menu. If you found gear or runes while in the castle, they are made available to buy outside the castle, but after you unlock the sales people.\n- You need to spend as much gold as possible before you renter the castle because there's a demon at the door that takes it all away! This fundamentally will make the game last longer, because you have to perform successful castle runs bringing back enough gold to upgrade or you can't improve the next generation.\n- You level up in the game, but it's irrelevant to determine how powerful your character is because your stats don't increase from your LV. All stat increase must be obtained from beating bosses, finding rare chests and slowing buying out the FAMILY TREE. Your level is a marker more for speed runners and hardcore players, like if you can beat the initial playthough of Rouge Legacy before LV 100 you're probably an experienced player. The higher the level the more time and opportunity you've had to buff up your character, which would make the game easy.\n- EVERY TIME YOU RENTER THE CASTLE IT RANDOMIZES. The layout of the castle will never be quite the same, or not where you would notice as your grind through heir after heir. This my friend, along with NEW GAME +, is the strength of Rouge Legacy.\n\nThe way I see it, this game would be too short if you leveled up too quickly, too boring if the castle stayed the same and too easy if they handed everything to you from the start. They've solved these problems with long grindy gameplay with randomly generated castle rooms, enemies and obstacles. It's an Indie game, so they gave you some room to stretch things out with limited resources. You will find the difficulty to be unbearable at the start, but as long as your bring gold and unlock thing your will gain momentum to do better and better. After you've unlocked everything and have bought everything you will still find value in the many consecutive NEW GAME +s  which seem to have no end.\n\nIt makes me wonder what they could do with a better budget without going all Call Of Duty on us. This is my favorite Indie game on Steam. This is supposed to come to PSN in 2014, by then way more people will know about this marvelous never ending game. For sheer fun and coming back for more, wow, it's a great spin on Symphony Of The Night. I can't give it a 5/5 because it lacks a certain gameplay depth I can't explain, it's not complex enough, but it's Indie so what do you expect?\n\n4.5/5","February 5, 2014","true","45.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My favorite rogue-like game, although it also served as my introduction to the genre. Even after playing a lot of others from the genre now, I still look back on Rogue Legacy as my favorite out of the bunch.\n\nThe game is presented in a pixel fashion, making use of some nice looking sprites for the various people and enemies you will meet along your journey. This style fits well, especially for a game of this genre. Come to think of it, I don't think I've played a rogue-like that was not in this style, and I've played several of them over the past several months. Can't really complain either, there's nothing wrong with it and I'd actually prefer this style in a rogue-like game, although I may be a bit biased there (heh).\n\nRogue Legacy's niche is the rebirth mechanic. Upon dying as one character, you'll have the choice as to which of the three offspring of that character you'll play as next. The interesting thing about this mechanic however, is that each child has separate traits, disguised as real world disorders and conditions. These can either be in your favor or against it. ADHD, for example, works in your favor in that your character will move 30% faster than usual. My favorite defect is vertigo, which mirrors the screen vertically. Yes, everything, including menus. Vertigo is a pain to deal with as I cannot rotate my monitor upside down, forcing me to play upside-down.\n\nAside from that gimmick, the other half of the game is the immense class and upgrade system. You'll start off with no skills, playing as the default class, the knight. Upon death, the opportunity to choose offspring with a different class is presented. The basic classes to choose from contain classes such as: mage, knave, knight, barbarian, shinobi, miner, etc. Each class can be upgraded, getting a name change in the process. The shinobi, for example, changes into the hokage, my favorite class. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages, keep that in mind.\n\nThe shinobi/hokage has the benefit of upgraded strength (175% to be exact), but at the cost of only having 60% HP, 40% MP, and not being able to take advantage of critical hits. I never really used the game's spells, so the MP cut didn't have much of an effect on me, but the HP and critical hits were quite the drawback. Even so, whenever I was given the opportunity to play as a hokage, I always took it. You can't beat 175% damage. I found it crucial to defeating some of the game's bosses. I actually defeated the forest boss (the second one I took on) without getting hit as a hokage, quite the achievement.\n\nOn top of the classes, there's also a plethora of upgrades to choose from each time you die. The upgrades are laid out in a branching format, with certain upgrades unlocking others. The first one made available is Smithy, the blacksmith. Once purchased, you'll be able to purchase both armor and weapons from him. There's also an architect (who can keep the last layout of the castle if you choose to not want the game to randomly generate another castle again) and an enchantress, who sells runes, which can be equipped to provide various abilities (like the ability to jump while in air).\n\nThe other upgrades consist of class upgrades (like barbarian -> barbarian king) and stat upgrades. This consists of mana, health, and equip upgrades. Equip upgrades allow you to carry more weight and is required if you ever want to wear good armor. There's plenty of other upgrades to base skills (attack up, magic damage up, armor up, etc.) and a few unique ones, like "death defy" and "haggle". Death defy, as you can probably tell, allows you to defy death (1.5% everytime the upgrade is purchased). Haggle, on the other hand, lowers Charon's toll when entering the castle.\n\nThe game's map is divided into five zones: the front "safe" area at the entrance to the castle, the castle, the maya (above the castle), the dungeon (below the castle), and the forest (to the right of the castle). Each area (aside from the safe area) has its own boss that needs to be defeated if you want to unlock the golden door at the entrance of the castle. These bosses are very difficult if you're not properly equipped (I did tell you about my love for the hokage class, right?). Each time you die and want to re-enter the castle, you'll have to give up all of your funds earned during the previous run to Charon, who guards the entrance to the castle.\n\nRogue Legacy is a fantastic game overall. The sense of progression is really profound and it just feels really, really satisfying to defeat the bosses and open that golden door. Now that it's only $15, why not give it a shot?","February 19, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sprite work in regards to both the enemies and the castle's various backgrounds is sharp, colorful, and all-around fantastic. Between the procedurally-generated castle layouts and the unique geneological trait system, the game is able to stay fresh from one run to the next and maintain a nice sense of randomness. The progression/skill tree is surprisingly deep and will require a lot of playtime to fill out. Intimidating bosses and rooms packed to the brim with enemies help create a healthy, satisfying challenge. I also like how the game gives you the freedom to explore the entire castle right off the bat, yet punishes you if you travel to specific areas out of the intended order (a la Dark Souls). Perhaps most impressive, though, is what could best be described as a "masterful" soundtrack. Every time I hear the theme for the Maya/Tower, I smile with joy. The music in this game is just so well done.\n\nOn the downside, while the platforming and combat controls work well for the most part and are simple to get a hang of, the analog controls tend to be a bit over-sensitive. There have been quite a few instances where I've screwed up and felt it was more a matter of the game's controls being imprecise than it was my own fault. Also, while still fun more than 20+ hours into playing, the experience does tend to feel a little grind-y once you get far into New Game+ territory.\n\nProblems aside, Rogue Legacy manages to do so many things well and so few things wrong. It does a terrific job of scratching that old-school Metroid/Castlevania itch and provides a sense of accomplishment with each run. A game that's easy to pick up and play in short 30 minute bursts, or spend hours on end with.

There are many rogue like elements, including random dungeon generation, random offspring generation, permadeath, and a high degree of difficulty.  There is of course newgame+ and more so the replayability is way above the 20 hours it took me to beat.  I have no complaints about this game, it deserves to be in your library as one of the best 2D games of this generation.

Things like Super Meat Boy, Spelunky, Super Hexagon, and Limbo are some of my favorites. And when I started Rogue Legacy, it felt like heading back down into the mines of Spelunky. But as I kept playing, that changed a bit. This game is hard on you, but it's not unforgiving because, even when you fail, you make progress.\n\nI hesitate to call this a rogue-like because it moves almost all progression from the game to the meta-game; you don't power up at all (except for one or two rare exceptions) while you're playing, and when you do, it's permanent. Contrast that with Spelunky, FTL, Binding of Isaac, Desktop Dungeon, etc., where failure means a complete restart, and you get a much different experience - a nicer, kinder experience.\n\nThis rogueish-like (rogue-likeish? rogue-like-like?) gameplay is perfectly complimented by smooth platforming mechanics, very solid controls (though I would recommend a gamepad), a good variety of enemies, and a great soundtrack. Toss in the descendent and trait gimmicks and this you've got yourself a well-designed, highly replayable, very polished experience.","February 20, 2014","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If your curiouse about Rogue and Rogue-like 'hardcore' gaming then this is an excellent place to start.  While it has the harsh and randomness of a Rogue-like. it also has an underlying persistant progression that all of your characters share and benefit from as you unlock it and a rather unique sense of humor.   There are a wealth of classes and features to play around with as you progress through the game and not much is missing in the way of challenge you'd expect from a game in this genre while still managing to be more approachable by newcomers.\n\nThough it does bare mentioning that if you sit there and grind those manor upgrades you'll soon find the challenge stripped from the game, if only for the time being till your progress catches up with your power.  I recommend not grinding, sure grab all the money and pickups you can per run but -do not- grind.  you may find  that stripping the challenge from the game (even temporarilly) may also diminish your enjoyment of it.","January 16, 2014","true","52.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rogue Legacy is one of the best games I've bought in a while. Interesting game mechanics combined with plenty of humour and nerdy references make this game quite fun to play. It's nice that the game doesn't force you to constantly backtrack unless you want to (it's optional~), so every playthrough feels fresh. Dying a lot is one of the main features of the game, but it doesn't feel tedious at all; instead, it'll have you saying "Just one more heir, and then I'm done" over and over again until you realize that you've been playing for 4 hours longer than you meant to. It's also nice that there are so many different character options every time you die, so you can change your play style to whatever suits your current mood. 10/10","June 30, 2014","true","41.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of the most addictive games I have ever played in my life and probably my overall favorite steam game.\n\nNow in general I am not a big fan of "rogue" games, the idea that you need to start all over again, every time you die is annoying to me, but this game just looked really fun so I decided to buy it when it went on sale.  Each time you die in this game you get to keep all the loot and weapons you found in the previous run to upgrade your character in a number of different ways so you are not starting from sqaure one every time, and you always keep all your upgrades.\n\nEach castle is randomnly generated, so every time you play the castle seems fresh, but there are certain things that are consistent in each generated castle.  The castle is divided into 4 sections, and they are in the same relative location each time you play(for example the forest is always located to the right, so if you keep going right you will eventually hit it) which makes exploring and reaching the areas you want to reach very seamless.\n\nYou also have the option of "locking down" the castle.  So you can replay the same castle if you think you missed some weapons/armor/runes, and more importantly you can lock down the castle so when you are ready to take on a boss you can just keep locking down the same castle and teleporting right to that boss(providing you find his location first) which makes multiple boss attempts very seamless and not frustrating at all.  usually the worst part of rogue games is replaying large boring sections just to replay the boss battle until you get it right, but you never have to do that in this game\n\nOnce you beat a boss, they are dead so you do not have to beat them all in one run.  Once you beat the game you unlock new game + and then new game ++, each substantially harder and more rewarding than the last.  I am not the kind of gamer who plays a game more than once, I usually beat a game and move right on to something else, but this is the first game since resident evil 4 which made me want to immedialtely replay it when it was over.\n\nI cannot recomment this game enough, if you are into hack and slash metroidvania type games you will love this game, I usually do a pro/con section with my reviews but I can't think of anything about this game I did not like.  Just buy it, you will not regret it.","August 2, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlock equipment, runes, skills and customize your hero in different ways.\n\nThe game gets harder every time you beat the last boss, so the replay value is really good.

Really a lot more like the newer Castrevania games than Rogue. Far as I can tell, the only "roguelike" feature is that you die a lot.\n\nSo you fight through this castle in an action-platformer, and you die a lot. Every time you die, the castle gets procedural rebuilt, and you choose a new character from three randomly generated options. Before beginning each time, you get to upgrade your "manor," which essentially upgrades every character going forward.\n\nI give it a B-.

The upgrades in the manor work somewhat like a talent tree in other games, yet it is completely new.  The fact that not all classes are availible at the begining makes it even more rewarding when the "unlock ____" appears on the manor.  The fact that Charon takes money away makes every single coin more precious.  One flaw in the game however, is that at some point it feels like you are just grinding gold.

With its compelling progression and customization systems and an excellent use of randomization, Rogue Legacy is a clear and definitive step forward for the genre.\n\nAny action-platformer game hinges on the player developing a set of reproducible skills -- learning how to read a room, confront enemies and chart a path through treacherous territory. Later Metroidvania games like Aria of Sorrow and Other M shied away from this and instead emphasized character empowerment and customization to the point where base skills like dodging and timing became almost unnecessary. Rogue Legacy deftly solves this problem by randomizing every room on each playthrough while also forcing the player to accept a unique set of strengths and weaknesses on each play session thanks to the game's hereditary system. After a couple hours, the player starts to understand the logic of the game: how each region works, where the greatest challenges are, how to chart a path through the castle and how to compensate for unexpected adversity. It's a brilliant example of a game that teaches the player a difficult and complex system at a steady pace over dozens of hours of play.\n\nIf you're a fan of Metroidvania games or a fan of challenging action-platformer games, you're more than likely going to get your money's worth out of Rogue Legacy. But if you appreciate dissecting and understanding great game design, Rogue Legacy is absolutely essential.","August 12, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Controls are tight, tons of loot, a vast array of baddies, and a lot of customization options.\n\nHowever, there isn't much of a story.  Boss battles are fun, but can be quite challenging.  That's good though, as you can get many hours out of this title because of it's challenge and replay value.  There are a good deal of characters you can pick from, each with their own abilities.  It should be noted, however, that each character usually also has a querk, too.  For instance, some characters play the game up-side-down.  Others are color-blind.  Some have flatulence issues.\n\nSo, I HIGHLY reccamend Rogue Legacy.  It's a terrifically fun platformer, which has a great soundtrack, and boasts hours of play time.","September 27, 2014","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vyross/recommended/241600/","Vyross","Vyross","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vyross/","340 products in account","Rogue Legacy is difficult, but rewarding, and highly addictive. The general "pattern" of gameplay is that you get as far as you can in the dungeon, die, and start over with a new character. However, you keep upgrades from one character to another, so after a "successful" - i.e. profitable - run, you can spend your gold on upgrades and equipment.\n\nThis progression SLOWLY snowballs, and you start to feel powerful (plus, you get better at the game in addition to the upgrades), but clearing whole sections of the dungeons (there are four sections to each: the castle, the forest, the dungeons, and the maya) will take a while to get to. Clearing the entire thing is something I still haven't managed, though I've fully cleared two sections.\n\nThe "Genealogical" thing is a bit of a misnomer. Traits from successful heroes don't seem to actually pass down to their heirs, at least in any noticable way. This doesn't matter all that much, because aside from a few really terrible traits (like Vertigo, which flips the screen vertically), most of the time I wound up picking a character because of what class they were rather than what their traits were.\n\nRogue Legacy is well-suited to any length of time that you might have to play. You can play it for five minutes (if you can stop), or an hour, or an entire day. Each round through the dungeon helps just a little bit, and it builds up over time.\n\nThe difficulty scales nicely, and does  so in a good way - lots of games make things more difficult by giving the player less health/damage or enemies more health/damage, but Rogue Legacy makes things more difficult by introducing variants of enemies already seen with new abilities, faster attacks, and more. The game gives you more things to dodge and less time to dodge them in the harder areas,  or puts lots of types of enemies into a single area, making target prioritization a key part of survival.\n\nThere are a few flaws. The game somehow managed to be laggy, despite my system specs: a Radeon HD 5800 with 2gb vram, 12GB of ram, a 6 core 3.2GHz processor. My computer's a few years old, but I can run most games on high settings still, or medium at least. This game, though, is 2D. There's no reason on earth why a 2D game should lag with those specs. If you buy it and have a smaller laptop or something, be aware that it might not actually run. Absurd, I know. Also, the difficulty early on was quite frustrating, and I nearly gave up a few times.\n\n7.5/10","June 26, 2014","true","41.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With its compelling progression and customization systems and an excellent use of randomization, Rogue Legacy is a clear and definitive step forward for the genre.\n\nAny action-platformer game hinges on the player developing a set of reproducible skills -- learning how to read a room, confront enemies and chart a path through treacherous territory. Later Metroidvania games like Aria of Sorrow and Other M shied away from this and instead emphasized character empowerment and customization to the point where base skills like dodging and timing became almost unnecessary. Rogue Legacy deftly solves this problem by randomizing every room on each playthrough while also forcing the player to accept a unique set of strengths and weaknesses on each play session thanks to the game's hereditary system. After a couple hours, the player starts to understand the logic of the game: how each region works, where the greatest challenges are, how to chart a path through the castle and how to compensate for unexpected adversity. It's a brilliant example of a game that teaches the player a difficult and complex system at a steady pace over dozens of hours of play.\n\nIf you're a fan of Metroidvania games or a fan of challenging action-platformer games, you're more than likely going to get your money's worth out of Rogue Legacy. But if you appreciate dissecting and understanding great game design, Rogue Legacy is absolutely essential.","August 12, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Things like Super Meat Boy, Spelunky, Super Hexagon, and Limbo are some of my favorites. And when I started Rogue Legacy, it felt like heading back down into the mines of Spelunky. But as I kept playing, that changed a bit. This game is hard on you, but it's not unforgiving because, even when you fail, you make progress.\n\nI hesitate to call this a rogue-like because it moves almost all progression from the game to the meta-game; you don't power up at all (except for one or two rare exceptions) while you're playing, and when you do, it's permanent. Contrast that with Spelunky, FTL, Binding of Isaac, Desktop Dungeon, etc., where failure means a complete restart, and you get a much different experience - a nicer, kinder experience.\n\nThis rogueish-like (rogue-likeish? rogue-like-like?) gameplay is perfectly complimented by smooth platforming mechanics, very solid controls (though I would recommend a gamepad), a good variety of enemies, and a great soundtrack. Toss in the descendent and trait gimmicks and this you've got yourself a well-designed, highly replayable, very polished experience.","February 20, 2014","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each child will have different characteristics that define them. For example, they might have dwarfism, and be really small, or have vertigo, where you have to play the entire game upside down! Obviously, not all of the traits are good, but they do serve to spice up the game.

This might be one of my favorite games of all time. It’s incredibly challenging yet deeply rewarding. You will find yourself dying over and over again yet you are happy to come back for more punishment. The idea of having to pick a character – each with their own strengths and weaknesses – from a randomized gene pool is a great concept. Sometimes you will simply have to concede defeat and sometimes you will luck out and prepare yourself for a long run into unknown worlds. The randomized castles are a great mechanic that provides a fresh experience every time you restart. The ability to unlock power ups and game-changing mechanics is unique and fresh and allows for much more gradual difficulty curve. Eventually you should be able to beat the game; the question is how many hours will it take? It took me just under 20 hours to beat the final boss.

The difficulty level in this game is perfectly balanced for it's play-style (dying a lot but not too much or in a bad way.) The game has great replay-ability as when you "beat" the game, the difficulty is notched up and you simply continue on, with the same character even.\n\nThe game does a fantastic job with it's subtleties and humor without losing sight of the actual gameplay.

Dying in those games is very serious, you lose everything: Characters, stats, items, all gone. In that genre, death really means Game Over. But what if it didn’t have to be that way? Enter Rogue Legacy.\n\nYou are a warrior tasked with exploring a magical castle and defeating monsters within, with Castlevania-like gameplay that should be familiar to everyone. The twist is that, when you die, that character is gone, and you start playing as one of their heirs, with different traits and classes. The money and treasure gathered by the deceased are passed on, and you can spend them on upgrades and equipments for the new generations.\n\nThe game manages to keep a constant sense of progress with the upgrade system; dying is not the end, it’s the beginning of a new adventure where you’re likely to be better prepared. It’s not just about getting better stats and armor, either, you’ll also unlock new classes and mechanical improvements, like dashes and air jumps.\n\nYour descendants are, however, randomly generated. This goes for both class and traits, the latter of which are characteristics like "Glaucoma" or "Dwarfism" that can be very helpful, irrelevant, or highly crippling. The unreliability inherent to the heirs often forces you to adapt to something that "will do" instead of having the best for the task available, which makes victory all the more sweet.\n\nAnd of course, it wouldn’t be a roguelike if the journey through the castle was always the same. It changes, but not simply for each game: It changes on every single generation. This is why you don’t want to die too early: You miss the chance to get a lot of loot, and boss rooms are transferred elsewhere. On the other hand, a new character means new treasure to find, so it’s not that bad. It’s fun, both to win, and to lose.\n\nAnd that is Rogue Legacy: A game that avoids being frustrating, but still without making you feel you’re getting off easy. All the balance in the gameplay elements really shows that a lot of effort was put into making this game, and it paid off, because Rogue Legacy makes for a fantastic roguelike*, and probably for one of the best Castlevanias out there, too.\n\n* “Roguelite”, if you prefer.\n\nPS: Use of a controller is highly recommended.","January 26, 2014","true","40.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My favorite rogue-like game, although it also served as my introduction to the genre. Even after playing a lot of others from the genre now, I still look back on Rogue Legacy as my favorite out of the bunch.\n\nThe game is presented in a pixel fashion, making use of some nice looking sprites for the various people and enemies you will meet along your journey. This style fits well, especially for a game of this genre. Come to think of it, I don't think I've played a rogue-like that was not in this style, and I've played several of them over the past several months. Can't really complain either, there's nothing wrong with it and I'd actually prefer this style in a rogue-like game, although I may be a bit biased there (heh).\n\nRogue Legacy's niche is the rebirth mechanic. Upon dying as one character, you'll have the choice as to which of the three offspring of that character you'll play as next. The interesting thing about this mechanic however, is that each child has separate traits, disguised as real world disorders and conditions. These can either be in your favor or against it. ADHD, for example, works in your favor in that your character will move 30% faster than usual. My favorite defect is vertigo, which mirrors the screen vertically. Yes, everything, including menus. Vertigo is a pain to deal with as I cannot rotate my monitor upside down, forcing me to play upside-down.\n\nAside from that gimmick, the other half of the game is the immense class and upgrade system. You'll start off with no skills, playing as the default class, the knight. Upon death, the opportunity to choose offspring with a different class is presented. The basic classes to choose from contain classes such as: mage, knave, knight, barbarian, shinobi, miner, etc. Each class can be upgraded, getting a name change in the process. The shinobi, for example, changes into the hokage, my favorite class. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages, keep that in mind.\n\nThe shinobi/hokage has the benefit of upgraded strength (175% to be exact), but at the cost of only having 60% HP, 40% MP, and not being able to take advantage of critical hits. I never really used the game's spells, so the MP cut didn't have much of an effect on me, but the HP and critical hits were quite the drawback. Even so, whenever I was given the opportunity to play as a hokage, I always took it. You can't beat 175% damage. I found it crucial to defeating some of the game's bosses. I actually defeated the forest boss (the second one I took on) without getting hit as a hokage, quite the achievement.\n\nOn top of the classes, there's also a plethora of upgrades to choose from each time you die. The upgrades are laid out in a branching format, with certain upgrades unlocking others. The first one made available is Smithy, the blacksmith. Once purchased, you'll be able to purchase both armor and weapons from him. There's also an architect (who can keep the last layout of the castle if you choose to not want the game to randomly generate another castle again) and an enchantress, who sells runes, which can be equipped to provide various abilities (like the ability to jump while in air).\n\nThe other upgrades consist of class upgrades (like barbarian -> barbarian king) and stat upgrades. This consists of mana, health, and equip upgrades. Equip upgrades allow you to carry more weight and is required if you ever want to wear good armor. There's plenty of other upgrades to base skills (attack up, magic damage up, armor up, etc.) and a few unique ones, like "death defy" and "haggle". Death defy, as you can probably tell, allows you to defy death (1.5% everytime the upgrade is purchased). Haggle, on the other hand, lowers Charon's toll when entering the castle.\n\nThe game's map is divided into five zones: the front "safe" area at the entrance to the castle, the castle, the maya (above the castle), the dungeon (below the castle), and the forest (to the right of the castle). Each area (aside from the safe area) has its own boss that needs to be defeated if you want to unlock the golden door at the entrance of the castle. These bosses are very difficult if you're not properly equipped (I did tell you about my love for the hokage class, right?). Each time you die and want to re-enter the castle, you'll have to give up all of your funds earned during the previous run to Charon, who guards the entrance to the castle.\n\nRogue Legacy is a fantastic game overall. The sense of progression is really profound and it just feels really, really satisfying to defeat the bosses and open that golden door. Now that it's only $15, why not give it a shot?","February 19, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sprite work in regards to both the enemies and the castle's various backgrounds is sharp, colorful, and all-around fantastic. Between the procedurally-generated castle layouts and the unique geneological trait system, the game is able to stay fresh from one run to the next and maintain a nice sense of randomness. The progression/skill tree is surprisingly deep and will require a lot of playtime to fill out. Intimidating bosses and rooms packed to the brim with enemies help create a healthy, satisfying challenge. I also like how the game gives you the freedom to explore the entire castle right off the bat, yet punishes you if you travel to specific areas out of the intended order (a la Dark Souls). Perhaps most impressive, though, is what could best be described as a "masterful" soundtrack. Every time I hear the theme for the Maya/Tower, I smile with joy. The music in this game is just so well done.\n\nOn the downside, while the platforming and combat controls work well for the most part and are simple to get a hang of, the analog controls tend to be a bit over-sensitive. There have been quite a few instances where I've screwed up and felt it was more a matter of the game's controls being imprecise than it was my own fault. Also, while still fun more than 20+ hours into playing, the experience does tend to feel a little grind-y once you get far into New Game+ territory.\n\nProblems aside, Rogue Legacy manages to do so many things well and so few things wrong. It does a terrific job of scratching that old-school Metroid/Castlevania itch and provides a sense of accomplishment with each run. A game that's easy to pick up and play in short 30 minute bursts, or spend hours on end with. Highly recommended.","July 24, 2013","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rogue Legacy does a really good job of creating a challenging game, but not making it so challenging to the point where you want to punch your computer screen. It can be hard starting out but once you start clearing out the castle more and beating a boss it feels so rewarding. There are so many diverse classes to choose from that all have a different take on your approach at the castle keeping the game fresh and not just doing the same thing over and over again. It is also very amusing with the different disabilities like IBS or Color blindness.

So far it's my most played game... Yeah, I don't play on my PC much. But that's not the point!\nRogue Legacy is an amazing game in which you play as a knight who travels through an unknown castle in order to slay the man that murdered their ancestor. Or something like that, the game is very thin on storyline...\nIn this game, you can play as a large variety of classes. From Knights and Mages, all the way to Shinobi (And Hokage, if you're a fan of Naruto, you'll catch the reference) and dragons!\nEvery single time you enter the castle, it's randomized. Unless you pay the architect to keep the pattern as it is. The random castles and different classes (I forgot to mention that each character has their own unique traits and/or disorders) really make the fun endless. You can upgrade your stats and armour ( or "armor" for the 'Muricans...) with the gold you collect, which makes the game a lot easier. But don't fear, the game never becomes too easy... The intense boss battles make a challenge, not to mention the bonus bosses bringing an awfully hard test for your skills...\nAs soon as you beat the game, you can go through it again with harder enemies in New Game Plus. At the moment, I'm halfway through NG+2\nMan, I've been typing for a while... So I'm gonna wrap this up and say this game is FAULTLESS!

The enimies are varied and intersting, esepcially the mini-bosses, even though at the beginning, you won't last very long. If you continue playing though, your skills will increase, as well as your armour, runes and stats. The 4 main bosses of each area are fun and are diffuclt, being extremley hard to beat them on your first time ( except the 4th boss, he is too weak to be the 4th area boss.) The controls are very good, with all the key assingments feeling natural. The finally thing is that the music in Rogue Legacy is some of the finest indie music I've heard. Overall, If you are a fan of Metroid, or the Metroid-Vanias, or are looking for a great indie game, this is the game for you.

As probably ever other review tells you, your hero changes to your next heir when you die and the heir has the potential to be born with some positive or negative traits. You level by dying which is a strange system in itself. The castle randomly changes with every heir unless you choose to pay a fee to save your previous layout with the "Architect." Each heir retains stat and armor upgrades your previous heirs had. As your characters get stronger, so do the mobs.\n\nPros:\n\n- Harder than most platformers. The difficulty level was perfect for me, not rage inducing, but hard enough to be of a challenge.\n- Castle layout changes and different challenges spawning kept the maps interesting.\n- Well planned bosses, except the last boss was kind of easy...\n- Addictive\n\nCons:\n\n- If you're used to old school platformer controls, this feels nothing like them. Slow attacking forces you to play very differently.\n- Mage classes don't really feel like mage classes.\n- Can't hold the d-pad down + attack like in Adventures of Link. Downward attack doesn't hold. Lasts for only a split second.\n- Game balance could use some work as sometimes the scaling just felt off.","May 4, 2015","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like Castlevania, the main objective of Rogue Legacy is to explore a castle and defeat several bosses within it.\n\nBut what sets Rogue Legacy apart and makes it really fun and interesting is that, when you die - and you will die a lot - you get to choose between 1 of 3 children of the character you were just playing to avenge their parent and explore the castle. Each child may have genetic abnormalities or traits that make the game play differently each time. Some will directly affect gameplay, while others are just for flavor. For example, you may have a child who’s a midget. They’ll have a smaller hitbox and be able to go through small openings, but they may also take more knockback. Or you might have a child who’s colorblind. Then the game is played in black and white until you die again. And each time you die, the layout of the castle is randomly rearranged, so it’s kind of like playing a brand new game each time. You’re also free to swap out skills and equipment to experiment with different playstyles if you’re stuck on a boss. Really cool stuff. On top of that, you’ll inherit your items from your parent when they die, but the game makes you spend the money you inherit on upgrading new items or skills before you reenter the castle. So each time you die, there’s a kind of moment where you think “Crap I died…But now I get to choose a new character and upgrade their items and skills!” A neat mechanic because it makes you never feel overly frustrated when you die. Which is good, because this game is hard. And you’ll die. A lot.\n\nI can’t really think of too many negative criticisms of this game, it’s very solid and well designed. Again, not too pretty to look at, but that doesn’t matter to me for a game like this. Maybe the soundtrack was a bit unremarkable, but that’s nitpicking. Check out Rogue Legacy if you can handle a challenge.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","January 24, 2014","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rogue Legacy delivers on all levels. The music brings back memories of Diablo II. The look of the game is definitely classic Super Nintendo Ghouls and Ghosts, however the gameplay has merit in its own right. It does not really play like Ghosts and Goblins or its successor Ghouls and Ghosts, which is not a bad thing. Many different character classes can be unlocked and each class has its own special ability that takes mana. You will find new pieces of armor and runes as you play, which you can purchase after your character's inevitable permanent death. Upon death you will then choose an heir to keep your legacy alive. Each character has its own special traits that can help or hinder you along the way. The runes that you acquire will give your character new abilities or they can do things such as make enemies harder, but also give you more gold.\n\nRogue Legacy is challenging, it will test your prowess. The game features a new game + mode, which makes it even more difficult and allows you to continue upgrading your manor and purchasing new armor and runes even after you have completed the game. The short storyline is good and it will keep you motivated to keep going.","July 30, 2013","true","29.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The traits are important for many reasons that I won't go into - but Rogue Legacy is definitely worth your time.\n\nThere's pretty mimimal story-line but what story you do discover is rather well done. You'll find little tables with a book that progresses the 'lore' and I found myself always wanting to find the next one.\n\nThere are runes and equipment to unlock and choose from. You can be a life-stealing, life-to-mana converting caster if you want. You can be a brute force vampire. Maybe have extremely high defenses. Or maybe be a melee glass cannon. The best part is, all are viable and all may end up making certain bosses and combat easier. It's your job to find out how to adapt and evolve your lineage.","September 24, 2014","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game though makes it a tick more addictive than the usual formula. You do not get to choose which class you play and which traits the char has, but you do get to pick one hero out of three random ones at each start of new round. Your goal - defeat the 4 bosses and open the golden gate at the beginnning of the castle. As you explore the castle, there's gold, runes, blue prints & stat points to gather. Once you die, the next char will succeed the old one by carrying over all the items you gathered beforehand. You can upgrade stats and unlock new classes at you mansion, equip new runes on gear that the blacksmith crafted with the blue prints you found. This game does it right. It is difficult, but with every new character it gets a bit easier and suddenly it 'clicks'.\n\nLove this game!","November 8, 2013","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Animation is fluid and sound is okay, caveat here that the jump strike that you are forced to use to defeat certain enemies/platform is incredibly wonky and WILL cause you to lose runs.\nMy main issue is that the game (by design) doesnt force you to clear rooms , this results in some rooms being tuned to be far too hard (with the intention of you skipping them).\nThe problem herein lies in the fact that once you reach  later zones/new game +   it is simply  more advantageous to skip every enemy and dash for the boss rooms unless you are overlevelled due to repetitive farming.\nThanks to this flaw the game starts breaking apart because the whole concept of collecting gold coins in order to level up and defeat monsters is moot due to bosses only scaling in hp/damage(and not tiers like the normal monsters) and having predictable patterns.\n\nA lot of wasted oppertunity but still fun the first(and second) run if that is your cup of tea, however unlike games like The Binding of Isaac/Risk of Rain/Spelunky it is unlikely that you will get much replayability out of this.","July 20, 2013","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a fan of Rogue-likes, you will love this. Trust me this is some amazing ♥♥♥♥. The gameplay is great, the concept is great, the graphics are perfectly fitted to the game. The sound track is awesome and I can't stop listening to it, nor playing this game.\nThe mechanics of the game are almost flawless. So far I've spent more than 70 hours on it.\n\nRogue Legacy is a game centered around a trait system, where each generation of the player's family has a child, chosen out of a possible three offspring. Each offspring has a different class, different name, gender, and a whole bunch of traits, such as Vertigo, Dwarfism, Dyslexia, and Hypergonadism.\n\nWhen your character enters the randomly generated castle, they throw away your family's wealth, to risk the ways of the Knight. When your character dies, their heir to the throne will grow up, and train to avenge them. Of course, this relation will be EVEN BETTER than the last, and have more upgrades than the last, allowing them to best their foes. One day.. They will avenge their parents, and conquer the castle!\n\nThis game is the most fun I've had in a long time, and it has so much replay value. It's hard at first, and some people say it has wonky controls, but I totally disagree. The controls are so well suited to the game, and without the odd little "Melee-Kiting" style, I probably wouldn't play it. What I mean by this is that once you start a swing in one direction, you can't change directions until the swing ends, unless you have a certain trait ;) ;) This allows for kiting, as you can attack an enemy while running in the opposite direction. I think this throws a lot of people off, as it can be difficult to work with at first, but once you get used to it, you'll find it so useful.\n\nProbably the only bad thing about this game is that the sprites / mobs are re-used many times throughout the game. Almost as much as in Ginormo Sword (okay no where near that much but that's because it's Ginormo Sword.)\n\n9.5/10.

My 7-year-old has been playing it and he likes the Knight class so much he doesn't want to upgrade it to the Paladin... which means that he cannot unlock any upgrades and his potentially awe-inspiring castle remains a small fort. Each to their own, I suppose.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed this game - great for a quick blast, plenty to explore and I felt great about finding the hidden class (at the top of the flagpole). It seems very much designed for an XBox controller, though, so playing on mouse and keyboard was difficult (I had to work out and write down the mappings from XBox controls to keyboard controls, plus the down-attack move to activate platforms is far too difficult on the default settings).\n\nIt would be nice to carry over money from previous generations to allow the more casual player to build up a fortune... as it was, I found it increasingly difficult to be able to spend my money on anything useful (but did find that investing in the 'vampire' items and runes helped my character survive for longer to get the money). Also, some guidance on the order to attempt the other levels would be useful too (unless I missed something in the notes). Still, I enjoyed the various classes and weird hero traits, and the game overall.","March 31","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I took a chance on it as it was only $3, and now that I have it I know I would've been happy to have spent more. It's challenging but not frustratingly so, and its a nice mindless game without being a dumb hacknslash. Much recommended, so long as you fit into the criteria I posted above.","June 15, 2015","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However as other reviewers have stated it does get easier if you can tolerate a little grindage. Using a logitech gamepad on this one similiar to the PS3 controller.. and I must say this game is ultra fun, pretty addictive.. the unlocks do come slowy after many deaths but this only fuels your desire to fight back and become more powerful. Your liniege continues familiy member after family member as you pick and chose your successor with each inherited trait/spell you move on one step closer to dominance. Hack and Slash your way through droves of enemies, avoid traps and enjoy totaly random dungeons. Rogue Legacy at the discounted price right now is a must have! Oh and don't forget to flip off Charon for taking your gold at the gate.","June 23, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only does it take me back to the old retro game style with the NES and SNES, but concept of each run being randomly generated, and the progression of slowly building your stats and taking out rooms that would wipe the floor with you a few characters back keeps you coming back for more. Extremely addicting game with multiple hours of gameplay. Even after completing the first run though, I still feel like there's much more left to do.","January 6, 2015","true","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
