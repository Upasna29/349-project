After a lifetime of rescuing princesses, collecting coins, avoiding spikes and watching out for pitfalls, it's time to do the complete opposite.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1_nl2GYgSg\nPlaying  through 20+ levels over 4 distinct worlds, you will slowly retrain your brain in the ways of the platformer. Starting with ignoring all road signs since they usually point straight toward death. Each level has hidden collectables which after further progress gives you the ability to unlock toadstools sidequests. Timed leaderboards were also available for speedrunners. Would suggesting using a gamepad but controls were manageable with a kb+mouse.\n\nOutside of the constant tongue in cheek humour the visuals are where the game really stands out. Rendered beautifully in 2.5D and standing somewhere between old classics like Super Mario World and the modern era of platformers. Couple that with a wonderful soundtrack by brentalfloss of DKC, SMW, Megaman (and more!) fame, which only added to the nostalgia.\n\nWhile 20 levels may not seem like a lot of content, Default Dan will make you rage and keep coming back just to perfect runs. For it's decent price point and the bizarrely backwards trip down memory lane it gets my recommendation. Cheers. :)","April 7, 2015","true","1.6"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","37","49","8","0"

The fact that I kept messing up and hitting coins over and over again is an example of just how much this thing messes with your mind.\nAgain, great game!

The thing that distinguishes this game from everything else on the market is that it makes you relearn everything you know about video games. Collectables that you are used to getting such as coins will be met with fatal results in Default Dan, and traditional obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits must be used in order to pass the level.\n\nThis simple yet clever twist makes Default Dan a completely memorable game. I would say $6 is a fair price for what you get, but Default Dan is a game that should not be passed up on sale!\n","August 6, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
