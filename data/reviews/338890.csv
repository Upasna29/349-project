You take control of a guardian angel in training and you have to watch over Harold, the underdog of the competition, as he takes part in practices, races and challenges while making sure he stays ahead of the competition. Taking place across 12 stages you must first complete a practice mode where you familiarise yourself with the stage, then you take part in a race against five other competitors each controlled by another angel in training and after the race you can take part in an incredibly difficult challenge mode where you have to run the whole course without dying while collecting stars.\n\n+Absolutely beautiful design, in particular the background scenery\n+A very likeable main character (Harold) who is also well designed, as are the other competitors\n+Despite only having 12 stages the different game modes, and the difficulty of the game, Harold provides hours of entertainment\n+Great story behind the game\n+Entertaining cartoon style cutscenes\n+Great humour, I laughed out loud a fair few times while playing\n+Wonderful voice acting\n+Interaction with the level itself is well thought out, fun and at times challenging\n+You only need to finish in third place to unlock the next event which makes it great for all players\n+Each stage introduces a new mechanic/obstacle\n+Great animation\n+Great soundtrack\n+Very nice special effects\n\n+/-You fail a lot in this game, personally I enjoyed retrying certain sections until I got it just right but some people may find it irritating, it really just depends on how much failing numerous times bothers you\n\n-It doesn't have keyboard and mouse controls so the only way to play is with a controller which seems strange for a PC only game\n-The controls for interacting with the environment are quite difficult to get used to in my opinion\n\nVerdict:\n9\n\nAn outstanding platform racing game with wonderful design and challenging gameplay, I cannot recommend this game enough especially to those who like a challenge.\n\nEl K.","March 5, 2015","true","8.5"," 57 of 77 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","57","77","7","0"

You, Gabriel, must guide Harold through his races in real time while getting at least third place in this absolutely gorgeous game with good music.\n\n======================================\nPros+Gameplay: Hard but satisfying.\n+Animations: GORGEOUS.\n+Graphics: Detailed, look hand-drawn.\n+Music: Really good, but tracks are similar to each other.\n+Sounds: Perfect. Good sense of timing and encouragement.\n+Narration: Kid-friendly, good voice-acting.\n+Menus: Minimal AND intuitive as heck.\n\nCons-Brutally hard timing requirements.\n\nNeutral+/- Have to practice before every level. Really, it makes sense, and is appreciated, as opposed to failing mid-race over and over, but can get a bit tedious.\n\n======================================\nIntroduction\nWelcome to Harold, the obstacle-based running game! In Harold, you surprisingly do not play as Harold, but play Harold indirectly as Gabriel. Gabriel is Harold's guardian angel, and your task is to see this unlikely runner to victory in races. Seraphiel is your nemesis in this task, doing everything she can to achieve victory in your place.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Harold is a blast. You, again, are Gabriel, Harold's guardian angel, trying to see him through his races in at least third place. That's not so hard, right? Wrong. In Harold, timing is everything, and you will be required to perform tasks with brutally tight timing. What tasks are you trying to perform you ask? Good question!\n\nIn Harold, you will be required to perform many tasks, such as speeding Harold across drawbridges, knocking out crocodiles, and lowering or raising, as well as panning obstacles for Harold to cross them. But wait, the fun doesn't end there! You can also, with good timing, mess up other runners' journeys through said obstacles, getting you closer to victory. There is one other feature in the form of puff power. Puff power is used to either save Harold from an improperly passed obstacle such as a crocodile or fall, or to encourage him, which makes him go faster.\n\nThere is a balance to be struck between encouraging Harold, getting him safely across obstacles, and to further puff pickups. If you fail the obstacle and don't have any puff power, you will have to start over, so be careful!\n\nAll of this makes for extremely fun and engaging gameplay, with good incentivation and strangely enough a pretty high feeling of reward. If the reward of satisfaction isn't enough, the cheering and confetti flying at the end of a well-performed race will perhaps push your fun-o-meter over the edge. The only thing to make a special note of is the pretty high difficulty curve. You've been warned.\n\nGraphics\nHarold is a beautifully animated game with a very slick menu and equally slick transitions. The art looks to be hand-drawn, and is very detailed. The animations are even more detailed, with each runner featuring a unique set of art and animations alike. There are a wealth of colors and they are all vibrant and eye-pleasingly used.\n\nThe menu system is minimal in every way, allowing you to choose races (levels) and the options corresponding to them simaltaneously, which is ingenious design. The menus are all made up mainly of pictures and background images, but the font that it uses when it uses a font is pleasing to the eye and a nice soft white, a good contrast against the colorful backdrops.\n\nAudio\nThe audio in Harold is also very well done. The narration is flawless, and kid-friendly, with great intonation and sense of pausing, as well as unique voices for each character used, a major plus in my book. The music is also very good, although slightly repetitive, since the racing themes feel like variations on each other.\n\nConclusion\nHarold is truly a gem, albeit a frustratingly hard gem. Like diamond level hard. The artstyle is wonderful, and well executed, the animations are fluid and varied, and the audio is wonderfully easy on the ears, as well as encouraging. There is polish all around, and the only problem you'll ever run into is the game's brutal timing requirements. If you're up for a very big challenge, but a fun one, Harold is for you!\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/recommended/338890/","FreakOramaXD","FreakOrama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/","737 products in account","Harold is a challenging, high quality hand-drawn 2D platforming racing game where you play as a guardian angel in learning, trying to graduate from school into a prestige academy, you have to at least win 3rd place in all (I think all) races. The twist is, you mainly control the environment of the race, with only a jump action you can do with the character that's in the race.\n\nThe hand drawn graphics are really high quality, and it looks gorgeous along side the animations and the music too. At first glance one could say it's a game that came out of a Disney movie, the 2D classic kind, not the CGI kind.\n\nThe story is cheerful one, and the characters are nice and likable, accompanied with great voice acting. And just the whole presentation of the game is almost spotless, with the right fine touches being applied. The music is just damn awesome and 'magical' if one could say, it reminded me the awesome music from Lilo & Stitch.\n\nThe gameplay is you racing with having control mainly of the environment rather than the character, where you have to interact with certain parts of the environment, and little character control, which is only jumping and enabling a speed bost, to be able to finish a race.\n\nThe game itself is really challenging, even from the beginning, which is why they always have a practice session before every new race in a new level for you to get an idea of how you manage and finish the level. It was also a good thing for me that they didn't make it mandatory that you have to finish first place, and they made it where you have to finish at least at third place.\n\nAlong the way you will learn new techniques every now and then regarding a level, that will introduce something new you will have to cope with, in order to finish the level in most cases, or learn how to better use them and finishing the level in the fastest possible way at first place.\n\nThere's a decent amount of content for you to go through and finish, with a challenge mode for each level that's even changed up a bit in a different way where you have to finish the race with speed bost on and not failing once, and that mode helps add more replayability.\n\nThe bad thing is that it's sometimes it's hard to tell where the character you play as is standing, especially in speed mode, which results in fuzzy knowledge of when to jump. The other problem is on PC, there's no keyboard and mouse support, only controller support, and that's not a good thing. To those who say that it isn't a big deal, sure, but imagine for a moment that a game on console gets released, and it only has keyboard and mouse support, no controller support. Bad right?\n\nThe game's presentation is just spot on amazing, with the art, animations, special effects, voice acting, the beginning to the ending, the story, all of which one would think they developers hired a director from Disney movies. That plus the good challenging and different type of gameplay. I went to have another look, and actually the game is inspired by classic Disney animation, with Hollywood animation veterans that have worked on it, so no wonder this game looks great.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","February 12, 2015","true","3.7"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","35","47","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JellyJellyFru/recommended/338890/","JellyJellyFru","Dr. Professor ShootBang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JellyJellyFru/","648 products in account","Hi! I may not recommend the game, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad one.\n\nThe animation for one is absolutely gorgeous, as is the art direction. I also liked the lighthearted story before my gamepad died on me (gamepad required, so, wasn't able to experience more). However...As well made as various segments are, none of them felt cohesive during my time with the game and I didn't end up really enjoying more than a part here or there. Let me explain:\n\nIn Harold, you play as a guardian angel in training. You're at top of your class but through some cruel twist of fate, in the final exam needed to become a guardian, you're assigned to protect/guide a lovable klutz named Harold through a series of races. It's a simple, innocent story that provides a nice framework for your job of zapping Harold to make him go faster and launching opponents into pits of spikes.\n\nActual gameplay consists of going through a level a number of times in several modes. The first is "Practice" and can not be skipped. Ostensibly, you're supposed to be learning how to best navigate the actual race to come by making Harold collect stars in bite-sized stages. However by the time you're fifteen or twenty stages in you want to simply get things over with and it begins to feel like unnecessary padding.\n\nAfter getting through Practice, you can enter "Race" mode (the meat of the game). In this, you attempt to, again, help Harold get through the level as efficiently as possible. This time, though, you also have to make sure Harold places third in a race against opponents more fit and smart than our reluctant hero. You do this by affecting his environment (bridges, platforms, obstacles, etc.) and "encouraging" him with bolts of lightning gained by using "Puff Power." You also directly control the timing of Harold's jumps. This is where the gamepad-based controls and animation come into play.\n\nYou always feel like you both 1) Never have enough control and 2) Have too much. This seems contradictory, but in practice this feeling dominated my time with the game. Every obstacle and platform, etc. can be used both to help Harold and hinder his opponents. So, despite Harold's sedate pace, you're constantly in a state of information overload unless relying on rote memorization based on constant failure.\n\nYou can't point at an object and affect it with a mouse--you have to use the triggers to switch between objects, and the analog stick to conduct whatever changes you will. However, in the midst of the lavish animation, the cues for what object you're affecting can get lost. Even as early as the second stage, that one lapsed second of attention can mean failure and a trip back to the starting line. The animation and focus on beautiful artwork also affect collision accuracy in a number of ways--a case of game design fitting art, rather than the other way around.\n\nMy typical thought process during a race:\n\n"Okay, a pit. Need to move it so that dude falls in and Harold gets across. Just swing across the gap and..."\n*Death*\n"...Shoot. It LOOKED like I'd make that jump. Wait, why am I controlling his jumps and not just the environment?"\n*Death*\n"Dang, got distracted. Okay, encourage, encourage..."\n*Death*\n"Man, I was moving too fast and couldn't put down the bridge fast enough. Okay, what if I move slower and take out my opponent before going across myself..."\n*Death*\n"Wasn't able to move the bridge back correctly in time. Okay, what if I..."\n*Death*\n"Too fast."\n*Death*\n"Too slow."\n*Death*\n"Couldn't see."\n*Death*\n"Got confused."\n*Death*\n"Mistimed jump"\n*Death*\n"Mistimed environmental change."\n*Death*\n"Wrong."\n*Death*\n"Wrong again."\n*Death*\n*Death*\n*Death*\n\nYou can get used to this over time and enjoy the game, sure. As I said, it's not necessarily bad, and there is significant content here including another mode focused on moving through an entire level perfectly, but without the pressure of opponents to race against. However, in a time where we're left with too many games and too little time to play them, to have to dig and dig for that kernel of fun is disappointing.\n\n*In full disclosure, I received a copy of this game for review.","March 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 48 of 71 people (68%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","68","48","71","12","2"

The gameplay is fresh, creative. The 2D graphics is nice, like Rayman. Music is nice, also in in-game sound. Harold is about a school in heaven, where students have their own human racer, and they have to compete to other students with their racers. They use the tablets on heaven to control them! Funny!\n\nHarold has 10 stages taking place in various locations, like the beach or desert, etc.... Each stage has 3 sections: Practice, Race and Challenge. In Practice, you will play some levels to improve your skills (collect 3 stars each level) and then you will race in "Race", with 5 others opponents. After finishing the race, you will be able to play "Challenge", which is collecting as many stars as you can during the racetrack. This is a like a race game so you have to be very quick to make ways for your buddy to run and set traps to another racers.\n\nTo sum up. this is a must-buy game!","February 12, 2015","true","2.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","7","12","4","0"

Loris said himself that each personâs tolerance for failure varies quite a bit so itâs difficult to say whether or not everyone can deal with the game's challenges. That said, we donât especially enjoy indie games focused solely on difficult platforming, but in the case of Harold, we just couldnât put it down. What is certain is that, for 15 Euro, youâll never feel robbed by the game or the developers, who are truly committed to pleasing players. Visually stunning, musically brilliant, Gamersyde strongly advise you to jump on this one rather than waiting for the âinevitable Steam sale in a few monthsâ. We canât wait to see what this ten person team can accomplish in the future and weâll be eagerly awaiting their next projects whatever they may be. In the meantime, weâre heading back to the races.\n\nFull review here:\n\nhttp://www.gamersyde.com/news_gamersyde_review_harold-16260_en.html\n\n----\n\nEmballÃ©s et dithyrambiques que nous sommes, il faut comprendre qu'un jeu comme Harold ne s'adresse pas Ã  tout le monde. Loris le disait lui-mÃªme, le seuil de tolÃ©rance Ã  l'Ã©chec Ã©tant trÃ¨s diffÃ©rent d'une personne Ã  l'autre, difficile de vous promettre que vous garderez un calme olympien en toutes circonstances en jouant au titre de Moon Spider. Ceci Ã©tant dit, n'Ã©tant pas spÃ©cialement des hardcore gamers prÃªts Ã  passer des heures et des heures sur certains jeux indÃ©pendants reconnus pour leur difficultÃ©, nous avons Ã©normÃ©ment de mal Ã  dÃ©crocher de ce jeu de plateforme Ã  l'envers. La marge de progression est impressionnante, la profondeur de jeu beaucoup plus grande qu'il n'y paraÃ®t lorsqu'on le regarde en vidÃ©o, et c'est rÃ©ellement en l'essayant que vous pourrez savoir de quoi il retourne. Ce qui est certain, c'est que pour 15â¬, vous en aurez pour votre argent si vous accrochez au concept, et que vous ne vous sentirez jamais volÃ©, ni par le jeu, ni les dÃ©veloppeurs qui se sont vraiment attachÃ©s Ã  nous faire plaisir. Visuellement superbe, musicalement gÃ©nial, Gamersyde vous conseille fortement de vous y mettre et de ne surtout pas ranger Harold dans la catÃ©gorie des "jeux Ã  prendre en soldes sur Steam d'ici quelques mois". Quand on voit ce qu'a rÃ©ussi Ã  accomplir ce petit studio de 10 personnes, on se prend Ã  rÃªver de leurs prochains projets, qu'il s'agisse d'une probable suite ou de courses supplÃ©mentaires Ã  ce premier Ã©pisode.

It's a little bit lackluster when it comes to variety, in my opinion, but it's not too bad either.\nEach level has a practice mode, a race and a challenge mode. Each mode has to be unlocked in that particular order.\nIn practice mode you play each obstacle combination on its own and the faster you are, the more stars you get.\nYou have to complete each practice level to unlock race mode and when you get the maximum amount of stars, which is 3 per segment, you get a bonus puff power.\n\nA puff power can be used in a race to get a burst of speed for a short period of time. At the same time the amount of puff powers represents the amount of lives you have.\nPuff powers can be regained by collecting two winged halos that are floating around in the level or by interfering with your opponent by manipulating obstacles to their dissatvantage.\nAfter completing a race at third place or better, the challenge mode is unlocked. It is basically like race mode, but without opponents. You are also constantly running at max speed,\nyou have to collect stars and you are not allowed to die even once. Additionally all side paths are closed, which somewhat makes sense, since you can't really collect all the stars in one run.\n\nOne little thing I have to complain about gameplaywise is the fact that you are forced to complete everything at least once in practice mode, in order to unlock race mode.\nI get it, each zone has its own hazards and obstacles, but forcing this linearity, especially when you are on the second level in the zone, is not so great in my opinion.\nAnother thing I'd like to point out is that in the game you have to do lot of flicking and twisting with the analog stick. So if you are not really used to playing with the controller a lot, the game might become difficult relatively fast.\n\nIn race mode each level has a secret shortcut that is somewhat required to be found when you want to get a good time. Getting a good time also ranks you higher on the global leaderboard, so there is some competition to be had.\n\nSound- and artdesignwise the game looks really good. The soundtrack is somewhat unique, and for some reason it reminds me of the Lion King, which was a bit confusing the first time I've heard it.\nIt might also be due to the fact that I don't hear a gospel choir singing in the background of a game that often.\nThe general art diretion of the game is inspired by disney movies and to me the game in terms of artdesign is somehow reminiscent of SNES games like Aladdin or Asterix and Obelix.\n\nConclusions: It has been a great experience so far(about 50% through the game) and there wasn't that much I had to complain about, so I'd recommend it.\nHowever the game is 20â¬ or your regional equivalent. A little bit pricey, but worth the money, especially when it goes on a sale.\n","February 12, 2015","true","2.8"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","17","34","10","1"

The better you do, the more the music evolves. The Lyrics are really catchy.\n\nThe gameplay itself is exciting, and you have to cleverly use flicks and drags to get Harold to the finish line. The animations are absolutely amusing and make the game quite humorous.\n\nThe cutscenes are very well animated, and the game overall features a strong narrative about guardian angels in training.\n\nSo please check out the game if you are looking for an innovative and cheerful experience, and especially if you are a disney music fan as Olivier has outdone himself with the score.

The challenge here makes me remember the games when I was a kid in the 80's! I just finished Harold (all tracks but not all in 1st place and I need 4 more secret passages to discover), and you need to train a lot, remember the level design...like old game! To deserve each of your victory, you need to be a real good player. But when you get it you feel that you're the King of the world! ( untilyou watch the leaderboard and you understand that you can improve much more cause some guys here have 15 second less than your own record! How possible is that! I wanna see a video of that race!) Nevertheless you can finish the game without beeing first at all race, so if you just wanna enjoy the game even if your are not an hardcore gamer, that's possible, you just need to practice the race a bit (thanks for the practice mode -first time that I really need it as much)! The graphics as you can see are awesome (espescially for someone who like anime or cartoon), the music is beautiful and interact with your way of playing (when you get a better rank the choir cheers you up). The game is fun and will make you crazy as well......\n\nPro\ndesign\nfun\na real challenge\ndurability\n\nreally worth it!\n\n\n\n","February 14, 2015","true","48.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Everything comes naturally to Gabriel, so he doesn't even have to study for his tests. Heâs basically been gliding his way through school without a single problem. That all changed when he learned that his final exam involves protecting humans in a series of races. As a lesson to Gabriel for being a bit too confident in his training, he is tasked with guarding a rather clumsy human named, Harold. Now Gabriel must help Harold place third in every race or he wonât obtain his scholarship to Archangel Academy.\n\nHigh Points\n\nFun Story â Gabe is a brash and confident Angel-in-Training trying to get his wings. Saraphel Malakh has a rich family history to live up to, but sheâs not in the same league as the rest of her family. She watches Gabe earning his accolades and gets bitten by the green eyed monster. Needless to say, watching the both of them come to terms with their own failings is worth helping the uncoordinated, Harold.\n\nGreat Animation â The cinematics are flash animated but they boast a nice art style and a Saturday morning cartoon aesthetics. The animations during the gameplay are astounding to say the least. It is fun to watch Harold go full sonic the hedgehog, or be wowed by the smooth transition of one of the many boost cinematics during a race. The backgrounds could be a bit more dynamic, but the shifting level scheme more than makes up for it.\n\nAwesome Soundtrack â The music during a race escalates depending on what place Harold is in during the race. Since this game is all about heavenly miracles the music is filled with the gospel sung by a choir. As Harold advances in a race the hymn will begin and start a song about his exploits.\n\nHard And Fun â Harold is an endless runner with a few tricks up its sleeve. As a god like being you control the environment around Harold and his fellow racers. Youâll move objects so that he can continue at his pace, and strike down lightning with FURIOUS anger to bring out his inner speedster. Itâs a challenging process to keep him dashing at optimal speed, and also sabotage his opponents by moving platforms out of their way.\n\nThatâs probably the best part of the game, sabotaging the other angelâs racers by trapping them or pulling the rug out from under their feet. Every stage is based on remembering where to jump, or what to move in a certain stage. This gradually makes the platforming more difficult as Harold proceeds through the various races. Like a game of Rock Band - youâll have a chance to practice areas of the course so that Harold can move through it faster. The game is layered with alternate course routes and constant boosts to keep Harold moving act optimal speed. Itâs a ton of fun if you get used to the control scheme.\n\nAverage Points\n\nController Support Only â It makes sense that the game needs controller support, but only because some of the controls require rotations. I feel like some concessions could have been made for the keyboard crowd. Maybe changing the rotations to simple up and down movements with the keyboard.\n\nLow Points\n\nConvoluted Controls â Since Harold is a game about basically recalling every piece of a level. Itâs weird that the controls are all over the place. Instead of a simple structure to dash, the player has to tap the top buttons on the controller. Flick the trigger buttons to change between platform sections, pull back and push forward to break items, or do the same to pull bridges. There is actually more to learn as the stages progress, but thatâs a lot to memorize while sabotaging other humans and watching Harold.\n\nConclusion\n\nHarold is a fun plat-former that clumsily steps on its own shoes with weird controls. If youâre into puzzle platforming you will have a blast directing Harold in and out of danger. Everyone else who isn't into punishingly difficult games based off memory and precisionâ¦ well youâre just going to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off a lot. If you do ever get used to the controls this can be a fantastic game for practicing speed running. I recommend you wait for a sale on Harold. It features splendid graphics but for a game that requires precision timing, it doesn't have a particularly functional control scheme.\n\n*This title was given to us by the Publisher*","February 13, 2015","true","13.1"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","31","4","13","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/338890/","Dragnix","{FITH}â¢Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","To go along with the review, Footage and First Impressions here: http://youtu.be/mNTmB12cD-4\n\nSummary:\nA game that does well in its basic concept of helping a runner win a race while being his guardian angel, but could have been a lot better if there were detailed that were shored up. While the experience was enjoyable, those little frustrations will wear on the player, but not enough to not have fun messing with other racers, and the concept in a whole. Those who like repeating to shave seconds off their time and improving themselves will most likely like Harold. I personally would wait for the game to drop down in price, but it is a game worth playing.\n\nPros:\n-Interesting Gameplay design, and engaging.\n-Varied paths in tracks, and interactive items sometimes are good not to use, which makes you question things.\n-Background story is actually interesting. Like the idea of being a guardian angle.\n-Controls are spot on.\n-Smart use of practice mode to help the player in the races.\n-Races are challenging yet fun.\n\nCons:\n-No keyboard support: this is only controller gameplay. And no way to rebind (I hate using LB AND RB to hit the bumpers). Definitely shows its console roots.\n-Challenge mode just doesn't change enough to make it feel different from the regular race.\n-Lack of retry button on practice. This means if you screw up, you HAVE to finish the portion in order to retry, which is really really annoying. Some obstacles just slow you down, and with trying to go for speed, that's really freaking annoying.\n-Sometimes, messing with other racers or jumping into a pit seems to be a benefit. While use lose a "puff", the spawn time really makes it so that sometimes it actually helps in terms of time to race. Which is annoying.\n-Early on, protagonist is hard to relate to, in fact, he seems like the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in question. On the other hand, they are setting up for a character building moment down the road, so only slight against it.\n-No sound sliders. Really annoying in a modern PC release.","February 12, 2015","true","2.4"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","0"

Sure I want to pull my hair out and punch the wall after dying over and over and over again throughout the race!! But that is what makes it fun for me! Failing over and over until eventually I win! And that winning feeling is so nice! Graphically it is lovely, music is catchy and the gameplay is very fluid. I really enjoy this game.\n\nAs one man once said âWhy do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.â You will fall a lot on this game and you will pick yourself back up again and tackle the race head on once more!\n\nHere is some gameplay :) enjoy\n\nhttps://youtu.be/f19WiAiLXc8","May 26, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keeping Harold in the race isn't as easy as it seems at first, and scoring first place is even harder. But i would count that as positive for the game. The controls are fairly simple and easy to learn, although you might get confused on switching between obstacles for the first few times.\n\nOther than that, the game features enjoyable, but not bothersome music (background choir!), a nice not-everyday-story (although nothing extraordinary or too deep), beautiful hand drawn graphics and funny animations.\n\nI'd recommend this game to everyone who likes puzzle games, the art style, or someone who just wants to relax and have a few smiles or even a laugh for a few minutes, as the game never takes anything too serious.\n\nAnd nobody could ever be really mad on clumsy Harold for being...well...Harold.","June 2, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pffft, that's nothing)\n\nThe only control you have over Harold (The guy you're helping) is boosting his speed for a few seconds or making him jump, harold won't stop ever, unless, of course, he hits a wall.\n\nThis game gets hard really fast, you're managing Harold, sabotaging other racers and, your "puff power" wich are lives and boosters for Harold at the same time. Thankfully, before every race, there are some training stages that guide you though the obstacles of the next race, with stars showing you the best paths to take.\n\nThis game is so damn pretty! The animated look like something that could come from a cartoon show, there's usually an animation between stages, one before each and another one in the middle of the race if you find a secret.\n\nThe story is also pretty good, simplistic yeah, but good, it fits well in the whole theme of the game.\n\nI really recommend this game if you want challenge and feel warm and fuzzy inside due to pretty graphics","June 5, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
