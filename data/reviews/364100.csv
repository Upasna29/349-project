You keep clicking around until too many spawn and you are juggle spammed and can't do anything, which is what happened to me, and die. you will get a score. That's the entire game folks, you can repeat it, but I'd seen all I needed to see in 5 min. There are no abilities, or anything to add depth or anything. Free flash games online offer more than this, and do it with better graphics. Don't know why anyone would buy this game on purpose, as I got it in a bundle, and am still disappointed it's in my library.","September 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

But at least it's honest.\nYes you control a Space Robot Samurai Zombie Slayer.\nYour job is obviously to slay zombies.\n\nThe gameplay is just "left click here and left click there".\nIt's a fast paced game and well I enjoyed it for 20 minutes.\nThere is not many people playing this game. I ranked #8 in the leaderboard in my 2nd playthrough.\n\nI guess, it's simple and fun for 20 minutes.","July 21, 2015","true","0.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

This is a game where you move your mouse around and kill zombies. The thing is that i remember playing a free browser game that was almost exactly like this. It was fun, and therefore so is this. But i just can't really see a reason in paying for it when i can just play a browser game that is the same.\n\nHowever, don't get me wrong this game is very fun and addictive. It really is just a fun arcade game, and that is all it is. There is no campaign, multiplayer or anything like that, just an arcade mode. But that is fine. Remember Call of Duty Zombies? That was just an arcade type thing, but it was still very fun and repayable and the same goes here. I would like more sprites for the zombies and some more areas though. Maybe unlocked if you get achievements?\n\nI would still recommend purchasing this game but only on a sale so you can actually get your money's worth. It is still pretty cheap now but considering what it is, not cheap enough.\n\nIf you wanna see some gameplay you can see some here: https://youtu.be/EtwTIGUG1TI\nThanks for reading!","May 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MusicGameMidi/recommended/364100/","MusicGameMidi","Not a Linux User","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MusicGameMidi/","116 products in account","When I first bought this game, I assumed it was going to be a cheap knock off pre-made asset game by some bootleg company that is hardly worth .50 cents. I was dead wrong. (Get it? Zombies.) The developer actually made 1000 amps, a game I fully recommend along with this game, but let's talk about SRSZS game already.\n\nSpace Robot Samurai Zombie Slayer is the best combination of mindless clicking and fast thinking. The game has two parts to it, a user friendly movement system that any newcomer can get used to and a high paced skill oriented score system that any competitive soul could get involved in. The way certain enemies attack is frightening to new players but can be utilized by veterans to max out combos. The game doesn’t throw any new weapons, upgrades or DLC cheats your way. It’s just you, your skill, and zombies. The addictive gameplay and price tag along are worth a look.\n\nDuring my time reviewing the game, I eventually found myself on the top 10 worldwide. So tell me fellow gamer, how many zombies can you kill?\n","June 19, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
