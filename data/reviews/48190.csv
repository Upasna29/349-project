As this game will start off exactly where the previous game has ended. I honestly felt that the story was short, you can easily sense that it is about to end soon. Compared to Assassin's Creed II, wherein I've poured atleast 26 hours of gameplay to finish the whole story and that includes some puzzles and some few side quests, it only took me atleast 18 hours to finish Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I'll admit that I've done more puzzles and side quests on the previous game than this one, but I think the difference from 26 hours and 18 is just too big. But given those comparisons, this game still has a story worth playing. And it is an essential part of Ezio's story rc, which is great if not one of the best storylines this franchise has.\n\nEnvironment and Design  - The game takes place on Italy, featuring its greatest city, Rome. It showcases some of the famous landmarks like  The Colosseum ,  Pantheon , and many more. And these aren't just for a show off, you have the option to purchase this landmarks to increase your income.\n\nBecause of the extensive land size this game offers, parkouring over the roofs may not be enough to roam the whole city on your own. Hence, they introduced horse for you to ride on and help you get to places faster. But to make travelling more faster, there are underground tunnels that would take you to different parts of the map instantly.\n\nI have mentioned earlier that the town feels more lively, and it is also because of the townspeople. There are more happenings around you, more idle animations and no more  just walking  people. And this may seem a small detail, but sometimes even the smallest detail can make a game better.\n\nGameplay  - The game may be short, but the side ques and activities is what made this game the way it is. Given its land size, there are alot of areas to conquer to increase the size of your brotherhood. And you may call this recruits during fights to help you assassinate the guards in the area. Or you can send them to different missions for them to earn experience and some gold for yourself.\n\nIn terms of combat, everything in this game has been improved, from hand to hand combat to picking off enemies silently. You can now chain kills when using either a sword or a small weapon when timed correctly. Not only this but you may also combine the use of this with long range weapons, you can now use the Hidden Gun while using a sword or use small weapons together with your throwing knives. As for the stealth, new long range weapons have been like the Poison Darts, which has the same effect of a Poison Blade but for long ranges. And the use of a Crossbow, which is basically a stealth version of a Hidden Gun, preventing the guards to be alerted when fired.\n\nAs for the parkour itself, everything seems just the same as to the previous game. But the most downside for me is when they implemented the synchronization. Its a side goal that they give you in each mission, normally everything is doable and reasonable. But what make its annoying is when it prevents you to be ceative of your own kills, because a failure to do so on the given side goal would only result a half synchronization. And it doesn't stop there, for me, the most annoying side goal is when you're in a dungeon full of obstacle course and puzzles, and they will give you a time limit. That is very frustrating, as if the game doesn't want you to explore the whole area to gather chests hidden somewhere. And a true gamer always want to get lost when exploring an area.\n\nControls  -The game still punishes you if you're a little bit hasty and wants to do things on a fast pace. As usual, I ended up falling alot of times again due to rushing the obstacle courses. I've also lost alot of side goals due to being impatient. But thank god they finally fixed the UI for controls shown on the top right. Instead of the weird icons, that I have no idea what key they represent, they now show the representing key. It maybe too late due to my experience to the previous, it is still a nice touch.\n\nConclusion  - Finish Assassin's Creed II first before touching this game and you'll appreciate how the story continues. The game may feel more focused on other activites than the main story but its still a game worth playing. Everything from the previous game is well improved.\n\nSince this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.\n\nThank you for your time reading this review that I made. And I would highly appreciate it if you can rate it to your liking. Below are the links for my other reviews that would complete this story arc.\n\nAssassin's Creed II - Review\n\nAssassin's Creed: Revelations - Review","October 29, 2015","true","18.2"," 123 of 130 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","123","130","7","0"

Ubisoft got this game, the second one featuring Ezio Auditore as the protagonist, out in March 2011, three and a halve years ago. Having played it relatively soon after the original Assassin's Creed II, I feel it natural to compare the two games to each other. This makes even more sense since the story of AC II really coninues in Brotherhood: not only do the same characters appear in both games, chronologically too they follow nicely upon each other.\n\nBrotherhood starts off splendidly, with a recapture of the final sequences of AC II which flows naturally into the new twists which the well-known story of the struggle between Assassins and Templars about world-changing artefacts takes. After the initial (short) part of the game that functions as a tutorial, I was taken straight into the city where almost all of the action takes place: Rome. The fact that there is only one major city here, compared to the two (Firenze and Venice) and the countryside of the original game, makes for a huge difference. Rome of around 1500 comes to live in Brotherhood in the most fantastic imaginable way. First of all, the map is HUGE: there are 12 districts (including the Vatican and some outer area's which have a rural sense about them), and running from one side of the city to the other would cost you at least ten-fifteen minutes (happily, horses are allowed in the city and there is a well-thought-off fast-travel system). Secondly, the development team has obviously taken the utmost care in analyzing how Rome anno 1500 looked like - and that's really quite different from modern-day Rome. During the first ten (!!) hours or so in-game, I mostly just walked around, discovering the city, marvelling at all the details in the buildings and eagerly reading the information provided for almost every single church, Roman building or other landmark. During my entire playthrough, I felt like being a tourist catapulted 500 years back to a place I love so much. That's quite some accomplishment, and I would even go so far as to call Rome the main character of the game, not Ezio.\n\nThat's not only because of the painstaking detail with which the "Cit√† Eterna" is being depicted, but it's also due to some problems with the concept of the game. Not only is the world almost entirely accessible from the start of the game, the number of side-missions is daunting, certainly compared to the main-story missions. Since I am a curious gamer, I tried some of these, than more of those missions, mixing it all up with the main storyline. Wrong! Almost every mission gives even more options afterwards, unlocking new factions or side-story lines, and they are of course all indicated on a over-cluttered map (which I had to zoom in really close to be able to read every sign on it). After a further ten hours or so into the game, I started feeling overwhelmed: there was SO much to do, to explore, to try, and it could all be done at my own initiative. Now this open-world concept may appeal to many gamers, but I like more of a narrative element, or at least a good backbone of a main story. And this exactly where Brotherhood tends to falter at times. Only by following the main story mission after mission (which I started doing after quite some time), did I refind the feeling of actually being Ezio Auditore, a feeling that had been so strong in AC II. Once I really plunged into it, the main storyline proved to be quite good, though not so compelling as the one in the previous game, and certainly much shorter (although this is more than made up for the number of side-missions and -excursions).\n\nIn all other departments than the identification with Ezio and the overdose of side-activities, Brotherhood does shine, just as I had hoped for. The walking/climbing/jumping and whatever more of Ezio is so fluent, that I actually felt becoming "good" at it, but as with the other AC games, using an Xbox 360 controller really is a must. Combat has been greatly improved upon alreay in AC II, and this game even adds more possibilities, all very natural. The biggest change is the addition of the Brotherhood: a group of Assassin's I could train by giving them missions abroad, and whose help I could call for when needed. Graphically, the game still is a gem, also after a couple of years. Only musically things could have been better: the music could have used a bit more variety.\n\nAll things put together, Brotherhood is a worthy successor to AC II, but it is flawed by trying to do too much, and all of that at once. It's not on the same steallr height as its predecessor, but it's still a very, very good game. Buy it if you tried and liked AC I and/or II, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first dive into the realm of the Assassins.\n\nGameplay: 24/30 (would have been higher with a tighter storyline)\nGraphics: 18/20\nSound: 7/10\nTechnical: 8/10 (I don't like Uplay as an extra "shell", but that's just how it is, and otherwise it's very stable)\nLongelivety: 9/10 (there is some MP which is mostly out of use, but SP alone gives you dozens of hours of gameplay)\nSteam-integration: 5/10 (as with almost all other Ubisoft titles: they try to promote Uplay...)\nPersonal appreciation: 9/10\n\nOverall: 80/100","October 8, 2014","true","71.7"," 113 of 126 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","113","126","4","4"

It continues the story of Ezio Auditore and offers a fewer minor, but noticable improvements over the previous title. The most obvious improvement is the ability to recruit a band of assassin's and deploy them on various missions throughout Europe or even assist during actual gameplay. There are also a plethora of new weapons, paintings, armor, investments, and various Leonardo da Vinci gadgets that continue to make this a fun series to play. I also noticed I didn't find myself cursing at the combat system like the previous titles so they had to make some improvements in that regard as well.\n\nThe main story takes place in Rome and while it is a much bigger city, the story seemed to be quite a bit shorter than the prior two games (for me) and this one left an obvious wide opening for the next game in the series. There did seem to be a larger variety of side missions though. Graphics and voice acting are top notch as usual.\n\nWhile I've been a little slow at playing the more recent AC titles, the first three Assassin's Creed titles have been an enjoyable series thus far.","July 8, 2015","true","23.2"," 58 of 62 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","58","62","0","0"

Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed 2.\n\nDesmond is on the run again. This time, Desmond, Lucy, Rebecca and Shaun visit the ruined Auditore villa on Monteriggioni and make it as their new hiding place. Desmond has learn much from Ezio, but he still need to uncover more information from Ezio, so there he goes again, and again, to the Animus.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood gameplay is pretty much the same with Assassin's Creed 2, but is now focused on the city of Roma, where Ezio battle his way to eliminate Cesare Borgia and liberate Roma in the process. Ezio needs to liberate each sector in the city of Roma by destroying the Borgia towers. Doing so will free the sector and let Ezio rebuild the sector, such as reopening blacksmith shops, doctor shops or banks, gaining income in the process. The game also let Ezio to recruit Assassins by helping troubled civilians who can then help him to fight guards or kill his mission target. Recruited Assassins can gain experience as they are being called by Ezio or by completing contracts. Also, for the first time in Assassin's Creed franchise, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood feature multiplayer game.\n\nThe graphics of the game still pretty much the same too. There may be some slight improvements but we won't notice it somehow. At least there is no downgrade.\n\nOverall, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has taken the next step in Assassin's Creed franchise by introducing recruitable Assassins, while retaining the open world feature.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/48190/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood continues right where Assassin's Creed II finished, so if you haven't played Assassin's Creed II I'd highly recommend playing that game first. Not only was it a good game, but it's almost essential at this point to play it so you can understand the story. This may not seem important, but for me the story is the most intriguing element to the entire franchise.\n\nThe gameplay continues to improve game-on-game, but it's pretty much the same mechanic we've seen since the first Assassin's Creed game. Sure they've removed the terribly rigid design to the missions where you MUST scale this tower before you can do anything else, and I'm personally grateful they did this. However, overall the gameplay isn't that amazing. It's fun, sure, but at the same time it's played it's course now. Don't get me wrong, you can still scale the towers to remove the fog of war, but now it's optional.\nIn fact it works well within what is slowly becoming a very sandbox style world, and this is another area of the game I'm starting to enjoy with each Assassin's Creed game. Ubisoft seem to be aware of what people enjoyed from Assassin's Creed II and disliked from Assassin's Creed and have done a good job of doing more of the same, and removing the offending elements of gameplay.\n\nGone are the insane amount of collectibles, and instead we have more Tombs/Lairs to explore, Glyphs to discover and solve and an entire city to manage. While these elements aren't essential to complete the game, and at times they don't seem to to do much to the story at all (and I personally found the city management side of the game to be over before it begun), it's nice to see that there are options there for people who wish to slow things down and invest into the Assassin's Creed world.\n\nIt's not all roses though, there are a few elements to Brotherhood that confused me. I'm hooked into the story, I want to know more, I want it to expand and progress, and sadly Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood never truly felt like it got going. It felt that it was one long prelude into Assassin's Creed: Revelations, with most of the Memory Segments feeling more like tutorials for the new gameplay mechanics or refreshing into franchise staple gameplay mechanics (most of which any Assassin's Creed fan would hopefully already be aware of). It's a minor fault, and if anything it's something of a Ubisoft Trademark to have excessive gameplay hints/tips/tutorials throughout the game.\nIt doesn't really distract from the game, but it does slow down the buzz and adrenaline that has built up after the huge climax to Assassin's Creed II. Now that I've finished the game, I'm not too concerned about the lull as I can fool myself enough to believe it was perhaps intentional pacing to bring you backdown to build you back up for Brotherhood's ending (which was decent).\nYet, I'm still left feeling 'what really happened' during Ezio's memory segments. I know who the main target was within the story, but you have so little interaction with them directly that you don't really focus on them (unlike in Assassin's Creed II where The Spaniard is referenced and featured in most segments).\n\nSadly there is one element to the game that is lagging behind Assassin's Creed II and that's the soundtrack. I was convinced it was a new composer as it just felt alien compared to the previous work of Jasper Kydd. I just couldn't connect to it.\n\nAlso, once again the character modles have changed ever so slightly but strangely noticably. A minor point of annoyance.\n\nOverall Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is a fun game, and somewhat fast paced (almost to the point where it feels like it's over before it even begun). If you're hooked into the series by this point I'd recommend buying Brotherhood as it continues the story in an easy fun game. If you didn't really enjoy Assassin's Creed II, I think it's best you bow out of the series now and leave Brotherhood, as it's more of the same.\nThe characters are slowly developing, and the plot is thickening. I also know that some people don't enjoy the 'future tech' side of the game, namely the areas outside of Ezio (such as being Desmond and the whole Animus side of world). I personally enjoy the mix of history and Sci-Fi within the game, so I don't find this to be a problem; however for those who do find it a problem there is a somewhat large/significant portion of Brotherhood that centres around the 'adventures of Desmond', so again it might be best to avoid Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.","December 17, 2013","true","20.7"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","47","53","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/recommended/48190/","7grain","7grain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/","291 products in account","Assassin's Creed Brotherhood offers modest but welcome improvements over the previous entry in the series, Assassin's Creed II.\n\nGraphically, it's very similar. I did notice a new day/night lighting cycle, and greater variety in character models around the city.\n\nHowever, the gameplay has been tuned significantly. I found the free-running much smoother in this game; I spent less time jumping accidentally against walls that I didn't mean to climb. Brotherhood seems to know where I want to go much better than AC2 did.\n\nBut mechanics aside, it's the new mission structure that really impressed me. Brotherhood takes a lesson from the Grand Theft Auto series -- the city of Rome is huge, and there's always something nearby that you can get involved with. The major missions come more naturally; you don't feel funneled towards them in Brotherhood like you do in AC2. You can take them on early, or muck around in the city for a long while before addressing the major story.\n\nAnd - the story. The Assassin's Creed storyline is still wonderful, and improves in Brotherhood. The cut scenes are well-balanced so they don't dominate gameplay. The body models are expressive and evocative, and the voice acting is excellent. I find that I really care about these characters and what's happening in the story. Also, Brotherhood really improves Desmond's meta-story.\n\nLast comment - Assassin's Creed has the best cities in video games, hands down. Brotherhood takes place almost exclusively in Rome during the renaissance. The city and nearby countryside is massive! But the attention to detail is remarkable. You see different NPC character models in different parts of the city, and they change between night and day. People mill about in a realistic fashion; some have places to be, others chat in the shade. The ambient noise is fantastic. And never a loading screen as you move about.\n\nSo... Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is over 4 years old as I write this, so I doubt I'll convince anyone to play it who hasn't already. But it looks great, plays great on PC with a controller, and really delivers a satisfying experience. It's definitely worth your time.\n","January 11, 2015","true","36.2"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","40","42","0","0"

He returns home safely, but is inexplicably surprised the next day when the pope's son interrupts his awkwardly animated sex scene with an army.After a tedious segment outside of the Animus, Ezio travels to Rome to dislodge the tyrannical establishment. It's here that the open-world game starts for real, and the plot congeals.As in AC2, the story progresses through a series of Ezio's memories. The missions are varied sequences of stealth, combat, and story-driving dialog, and even the seemingly garden-variety escort missions are well done.The free-running and combat do take effort to master.The more I played, though, the more impressive my acrobatics became.As fans of open-world games would expect, a lot of the player's time will be occupied with missions and activities that don't necessarily advance the plot. It's easy to get sidetracked for hours finding treasure chests, taking on assassination contracts, doing missions for the various guilds or trying to level up your relationship with them, exploring the world or climbing landmarks like the Coliseum.Leonardo da Vinci is back as an ally too, and once again provides weapons for Ezio. Turns out he's also been pressured into creating war machines for Cesare, so it's up to Ezio to destroy the plans and prototypes. There are three major changes that try to switch things up: the assassins' guild, the tweaks to combat and the ability to ride your horse anywhere. Recruiting assassins who can be called upon with the press of a button is obviously the big one, and it works very much as advertised.It's also worth mentioning that looting dead guards' bodies now yields far more valuable items than it did in ACII. You can top up on smoke bombs, crossbow bolts, poison, bullets and medicine with relative ease.Perhaps the biggest surprise of the Brotherhood package is the multiplayer, which is refreshing and inventive.Multiplayer matches are simple but challenging stealth manhunts, either as lone-wolf assassins or teams of killers.Overshadowing even that, Brotherhood's biggest improvement is that it requires only one-time activation, as opposed to AC2's ‚Äúalways-online‚Äù DRM. The game itself isn't notably superior, especially in terms of story, but all of its additions put it on par with the last, and it's a hugely entertaining sequel.Overall 9/10.","October 18, 2014","true","18.7"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","49","58","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/recommended/48190/","thesmolder","Akihiko Sanada","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesmolder/","105 products in account","Introduction:If you are a fan of Assassin‚Äôs Creed II, you are going to absolutely love this gem! If you have not played Assassin‚Äôs Creed II, I highly recommend that you start there, as Brotherhood and Revelations are direct continuations of Ubisoft‚Äôs 2009 predecessor. While Brotherhood is a sequel of a sequel, it continues to bring multiple quality elements to the table. This game is, without a doubt, my personal favourite in the series. Like the original installment, Brotherhood is an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. One that you will not be disappointed in.\n\nAs a general warning, you should not read this section if you have not yet cleared the predecessors, and have the intention of doing so. There are minor spoilers ahead, for those of you who have not cleared the first or second installments of Assassin‚Äôs Creed.\n\nStory: Brotherhood follows Assassin‚Äôs Creed II nicely, and cleanly picks up where the last left off. Desmond flees the scene of the latest Templar attack, and follows his team to Monteriggioni: their new hideout. Desperate to locate the Apple of Eden, in hopes of preventing a global disaster that had been predicted to happen later on in the year, Desmond rushes back into his genetic memory.\n\nFor Ezio, it is 1499, and he still cannot explain what he had seen inside the vault. Unfortunately, he is not given much time to mull it over before the actions of the Templars push him back into action. He spends most of the game struggling to cripple the Borgia influence in the capital, and then begins the process of training other Assassin‚Äôs to aid him.\n\nGameplay: Allow me to start off this section of the review by stating that Brotherhood is a huge game, offering more content than Assassin's Creed II. There are a lot of places to explore, both above and below ground. While some players share the mindset that "more isn't always better", I am a firm believer that the fans of the beloved assassin Ezio Auditore will have a blast checking out this game... Especially taking into consideration that there is a huge pool of returning characters, including Leonardo DaVinci and Machiavelli.\n\nThere are a number of recognizable, yet staple mechanics worth mentioning, that have been recycled in Brotherhood: The original (if not improved) free-running system, eagle-vision, hidden messages, looting, buying, and investing. Furthermore, Brotherhood keeps the modernized and improved quest system from its predecessor, which permits Ezio to hire courtesans, thieves or mercenaries.\n\nThe combat aspects of Brotherhood are mostly recognizable from Assassin's Creed II. You can still cycle through your weapons, and choose whether or not you want to execute a clumbsy public chase, or a stealthy and well-planned kill. Combat aesthetics are gorgeous, and make just about any fight seem brutal and bloody. Like it's predecessor, weapons and armor can be both obtained and repaired at blacksmith shops - Each offering their own selection of kill animations.\n\nHowever, there are also new aspects of combat. For instance, mounted combat is possible. While running through crowds and across rooftops is entirely possible, Brotherhood now offers the option of horseback riding through cities (once the stables have been purchased), permitting the player to jump from a horse, and straight into an assassination.\n\nLeonardo DaVinci has a bigger role in this game, along with optional DLC. In fact, he offers stand-alone quests that require Ezio to go after his four war machines in order to lessen the Borgia's military strength. While getting to each of Leonardo's inventions might seem a bit repetitive at times, the objective following locating the machine is always exceptionally diverse. No two missions to destroy Leonardo's inventions are the same.\n\nFinally, I  saved the best implementation for last. The Assassin's Guild. Ezio is eventually able to recruit civilians, and train them up by sending them on their own quests, to become assassins. Once they have been obtained, they can be called upon to assist Ezio in combat so long as they are not deployed on a mission. While they are extremely powerful, I thought it was a lot of fun to recruit and train them, and I guarantee that you will likely feel the same.\n\nControls: If I am not mistaken, the controls are entirely identical to the setup in Assassin‚Äôs Creed II. You still cannot re-arrange your buttons, though I guarantee that playing with a gamepad will be much more friendly than playing with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nLike the previous establishments, Brotherhoods targeting remains a bit on the tricky side. You can‚Äôt ever be 100% certain that you will hit your target, but it is something that can still be worked around. However, from time to time you might still end up changing your camera angle, and inadvertently kill a civilian or something, oops!\n\nGraphics: Brotherhood offers beautiful graphics that focus heavily on its environment. Virtually every area has been polished to reflect the games atmosphere. I‚Äôve said it a million times before, and I‚Äôll say it again: It is really hard to nit-pick this aspect of the game, because the visuals are so fine-tuned.\n\nSound: Having played II, Brotherhood, and Revelations - It is my firm opinion that Brotherhood offers the best of music and voice tracks. Ubisoft continues to uphold the tradition of combining dramatic scores of music to assassinations, making the experience more enjoyable for the player. Subtitles are still an option, and a huge help when it comes to fully understanding what is being said - I encourage you to use them for your own benefit. As always, the sounds only add to the atmosphere of the game, and in the case of Brotherhood: It is extremely well done.\n\nReplay Value: In my own opinion, Brotherhood has the highest replay value in the entire series. It introduces so many miscellaneous objectives, that the game never truly feels boring. While replay value is entirely dependent on the player, I am confident enough to say that any fan of Assassin‚Äôs Creed will want to play this one again.","November 29, 2014","true","59.3"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","36","40","5","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/48190/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5490 products in account","It's that time of year again, suiting up in your best hooded outfit, cutting open a pair of black stockings, taping a butter knife to each hand and lurking around the neighborhood looking for Templar's to slay.  Ah, the memories of jumping out at the purse snatcher and jamming the butter knife directly into his ribcage..  The sweat dripping off my bald head, my heart pounding.. my face hitting the ground as I realized I'm not Enzio and the man I just jammed in the stomach is 6'3 and close to 300 pounds.. After a nice nap, I woke up in the hospital.. Not one to feel discouraged, I vowed to get revenge on that over sized Neanderthal.  After all he had knocked out my front tooth..\n\nEnough about that..  It's time to talk about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, or as I like to call it Assassin's Creed 2.5.\n\nThe Story:  Brotherhood picks up the story after the second game.  Enzio returns to Monteriggioni after he successful retrieved the Apple.  He returns to a hero's welcome, and numerous offers of "ahem" favors from the local town woman.  Our resident playboy settles for a night with Caterina Sforza.  All is going well for Enzio, he's a hero, he's gotten his revenge, he's got himself a sexy MILF, he's going to live happily ever after...  Since this is a game, we all figured out this wasn't going to happen..  Que the music...   (puts on Hammer Time by MC Hammer)  After some vigorous relations with Caterina Monteriggioni is attacked by a new Atagonist Cesare Borgia.  Needless to say the attack left Mario dead and Monteriggioni in shambles..  Guess a relocation is in order.\n\nLeft with nothing Enzio is tasked with rebuilding the Assassin Brotherhood, while at the same time getting justice against the Borgia clan and reclaiming the apple once more..  This time around the game takes place in Roma.. better known as Rome, a very large and vibrant city.  You'll meet numerous people in your travels and back yet again is everyone's favorite painter and cheapskate Leonardo Di Vinci,\n\nThe Gameplay:  If you've played Assassin's Creed 2, you know fully what to expect in Brotherhood, the few additions to take note of..  Money serves a fair larger role in Brotherhood, gone is the building of a city, now you are tasked with rebuilding an entire City-State.  You gain revenue from the various businesses and landmarks that you purchase.  A new feature are the Borgia Towers, which have replaced many of the view points.  You need to kill the Guard Captain, then make your way up the Borgia tower to set it ablaze.  As you take out Borgia towers you reduce the Borgia's power and open up new businesses and landmarks that you can buy.  Another awesome idea is building of the Assassin Brotherhood, you can recruit assassins..  The more Borgia towers you control the more assassins you can own..  I believe the max is 10.  Also this time around various guilds exist which allow you to climb their ranks (although aside from dropping the price to hire the various helpers (courtesans, mercenaries or thieves I didn't notice any other benefits).   You can send your Assassins away on contracts of various difficulties, these earn the assassins experience, and money for you.  Occasionally you'll be rewarded with items as well.\n\nThe Combat:  Not much has been changed from the second game. The few changes are as follows.. You gain access to a crossbow!!!  A nice ranged weapon which allows you to silently kill enemies from afar.  Unlike the gun which makes noise and attracts attention, the Crossbow is silent and quite deadly.  Unarmed combat includes a few new animations for unarmed kills, such as a curb stomp, and neck breaking.  You can also chain kill this time around, which is very useful for those times when you are surrounded by 8 or 9 enemies, after you execute the first enemy, you can immediately focus and execute another without the need to fight them, repeat this as much as possibly until you need to counter attack.  The biggest change over all is the ability to call your Assassins into combat, or order them to take out guards.  Instead of having to get your hands dirty and risk tipping off the guards, you send in your crew, they clean up the guards then run off..   This is the single biggest game changer about brother hood..  Nothing beats having an army of 7 - 8 buffed up assassins at the ready for any of those large scale battles (although only about 3 - 4 of these battles exist unfortunately)\n\nThe conclusion... If you enjoyed Assassin's Creed 2, you'll enjoy Brotherhood.  While the game itself feels like a rather large expansion, it has enough meat and potatoes to stand on it's own.  So buy it, enjoy it..","January 27","true","21.8"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","87","39","45","22","0"

Actually, I have completed this game long ago, still I want to write a review for it. First-off, this game is my favorite of the whole series. I can't really remember when I began playing it but my emotions were like: "The Story of ACB is perfect". Yes, it's truth. Though, don't compare it to other Assassin's Creed games. OK, I begin with the story, of course. This game shows us a 40-years-old Ezio, after he "killed" Rodrigo Borgia and took "The Apple". I won't spoil it all but I will tell you where it all happens, in Rome. It's the only city you will be in. But it's not bad at all. Comparing to ACII we have a lot of new things: shops and buildings that need to be unlocked, new enemies, graphics (well, they did improve it a little bit), new weapons, and ASSASSIN RECRUITS! Yes, now we are able to recruit new comrades in our guild. It's cool, they'll help you fight with the enemies. Also, there's kill streak, with this thing you can fight with no stopping at all! You can punch enemies whose armor is heavy. The next thing is engine, still it's the same as it is in ACII (well, it's improved a little bit). I don't think I said everything you needed to know. You should feel it while playing. And the next BIG thing they added was MULTIPLAYER, it's perfect. You can fight off your friends, or be in one team! It's cool and has fun too! Well, I won't spoil, so you can enjoy it yourself. My final rating is 10/10 as it is my favorite.","May 3, 2014","true","97.6"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","42","51","0","0"

On the run from Abstergo, Desmond further explores his ancestor Ezio's memory to find where he had hidden the Apple of Eden, bringing him to the Papal Wars when he settled in Rome to rebuild the Assassin Brotherhood and oppose the Templars that controlled the Vatican.\n\nPros: Once again improves on the previous one, introducing new mechanics early and giving a coherent reason for starting from scratch. Replaced multiple medium maps by one large open world: Rome and the surrounding countryside and villages, which you assist in rebuilding by investing in it. Looting enemies now gets you ammunition, more money, and actual loot which can be sold or traded to unlock equipment. The near-future is also more relevant, as Desmond can log out of the Animus and interact more with Lucy and the others. Oh, and another WTF ending!\n\nCons: Rome is a clusterfrak to parkour in: streets zigzag incoherently while rooftops are so uneven it's faster to just run on the floor than climb up and down all the time. The loot you get is mostly clutter you'll sell, only a few of which you'll use to unlock stuff. Graphics didn't see much change at all. The last Ezio chapters are rushed.\n\nVerdict: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ - Next on your list!\n\nGreat sequel to Assassin's Creed II, but it's basically "more of the same" with some light improvement and more story. Don't play without playing the previous one first, and if you did like the previous one, you'll love this one, too!\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","May 2, 2015","true","44.8"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","21","25","0","0"

The game is further padded out by a heavy reliance on collectibles which rarely offer any benefit even if you do catch them all. The conspiracy-laden plot that stretches imagination at times (if /everybody/ is involved in the secret conspiracy, how can they claim nobody knows about it?). The graphics were too subdued and could have used a splash more color; another victim of the "real is brown" design school. And a host of bugs and gameplay issues - including a flaky camera, AI scripting problems and a finicky jumping mechanic that far too often had me leaping to my doom rather than at the obvious target right in front of me - did nothing to improve things.\n\nOn the other hand, the combat system was well done, with excellent and numerous animations, as was the parkour climbing that is the heart of the game. The level design were interesting, if too beige, and the voice-acting was excellent. Brotherhood shows that the Assassins Creed franchise remains enjoyable, even if it is growing a bit long in the tooth.","November 25, 2013","true","44.1"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/48190/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Note: As of now, this review covers only the single player portion of the game.\n\nAssassin's Creed II was, for all intents and purposes, the game the original wanted to be but fell short of, do to a variety of reasons perhaps most largely its own incredible ambition. With the sequel, Ubisoft managed to monumentally improve virtually every aspect of the series, giving us a tightly wound narrative, a charismatic lead, and refined mechanics that came together for one of the best games of the last few years.\n\nFollowing up this achievement is Brotherhood, arriving barely a year after the first and on the surface seeming little more than a retread of what we already saw, and an easy cash grab before a full fledged sequel can be made. In some ways this is accurate, as Brotherhood in many ways is incredibly similar to its predecessors, but to call it anything less than an entire new experience would be a disservice, as for how short a time it had in the oven it's just as large and engrossing as the games that came before it, while also adding an assortment of excellent new mechanics that push the game forward even when it occasionally stumbles in the wake of critical acclaim.\n\nBeing a direct sequel, Brotherhood picks up mere moments after the end of II, with the surprising (arguably convoluted) events that transpired still fresh in Ezio's mind though it would appear he has finally arrived at a moment of peace after all his struggles. Of course nothing good ever lasts long, and it doesn't take long for his enemies to catch up with him, kill yet more of what little family he has left, and send Italy tumbling into chaos, leaving you to pick up the pieces (though for once you aren't alone).\n\nAfter the fantastic birth to assassin story of II, Brotherhood's more traditional tail of revenge mixed with some incomprehensible supernatural elements never quite manages to achieve the same level of intrigue and pacing. Though perfectly solid and enough to drive the experience, aside from the first and last few hours it meanders through much of its plot, spiraling off into dozens of disconnected tangents that feel more like side missions than an overarching narrative which left me feeling rather disengaged with everything that was happening. By the end I had lost the investment I previously had in these characters, and simply wanted it all to wrap up in a way that somehow made it all pull together, which again it unfortunately failed to. This isn't to say that Brotherhood isn't entertaining, or that the story is terrible, but it lacked the sense of urgency and tightness that exuded from every moment of II and came off a tad rushed.\n\nThankfully, Brotherhood plays incredibly well, taking everything that worked with II and adding in enough fresh elements and interesting mission types to be just as engaging. The most readily apparent change is that of the scenery, moving away from Venice and into the sprawling city of Rome. It's a far larger environment, that feels more alive than ever thanks in part to the expanded town building system which now encompasses the whole of the city, allowing you to renovate shops and tunnels to provide income, more areas to purchase items, and fast travel across the map. It also makes it easier to feel invested in the city as you see it build up around you with each new renovation. It's a huge world to explore, yet every inch of it is packed with an enormous amount of things to do, leaving little idle space and a never ending stream of missions the vast majority of which are surprisingly fleshed out and enjoyable.\n\nAs the name implies, Brotherhood no longer sees you fighting alone but instead building up an army of assassins which you can then send on contracts and call in when you need aid. It's a tad underdeveloped in its current state, but it nonetheless greatly changes how you can approach an encounter, as often times calling in assassins which can pop out of anywhere is far less risky than attempting to get close to a target yourself. They also work as convenient distractions, and add a layer to encounters that feels especially needed when the combat is still trapped in a fairly dull design that despite numerous cool kill animations never became very fun and was best avoided whenever possible.\n\nOther minor tweaks in takedowns, platforming, and general movement add some noticeable refinement to the series core gameplay, though there are still moments when the camera will freak out or the free running system will send you jumping randomly completely in the wrong direction. Animations in particular continue to stick out to me as incredibly well done, with Ezio in particular moving with as much grace and fluidity as you'd expect from an assassin. Lastly Jasper Kyd's original score is utterly gorgeous and sets the mode strikingly well at every moment, as if his music is deeply tied into the world and speaking to you as you traverse it.\n\nDespite its narrative shortcomings, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is by no means the sloppily churned out annualized rubbish it very well could be, instead a brilliant successor to what I would consider an utter masterpiece, and a remarkably well crafted game on its own measures. If you've yet to touch the series this certainly isn't the place to jump in, but if you were left wanting more after II, Brotherhood will certainly satisfy and then some.","September 6, 2014","true","19.0"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","4"

It continues Ezio's story right after the end of AC2 as well as continuing Desmond's story (modern times).

When this game came out, Uplay was in it's infancy, and it has undergone many updates since. Uplay is completely stable these days and hasn't given me a single problem in about a year.\n\nWhenever I hear somebody say Assassin's Creed II is the best game of the series, I just want to tell them to replay it. It's glitchy and controls terribly, especially after being used to the updated control refinements that AC:III and Black Flag introduced. That being said, This game doesn't control as well as the aforementioned two games, but the controls are tighter and, overall, the intuitive nature of the parkour/jumping algorithms are significantly improved.\n\nThe graphics, while not a drastic overhaul from its predecessor, are quite good and there seems to be more attention to detail in the texture work within the environment. Also the lighting is noticably superior.\n\nI would say the only thing that may be worse in this game than it's predecessor is the story. But that's only because everyone loves an origin story, which was the heart of the first game. Although, the villains in this installment are far more fleshed out and it's really fun seeing the family dynamic of the Borgia's play out.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an A game that refines it's previous entries shortcomings and is really the peak of the Ezio trilogy, if not the entire Assassin's Creed franchise.","September 26, 2015","true","69.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

Having previously played this game on the PS3 when it launched back in 2010, I can say it was a fun revisit! Gameplay speaking, this Assassin's Creed "2.5" adds more mechanics for playability, you can recruit assassins to join the Assassins' cause.\n\nBrotherhood continues the trilogy story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze and now focus solely on Rome. The city is big, really big to explore. Although, even if it is quite big, I much preferred the different locations in AC2 than "only being in Rome". There is a tons of collectibles in this game... too many for my taste. 101 Borgia Flags does unlock you the Borgia Cape, which sets the notoriety permanently at none. Same effects occurs if you completely rebuild Rome with renovations, you unlock the Auditore Cape. I had the Auditore Cape on my PlayStation 3 playthrough and it was satisfactory to go on a rampage without being chased by guards all the time. But you're more than likely to unlock that cape quite late in the game which makes it almost pointless.\n\n\nPROS:\n+Strong narrative, both in the present with Desmond Miles and in the Animus, Ezio Auditore da Firenze.\n+Graphically improved compared to AC2 albeit contains visual glitches at times.\n+Soundtrack is excellent and again, composed by Jesper Kyd.\n+Same as AC2, the voice acting is solid.\n+Improved combat system.\n+More weapons and you can now carry heavy weapons.\n+Recruiting and using assassins on targets.\n+Multiplayer ain't my fort√© in the AC franchise, but it is very original nonetheless.\n+Ability to replay missions.\n+High replay value.\n\nCONS:\n-Uplay DRM.\n-Horrendous WASD keyboard + mouse scheme. Play this game with a gamepad! (I played Brotherhood with the Xbox One controller and it worked without any issues).\n-AC: Brotherhood feels like a big filler and not a proper sequel or expansion.\n-Silly timer on pretty much every assassination missions. Very irritating!\n-Some stupid requirements during missions like to not be seen or it causes desynchronisation.\n-Draw distance in this game seems broken at times, especially when you see guards appearing right in front of you, i.e.\n-Rome pretty much looks like the same anywhere you go in Italy.\n-Steep learning curve for the Multiplayer mode.\n-The cliffhanger ending is very irritating.\n-Too many collectibles... however, once seen in Eagle Vision, it sticks on your map for later acquisition.\n-Annoying "Full synchronisation" on missions / side-missions that don't do anything except unlock Trophies (PS3) or Achievements.\n\nOVERALL:\nBrotherhood ain't perfect for sure. But if you loved previous AC games, you'll enjoy this game very much. If you're a newcomer in the AC franchise, you could love this game a lot as well but you're gonna feel lost in the story. My best advice, you better play the previous games or at least, get informed by reading / watching wikia and videos online or you're gonna feel completely off the track!\n\nThis game adds a few great mechanics which is always welcomed. Although, I felt this game to be more of a filler than a sequel / expansion. It is a good filler that is well paced... right until the very end scene which leaves you in a cliffhanger!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nYes, I highly recommend this game for anyone loving this playstyle. The story is very interesting and you feel quite engaged with it as much as the past and the future events. My favorite AC game so far is still AC2 but Brotherhood continues on the same premise so you won't feel lost when playing it.\n\nRATING:\n8.0 / 10\n\nAnd now, going to revisit AC: Revelations...","June 24, 2014","true","26.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","2"

When beginning the game you start right where you left off in AC2. Without giving too much away you leave Rome only to return where the main game takes place.\nIn Brotherhood a new mechanic was added that let you perform kill streaks much more easily. This new feature included easier kills and the ability to immediatly take out enemies one after another. This made combat a lot faster however it felt almost too easy. The city is quite large however it is lacking in actual buildings too parkour across once outside the region.\nEven though the main story was quite short it is made up for in the free dlc and side quests.

If you are new to the series, I suggest to play with Assassin's Creed‚Ñ¢: Director's Cut Edition first because of the story.\n\nWhere to begin... History is playground.\nThis game is one of the most enjoyable game I've ever played. The music is a masterpiece, I will buy the OST on Google Play. The cities are full of life, the environment and graphics feels real. It is now impossible for me to go outside without mentally assessing climbing routes and synchronization points over all the buildings in the historical downtown of my city.\nBrotherhood only gives a small extra to Assassin's Creed 2. I often felt this is AC2, but thanks to the small extras this is a step forward.\n\nEzio is probably one of the best and well-written characters in gaming history, I was a little disappointed in AC2 last mission. After perfectly built large cities Ubisoft made a mistake to let Ezio go to "Rome", which was only a limited wall, a tiny part of the Vatican.\nLuckily Ubisoft finished what they begun, and we got a beautiful ancient Rome.\nThis is not just a game. The cities has historical buildings, events, and people. In the game you can access information about the characters' life, the story of the place you are. You can find hidden signs to explore "the truth". You can access side missions, and you can collect and purchase items.\nAll things considered this game is probably one of the best of the Assassin's Creed games, I highly recommend to buy it.

While they didn't reinvent the wheel with this game, they certainly improved and enhanced it.\n\nRather than the game taking place in multiple cities across Italy, AC:B takes place mostly in the city of Rome. However, Rome is by far the most detailed location in the game up to this point. You can upgrade local buisinesses in the world, take out guard outposts and burn them to the ground, and  run a local assassin guild you build from the ground up. Among many other things. The game is also noticeably harder and basically expects that you already played through AC2 before this one. It also features V/R missions like Metal Gear Solid so you can test your skills in the combat and stealth challenges. There's plenty to do in this game and the focus on side content is very noticeable.\n\nSo if you liked AC2, AC:B is the next thing to check out. On the other hand if you haven't played AC2, or didn't really like it I don't recommend this one. It expects that you have already played through AC2 and apart from the setting and the inclusion of a few new weapons it's virtually the same game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392173177","January 1, 2015","true","11.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In this title (which in my opinion should be could Assassin's Creed III: Brotherhood) the entire adventure takes place in Rome. It is gigantic and very well detailed. It looks way better then Assassin's Creed II and there are some subtle improvements to the gameplay of ACII.\n\nThe Story is not as good as the last two games in the series. The ending is great and leaves you guessing. Ezio is now becoming a Master Assassin and thus recruits new Assassin's. You can call these brothers in arms into battle whenever you wish. Yes, it's a cheap and overpowered way to get yourself out of a tough fight, but I love the way these Assassin's come out of hiding places just like Alta√Ør or Ezio would. You bond with a lot of characters and I love that.\n\nIn other words, did you play the wonderful Assassin's Creed II and you want to know the next chapter in the story? Brotherhood is a very safe purchase. Fun, beautiful and exciting! Love it.","July 20, 2014","true","42.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

While AC2 felt like a huge step from AC1, in this case the changes are not that big. Ubisoft left the basics from what made AC2 great and added a whole bunch of extra stuff. This time it is just one city - Rome, that is divided into 4 districts. Still present is a really good storyline where Ezio is already established but builds up his brotherhood of assassins. The game is still fun and has lots of side missions to keep you occupied for hours. However, some types become a bit repetitive and the 100% requirements for many missions are just plain annoying. But I guess this is to counteract the fact that once you have you assassins that you can call upon the game goes into easy mode. So the only real challenge comes from the artificial requirements of the 100% completion system. The combat is the same as in AC2. Main assassinations are again great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. This time we see more of the Desmond timeline of which I am a fan. Some flaws are funky camera placement in some cases and sometimes weird AI. I would complain about uPlay but you all know what playing Ubisoft games is like. You simply need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is awesome and while slightly worse than AC2 it still is worth your money.

Set between 1499-1509 Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood takes place immediately after the plot of Assassin's Creed II, featuring the 16th-century Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Italy and on his quest to restore the Assassin order, and destroy his enemies: the Borgia family. Intersecting with these historical events are the modern day activities of series protagonist Desmond Miles, who relives his ancestor Ezio's memories to find a way to fight against the Assassins' enemies, the Templars, and to also prevent the 2012 apocalypse. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood introduces rectruabile Assassins to the game. Ezio can now recruit new members to the Assassin Order by destroying any of the twelve "Borgia towers" around Rome where the papal troops are stationed, then by rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from the harassing guards. There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those that were seen in AC II such as the horsemen, arquebusiers, the papal guards and others. Horses now also have a much larger role in AC Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport, but also as a component of different acrobatic sequences and also so much more advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is also the first game in the whole Assassin's Creed Franchise to feature multiplayer which consists of three game modes, Free for All, Co-Op and Team. This game is just full of amazing detail in every aspect; The story, Graphics, ambiance, environment, sound and much more. I really recommend this for the mere fact that it's just always fun to play, and there is just so much things that you can do in the game. I absolutely cannot recommend this game to you enough it really is just absolutely outstanding. So once again I highly recommend that you get this game because I'm sure you won't regret it. I am definitely without even a single doubt 100% sure that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood will not disappoint you!.","September 10, 2014","true","307.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"

So it was about 4am and i was a little tired. I went on steam and saw ubisoft having a sale and thought "Why not buy assassin's creed?" But of course I forgot about Uplay that comes with it on the pc. Basicly It is an add-on you have to download to play any ubisoft games and it is really annoying. I'm not trying to discourage assassins creed, it is a good game, brotherhood i've played on xbox and loved it, the same with black flag. But Uplay creates problems with gameplay.(Also takes up a bit of space in a Uplay folder it makes in your computer's Program files/x86.)  And it can be seen in all of ubisofts public reviews; 1.[i.imgur.com] : 2.[i.imgur.com]. This is part of the reason their games get poor reviews from the public due to non-needed add on's that make it hard to actualy get to the gameplay. (Example: EA's Origin or Rockstar's online social club.) If your going to buy a game from these companies I would strongly advise buying it on a Playstation or Xbox, but if your like me ond only like to use PC there isn't much to do about it.","March 9, 2014","false","0.1"," 45 of 84 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","45","84","0","0"

A Clearer picture, constant 60 FPS, and almost no game crashes has been so far my best experience on PC with an Ubisoft game that I've played outside of South Park: The Stick of Truth.\n\nGraphics: They are a step up from ACII, with more colors, a clearer picture, and more detail on everything from buildings and architecture to character models. Some common citizens as well as the new assassin recruits/their faces, however, look a little too low poly and low rez as far as the game world is around them, but this is just a minor concern. The game, for the most part, makes Rome look stunning, even by 2015 standards (if you have an open mind for older titles, anyway). I did have a weird problem with citizens/guards popping in right in front of me, as they took longer to load, and they scared the heck outta me when that happened, but this didn't take away much from my experience.\n\nStory/Plot/Setting: It picks up right where ACII leaves up and continues to be compelling and engaging. Ezio is still ever the charming personality. The people he interacts with are, for the most part, well written and interesting. Ezio continues to learn and grow as a character. The new assassin recruits make for an interesting side game as well as a great story mechanic. The side missions expand on the story even further, especially the Christina Memories. You spend more time as Desmond in this game than you did in ACII, but not enough to take away from the experience as Ezio. The ending is an interesting plot device to push the story even further and ends on an outrageous cliffhanger.\n\nGameplay: It's the AC gameplay we all knew and loved from the 2nd game, with better platforming and new side missions. The Assassin recruits are simple to handle, though not very engaging. A lot of the side missions that you may or may not have loved, like contracts, races, the like, have returned. Collectibles have also returned. However there is a lack of the puzzles you did in ACII. The Romulus missions work similar to the Assassin Tombs in ACII, which I loved! I beat the game in 26 hours, about 4 hours shy of the time I spent in ACII, but if you're a completionist or enjoyed a lot of the side stuff that ACII had to offer you could easily spend more time than that with this game. There is also the "investments" in stores outside of buying them, but considering that the community has moved on to the newer titles, they don't really matter much.\n\nI did not play Multiplayer so I am not sure how well this game has retained a community but keep in mind this game was released in 2011.\n\nBut I highly recommend playing this version if you have not played the series before. A shame that recommendation is harder to give for the final part of Ezio's story, Revelations. Stay tuned for that review once I finish the game.","August 3, 2015","true","26.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Currently through with Mem Seq 8 and have completed the majority of renovations and purchases and have a couple assassins in my brotherhood - working toward that magic number 5. I'm pretty much just map-clearing before going on with the main plot thread to afford my brotherhood the chance to level up. I have the feeling that the rest of the story missions will go quite smoothly.\nPerhaps the opening interval made me wary of Brotherhood and its standing as a sequel to ACII, but I think it works out the kinks smoothly.

You'll just not use them on a horse.\n\nThe setting is different now though. Largely, you'll spend your time in Rome. A confusing change. Not only for you, but your horse too it seems. Horse AI never needed to be very intelligent in past games, but here their intelligence' true nature seems to really surface. It's limited to silly situations, thankfully.\n\nHowever, being one city, Rome is one big city to be in. You'll be busy renovating stores and freeing districts from Borgia influence. Which partly is entwined in the story.\n\nThat said, the story becomes quite a bit more interesting. A matured Ezio is becoming the driving force behind the goals of the Assassins, and will later on be able to command a handful of his own trainees. This forms a new method of approaching a problem. You'll have assassin signals assigned to you, which you can use to send one of your apprentices out of hiding, and attack your target.\nOr, when you have enough signals saved up with enough aprentices, you can launch an arrow storm attack, killing almost all hostile in the vicinity. These signals slowly replenish over time.\n\nIf the story of AC2 engaged you, you will not be hard pressed to enjoy it here as well.

The story picks up exactly where the last one left off (both in the past and the present), and the game mechanics are more or less identical. In some ways, the need for this game to exist seems a bit unnecessary (i.e. it feels more like the result of a corporate mandate to make an annual franchise than a creative decision). That said, it‚Äôs forgivable if only for the fact that it‚Äôs just as good as its predecessor, if not better. Part of what feels forced is the contrived story revolving around Ezio losing his Apple of Eden and having to retrieve it. But there you go... it is what it is - basically, a flimsy excuse to move to a new setting and do more cool things with a well-loved character.\n\nThe game takes place in the early 1500s, almost entirely in Rome. While that may sound like a reduced scope in setting from the prior games, it‚Äôs actually not. Rome is huge. Like, really huge. There are also a few other places that you get to explore in some of the main story missions as well, so there is plenty of variety in the environments. As usual, it‚Äôs a lot of fun just to explore the city and discover its secrets. Brotherhood also greatly expands the role of horses (you can ride them pretty much anywhere), and there are some fun combat mechanics added as well. The missions in the game are similar to those from AC2, so nothing major has changed on that front. The other primary mechanics introduced in AC2 (notoriety, blending, etc) all return here as well and are also just as good.\n\nThe main addition this game brings to the series is the titular Brotherhood. Ezio can now recruit citizens to the Assassin Brotherhood. As you progress through the game, more recruit slots are unlocked. Once recruited, you can call your Assassins to assist in combat or send them on missions in a sort of optional sub-game. Doing either of these things awards XP to the recruits and eventually they level up and become more powerful. Though hardly revelatory by any means, it‚Äôs a fun new aspect to the game and is a welcome addition.\n\nWhile Assassin‚Äôs Creed: Brotherhood doesn‚Äôt really do anything groundbreaking or expand on the established formula in any major way, it is still worth playing if you enjoyed AC2. While it is essentially more of the same, at least it‚Äôs a *good* more of the same.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nNote: I don‚Äôt recommend playing any of the Assassin‚Äôs Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.","February 13, 2013","true","55.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Mechanically, it's not very different from other games in the series - it is a third person open-world historical fiction action game, where you play as an assassin in 16th century Italy, working to improve the standing of your faction and reduce the power of your opposing faction.\n\nLike seems to be the case in this series, controls are improved over predecessors in that it makes combat easier, but that also serves to transition the game from being a stealthy assassin and more into being the sort of person who just jumps into combat and runs rampant. The primary change in this game is the ability to summon other assassins to help with combat/kills, which actually is pretty fantastic.\n\nI played this game on the 360, and enjoyed it a great deal - it's very much "more of Assassin's Creed II" with very minor changes. If that sounds like a good time, by all means - check it out. The game's a lot of fun. But by the end of this game, the mechanics and such were starting to wear thin - it's probably why I've taken as long as I have to get started in Revelations.","June 14, 2014","true","0.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The game continues the narrative saga, but quickly becomes tedious in its constant parkour maneuvers and climbing. However, AC:B is the first of the series to offer a multiplayer mode which in itself becomes just as tedious. Still, AC:B provides a crucial extension to the AC2's story line that again leaves fan hanging on for more. Essentially, AC:B feels like a paid expansion to properly conclude AC2 and begins to really show the repetitive nature of the series.","July 7, 2012","true","22.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

the Ezio we see at the beginning to the game is still the same old Ezio we see when the credits roll.¬† Admittedly it would have been a tall order for Brotherhood to raise the stakes for Ezio relative to the events in AC2.¬†¬†Unfortunately this leaves the events that transpire in Brotherhood feeling a bit like an epilogue to the 'main story' occurring in AC2.\n\nIn Brotherhood we once again find ourselves fighting the Borgias although these particular members of the family seemingly pop up from nowhere.¬†¬†From a historical perspective it makes sense that these Borgias would have been a threat to the fictional world of Ezio, but in terms of gameplay it would have been nice to at least have some reference to these folks in AC2, so as to maintain series continuity (granted I do understand this sort of series planning doesn't often happen that far in advance).¬† The main Borgia from AC2 does makes an appearance in Brotherhood as well, but it‚Äôs only slightly more than a couple of cameos.¬† After all the time spent in AC2 tracking this man down, Ezio actually has very little to do with how that thread resolves itself.¬† So that‚Äôs a bit disappointing.¬† As it is the newly introduced Borgias wind up feeling like the "bad guys du jour".¬†¬†The motivation for fighting them is provided clearly enough; it's just the enemies themselves seem to be randomly inserted into the mythos (unless you were already acquainted with the history of the Borgias in which case, yes I suppose this decision makes total sense.)\n\nSo let's talk about gameplay, because for the most part it is absolutely brilliant in Brotherhood.¬†¬†Once again we are treated to the delightfully smooth responsiveness we saw in AC2, and maybe it's just me, but I feel like general mechanics and responsiveness have been even further improved upon here.¬†¬†I didn't have nearly as many moments in which I felt Ezio jumped in completely unexpected directions.¬†¬†Wall jumps are smoother and easier to execute reliably.¬†¬†Not only that but the new gameplay elements introduced in Brotherhood, make the game all that much more enjoyable.¬†¬†Horseback combat is the best that it‚Äôs ever been in the series, and horseback assassinations feel extremely satisfying.¬†¬†The introduction of kill streaks makes standard combat even more dynamic and interesting.¬†¬†The crossbow is a fantastic addition for stealth kills at a distance.¬†And then of course there is the titular Brotherhood itself.¬†¬†The 'game within the game' of building and managing a stable of Assassin's under your command is enjoyable and well executed.¬†¬†Once you have a few talented assassins at your beck and call, it simultaneously introduces some game breaking elements and counterintuitively an undeniable feeling of exhilaration that comes with having a badass ninja posse at your disposal.¬†You'd rather not deal with the gate guards in your way?¬†¬†Just whistle for your homeboys to jump in with blades flashing and smoke bombs flying.¬†¬†Don't feel like slugging it out with charging cavalry?¬†¬†Call in an arrow storm.¬†¬†The brotherhood introduces a really fun mechanic to play around with, which actually does help to further the narrative of Ezio transitioning from rank and file soldier to master assassin within the order.\n\nSo while there is an overwhelming amount of good involved in terms of gameplay, there's also a dash of the questionable.¬†¬†This is the first game in the series to introduce the concept of 'memory synchronization'.¬†¬†Essentially this means that you have to play missions in a certain way, or meet certain objectives during the mission, to reach full synchronization (read: full completion percentage).¬†¬†Sometimes the full synchronization criterion makes sense.¬†¬†"Kill only the main target" or "Kill your target with the hidden blade" for example.¬†¬†Sure, that all sounds reasonably assassin-ish, and I can buy in to that.¬†¬†But sometimes the goals feel tacked on and arbitrary at best ("Kill at least three enemy types with their own weapon ", " Kick your target"), and at worst they introduce an artificial sense of difficulty that would not exist otherwise ("Do not take damage while in the tank. " ‚Ä¶ a tank which happens to be an unresponsive heap of fetid frustration.¬†¬†That's right Leonardo, if you're reading this; your tank is more worthless than a bag of farts at the bank).¬†¬†While the Order of Assassin's preaches that, "Nothing is True,¬†Everything is Permitted, the game itself tells you in no uncertain terms that, "No in fact you're only permitted to accomplish this objective in one specific prescribed way".¬†¬†It's not that memory synchronization is game breaking or anything, but it does take some getting used to (or potentially a lot¬†of getting used to if you‚Äôre going for 100% completion).\n\nLastly be aware that there is¬†a lot¬†to do in this game.¬†¬†This can be good or bad depending on how you feel about "artificially extending the experience".¬†¬†So you've finished the story?¬†¬†I don‚Äôt think so partner, go help Leonardo with this whole War Machine thing.¬†¬†You're done with that?¬†¬†Better figure out what the Cult of Romulus is up to!¬†¬†Romulus is in remission?¬†¬†Better go help some courtesans now!¬†¬†Whoa, don't forget about those regression memories with Maria!¬†¬†Have you completed any guild challenges?¬†¬†Well get on it!¬†¬†Don't forget to explore modern day Monteriggioni!¬†¬†No wait, where are you going?!¬† You need to find and solve the Mystery of the Glyphs!¬†¬†And on and on ‚Ä¶¬†Personally I don't mind this sort of thing.¬†¬†AC: Brotherhood is a fun world, and it's fun to just goof around while completing some missions at the same time.¬†¬†On the other hand, if you feel like the description above sounds like a grinding slog tacked on purely for the purpose of lengthening the game, well you might have a bad time in Brotherhood (unless you opt to ignore side missions completely which is also perfectly valid)\n\nOverall Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood effectively expands and builds upon the Assassin's Creed universe with some really great gameplay choices.¬†¬†While the story lacks some of the overarching grandeur we saw in AC2, it is still a nice expansion upon the story of Ezio and his exploits in Rome.","February 24, 2015","true","67.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

O jogo tr√°s algumas novidades em rela√ß√£o ao seu antecessor, mas n√£o muitas, de forma que parece mais ser uma expans√£o que um jogo novo. Digo isto n√£o querendo desmerecer, at√© porque se trata de um t√≠tulo de grande qualidade, mas se n√£o fosse pelas cidades de ocorr√™ncia serem diferentes, facilmente poderia se confundir os dois jogos.\n\nA trama, como sempre muito bem elaborada, diz respeito a liberta√ß√£o de Roma do dom√≠nio dos Borgia, poderosa fam√≠lia de templ√°rios que al√©m de tudo estavam no controle de um dos artefatos m√°gicos. No entanto, o final √© meio desanimador, por ser totalmente inconclusivo  deixando o jogador com a impress√£o de que o jogo acabou antes do final.\n\nEntre as novidades, a que mais chama aten√ß√£o √© a possibilidade de recrutar pessoas entre a popula√ß√£o e trein√°-los em batalha para que se tornem assassinos, inclusive com ritual de passagem e tudo que tem direito! A Irmandade tamb√©m pode ser usada para se livrar de um pelot√£o de inimigos inteiro com a chuva de flechas, caso estejam todos os recrutas dispon√≠veis.\n\nOutra coisa legal √© que existem desafios extras durante as miss√µes, como, por exemplo, complet√°-la sem ser visto ou matar usando determinado item, criando assim um grande est√≠mulo a rejogar para tentar 100% de sincroniza√ß√£o.\n\nAl√©m destas citadas, h√° outras novidades como uma maior utiliza√ß√£o da economia, de forma que √© poss√≠vel adquirir pr√©dios p√∫blicos e com√©rcios para depois investir neles, na pr√°tica uma ideia meio desperdi√ßada. Para liberar os estabelecimentos para compra, √© necess√°rio destruir uma torre de vigil√¢ncia pr√≥xima e matar seu capit√£o, para que as tropas recuem e parem de intimidar os comerciantes.\n\nUma coisa chata √© a forma de se adquirir as armaduras e armas novas, que precisam ser desbloqueadas atrav√©s de miss√µes para as lojinhas em que s√£o vendidas. Essas "miss√µes" consistem em encontrar determinado n√∫mero de itens espec√≠ficos, e feito isso a pe√ßa √© desbloqueada.  D√° para fazer as miss√µes mesmo sem saber que est√° fazendo, mas de qualquer forma √© chato ficar dependendo de sorte para encontrar os itens certos.\n\nOutra coisa ruim √© que, al√©m de possuir apenas uma cidade dispon√≠vel (muito embora esta seja enorme), as partes desbloqueadas a cada mem√≥ria s√£o inescrupulosamente misturadas, de forma que h√° locais no meio do mapa que s√≥ s√£o desbloqueados nas fases finais e peda√ßos da ponta que est√£o dispon√≠veis desde o in√≠cio, tornando tudo muito confuso.\n\nNo fim das contas, AC Brotherhood √© um jogo divertido e apesar de parecer mais uma expans√£o que um jogo novo, n√£o cai na mesmice e apresenta uma qualidade t√£o alta quanto o seu antecessor. √â altamente recomendado para todos aqueles que gostam de um jogo com uma boa hist√≥ria. EXCELENTE (9/10).\n","December 27, 2014","true","28.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/48190/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","The Assassin's Creed series just keeps getting better and better. The first game was a solid start, but the missions got repetitive after a while. AC II blew me away with the number of things they added; a compelling plot and characters that felt authentic, interesting platforming sequences, and a real sense of humor!\n\nI just finished the story campaign of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and I can't decide whether I liked it better than Assassin's Creed II or not.\n\nGraphically Brotherhood is obviously better, but it is not as big a difference as the change from AC to AC II. Also, 3D gaming is really useful while freerunning around Renaissance Italy because depth perception helps me to know whether I can make a jump or not.\n\nI think I preferred the story of AC II because it was an epic narrative of Ezio's journey over several decades to train and grow from a rather self-centered lady-killer young adult to a mature assassin (still a lady-killer). AC Brotherhood was much more limited in scope, as it takes place over the course of a few years in the city of Rome. Don't get me wrong, it was epic, but I liked the tangible progression that Ezio went through in AC II.\n\nHowever, I definitely preferred the gameplay of Brotherhood. They improved on a few of the things that had been iffy in the previous games (like horses!) and they added some really great things as well. The big one of course is recruiting assassins to help you out. I felt like a total badass whenever I walked by a group of guards, raised my hand and whistled, and a moment later they were dead. I also became rather attached to the recruits, and it made me very proud when they gained enough experience to become full-fledged assassins. Losing recruits didn't have quite as big an emotional impact as losing people in The Walking Dead did, but when I accidentally killed one it came pretty close.\n\nThe endings of these games keep getting more and more mind-blowing; I have heard that Revelations raises the bar once again, and I can't wait to get there. One thing that definitely gave me the chills was the date that the finale takes place on. Ubisoft has intentionally been converging all events on December 21, 2012 and the final scenes of Brotherhood take place 72 days before that.\n\nSo if you were to ask me which Assassin's Creed games you should play, I would say all of them. If you are short on time/money skipping the first one is excusable. AC II, Brotherhood, and Revelations make a nice little trilogy, so don't start after AC II.","October 3, 2012","true","36.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

After playing this I started a rerun for the previous game and I feel that as a game experience, this one is a lot more solid and fun to play. Rome as a city feels better for the gameplay than Florence&Venice. Also concentrating only on one city, the game area becomes more familiar and yet has almost as much to offer as all the areas in AC2. Also the "subplot" makes now more sense, although it still takes only baby steps. Animus interface and controls are less akward and running in the roof tops seem more intuitive and fun. I still don't like the idea, that some areas are unreachable until advancement in the main plot, but atleast it isn't as annoying as in the previous game.\n\nIf you are looking an entrance to the series, this might be the one to start with. Although the subplot might not make much sense, it does not do that even with previous games played. So you might just enjoy this games main plot and then think about getting the other games if you like. I took the bit harder road and purchased AC2 first and almost didn't buy this because the flaws in it. Now I'm glad I did buy this.","September 22, 2014","true","53.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the third installment to the series leaving off where Assassin's Creed 2 left off. The game feels very much like the second in many ways but the most notable is that the main character is still the assassin named Ezio, honestly most of the time I think of this more as an expansion pack instead of a standalone. Even with that being said many new features were brought into the game, most of these changes are still in the most recent release Black Flag.\n\nThe game takes the gameplay of the second and enhances upon it, for example now you can equip the hidden gun with the sword or the dagger with throwing knives. Combat is far less time consuming with the introduction of the kill streaks, although this is useful it takes much of the difficulty out of the game. This is also the game that introduces assassin recruits, although it feels less refined than revalations they are still a very welcome addition to the game. Also the game adds some replayablity by allowing you to revisit missions unlike the second game, it even goes as far as to give you a reason to go back with extra objectives in a mission to accomplish what is known as "full sync". Full synchronization is nice for those who are completionists and want more out of the game but sometimes they get frustrating. Last but not least the controls are still a little touchy at times you may jump the completely wrong way, this can get very annoying especially when you jump off cliffs.\n\nSorry about the rambling there, honestly this may not be mechanically my favorite of the series but it is still one of my favorites from the series. The game introduces many mechanics that would later be some of my favorite aspects to the series after they were refined. This game definitely has my approval for anyone thinking of purchasing.","June 22, 2014","true","38.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story pick up right where 2nd game ended and Ezio now must find a way to stop the opposing force once again. Ezio is driven away from his home Monteriggioni vila, and travels to the Rome to stop the Templars. When he infiltrates Rome he quickly finds himself in difficult possition as the assassin brotherhood is weakened and the usual suspects refuse to help him. Ezio regains influence for assassins, rebuilds weakened assassin brotherhood and becomes the Grand Master of the brotherhood. Your quest might seem simple, to regain stolen Eden's Apple from vicious templar Cesare Borgia, but it's never that easy, especially when your enemy is a templar. You get to see city of Rome, lots of memorable locations, and immerse yourself in another incredible chapter of Ezio's life.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't seem like it was improved whole lot, like transition from first game to second, however you're given few new tools to dispose of your enemies. You now have crossbow so you can assassinate your targets 2 rooftops away quickly and silently. What I really wanted since 2nd game was carry an axe for fights, even though it's not elegant weapon for an assassin. The biggest improvement in this installment was the intern system. The intern-assassins can do your assassinations for you, that gives them experience and eventually they graduate from assassin school and become real assassins. The gameplay didn't change much from 2nd game but it's not a bad thing considering it did pretty good job improving rough angles.  The one thing that's worth mentioning is execution system, where you can go on endless kill streak after successful counter attack. This thing was so fun I couldn't stop doing it till the very end of the game. Overally gameplay is smoother version of the 2nd installment which works really well.\n\nWhat I really disliked about the game was 3rd party DRM system called Uplay. There was no warning that I have to install a program besides steam in order to enjoy game I already purchased. That being said I can't see any other downsides to this game besides Uplay. If you wonder whenever you should get this game the answer would be strong yes.","October 31, 2014","true","43.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the Christina missions, as it gave a nice nostalgic vibe, seeing Florence with brotherhood graphics is amazing, and i definetly liked the Steel Armor for Ezio in some of them as it looked more fresh than AC2. I haven't played the multiplayer yet, but I assume it's good (unless ubisoft have taken down the servers). The Lairs of Romulus are fun sometimes too, they act the same as the Assassin Tombs in AC2, Leonardo's War Machine Missions are good aswell, I think they pay off too, I did sometimes get stuck, and sometimes they do get stressy, since It's not really in my nature to not get caught, I had to be extra sneaky. The customisation is more varied than AC2 aswell, but still sticking with some of the AC2 patterns, like Wetlands Ebony and some of the Florence colors. Overall, I would say that this game in my opinion is a bit better than AC2, since there are alot more story oppertunities, and it goes well with the big map too, plus it saves some loading screens going from one place to the other in AC2.","September 27, 2014","true","44.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of going all over northern Italy, you now stay (mostly) in Rome. Rome is a very big and interesting place, so it certainly doesn't feel limited; but it is a bit less varied.\n\nGameplaywise there are some nice improvements. The biggest and most interesting one is that you can now recruit other assassins, who can either help you out in combat, or perform missions for money. Besides this there are some small improvements, such as the ability to ride horses inside the city, and some noticable improvements in the controls. The story, however, is not as engaging as that of AC II.\n\nOverall, a very solid and enjoyable game, even if I enjoyed II a little more. 8/10 compared to AC II's 9/10.","April 22, 2014","true","44.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ezio is driven away from his home Monteriggioni vila, and travels to the Rome to stop the Templars. When he infiltrates Rome he quickly finds himself in difficult possition as the assassin brotherhood is weakened and the usual suspects refuse to help him. Ezio regains influence for assassins, rebuilds weakened assassin brotherhood and becomes the Grand Master of the brotherhood. Your quest might seem simple, to regain stolen Eden's Apple from vicious templar Cesare Borgia, but it's never that easy, especially when your enemy is a templar.

When you lock on an NPC, or PC in multiplayer, it actually LOCKS. This was the only gripe I had with AC2's gameplay and it's been remedied.\n\nYou might have noticed that I've logged almost 500 hours in this game. The continuing story is great but it doesn't have THAT much replay value. No, that time was mostly spent in Wanted mode multiplayer (MP). And what a multiplayer it was/is. I've never played anything like it. This game's MP changed my view on something. I once read a review of Mass Effect 3 in which the writer stated that he loved ME3 multiplayer but didn't care about the story at all. I was somehow annoyed by this. Even if you hated the ending (I didn't) how can you play a Mass Effect game at all without caring about the story?! That game's world building was on an epic scale! But then I started playing AC:B's MP. And I understood. I actually started because I saw my brother playing Wanted mode and I thought it looked cool. I was still on AC2 storyline at the time so I skipped Story Mode at first and went straight to MP. I logged a cool hundred hours of that before completing AC2 and moving into AC:B. I played one hundred hours of this game's MP before even touching it's single player story.\n\nAnyway, the MP player base is still active to this day but you won't find me there. A Ubisoft bug wiped my XP progress and skill unlocks on my MP profile one day so I'd have to start from the bottom. This doesn't appeal to me one bit. Silver lining though, this gave me the impetus to uninstall this game and move on to the rest of my library.\n\nTL;DR If you get a chance, try to play some MP Wanted mode. There's nothing else like it out there. I like it more than Revelations Wanted mode, for that matter. "Honorable Death"?

After Ezio fails to assassinate the Borgia Pope, he receives the message for Desmond in the vault. Confused, he returns to Monteriggioni to live a life of peace. That is shortly disrupted when Cesare Borgia appears and lays siege to Monteriggioni in revenge for Ezio's attack on Rodrigo Borgia. Mario, Ezio's uncle, is killed, Ezio is injured, and he flees. Ezio wakes up in the suburbs of Rome, mysteriously healed, and given new Assassin gear. Ezio must now meet up with the Assassins (or what's left of them) in Rome and seek revenge. Not only does Ezio have to do this himself, he must rebuild the Assassin Order. To take on the Pope, you'll need more than just a single, skilled assassin.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to AC2. Same type of missions, but with a few extras. Leondardo was forced to build weapons of war based off of some of his most famous drawings and Ezio has to go destroy them to prevent the Templars from using them for their nefarious means. The game also keeps everything in the extremely expansive city of Rome, which feels like it's a much closer scale replica than the other maps. The game even allows you to ride horses to help make the trip around Rome much shorter (although I ended up running or using the sewers instead). The game also introduces Borgia Towers, which prevent you from restoring various areas of the city and gaining income from it. You have to kill the captain in charge of the area and then climb the tower and destroy it. It's a nice little minigame, so many of the towers are blocked off by invisible walls (or basically the restriction of Ezio's memories) so you have to wait to be able to clear them all. The game also gives you another powerful set of armor to retrieve by going through and clearing the lairs of the Followers of Romulus, a pagan cult controlled by the Templars. So much of the gameplay is recycled from the previous game that it feels more like an expansion to AC2 rather than its own game. Building up the Brotherhood was not as exciting as it sounds since you basically rescue some random citizen in the city, they join the cause, and then you send them on missions around the Mediterranean to level up and become full-fledged Assassins. They can also play a role in fights, if you want them to, but I rarely used them, since it wasn't necessary most of the time.\n\nThe story is in the game is compelling, however, as the story shifts from Rodrigo Borgia, the Pope, to his son, Cesare. It is unclear if Cesare is really loyal to the Templar cause, however, and it kind also seems to distract from the primary Assassin vs. Templar showdown. In fact, that portion of the story doesn't advance very much and few new clues are given. The whole story revolves around Ezio regaining control over the Apple so it's not in the hands of the Templars or Cesare, who wants to use it for his own ends.\n\nBut Rome seriously makes up for the lackluster gameplay. The scenery was amazing, the landmarks recognizable, and just being in the Eternal City was great for a hobby historian like myself. You find yourself getting lost in the winding streets of the city and learning more about its place in the Renaissance world was fascinating.\n\nOverall, I think it's not as good as AC2, but if you liked AC2 you'll still enjoy Brotherhood. Enjoy your trip to Rome and continue Ezio's legacy!","May 19","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not a spin off, despite what many say. It's relevant to Ezio's story and the modern day story. The gameplay is basically the same from 2 except enhanced a bit so it feels easier. You can now kick your opponents in the knob to weaken them so that's fun. The story is great and still had that Assassin's Creed feel (Which ends in 3) and the modern day story is pretty good too.. I've 100% the game on PS3 before, but I downloaded a save file for the PC version. I haven't seen any glitches so far and the game is pretty easy to run.

It's not as good as Assassin's Creed II. It's not terribly worse, but it doesn't really add anything. It continues the adventures of Ezio Auditore: the renaissance-y murder specialist and Desmond. Desmond deserves no description as he is blander than wet graham crackers. This might sound like I'm jumping on the Hate-Desmond bandwagon. I am because said bandwagon is warm and has free wifi and is GENERALLY CORRECT.\n\nThis game is good if your a fan of the series and curious to see what happens to Ezio, but it doesn't do anything that interesting or new.\n\nAs usual it adds some new weapons and a new setting. They have replaced the two fairly large cities of Florence and Venice with the pretty large city of Rome. You went to Rome briefly in the last game for an oddly linear mission, but it's back and fleshed out into a totally new map.\n\nRome is neat, considering it has it's fair share of cool landmarks. The Colosseum comes to mind. Rome is one of the only things that is new though. You still follow the same group of modern day people: Lucy (who falls a bit deep into the uncanny valley), the british guy and the other woman. You still follow Ezio (now a bit older, with a beard, but still as spritely as ever.) The bad guys are still the Borgias and you still take down key members of the family in a quite brutal game of Family Feud.\n\nMoney is back too. This time you have to renovate all of Rome, which leads me to ask how the f*ck does Ezio have permission to fix the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Colosseum.\n\nAnyway, the game's pretty good. If you plan on playing the Assassin's Creed series then I suggest picking this one up, at least to fill in the story holes. It's pretty fun, but doesn't do much. The name is a key indicator. It's not Assassin's Creed III (that's a different game). It's not a straight sequel. It's more of a time occupier.\n\nHowever, it's pretty good.","December 21, 2014","true","30.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Killing, parkour, constant missions. After the tutorial mission, I realized it was more than that. There's missions scattered around the map, you have free play, and you get to strategize your killing. I like how you always need to stay aware of your surroundings, inventory, and resources. The free play allows you to pay attention to Ezio's needs, like allowing more ground to explore by eliminating the Borgia infulence, getting medicine, making sure you always have income room, keeping your armor repaired, and buying new weapons. There's a wide varity of content in the missions, you're not always saving the damsel in distress. Also there's ponies. PONIES.

The multiplayer is loads of fun, and it even has it's own leveling up system to improve skills and obtain weapons. Brotherhood is by far the best Assassin's Creed to date.

Regardless, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood does add some interesting gameplay mechanics such as assassin recruits and, together with with the impressive new locales becomes what I see as probably the game in the franchise thus far.\n\nFor those who enjoyed Assassin's Creed II: buy it - you won't be disappointed.","April 2, 2011","true","62.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Mostly due to this game having more actual "game" in it. Gamification is above all present in the missions that sport an additional requirement for 100%ing it. Sometimes it gives real challenge like time trial, sometimes it actually limits your choices to specific weapons or angles of approach but sort of works to keep things varied. And the whole sandboxy aspect is also what I liked.\n\n'Cause yeah lack of challenge, mostly in the fights (guards actually hit harder now and there's more of them, but conversely you get more efficient ways of killing them so it's still too easy), and feel of an interactive movie instead or something, is a beef I have with the series. I guess I embraced it though by now and even started to somewhat enjoy those overpowered fights. Still missing focus on stealth, but I don't mind it either anymore (I adjusted my expectations, eh? :D some missions ask you to remain undetected but stealth never seems to be the focus, really, you just charge head on or literally flick your fingers to kill every enemy on screen)\n\nYou still gotta love the parkour, rooftop jumping aspect, raiding tombs is fun too, there's a dash of puzzling involved tho not much, and story continuing present day and Ezio's day affairs still enjoyable, even though it doesn't really touch me deep on an emotional level.\n\nAbout the story... The side missions don't directly connect to the main arc of retrieving the "magic apple", they have more to do with Ezio going all "I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I'm gonna bring the whole f*n' diseased, corrupt temple down on your head" on the Borgias or, rather, living in denial that he fudged up royally and instead explaining to everyone that you gotta have more systemic approach rather than playing the cutting-down-hydra's-heads game. Hence all the Rome rebuilding, winning minds of various factions and citizens etc.\n\nSo the main story may feel somewhat diluted and I guess people mostly enjoying the story aspect may be bit underwhelmed. Like I said, I personally didn't mind and actually like the game more even though it seems actually less focused on whole assassin's creed ordeal.\n\nOh, and Desmond Miles in present day finally gets some of focus and action, after all ac2 was supposed to prepare him for some parkouring in the present day so yeah, he gets some :3","March 6, 2013","true","84.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

So this review will not play on any nostalgia, whatsoever.\n\nI thought Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag looked like a really good game, and as a fan of pirates I felt that it was something I definately wanted to play, but due to me being a massive lore nerd I felt I had to play all the predecessors beforehand. That hopefully explains my playstyle of this title, I just wanted to get thru it, doing only the odd side objectives, in order to get to the more recent games quickly.))\n\nAfter playing Assassin's Creed II, and even more; Assassin's Creed (I), I wasn't looking forward towards playing Brotherhood, (or Revelations). This mostly because I didn't enjoy the first two games; both of them had huge problems in pacing and storytelling. That said; Ezio's story (started in Assassin's Creed II) was a lot more intriguing, but dragged on for far too long to keep my interest up. As, already stated, I just wanted to rush thru these games, so I only saw them as an obstacle. But as soon as this game started up I noticed something different; the game didn't run like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on my machine! I can report that the PC-port of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is far, far better than the two previous iterations. But the positivities doesn't stop there either! I guess "Third time's the charm" really is the truth. The pacing and overall story is also miles ahead of it's predecessors, keeping me intrigued and caring all the way thru. The main storyline is also noticibly shorter than it's direct prequel, more in line with the first game in the series, coming in at around 10 hours. Don't let this discard you from playing it tho, as this is really the perfect length for the game as you don't end up doing menial tasks for hours, which was the case for both the previous games. The parkour gameplay does also seem to be improved upon, but that just my be the cause of me feeling far more positive about the game.\n\nIt also helps that the adventure, this time around, only takes place in one city; Roma (Rome). Making it a lot easier to grasp the scale of the game and keeping you on track.\n\nThe biggest thing however is the Desmond storyline, which before only was uninspired and very hard to care about. Now, however it dragged me in considerably and when I finally finished it I instantly installed Revelations to find out how this storyline ends.\n\nIn the end, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a far, far better game than both it's predecessors. And if you (unlike me) isn't a massive lore nerd, who wants to find out every twist and turn, you do get a quick catch-up at the beginning so that you won't feel completely lost, making the game possible for me to recommend.","January 16, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So this review will not play on any nostalgia, whatsoever.\n\nI thought Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag looked like a really good game, and as a fan of pirates I felt that it was something I definately wanted to play, but due to me being a massive lore nerd I felt I had to play all the predecessors beforehand. That hopefully explains my playstyle of this title, I just wanted to get thru it, doing only the odd side objectives, in order to get to the more recent games quickly.))\n\nAfter playing Assassin's Creed II, and even more; Assassin's Creed (I), I wasn't looking forward towards playing Brotherhood, (or Revelations). This mostly because I didn't enjoy the first two games; both of them had huge problems in pacing and storytelling. That said; Ezio's story (started in Assassin's Creed II) was a lot more intriguing, but dragged on for far too long to keep my interest up. As, already stated, I just wanted to rush thru these games, so I only saw them as an obstacle. But as soon as this game started up I noticed something different; the game didn't run like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on my machine! I can report that the PC-port of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is far, far better than the two previous iterations. But the positivities doesn't stop there either! I guess "Third time's the charm" really is the truth. The pacing and overall story is also miles ahead of it's predecessors, keeping me intrigued and caring all the way thru. The main storyline is also noticibly shorter than it's direct prequel, more in line with the first game in the series, coming in at around 10 hours. Don't let this discard you from playing it tho, as this is really the perfect length for the game as you don't end up doing menial tasks for hours, which was the case for both the previous games. The parkour gameplay does also seem to be improved upon, but that just my be the cause of me feeling far more positive about the game.\n\nIt also helps that the adventure, this time around, only takes place in one city; Roma (Rome). Making it a lot easier to grasp the scale of the game and keeping you on track.\n\nThe biggest thing however is the Desmond storyline, which before only was uninspired and very hard to care about. Now, however it dragged me in considerably and when I finally finished it I instantly installed Revelations to find out how this storyline ends.\n\nIn the end, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a far, far better game than both it's predecessors. And if you (unlike me) isn't a massive lore nerd, who wants to find out every twist and turn, you do get a quick catch-up at the beginning so that you won't feel completely lost, making the game possible for me to recommend.","January 16, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/93juantheone/recommended/48190/","93juantheone","Neutron John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/93juantheone/","785 products in account","Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Retrospective ReviewAC:Brotherhood while a good game is a bit disappointing in a few ways.\n\nSo after the so called ‚ÄúGods-Not-Gods‚Äù you interact with at the end of AC 2, Brotherhood picks up shortly after that moment in what will become a tireless exercise for the series. The tireless exercise is that from this point on, Assassin‚Äôs Creed drip feeds you it‚Äôs story. If you thought the story was moving at a snail's pace, well AC:Brotherhood moves a heck of a lot slower which unfortunately becomes a common occurrence in the series. This is completely frustrating and really an unforgivable indictment on the series. In present time, a some plot threads from AC 2 are just dropped and forgotten. In AC 2 you learn that Desmond starts seeing things from the Animus in the real world, like glimpses or ‚Äúghosts‚Äù of Acre, which then turns into a dream that controls much like an Animus session except without all the help of the Animus. In AC: Brotherhood, nothing like that ever happens. As a matter of fact it‚Äôs a plot point that is dropped to never be returned to again. This strikes me as Ubisoft redacting certain story elements that would then converge into a new story that would allow them to drip feed the story from game to game. Also the present story is rendered moot, because there is almost zero emotional ties to what is happening. In AC2 you learn that Desmond is sorry for the way he treated Lucy at Abstergo and that Lucy believes in him. In AC Brotherhood you get none of that. Just exposition piled on exposition and it‚Äôs quite unfortunate. Ultimately the only moment that moves our characters along in their respective arcs is the ending which tries to ape the crazy ending of AC2, but is a lot less successful. This ending doesn‚Äôt help anything at all. All it does is raise questions and answers none of the ones that were raised last time. At this point, the more I think about the state of the present story, the more it pisses me off. Look, the present story in AC1 and 2 wasn‚Äôt anything to write home about, but it did give us a hook to latch on to. We could empathize with the characters and hope that they would get out of this okay, but in Brotherhood and subsequent iterations  or at least in Brotherhood, there is nothing that moves their arcs in any direction and it‚Äôs downright frustrating.\n\nWhen it comes to Ezio‚Äôs story thankfully there‚Äôs a lot less inconsistencies although they are still there. It‚Äôs thoroughly enjoyable story that shows us the weakness‚Äô that the Assassins have. Ezio‚Äôs in particular. You see that he cares about people in a way others just don‚Äôt. It leads him to go out of his way to help his friends and comrades and make sure they make it out alright and he doesn‚Äôt leave them to just die. It endeared me to the character and makes him much more relatable. Also there is a lot less exposition, which helps. Lastly the inconsistencies are few, but still present. Ezio‚Äôs mother for example seems to have forgotten that half of her family has died. She is in a chipper mood and it just strikes me as unbelievable. This wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if the game took place years after the second, but it doesn‚Äôt it literally takes place right after the second. By the end of the second game, Ezio‚Äôs mother was talking again, but only slightly she was still mourning. In this game we see none of that, and I‚Äôm not saying that she should be completely depressed, but the fact that she is happy strikes me as odd. We are left to assume that she‚Äôs just over it, like the death of her family ‚Äúis sooo last year‚Äù. Okay you can see that it bothers me, but it‚Äôs true.\n\nThe gameplay is where Assassin‚Äôs Creed Brotherhood suffers the most. It‚Äôs entirely playable, but it‚Äôs much the same as AC 2. If that bothers you then you probably won‚Äôt find much to like in this game beyond the story and environment. However, there‚Äôs no criticism I can give that you haven‚Äôt already heard a thousand times before, but what I can say is positive things. Yes, Positive! For one the A.I thankfully is far more consistent. In AC2 it felt like every other enemy I sneaked up to would turn around like I was making tons of noise. Now, for the most part they will only turn around if you are making a ruckus, now I said for the most part, unfortunately there are still times that enemies will turn around even if you sneak up to them and other times where they won‚Äôt see you whatsoever. Now the game adds some mechanics that I thought were pretty fine, but some reviewers seemingly lambasted the game for. You eventually pick up a crossbow that shoots as fast and as far as a gun. This is great for the rooftop excursions where I just shoot a guard so it won‚Äôt just start chasing me. Also there is the chain kill mechanic in where once you subdue a foe you can then kill others by just clicking the button which will turn into a one hit kill for each enemy until you are interrupted. All these things might take away from the challenge, but honestly if I got two more AC‚Äôs with AC2 controls I don‚Äôt care. It makes the game less frustrating and then more enjoyable. Now the last thing I want to touch on is optional objectives. Some people don‚Äôt like them, but I never had any trouble with them, which makes me wonder why people are complaining in the first place. I loved them, because it forced me to actually be an assassin. It was awesome, even if it kinda forces you on a scripted path. I enjoyed them and I personally think they are a great addition to the series.\n\nNow  when it comes to environments, it‚Äôs as always awesome. I have actually been to Rome once before and when I went to Coliseum in this game, it was cool just, how much it was like the real thing. That‚Äôs pretty much it. Rome is a beautifully rendered environment and Nuff said.\n\nMy experience might be unique with my system, but if AC 2 gave you graphical performance issues then you are in for much of the same in AC Brotherhood. The game would drop frames out of nowhere and for one stretch was stuttering uncontrollably. It was incredibly annoying. So it pains me to say that AC Brotherhood is poorly optimized with the caveat, that it might be unique to my setup, maybe you might have more luck. On the plus side it never gets to the point where the game is just unplayable.\n\nAssassin‚Äôs creed Brotherhood is a double edged sword. It‚Äôs is technically a better game than AC2, but it also suffers from some of the same problems, but as well as some new ones. I do recommend the game and it is a good addition to the series, but not a great one.\n\nI played about 62 hours\nI got 86% synchronization\nI unlocked ‚ÄúThe Truth‚Äù\nI played this game on an i7, GTX 970, Windows 8.1/Windows 10 computer\nWhen I switched to Windows 10 for the last 4 hours that I played the game, I didn‚Äôt come across the out of place        framerate drops.","March 14","true","62.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not as epic as the previous one but it's still a good story\n\nWhat really bugs me is the white gradient on the top of the screen otherwise the graphics improve especially the shadows.\n\nThe Score:\n\nGameplay: 9/10 (improves a lot, adds more fluidity)\nStory: 7/10 (Good but short)\nGraphics: 7/10 (The white gradient prevents from being 9)\nSetting: 7/10 (Rome is realistic but too much of the same, several cities is better)\nInnovation: 8/10 (several new modes are added to the game)\n\nOverall: 7.6\n\nIf you loved AC2 buy this one but expect more of an expansion than a really fresh game.","October 19, 2014","true","42.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Assassins Creed Brotherhood is a Wholesome Gory, Enjoyable and Deadly Stabbing frenzy through Roma. Set in Renaissance Italy spanning 7 years of Ezio's life (1500-1507). Assassins Creed 2 was a work of art so naturally Assassins Creed Brotherhood follows in its footsteps and the style of combat is the same but improved drastically. Perhaps the best edition to ACB is Assassin Recruits. Assassin recruits are like Ezios entorauge, as you explore Roma you gain the chance to recruit new brothers into the brotherhood, hence the name. The story takes off from AC2 and Ezio must kill Ceasre Borgia. Along the way you must assassinate lower ranking Templars and work your way up.\n\nThis is the best Assassins Creed game yet to come in my opinion. 9/10","January 21, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Oh whatever...\n\nACBro, as the title dictates, it's about the Creed Brotherhood and it's restoration after the collapse.\n\nAs always, new series in AC is a level up in terms of gameplay sidequest and many more.\n\nFor the story, in Ancestor it tells about the village that have been reduced to Ash, and there isn't any choice for Ezio to do so he travel to Rome to pursuit his archenemy and while at that try to revive the brotherhood.\n\nMany arsenal of weapon that can be built by Leonardo Davinci will help you in the way to assassinate enemy. The battle become more fluctuative too so it will not be as easy as the previous game.\n\nIn terms of all aspect, I think ACBro is the best AC that have been made, the story is still makes sense and the gameplay is not over excessive.\n\nDefinitely a must play game!!","February 16, 2015","true","46.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The setting is amazing. But as for my own opinion is concerned, I think Rome is not entirely remade as it should be in this game. The Capitolini is to the contrary of real life, in which it is way bigger. The Forum Romanum is just awfully done. The only thing the makers did well is the placement of all the buildings, the rest they just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up. The Pantheon and the Colosseum however are a blast to see and experience in ACB, they are pretty well remade. Just as much as in Assassin's Creed 2, I hate the storyline of Desmond and Co. Seriously, this is getting really annoying. Ubisoft knew nobody liked and cared about Ezio's story, but still they decided to put this son of a B. in another 2 games. This kills the fun for me. But still i love Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, even though it's a replica of Assassin's Creed 2 with a few adjustments just in another city, it's still a good game to play.\n\nHave fun playing.\n\nEDIT: It would be nice if you could actually skip the 18 minute long credits instead of waiting them through...","January 5, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sometimes there are weird camera angles, making it hard for trick jumps where they are required and controls get a bit mixed up with the camera angle as it is. Dying clothes and capes requires money, which wasn't required in the previous game. You can now have execution streaks which are always dead useful when you're surrounded, counters are now 100% guaranteed to work everytime. Some of the viewpoints are at the top of the Borgia Towers (makes sense) but Borgia Towers that are lv5 will have Captains that will run, which was a pain to catch. Lastly, the Armor of Brutus (the best armor in the game) just doesn't look very nice to me, Altair's Armor had been swag, but Armor of Brutus....eh. All in all, this was a great game and definitely should be fun for those new to the Assassin's Creed series, but if you are new, I suggest you start from Assassin Creed II since Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is a direct afterward of Assassin's Creed II","March 13, 2014","true","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

Also probably gonna ignore multiplayer for this game and all other AC's so forgive me.\nWARNING:Contains Spoilers\n\nSTORY:Again you assume the role of Desmond Miles as he,Lucy,Rebecca,and Shaun head to Ezio's villa to escape Abstergo. You find the room where Ezio had attained Altair's armour and set up shop here but not without doing a little mission. After that you assume Ezio once again going into his final memorie where he fought the main antagonist of the game Cesare Borgia but Desmond is locked out of the memory. Just like AC1 he must go through the earlier memories before he can go back to the final one. This story honestly is one of the best, second to AC2 and better than Revelations it's gone it's own deaths, accomplishes, twists and turns. Again it wasn't as good as AC2's story but at least it was better than Revelation's story.\n7.9/10\n\nGRAPHICS: The graphics here are better than AC2, cleaner textures, better frames, ect. It's great for it's age (2010) and still in my opinion hasn't dated yet.9/10\n\nGAMEPLAY:Oh boy here we go where do I even start.......the gameplay was okay? If I just spill it out this game made me ragequit it multiple times, not for the main missions but for the side missions. The tank mission was horrible, one hit and you were done you couldn't get hit once or your full sync would fail. The young at heart sucked too, and those side missions where you only had 6 minutes to complete the mission or no full sync. Also to clarify, full sync is supposed to represent how Ezio did completed his missions and side missions but honestely Ubisoft shouldn't have integrated this yet because there was extreme difficulty issues in some missions. Yeah it would be a breeze for normal fans, but full sync fans would learn that the levels did not suit for full sync, they had to find that out the hard way and it was a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Sorry for the rant but the other gameplay elements are at least better than this, with you calling out Assassin's and taking out your enemies like a boss you truly feel like a grandmaster assassin also mentioning finding items to get armor, fast poison ect was stupid on Ubisoft's part too.6.5/10\n\nCONCLUSION: AC:B was honestly one of the most frustrating games I've ever played. There was too difficult side missions, finding ridiculus items to get other items, and full sync. But it balances this by putting in a good story, calling assassins and new gear and weapons but I still can't forgive it's frustratingness and hopefully I won't play this game again.\n\nBUY RANK:1-2 (Putting this in because the game is like 20 bucks)","March 15, 2014","true","37.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And figuring it out can be a pain. But Brotherhood is an excellent game. Traversing Rome (which is absolutely gorgeous) by way of the roofs, streets, or on horseback is enjoyable. The combat system is fluid and easy to master while still being fun. You start the game feeling like a badass and end feeling like an even badasser badass. Slowly taking over the city and recruiting and upgrading your assassins is gratifying. The missions aren't incredibly varied (though some differ incredibly, like the ones with Leonardo da Vinci's war machines) but they remain fun, because, again, you feel like a badass. I'd definitely recommend this game, even at full price.","February 24, 2014","true","25.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pro_zac/recommended/48190/","Pro_zac","Prozac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pro_zac/","138 products in account","Apparently I've played AC II Brotherhood way longer then AC II, which already speaks for itself.\nThis game is awesome by all means, and has few improvements and new stuff not witnessed in earlier games of the series:\n\nPros:\n\n- Storyline. Still captivating, interesting, with lots of likable and not likable characters.\n- If AC I was repetitive and AC II not so much, AC II Brotherhood is a mixture of the two, but in a positive way. If you like grinding (like I do, especially in beautiful Roman surroundings), there is a lot of it  (A LOT). And somehow it didn't bore me. On a contrary: additional quests were interesting, many of them different, only some of them felt lazy. Flags are back, and of course feathers and treasure chests.\n- Game gives you option to either buy maps which point to all the hidden stuff, but you don't have to buy them. You can grind them by yourself. Options are always a good thing.\n- Environment, architecture, Rome, graphics, music: sometimes you just want to ride around Colosseum with no purpose other then admire stuff around you and in distant perspective.\n- Eagle vision is still useful!\n- Leonardo's war machines quest line was one hell of a ride.\n- You will be able to rebuild assassins brotherhood, recruit your own people, train them and use their help should you choose so. This is a blast. One completely new instalment and it is awesome.\n\nCons:\n- So many weapons, and majority of it still serves only as collection trophies.\n- I remember that throwing knives were useful in AC I. Somehow they are not useful here (as they weren't in AC II).\n- Combat is as it was. I think I got used to it, but it has not been improved. Oh, wait, you can kick people now to break their guard.\n- Freakin camera angle almost made me pull my hair out during few missions.\n- There is this new stuff I don't recall from before: full synch. To fully synchronize you are required to finish the memory in given way. Sometimes it will demand from you to take no damage (really? Where's fun in taking no damage?), sometimes it requires you to complete memory in few minutes (forcing you to get back to the location for full discovery which can take three times that long). The only synch requirements I liked were the ones that enforced stealth play (aka. not being detected). But I guess it's a matter of taste.\n- I don't remember any outstanding bug. Oh, but it's a cons section. I guess I expected them as a "fun" part of the game. Ubisoft is bending perspectives ;)\n\nOverall:\nI love this game. Brotherhood is also the first AC  game where you can play online. I have yet to try it, though I'm not very eager at the moment. Heading to part 3 of Ezio trilogy.\n","February 26","true","82.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, rejoice! You can now focus on important things like bringing democracy and freedom to Rome's denizens without being burdened about said denizens' freedom to safely cross the street!\n\nVeterans familiar with the series won't find anything new with this one-trick pony, history buffs might recoil at the revisionist treatment of famous historical figures, and Ubisoft's game launcher remains awkward. But there's nothing more satisfying than running down 15th century blackguards and ruthlessly punishing them for nothing if not their poor choice in wardrobe.","April 15, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While Assassin's Creed II may have had more locales to explore, Brotherhood's single locale is straight up better.  The samey environments of II can't stand up to running across aqueducts and seeing the Colliseum for the first time.  So as far as environments go, it blows II out of the water.\n\nNow I know you all like bullet points, so let me run some bullet points on you.\n\nPros\nThe environment, which I already said, is supreme.\nInvesting in Rome gives the game staying power, and the collectibles are more fun to search for.\nIt's more of the same.\nCons\nIt's more of the same.\nRidiculously buggy.  Animations frequently tweak out, and it's prone to crashing.\nIf you like Assassin's Creed, Brotherhood is a must.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/48190/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","There are three reasons why I cannot recommend Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood; chief of which is how there's not enough new content for this to qualify as anything more than a DLC. No new notable characters have been introduced, additions to gameplay are minor and differences to the script similarly so: you essentially lose everything from Assassin's Creed 2 during the prologue and spend the rest of the game trying to build back your base of operation. Meaning, don't begin your Assassin's Creed experience from this title onwards because you start immediately as Assassin's Creed 2 drops off; so yes, spoilers.\n\nSecondly, one of the defining aspects of the game (specifically, the brotherhood of assassins whom you recruit) works entirely by a time-passage mechanic.  If Assassin's Creed 2 allowed you to cheat the system by waiting so as to gain additional income, Brotherhood sends your assassin recruits away on missions where success is based entirely on a percentage, with no involvement on your part.\n\nThird, although I love how your missions now have additional challenges, autosaving on your failures and the inability to skip cutscenes are just artificial obstacles that any game producer respectful of their customers would've removed already. Neither can you skip the end credits, and the game won't acknowledge you've finished the story until the whole 20 minute thing has passed. Alt-tabbing pauses the credits.\n\nProduction was so lazy, it warped the whole story stupid. They've copy-pasted the villa restoration system from 2, but it's one thing to rebuild a decrepit villa so as to attract tourists and another one entirely to renovate ROME. You wage war on the open seas against battle ships sculling about your little gondola oar, because of course they kept the gondola and they couldn't be arsed in building an appropriate boat. I should add that the filler returns WITH A VENGEANCE: the missions I don't mind, it's the list of tasks such as "kill 20 guards with a crossbow while undetected" which are nothing but a chore. Expect around 40 of those.\n\nSo don't do like I did and buy a whole bunch of discounted Assassin's Creed products in bulk, but pick and choose amongst the goodish ones. Or imagine everyone lived happily ever after the events of Assassin's Creed 2. That works too.","November 14, 2015","false","56.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pogrid/recommended/48190/","Pogrid","Firetiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pogrid/","209 products in account","Here ends my personal journey with Assassin's Creed, having completed the trilogy and now Brotherhood.  And what a beast of a game, a series.  Was it worth my time, you ask?  Let's start at the beginning.\n\nSpace expanded rapidly.  Particles gathered into hydrogen atoms, stars and planets were formed, and Assassin's Creed was made.  I played that game and loved it.  It was impressive technically and visually, on a level that only millions of dollars could produce, and perhaps more astonishing was the total commitment to their freerunning system.  Ubisoft promised players could freely climb and scale virtually any solid object in the game, and I say they knocked it out-of-the-park on their first go.  Not everyone agrees with me.  A lot of folks complained that it was too repetitive (a peeve of mine, but that's another tale).\n\nCue the sequels and I'm utterly baffled.  You see, freerunning is the CORE of Assassin's Creed, its bread and butter, its heart and soul.  Almost everything you do somehow involves climbing on things.  Taking the original game as a successful prototype, with the primary complaint being that people want more of it, the natural path is to focus on the one thing that defines the game and use it to springboard to something more.  But every game in the series has taken bizarre 90-degree turns that don't add up to anything.  Consider:\n\n"There's a rad freerunning system and now you can construct a brothel in your villa!"\n"There's a rad freerunning system and now there's a simulated economy!"\n"There's a rad freerunning system and now you can play bocce ball with George Washington!"\n\n...And the games are praised to high heavens.  Is this what people really want?  It's a crying shame that the core gameplay remains constant while getting buried under a mountain of crap.  Are layered mechanics not more interesting than disconnected ones?  Meanwhile, almost every activity can be reduced to "go to the waypoint marker and/or beat up some guys".  The problem is the freerunning, and to some extent the combat, really carries the game.  Your fun is absolutely dependent on whether these two things are compelling enough on their own.\n\nAnd therein lies the crux of why I think the Assassin's Creed series as a whole, stinks, because they can boiled down to nothing.  "Go here" involves holding two buttons and pointing the stick toward the waypoint.  "Beating up guys" involves repeatedly pressing attack and occasionally pressing block as an enemy strikes.  Following this strategy will get you through most of the game.  Perhaps one could say the game is just too easy.  I used the stock hidden blades throughout the whole game, and never felt the need to purchase any weapons, upgrades, or gadgets (except for DaVinci's climbing gloves, bless his heart).\n\nOccassionally you will sense that Assassin's Creed wants to be a stealth game, and I think it could be an outstanding one, except it bungles this as well.  The game falls into the very unforgiving trap of instant failure if you are detected at all, even if you stab a guy through the throat as he glimpses you upon his dying breath.  More perplexing design decisions abound.  Don't get caught freerunning or the Roman Rooftop Gestapo will get you!  Why punish players for climbing and exploring?\n\nOf course the story context is a monster in itself.  Apparently Ubisoft was so wowed by their own material that they felt it acceptable to ram the story down players' throats.  The sheer quantity and length of cutscenes is unreal.  Now I ain't no literary scholar, but I think the writing throughout the Assassin's Creed series is abysmal.  You spend so much time watching one-dimensional characters standing around yakking endlessly about some garbage you don't care about.  Every other line of dialogue is contrived to get you to "go" and "kill", and there just isn't a story being told, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't constantly interrupt the game.  You can hardly pick your nose without it bookended by boring cinematics.\n\nThe main conflict feels equally contrived.  Antagonists are either ridiculously villanous or guilty by association.  Of course you hardly ever see any of the alleged wrongdoing -- you're just told that person X is "corrupt" for vague reasons and they have an unfriendly disposition when you meet them in person.  I also can't get past the grand irony of the evil Templars condemned by the rightous "Assassins".  They fight back by murdering hundreds of people.  Other moments of brilliance are wasted.  Fallen foes, in their dying moments, try to get you to understand their motivation, their ideology.  But Ezio doesn't care.  He doesn't reflect upon or question his choices.  There's no personal growth; the story takes no risks.  It's just... flat.  The overarching sci-fi plot is actually quite interesting but so sparse that it hardly matters.\n\nI probably ought to explain my beef with cutscenes.  They never sit right with me, but they are the most obvious way to tell a story.  The nature of authorship is such that it conflicts with input from the audience.  The more input, the less control the author has.  Thus, taking control away from players is the most direct approach.  I'm fine with this, but I begin to take issue when cutscenes are used as a crutch for sloppy game design.\n\nThere's a depressing trend among modern games to take the mechanics and tease out narrow, compartmentalized segments of gameplay, which are then shuffled throughout the experience.  The result is a game which is ultimately simpler, more predictable, and presumably easier to develop.  The first example that comes to mind is the Tomb Raider reboot, and the game suffers for it.  You are either climbing things or shooting things, but never both.  However, Tomb Raider is somewhat forgiven because it smoothly transitions between gameplay segments with smart level design, pacing, context, etc.  Assassin's Creed, on the other hand, glues together disjointed segments of gameplay with cutscenes, jerking you all over the place.  Cutscene - CHASE - cutscene - KILL - cutscene - FOLLOW - cutscene - KILL... I hate this.  It's like Warioware without the creativity (or fun).  This is how you can tell a game's design is oversimplified.\n\nIf you've never played an Assassin's Creed game, it may be too late for you.  There was a day when the freerunning was cutting-edge and the sci-fi story was a surprise.  My advice is to play the original because it's the most "pure" experience and the medival setting really fits.  Otherwise, ask yourself "can the freerunning carry my enjoyment for another 10-20 hours?".  Gamers will always mentally strip away a game's fluff and reduce its moving parts to an abstract model, and at this point Assassin's Creed immediately goes stale.  It just doesn't have enough complexity to last beyond the initial novelty.  Sure, the game is punctuated by interesting moments in its enormous story, but these moments are mere hydrogen atoms in the vastness of space.","September 6, 2015","false","10.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Buy it now! // 31st of December 13\n\nI have decided to re-make this review since, originally, I just wrote it because I saw a negative review of this game. So here goes!\n\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood takes place just where the second game ends, making it a direct sequel. In this game you still relive the memories of your ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. In the real world however, things change a bit. Desmond and the crew have moved the entire operation to Monteriggioni, the town that Ezio's family had earlier lived in. This means that you can, at any given time, exit out of the Animus and wander around in the real world. This is a nice edition, but is sadly not that well made as there are little to none things to do.\n\nThe gameplay of this installment has been improved from the previous games. The fighting is well made and you will feel a sense of progression as enemies will be easier to defeat as your skill goes up. Also combos have been introduced, making fighting 2+ enemies will not feel as rubish anymore.\nBut fighting is only have the game, of cource the climbing has been improved. This is not as noticable though, as it was good in the older games aswell.\nThis game features alot of quests, aside from the main storyline, that are well fitted into the story and helps you get a better understanding on how Ezio was as a person. The most well made once were the once featuring no one else that your friend, Leonardo da Vinci. He is back with long, well made mission for you to complete. But not only that, he also sells you items that will spice up the gameplay, giving you tons of new options on how to do thing.\n\nGeneraly speaking this game is a masterpiece in the Assassin's Creed series. The story is great, you will come to care about the characters, the gameplay mechanics are improved, still same stunning visuals as the last game. Basically a worthy sequel that was not made to cash in on the Assassin's Creed name.","December 30, 2013","true","43.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Buy it now! // 31st of December 13\n\nI have decided to re-make this review since, originally, I just wrote it because I saw a negative review of this game. So here goes!\n\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood takes place just where the second game ends, making it a direct sequel. In this game you still relive the memories of your ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. In the real world however, things change a bit. Desmond and the crew have moved the entire operation to Monteriggioni, the town that Ezio's family had earlier lived in. This means that you can, at any given time, exit out of the Animus and wander around in the real world. This is a nice edition, but is sadly not that well made as there are little to none things to do.\n\nThe gameplay of this installment has been improved from the previous games. The fighting is well made and you will feel a sense of progression as enemies will be easier to defeat as your skill goes up. Also combos have been introduced, making fighting 2+ enemies will not feel as rubish anymore.\nBut fighting is only have the game, of cource the climbing has been improved. This is not as noticable though, as it was good in the older games aswell.\nThis game features alot of quests, aside from the main storyline, that are well fitted into the story and helps you get a better understanding on how Ezio was as a person. The most well made once were the once featuring no one else that your friend, Leonardo da Vinci. He is back with long, well made mission for you to complete. But not only that, he also sells you items that will spice up the gameplay, giving you tons of new options on how to do thing.\n\nGeneraly speaking this game is a masterpiece in the Assassin's Creed series. The story is great, you will come to care about the characters, the gameplay mechanics are improved, still same stunning visuals as the last game. Basically a worthy sequel that was not made to cash in on the Assassin's Creed name.","December 30, 2013","true","43.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It surpassess ACII mechanics of combat and movement in almost every way and even now, years after its publishing is still a lot of fun to play. There are a lot of activities to keep you busy and entetained and there is the synchronization system and collectibles which add a little more. The plot is the weakest point, sadly, not due to low quality, but because it seems so short. It is also a shame that you cannot explore monteregioni anymore, and while you do get your own base, it just isn't the same. The BEST thing about the game is the world, which is open and well designed. Walking, running and climbing through rome is a joy, the finest city experience any part of the game has served up yet. It is a shame that the multiplayer isn't active anymore, but u guess that's just how it is.\nSumming up, i recommend this game. The best argument i can find is that it really is a very enjoyable gaming experience, and really, isn't that what matters?","May 17, 2014","true","30.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll probably love this.\nDo you want to try out Assassin's Creed? I recommend you try Assassin's Creed 1, and 2 before this. Without the first (and especially 2nd), games under your belt, this story will make no sense, you won't care about the characters, and you probably won't enjoy this at all.\n\nThis is a filler sequel.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely similar to Assasin's Creed 2. It is hard for me to identify too many new elements. I don't know if any of the weapons were actually new, of if the ammo for them was just more plentiful, but I definitely used the gun, poison darts, and crossbow a lot in this game. I also found myself playing a lot less stealthily, possibly because the crossbow was so much fun to use, and I could loot ammo from any dead body.\n\nThe one new element is that towards the midgame, you start an Assassin's Guild, sending assasins out on missions throughout Europe. They reward you with money, and some rare "shop quests" (i.e - crafting) items. You can also summon them during any battle and they will fight well. It almost feels like cheating compared to previous games, but it is kind of fun to say, "screw this stealth crap, everyone dies now."\n\n\n","January 27, 2014","true","45.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most of all the AC games involves running around and trying to avoid being attacked by guards, who seem to spawn just in time to complicate your escape. The storyline and actual missions are great, but they tend to be variations on the same basic types: tail someone. Assassinate someone without being detected. Hold down W + RMB + SHFT indefnitely (what the game calls "freerunning"). AC:B seems to be particularly annoying with regards to how the controls and freerunning works: sometimes Ezio will leap off a tall building even though you told him to walk cautiously in the opposite direction, and sometimes he will lock on to something you didn't even know was there and save your hide before you even realized it was in danger. There are also several annoying features of the game, like the camera switching perspective, which throws off the direction Ezio moves in.","May 23, 2012","true","18.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

Despite this, the real brotherhood was something new and experimental. As usual, I would list the best points from the game:Multiplayer is innovative, not your usual killing, it‚Äôs stalking, hunting and chasing. It had its drawbacks, not stable servers, for instance. What I like most about this part is that everybody provides different animation for a different weapon, no two weapons or techniques are the same.\nAssassin brotherhood is a huge innovation, since Ezio is Il Mentore now. Even though the apprentices appear out of thin air sometimes, it is still interesting to have them by your side.\nComparing to the previous game, it became more saturated in terms of colours. The previous game literally pales in comparison. Here everything is rich ‚Äì from the colours of the robes to the landscapes of the levels.In my opinion, this game has the weakest soundtrack from the series, save for some tracks, it is quite repetitive (I believe this is due to the fact that we are in the same city and the need to differentiate does not arise).\nAlso, because of unknown reasons (only in Steam version), two missions are bugged - the final mission, unable to interact with Cesare after climbing the siege tower, and locked controls during flying the bomber.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/48190/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2595 products in account","Assassin's Creed Broterhood is at its core not a bad game, but it has a few too many flaws in order for me to be able to recommend it to anyone who does not intend to play it just for the story.\nPros:\n-The main city is quite big and well made\n-Logical continuation of the story\n-The parkour feels really satisfying, when it works\n-A good amount of sidequests and other activites\nCons:\n-When the parkour does not work, it's quite frustrating\n-Highly inconsistent controls\n-Broken economy\n-Simplistic combat and overlong kill animations\n-Rushed ending\n\nAssassin's Creed Brotherhood starts right where Assassin's Creed 2 left, and the makers of the game seem to take for granted that you've played the previous game. The gameplay in Brotherhood is nigh identical to that of Assassin's Creed 2, and that sadly also means that they did not bother fixing some of the flaws that that game had.\n\nA core part of what makes the Assassin's Creed games is the parkour system. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop can be a real joy, and many of the missions also have lengthy parkour elements. The system is not without its flaws though, the game sometimes has a hard time telling where you want to jump, and decides to jump to something to the side rather than straight ahead, resulting in some embarrassing deaths. It's at least not as bad as it was in Assassin's Creed 1, but there is still a lot of room for improvement here. The game designers also decided to lock the camera at some points during these parkour segments, but as movement is relative to the camera, when the camera locks at an awkward angle (and it always does), jumping in the right direction becomes harder than it should be.\n\nOne flaw that seem to have become bigger with the introduction of some new elements is the problem with the inconsistent controls. Most games would simply have a "use" key that you would press when using levers, opening doors, talking to people, looting bodies  and opening chests, but Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has 3 different keys that is being used here. E, Shift and the dreaded "any key" (which can be a hassle if you're close to the object and intend to run in any direction). And it's not entirely consistent about which key you're supposed to use at any given moment. This is made even more annoying by the fact that tutorial message that tell you very basic things keep popping up through the entire game, which covers the button prompts. Attacking is also a bit inconsistent.  For most attacks, the left mouse button is used, like in any other game, but when using cannons (and other more exotic mounted weapons), it's suddenly the right mouse button that is used instead. This inconsistency makes no sense, as the left mouse button is not used at all during these segments. When mounting or dismounting things (boats, horses & cannons) there is again an inconsistency in regards to what button you're supposed to press. Shift, space and the left mouse button are all used for this. Finally, when using the crossbow or pistol you suddenly aim with WASD and can't control the camera at all, which makes those weapons really awkward to use.\n\nThe story is for the most part quite nice, for an action game. What's going on makes sense within the confines of the universe and most of the characters also behave in a relatively believable way. The voice actors that voice the major characters do a good job at portraying them. Sadly the later parts of the game feel rushed and the story end up feeling a bit disjointed towards the end, jumping from place to place with no logical transition. It felt like I missed several cutscenes during the final 2 hours of the game. The level design of these parts also show signs of being rushed, as I found 3 spots where I got stuck (without looking for them) during chapter 7 alone. Getting stuck in the level geometry is generally a sign of lack of playtesting.\n\nFinally, the economy system is just as broken in Brotherhood as it was in Assassin's Creed 2. The game showers you with money as soon as you've started to make a few investments, and money ends up being a non-issue, to the point where it might as well not be there in the first place.\nIn closing, I find it very hard to actually recommend Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to anyone. While it has its share of good elements, it also has quite a few problems that make what otherwise would have been a good action game a so-so one. There are just too many better games out there for Brotherhood to be worth playing, unless you're just playing it to get the complete Assassin's Creed story.","July 14, 2015","false","19.4"," 19 of 40 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","19","40","0","0"

The combat, IMO, is still great with a few added improvements.\n\nBut then, This game, to me, falls on so many levels compared to Assassins Creed II.\nFirst, the map you play in, Rome. Rome seems to feel more empty and barren compared to Florence and Venice. In those games, you always had somewhere interesting to go, something to dominate the view, but in this game, most of the map is just open countryside with a few Roman ruins scattered around. You may get a slight sense of awe when you first see the places like the Pantheon or the Colloseum, but after a while that novelty wears off and they just become another thing to climb. It also seems to have sparce few people, making rome feel empty, which is never really good.\n\nthe ending to the story is just confusing to wrap your head around, and they just seem to throw in charecters from ACII randomly. And then the main feature of the game: the Brotherhood ability.\n\nThis ability is quite fun recruiting people and them using them to earn you money and kill guards without you having to do much. But it becomes that: getting money and killing guards; not very exciting.\n\nSo, in MY opinion, I beleive this game fell far from the greateness of ACII. I would only get it in a sale and if you want to carry on the story of Ezio.","October 16, 2014","false","12.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Didnt know why (see EDIT*).\n\nI use a (good) keyboard for games like this. If I wanted to use only a controller, I would buy a fkn console.\n\nIt takes a bit of practice to get used to the controls, but at least its keyboard-coded far better than the garbage spewed out of KONAMI Studio called Metal Gear Solid 5, which REFUSES to allow you to re-map all the controls for disabled players (missing fingers) or the left-handed, Unlike this far older game.\nIn regard to MSG5, I dont think Hideo Kojima was responsible for that re-mapping MESS, but I think he/his team was Ordered to make it a Console port, and not cater for PC specifically (especially in regards to Controls re-mapping). Asanine twerps wanted to chop costs.\nThis game (Brotherhood), I have not have much chance to really test it out. Buy it in a Sale if you can if AC Creed games work for you.\n\nEDIT*.\nNow I fixed AC Brotherhood with switching Steam BETA on and rebooting and Switching Steam BETAS back off, and re-booting, and now the game works after hours of determination to find a fix.\nI updated my review (to thumbs-up) when I got the frustration out of my blood enough to play the thing without gritting my teeth trying to get it to simply start.\n\nAs for Peonza`s comment (when I initially game the game a thumbs-down [when the game refused to start]), I can certainly understand why some people hate such awkward-to-control games; but like I said, its Keyboard controlled FAR BETTER than Metal Gear Solid 5.","December 31, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

(for those of you just saying I should play with a controler, this proves its a bad port and the only thing a controller fixes is this part.)\n-A gap that Ezio can cross one time won't work the next time you try it.\n-I jumped onto a ledge with a horse that was about 30cm (12") of the ground and it couldn't get off the ledge.\n-The camera changes to an awkward angle the worst moments and the slightest movement of the mouse makes it look like a 2year old with a handy cam.\n-While the camera changes the directions don't work the way you would expect and you can often jump to your death.\n\nThis is a buggy piece of Bovine Fecal Matter and unless you care about the overall Assassin's Creed story avoid at all costs.","April 18","false","49.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","3"

You do not have direct control over your actions during combat, you feel like a spectator where you have to push a button as soon as someone attacks you; very frustrating.\n\nThe game also lacks the atmosphere and details of the previous games, it feels like a copypaste of AC2 and somehow the essence got lost.\n\nAlright game but not worth your time.","March 16, 2015","false","5.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Only if you've already beaten ACII and are hungry for more.\n\nDon't get me wrong- there's nothing much wrong with it. It's solid, it's just more of the same. There are changes here and there that make it more polished, but at the end of the day, ACII had a solid and interesting, if not terribly inspired, story backing up its gameplay and exploration every step of the way, supporting its flaws. Brotherhood... kinda doesn't. It's fine, it's just less engaging than its predecessor, and while some of the new gameplay tools are quite fun, it's hard to justify buying a whole game for "more of the last one" without having a story of some sort worth carrying it.","May 15","false","27.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

A great game with great (albeit simple and very easy) combat, Excellent platforming scaling detailed walls where teh main character grabs onto handholds realistically (for a super assassin) and where intricate leaps can be made onto small skinny poles and lamps and what not.  Overall the platforming is very well done.  Unfortunately, this very promising and potentially great game is plagued by unskippable lengthy dialogue and downright monotonous cutscenes that caused me to quit the game early.  I cannot remember perfectly, but I believe this was the AC that introduced property purchases and interval revenue (earning money over time.)\n\nGraphics:\nNothing remarkable, but definitely passable.

It starts out fun and introduces a few new features and modifications that are definitely for the better.\nHowever, as soon as one reaches Rome, it quickly gets frustrating. Me, I stopped there after a while. Here's a few reasons why (it's basically the same reason all over, but it gets so annoying it's unbearable):\n\n1) You see a lookout on the map and try to reach it. However, you quickly realize that you can not access it just because you see it on the map. Because "this memory is not available".\n2) You want to return to a place you've been before, perhaps to get money from the bank or repair your armor? You'll notice that, other than in every other Assassin's Creed before, areas you've been to will not necessarily stay available. Suddenly these areas are "not available" anymore.\n3) I feel like I'm squeezed into a relatively narrow tunnel of "available memory", with only a bit of space opening before me, while it closes again behind me. Everytime I stray form the path a little, I can't continue because "this area is not available". Like the game is trying to get me through the missions and areas in a most linear way. Not the Assassin's Creed experience I came to know and love.\n4) I would like to repair a building to get a lookout point. I can reach the building. However, the building is controlled by a tower. I need to destroy the tower. However, the tower is in an area that is "not available". WTF?!?\n\nAt this point I was so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that I actually stopped playing, because I felt mucked.\n\nSeriously, it's a great game. Gameplay-wise, it's even better than the original Assassin's Creed 2. But the way it limits the player to a rather small area really kills it for me. So much for "open world".","October 25, 2014","false","70.3"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Unfotunately one mission couldn't be solved (the flying mission) because the controlls stopped working. After that my motivation to take on other missions or try multiplayer was gone and I tried to end the game as fast as possible.\nSome of the bugs are well known to Ubisoft, but they never provided patches as I've learned on some message boards.\n\nUPlay worked on my playthrough (others weren't as lucky), but I still don't understand the need for a double DRM. Being forced to make an account for playing offline really got on my nerves.\n\nThis game was also very prone to crashes and Alt-Tabbing out of it was completely out of the question.\n\nWhereas in AC 2 you visit different cities, in this game you just remain in Rome. This and the repetitive missions killed most of the replay value.\n\nAll in all I'd give this game 3 out of 10 points mainly for the story and the whole climbing and stealth mechanics - if that's also what you love about the AC series I'd reccomend you to buy AC 1 and leave it at that.\nThis game was a total waste of money.

With the exception of the controls often being the most epic boss in the game and the plot never going anywhere, story mode is worth the trip! But the MP flattens the SP by far! Vibrant, colorful, well-voiced, well MO-CAP player models and genius design, the MP is arguably the best gaming has ever seen. Unfortuantely, Ubi decided to go all COD on it, releasing another AC every year. The legendary MP that they did so well to make is now dead forever. What a shame.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/48190/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","This is a tough game to review, like all AC games the controls are garbage.  Is this game fun, thats debatable, it doesnt feel fun, but it is challenging.  Every mission is 100% is possible but ONLY if youre real hardcore, because your not playing to beat the game, your playing to beat bad game design.  Every time I get 100% sync on a mission, I feel like its sticking it in the face of the devs, as if as a mere player I can overcome how bad they are at making games.\n\nLets step into BAD game design 101 a class where everyone at Ubisfot is an A student: There is a side mission where you drive around in a tank, the bonus goal to get 100% on this mission is to not let the tank take any damage.  Any normal player would think that makes sense so we can preserve the tank, keep it undamaged to use later.  HA!  FOOLED YOU!  This is bad game design, no lets make the mission ungodly difficult, then after you beat the mission, lets have th player jump out of the tank and blow it up!\n*Bonus bad design:  Make it a looOOoooong mission, where if you get damaged in the tank, instead of going back to a checkpoint, you need to restart the entire mission.\n\nNext chapter in Bad Game Design:  Build open world, imagine a big world you can explore, gamers would like that!  That isnt how its done in this game, thanks to more bad game design there are stupid white walls everywhere that just kill you if you touch them.  There is no excuse for this, I found it altered none of the story if you could just go to different places.  How that would ruin any game is just beyond me.\n\nMultiple endings:  Games that offer different ways of achieving a goal through creative thoughtful strategy is often rewarded.  Not in AC brotherhood, most missions if someone looks at you, you just die and have to restart.  Suddenly everyone of the bad guys in Italy are medusas, and if they look at you apparently you die.\n\nPlaying this I often picture the developers, who are in their corporate headquarters on a hill as the sky grows dark lightning crashes around it.  They sit in a meeting room making lists of how to make the game worse.  Ringing their hands in dark rooms lighted only by the glow of their overhead projector used for presentations, while laughing maniacally at the thoughts of people suffereing through their horrible game, MuWaHaHaHaHa....\n\nMultiplayer is dead...  Game is so boring that people sitting in the same room watching me would fall asleep as I had to retry missions again, and again.  They tried to play it and thought the controls sucked, and it wasnt fun.  There so for average people or fun gamers, this game is terribad, only for people who really want a challenge is it fun, and challenging isnt that much fun to be honest, its just challenging...\n\nRegular Gamer:    Rating:  0/10  Value  $0.00\nHardcore Gamer:  Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99\n","November 28, 2013","false","63.6"," 10 of 30 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","10","30","0","2"

This game feels more like an expansion pack to Assassins Creed 2 than an entire new game though. There's reused character models and animations galore. And unlike an expansion, you start back at ground zero with all your equipment burning so you have to re-earn it.\n\nSimilarities aside, Rome is a cool city, and calling in fellow assassins to help fight is when the game gets good. Don't bother trying to fully grasp the storyline, just know that the bad guys are taking over and it's up to you and your merry band of Assassins to stop them.\n\nI grabbed it on a steam sale for $4.99 and it was worth it for the gameplay and overarcing Assassins Creed storyline.\n\nPros:\n- Merry band of assassins makes bigger fights easy.\n- Owning shops and landmarks makes moneymaking simple.\n- Stab everything, you're an assassin.\n\nCons:\n- Muddled story - the Borgias are a generic evil family and Ezio has a lot of opportunities to kill members of the family and doesn't do it.\n- I feel like owning a shop or landmark should make me even more money.\n- Aside from the merry band of assassins, there isn't much new in the game.\n\nJust Weird\n- Horses galloping through crowds don't kill people.\n- At the start of the game you lose your equipment and the game has you rebuying it. But you also lose your ability to jump when climbing....because you lost it? Because I know Ezio learned how to do it in Assassins Creed 2, but you have to re-learn it in Assassins Creed Brotherhood.","January 1, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeeFunct/recommended/48190/","DeeFunct","DeeFunct","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeeFunct/","387 products in account","Coming in off AC:II, which is undeniably one of the high points in the Assassin's Creed  series, the bar is set high for Brotherhood. Set in Rome several years after the events in AC:II, Brotherhood expands on the story surrounding the Borgia and their attempt to take the city (and then the entirety of Italy).\n\nPersonally, I found the storyline uninteresting and failed to drive me to move forward in the game compared to II where I was riveted the whole way through. I think this is in part marred by the introduction of the extra feats you need to complete to achieve a '100% Sync%' on missions, you find yourself concentrating more on some of the (sometimes ridiculous) extra criteria that have been set for you rather than the mission and it's impact on Ezio, Rome and the larger world.\n\nRome itself is quite possibly one of the dullest settings in an Assassin's Creed game, players were spoilt with the multiple venues of II and if you move onto Revelations, Constantinople has more character and charm about it than Rome does. The Lairs of Romulus add in an extra spark to an otherwise boring landscape, but again the 100% sync challenges may mean you want to speed through these locations instead of taking them in fully.\n\nCombat hasn't really evolved from the second game, you'll find a majority of fights easy and with the added bonus of being able to call upon your own team of assassin's, any fight where your seriously outnumbered can be evened out in a matter of moments. The fact that you are recruiting assassin's and sending them out on varying missions really does help you feel that you are being instrumental in helping to establish a proper order in Italy and will leave a legacy in Ezio's name.\n\nBrotherhood can be considered a low point in the series, the game feels like they've tried to cram too much into it in a short space of time, not really developing the new features fully, making the experience a somewhat stop/start affair. There is still plenty to keep die hard Assassin's Creed fans occupied and there is enough lore here to warrant playing through the game to keep abreast of the whole arcing storyline that runs through the AC series. Worth picking up when on offer, just don't expect it to light up your life.\n\n(Ignore the 230 hrs played, there was a glitch in the matrix that added 180hrs to my play time.)","February 11, 2015","true","230.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There was a lot of fustrating parts where you are climbing when you mean to run.\n\nBest mechanic is the companion leveling system.\n\nI recommend this game for AC fans. If you already played AC2 this is pretty much the same.","November 29, 2014","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Familiarity of AC 2's HUD system and combat mechanics with additional in-game features such as building up your very own troupe of Assassins and sending them on missions to gain levels and become more powerful. One of my favourite features was having the Assassin's at my beck and call to terminate any tricky targets or just to troll the guards for a bit of fun. Great continuation of the story so far with even more intrigue thrown in and questions raised.

But, AC: Brotherhood and AC II are VERY similar in many respects, and since I haven't played them for awhile, I am literally copy-pasting the same review to both of them because I can't remember all the little things that are different, because really, they are very similar. So here we go:\n\nI love the Assassin's Creed series. I played the first AC about seven years ago, and I played it nonstop. The basic idea of AC is that you are and assassin, and you have a city as your assassination-playground, usually multiple locations. You start the game as Desmond, a guy who uses a machine called the Animus to shoot back in time to his ancestors' history. This is accomplished from the Animus being able to use his mind as a channel for those ancestors' memories.\n\nThen, you are his ancestor, an assassin. and you have to kill things. The story is usually deep and intriguing, and it brings you along, and the gameplay of it is awesome too. And then you can just do random things as sidequests, usually pickpocketing, or another assassination target, stuff like that.\nYou have two profiles: Low profile, where you don't draw attention, and just push past people, or walk. Then High profile, by holding right trigger, where then you start running and you can parkour, fight, shove through people, and sprint.\n\nThe combat is fun, and the sneaky-assassinating is satisfying. There's some flaws, but Brotherhood and AC II are probably the best out of this series. Would recommend anybody to try.","December 3, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got a guy on the rooftops in your path and no time to sneak up on him? Let your peeps handle it. Need a distraction? No problem, they're good. Need every guard in sight to take a "nap"? They've got you covered.\n\nAgain Ubisoft manages to expand the mission options and gameplay filling another game chock full of interesting characters and new gameplay.

One of the best storylines in a game series to date. The downsides are that the Assassin's Brotherhood gameplay addition is more of a gimmick than anything else which is a damn shame as it could have been awesome to train up your fellow assassins by being able to engage with them more directly instead of just sending them on pre-scripted text based missions. Also, being able to call them to help you in a fight is cool and all but can be used to easily cheese your way through the tougher encounters in the game.\n\n8.5-9/10","September 1, 2012","true","57.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is filled with many Assassin's Creed II functionalities, but maintains a fresh new take on the franchise.\n\nContinuing the open world aspect (thank goodness), you play as Ezio once again, this time exploring Rome, of which was a brief setting in II that you could not roam. Now all the city is yours to do whatever you wish. The adventure never fails, letting you climb on vertially anything, until you get to the top and see Rome in all its glory. The setting is amazingly beautiful.\n\nThe voice acting is terrific, and it's awesome seeing Ezio age from the beginning of II to the events of Brotherhood. The combat is the same as well, allowing you to stealthily hide in crowds or hack and slash through guards as you please. Because pleasure is guaranteed in this game.\n\nA fun new feature in brotherhood sticks with the title: you can now recruit other assassins to help you in the game. You can have them eliminate foes for you, or send them on missions to make money for you and strengthen the asssassin's abilities. The story is magnificent as well, keeping you on your toes the whole time.\n\nFor any action-adventure lover or fellow Brotherhood members, this is the perfect game for you. But, keep in mind, this is not the first game. I advise you to play Assassin's Creed I and II first. Assassin's Creed I CAN be skipped, but I do not recommend it. Play them all.

Picks up after AC 2, with Ezio again a few years after AC 2 took place.  Focused solely in Rome with 4 areas that unlock as you progress.  The story was interesting.  Ezio pulls together the 3 factions to defat a common enemy, and ends with a decent addition to the lore.  Graphics look good.  Combat is the same as usual.  Entertaining but frustrating.  Running through streets will enevitibly result in you running up a wall you didn't intend to, or hoping up on a barrel killing your progress in timed missions.  The camera will hide behind a tree during a battle with multiple enemies.  If Ubisoft could solve these issues this series would be a 9 or a 10 for me, but as of AC 4, they are still present.  I liked the economic twist they added in this installment.  Investing money in shops to get rewards to unlock more weapons, although it looks like they dropped the mechanic at some point, since it wasn't in AC 4.","October 18, 2014","true","63.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This time around, the player feels more included in the Assassin band because you could send in a team at your command. The story is as interesting as ACII if not a little less, because the game tries to answer everyone's questions, both the audience and Ezio's. There are a few more gadgets and a brotherhood, otherwise that is it. The gameplay is basically the same as in ACII. By the end of ACII, Ezio got a bit comfortable, but right from the beginning of this game, it is clear that there are other powers out there that are constantly uprising. As usual, the game design is beautiful. The city of Italy has a lot to take in with many areas to explore. The missions are roughly the same as in ACII, but there are a few new ones that were refreshing. This iteration of the series was not as amazing as ACII, but was still a fun game to experience.\n\nThe Strengths\nThe developers played it a bit safe by just using the same formula from the previous game. I enjoyed the sense of 'Brotherhood' when interaction with the assassin family in the game. I thought that the addition of the crossbow was awesome, and on top of that the arrow storm proved to be very useful in many situations that I encountered.\n\nThe Limitations\nAlthough there was a good amount of features added to the game, I did not get the same sense of awe throughout the game.","November 16, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I say this, I really mean you start in the exact spot, wearing the same gear you were at the end of the previous game. The story picks up right away and continues to entice.\n\nThis game, while different in various ways, keeps the same essence of the last game. You explore Roma during the Borgia reign of the early 16th century. This allows for, like all the games, some splendid views and the ability to truly appreiciate the thought and effort put into the design of the city and surrounding areas plus the attention to detail that I have come to enjoy and appreiciate.\n\nThere is a lot to do in this game. The added Economics allows for lots of money to be made and spent in Roma. This just builds on the ability in the previous game to earn and spend money and puts that to work on a grander scale.\n\nThe added abilities, weapons, and use of the syncing percentage really shine in this game. I found myself using the crossbow alot more than I thought I would and not just out of neccesity but actual enjoyment. Leveling up you own assassins within your guild and using them in various ways allowed for more interesting encounters with enemies and missions. Having missions have an optional objectives/constraints to get a sync percentage made had me retrying missions all the time to achieve that percentage. It made the replay value, for even the first time through, appealing and challenging.\n\nOverall, if you like the series and played the games up until this point, continue to do so. You won't be disappointed.","October 29, 2014","true","47.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays very similar, but there are some excellent improvements; visually and in regards to the gameplay.\n\nAll the Assassin's Creed games had one major positive aspect: They look beautiful. You feel immersed and part of the environment and getting to a high point that allows you to overlook the entire city/area is truly a 'wow' moment. As far as the gameplay is concerned, I particularly like the fact that you can actually call a horse and ride it within the confines of the city, and the new weapons you can use; particularly the crossbow. Very cool, and foremost helpful if you're free-running and have to quick eliminate guards.\n\nLater on you get additional help once the brotherhood forms, but I won't say all too much here, because that is something that should be experienced!\n\nThe somewhat different economy system makes sense and works, as it provides you a fairly steady source of income right from the get go which definitely helps with upgrades and repairs. So far the missions are diversive, the envrionment feels lively and challenging and it's definitely a good addition to the series. Basically have, so far, never really felt bored.\n\nAs I said before, Rome certainly looks beautiful and in particular the recreation of the Colosseum is impressive. In general you have very recognizable landmarks. The entire area in which the game takes place is also huge, much bigger than you'd think when you get started. It grows very subtle, and suddenly you think, 'hold on, how did I get here?" It is true that certain areas being "unavailable" in a certain memory sequence is a little annoying at times, but I guess, since AC is a very story and narrative based franchise, despite the free roaming, it makes sense to move the story along.\n\nThe world does evolve with you though. The only other game series that ever did this to a certain extend was GTA, but not with the same kind of subtlety and style Assassin's Creed does it; that is something that was there right from the start of th series, but it certainly evolved with each subsequent game.\n\nIf you liked the Assassin's Creed series up until this point, you will not be disappointed by "Brotherhood".","October 25, 2014","true","42.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Complete with new gadgets, a brand new, large city to explore and your own guild of assassins, Ezio is well equipped to confront Borgia tyranny.\nThat is not to say that everything that this game adds is good though. In particular are the new challenges, the 100% sync missions. These are optional, additional challenges on top of the normal missions in order to appeal to completionists. And while most are reasonably possible to do, some are outright annoying, for if you fail the 100% sync, you cannot get 100% sync without restarting the entire mission.\n\nLuckily, the game retains the same fun, do what you want sandboxy feel that AC2 had, and my gripes are really only optional content.

Assassins Creed Brotherhood review!\n\nThis game is the second of 3 in following the story of Ezio Auditore. It's a few years after AC2, and so there's a few of the same characters and a bunch of new ones. There's even a few flashback missions that take place in Firenze. I was in it for the story for the most part, so I tried to beat the story missions as in order as possible. The combat is pretty much identical to AC2 but with much cleaner mechanics. I didn't play around with the weapons much and mostly just stuck with the hidden blades. The combos are always satisfying when they connect especially when landing an execution chain on multiple enemies.\n\nAs usual, the voice acting and dialogue is excellent as AC goes . The cutscenes and scenery in general is awesome, with great attentions to detail in reconstructing the textures and landscapes. It really feels like being in the renaissance! The maps were very detailed and well put together so you rarely take the same paths twice, if ever. The ability to call and ride horses instantly everywhere makes getting around on roads and sidewalks a breeze no matter how many npc's are walking around.\n\nThere's still a lot of repetition in mission events, go here, go there, stab someone, run away, hide etc. That aside, it's definitely a game series worth playing and I'm gonna get on AC Revelations tonight!\n\nAssassins Creed Brotherhood Prof Points: 8.2741","November 23, 2014","true","40.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Familiarity of AC 2's HUD system and combat mechanics with additional in-game features such as building up your very own troupe of Assassins and sending them on missions to gain levels and become more powerful.

Great continuation of the story so far with even more intrigue thrown in and questions raised. Definitely a worthy addition to your AC collection, or just a fun game all around. *****","June 25, 2012","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, it seems like halfway through the game new stuff is still being introduced, to the point that I kept wondering "So when does the tutorial end and the game begin?"\n\nNone of this would be a problem if all of this inconsequential fluff was interesting, but most is simply repeating the same things over and over again. When they aren't acting as dry tutorials for all the busywork the main quest missions can be quite good, but unfortunately they tend to be drowned out by all the added nonsense.

Only thing you're going to buy is pouches. Taking down Borgia Towers is fun. The AI is still dumb as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. The side quests are more fun, adding a different kind of Assassination Mission: Templar Agents. Multiplayer is great. You can do missions at 100%, which adds a little replayability.

Or, for long distances traveling - if one doesn't want to use sewers system the horse is only choice. But not in tight streeets of Rome, you can get really hard times with your horse stucked somewhere on the corner etc ;)).\n\n- there is no more killing from back of your horse with your sword possibility. You just can't draw your sword while being on horse. Which looks strage, but to be honest - it gave too much overpower to Ezio. Ezio was almost immortal with sword being on horse back. It was fun for a while, but with that were some parts of game too much easy. Specially liberating Borgia towers was like "one finger in my nose, second hand on my mouse", i just took a horse, draw my sword and even hardes Borgia towers were cleaned of Borgia soldier within minute with no need to use of medicine.\n\nCons:\n\n- as i play third AC in row (started with ACII, then AC:B, now i play AC:Reveletaions) i start thinking there should be difficulty setting, i fell very often like as guards are totally blinded or def\n\n- parachutes from Leonardo! Worst thing ever, for what is it if you can't use it as primary tool for escaping some fight/battle which gone wrong? I was unable to use parachute almost everytime i was "known, seeked and chased". In time of peace i had no problem to deploy parachute.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWho loved AC and loved ACII will enjoy AC:B. And i have no problem with strictly continuity of Ezio story (so one needs to know ACII before playing AC:B and needs to know AC:B before playing AR:Revelations).","September 6, 2014","true","57.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are new gadgets (crossbow, poison darts, parachute to name a few) that make Ezio's arsenal finally feel complete (I'm not sure why it took so long to get the crossbow though, Altair had one in the intro movie for the first game). The ability to call assassin's is great fun and actually makes you feel like part of the brotherhood instead of just a lone wolf. In many ways Ezio is just completely overpowered (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) so when I see a group of guards it's a question of how do I want to kill them as opposed to what is the most effective way to kill them since all the methods are effective. The Leonardo missions are also fun (Ezio gets to drive a tank in one).\n\nThat said, this game feels like it really should have been an expansion pack for AC2 instead of a sequel. There isn't much to the story and what is there is drawn out longer than it should have been. Ideally the best placement for this game would have been right before the final act of AC2 so Ezio builds up to finally confronting his arch rival. The bad guy in this game just doesn't seem all that exciting after fist-fighting the pope at the end of AC2.\n\nThe world is also MUCH smaller. You're stuck in one city the entire game with no countryside either.\n\nThat said, the game was still a lot of fun and is easily recommended. As with all older games, wait to pick it up on sale.","September 9, 2014","true","53.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reece82/recommended/48190/","reece82","Reece","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reece82/","332 products in account","This entry was  vast improvement over Assassin's Creed 2 for me.  I'm not even sure if I can put my finger on why that is either.  Perhaps less flag/feather gathering.  I'm a bit of a completionist so that drove me insane in AC2.  Though admittedly I didn't gather everything in this entry either.  For those without AC experience, there are flags and other items to "collect" scattered around the game.  Some are in hard to reach places or locked areas that open up as you progress.  For the most part I enjoyed the "jumping puzzle" and added challenge of figuring out how to get to them.  Some may not...for some reason in AC2 I was at my wit's end due to the size of the game and high number/variety of items. The feeling of "missing something" was constantly there and it became tedious trying to figure out what I may have overlooked.\n\nOne of the bigger changes in Brotherhood in regard to missions, was that every single one had an added challenge in order for you to get 100% synchronization for a memory.  At first, I found this extremely frustrating especially since I hadn't mastered some of the combat mechanics (like kill streaks, though once I figured that out it, my game changed dramatically).  But eventually I ended up finding that the missions were a lot more fun with the added challenge.  Granted, there were times I was cursing how clumsy I was with the controls. This did eliminate some freedom in how you decided to complete a mission.  That was my biggest lament over this feature...but for me, it wasn't a terrible thing.\n\nThe acrobatics in this installment are as you'd expect them.  Perhaps it was my imagination, but it felt more responsive than the previous games and  traversing the rooftops felt more fluid than ever.  As much as I'd expect to get tired of it, just jumping from rooftop to rooftop, is a good time.\n\nIt's no wonder flabby gamers everywhere love the AC series because it lets you become the ultimate acrobatic badass as you hang from a ledge by one hand flashing your 12 pack abs to the ladies below. Those courtesans may sleep with everyone else in the game, but let's face it, they all want you (Ezio).\n\nI have to give props to the music in the game.  The perfect track always started when you were jumping through ruins, fighting 20 guards or racing the clock.  It always felt right.\n\nI liked the storyline this time around.  I had to recap what happened in AC2 before I played Brotherhood. But I'll be starting Revelations knowing exactly what happened in Brotherhood. No shortage of intrigue and I have to give the writers credit, I love the whole premise of visiting a time period hundreds of years ago while progressing a sci fi story in the present/future. It's brilliant from a sequel standpoint, especially considering the fact that I'm 3 games behind the current release (with a new one on the way).\n\nI hope Revelations is as satisfying as Brotherhood. I know AC2 was a fan favorite, after reading reviews and comments about it.  I can understand why some loved AC2 over AC1 due to AC1's repetitiveness but I didn't get much out of the crazy amount of side quests and collecting in AC2.  I also felt like AC1 was stronger from a storytelling perspective (with the ending being an exception perhaps). Ezio was very difficult to like at first too. Perhaps that's why Brotherhood won me over.  It took all of AC2 and Brotherhood for me to warm up to him.","September 2, 2014","true","55.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Putting the ridiculously OP counter aside, the battling part of the the game is still decent. The free roam adds more gameplay time in this game, which is always good.

Picks up after AC 2, with Ezio again a few years after AC 2 took place.  Focused solely in Rome with 4 areas that unlock as you progress.  The story was interesting.  Ezio pulls together the 3 factions to defat a common enemy, and ends with a decent addition to the lore.  Graphics look good.  Combat is the same as usual.  Entertaining but frustrating.  Running through streets will enevitibly result in you running up a wall you didn't intend to, or hoping up on a barrel killing your progress in timed missions.  The camera will hide behind a tree during a battle with multiple enemies.  If Ubisoft could solve these issues this series would be a 9 or a 10 for me, but as of AC 4, they are still present.  I liked the economic twist they added in this installment.  Investing money in shops to get rewards to unlock more weapons, although it looks like they dropped the mechanic at some point, since it wasn't in AC 4.","October 18, 2014","true","63.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Taking over the new city 'Rome', purchasing buildings, and restoring it to its former glory was cool as well.\n\nAssassin's Creed - Brotherhood is pretty fun if you're a fan of the franchise, you can find it for cheap, and you have some time to burn.","November 6, 2014","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Complete with new gadgets, a brand new, large city to explore and your own guild of assassins, Ezio is well equipped to confront Borgia tyranny.\nThat is not to say that everything that this game adds is good though. In particular are the new challenges, the 100% sync missions. These are optional, additional challenges on top of the normal missions in order to appeal to completionists. And while most are reasonably possible to do, some are outright annoying, for if you fail the 100% sync, you cannot get 100% sync without restarting the entire mission.\n\nLuckily, the game retains the same fun, do what you want sandboxy feel that AC2 had, and my gripes are really only optional content.

But I cannot recommend this installment in the series like I did its predecessor.\n\nThe real shame here is that Rome has none of the charm of AC2's brilliant levels. Where Florence was towering and beautiful, Venice labyrinthine and mysterious, and Tuscany open and warm, Rome is just a dissapointment. It feels lifeless and indistinct, even small at times.\n\nAdding to the problem is AssCreeBro's story. AC2 got it right, by telling a straightforward story about the protagonist's journey from simple vengeance to deciphering his role in a larger mystery. AssCreeBro falters, picking up immediately after the admitedly weak finale of AC2 and going nowhere slowly. After the Borgia launch a counter attack that an idiot should have seen coming a mile away, Ezio heads to Rome to regain the Apple and thwart his enemies. The plan includes rebuilding the Assassin order, which plays out in a profoundly boring way. You meet bland, faceless citizens who are under attack, save them, then recruit them to your cause, where they become bland, faceless assassins who do nothing of plot significance. You'll slowly "liberate" Rome by climbing towers (and setting them on fire for some reason), and then buying all the shops in the area.\n\nAssCreeBro adds a few features (like the Assassin recruits). The disappointing part is that most of those new features are bland or unnecessary. The investment minigame seems to exist only to fuel itself. The missions you send your recruits on earn a tiny amount of gold and do nothing for the plot. New "full syncronization" challenges have been added to every mission, further restricting the way you experience this open world adventure (usually in arbitrary ways that don't make any sense and often with bugs).\n\nWithout the charm of the setting or story, issues that have plagued Assassin's Creed gameplay since the original begin to take center stage. The controls are atrocious. On PC, the stronger option is to use an Xbox controller rather than wrestle with the horrible keyboard/mouse options. On the controller, one must hold the left trigger to perform all the most common actions. The X and A buttons on the controller are each map to dozens of different (often contradictory) context sensitive commands, and other buttons are under-utilized or outright ignored. Keep in mind, none of these issues is new to AssCreeBro, its just that without the distractions these issues swiftly come to dominate the experience.\n\nIts not that AssCreeBro is bad - its just not good enough to overlook the flaws. If you're already invested in the series, you might want to power through this chapter, but if not, I'd skip right past it.","March 6, 2015","false","43.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was shorter than the previous game, but it was still very well made and packed with intriguing characters.\n\nThe gameplay didn‚Äôt change much from ACII, but did add some entertaining side missions like liberating sectors of Rome from Borgia oppression, further develop the city‚Äôs economy and various assassination contracts.\n\nEzio develops his leadership skills while training recruits and managing the Order, this also allows the ability to call assassins as backup or send them on mission across Europe.\n\nThe graphics and animations are amazing, the streets, the architecture and monuments and landmarks of Rome are breathtaking and really add to the game‚Äôs immersion. The soundtrack itself adds to this, combining some old songs with new ones, really good work.\n\nDefinately a game worth buying and a great addition to the series.","April 15, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is identical to ACII with a few new mechanics so you have nothing to get used to. Difficulty feels like it has been increased but nothing too frustrating. The most notable new mechanic is right in the title, being able to recruit assassins and help you out when you call upon them. However the game starts to feels like a grindfest when you want to rebuild Rome, it's the same mechanic on liberating each sector: muder captain, climb tower, set fire. Rennovating the shops is also just as tedious.\nBut if you a fan of the Assassin's Creed series or open world gamplay, this is something you will enjoy.","April 17, 2014","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Leap of faith-- yeah, I've been waiting to use that one.) Honestly, though, it isn't the story that takes frontrunner here, as it seems that with each entry the story gets more and more confusing (not that that is necessarily a bad thing in this case), but the thrills that come with being able to call forth allies on a moments notice to help you take out your enemies. Leveling up your Brotherhood and becoming more engrossed in the brilliant side tasks gives players more reason to come back than any other entry in the AC series, and that is saying a lot. Of course, however, those who would try to play this without playing at least AC2 will be making a gross mistake. Fair warning to any who haven't touched upon this fantastic series.","July 25, 2012","true","63.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Brotherhood tries to follow the same way of the second, with secondary missions less tedious (as tedious as the first title). I think the goal is having the player in game the more possible hours.

It's so much fun running around Rome randomly stabbing guards from rooftops. The story is meh but that's not the main draw of the game. Like any Assassin's Creed game it involves a lot of parkour and stabbing, which it nails down well. The one draw back for me is the lack of any sort of cover mechanic. Sometimes you're supposed to assasinate a target, yet all you have to hide behind is a pillar slightly wider then yourself. A cover system like Batman: Arkham City would have been nice. Overall though the game is a lot of fun and you can spend hours just free-running around Rome. I give it an 8.7/10","April 11, 2013","true","51.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
