But you can't change the resolution, which means I either see it in a tiny window in the middle of my monitor, or go 'full screen' and the massive blurriness that entails.  For that reason alone I don't think I can keep going.  Not to mention it's very dark most of the time, and no brightness setting seems to exist.  So it's small, dark and generally eyestrain inducing.  It's a shame, the concept is a nice one.","April 8","false","0.6"," 114 of 160 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","114","160","2","7"

Once you're confident take on your friends in 1v1 battles.\n\nFortify has really impressed me, but I'm not surprised as it's from the same dev as Terraform which is another very good game!\n\nDisclosure: Based on my experience of Terraform, I asked to help Jonas test Fortify so I had pre-release access to game for no charge. Jonas was very receptive to my comments and quickly implemented a few improvements to the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/recommended/378260/","commissarbro","CommissarBRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/","1034 products in account","This game is good. Just a simple Tower-Defense/RTS hybrid in the same vein as some zombie survival flash games you might've seen on Armor Games about a decade ago. Like those games, this one has a very addicting nature and you'll find yourself sinking a good number of hours into the Arcade mode, trying to get further and further every time. So far my best playthrough is 22 waves.\n\nFortify plays in a very simple manner. You have a fort that starts out very low tier with just a couple of slingshooters to hold back the tides of evil. As you gain more gold, you'll unlock new units. You'll upgrade your fort and build outposts which produce 1 of 3 resources that are used to further upgrade your fort. You'll progress through three tech levels; Iron Age, Medieval Age and Imperial Age. Starting from slingshots and ending with rifles and grenades. Aside from the 2 campaigns in the game (Northern, West) you also have an endless Arcade mode and a multiplayer mode where you can battle against 1 other player.\n\nIn summation, a very solid title that I've had an absolute blast with. And for 4.99, you can hardly beat it! A lot of indie titles price themselves out of the market, assuming they have plenty of content for the price. This title can actually carry that boast.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV6mwbgL4bM\n","April 9","true","3.1"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","36","49","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retrific/recommended/378260/","retrific","Retrific","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retrific/","107 products in account","TL;DR: Really nice game to fair price. If you like RTS/Tower Defense and have someone to play it with in multiplayer buy it immediatly!\n\nI followed the development of this game for a while and bought it on release and I wouldn't say I'm disappointed, no it's definitely a really nice game. I'm a huge fan of indie games and also of RTS games, so this game was an easy buy-choice for  me. And I don't regret the purchase, but this game is still not perfect. There are many small things that bug me and some of them are easily fixable. And I hope this game gets more content in future updates.\n\nThe biggest thing everyone who buys this game will notice immediatly is that this game has no resolution option at all, which would be no problem if it was in HD anyway or would have pixelart style, but its more in a flash-game kind of style, i.e. it has sort of high resolution textures and tries to look "realistic". I like the design and it fits the game perfectly but because there is no resolution option the game will be noticable blurry (at least in the main menu) when played in fullscreen. But I can live with that.\n\nThen there is the 30 fps lock, which really is no problem at all because of the gameplay. But I noticed that when you advance time at night the fps lock will switch to 60, 90 and 120 fps, which then speeds up the game. That's not really professional, but it works...I guess.....nice workaround...but this probably explains why it has a 30 fps lock instead of 60 fps. Since 4x60fps = 240fps which would probably cause some problems on less powerful systems.\n\nNext thing that I noticed are some AI problems here and there. The AI really has no AI at all except maybe some kind of pathfinding. This kinda sucks because you'll always have to rotate your troops so that they attack the enemy. You can't set something like patrol paths or auto-rotation. And everytime you change the direction of your ranged units you'll have to change it back, because the position-saving only saves their position, and not their rotation, so when you say them to go back to their default position but you rotated them earliert they will then look in the wrong direction. Dev, pls fix this!\n\nThen there is the problem that most of the times you won't find someone to play with, and I doubt this will change in the future, probably it will become even harder. But yea, that's because not enough people play this game, that's not the games fault :D\n\n̶A̶̶n̶̶o̶̶t̶̶h̶̶e̶̶r̶̶ ̶̶m̶̶i̶̶n̶̶o̶̶r̶̶ ̶̶t̶̶h̶̶i̶̶n̶̶g̶̶ ̶̶i̶̶s̶̶ ̶̶t̶̶h̶̶a̶̶t̶̶ ̶̶s̶̶o̶̶ ̶̶f̶̶a̶̶r̶̶ ̶̶y̶̶o̶̶u̶̶ ̶̶c̶̶a̶̶n̶̶ ̶̶m̶̶o̶̶v̶̶e̶̶ ̶̶t̶̶h̶̶e̶̶ ̶̶c̶̶a̶̶m̶̶e̶̶r̶̶a̶̶ ̶̶o̶̶n̶̶l̶̶y̶̶ ̶̶u̶̶s̶̶i̶̶n̶̶g̶̶ ̶̶W̶̶A̶̶S̶̶D̶̶/̶̶A̶̶r̶̶r̶̶o̶̶w̶̶ ̶̶K̶̶e̶̶y̶̶s̶̶,̶̶ ̶̶b̶̶u̶̶t̶̶ ̶̶n̶̶o̶̶t̶̶ ̶̶m̶̶y̶̶ ̶̶c̶̶l̶̶i̶̶c̶̶k̶̶i̶̶n̶̶g̶̶ ̶̶a̶̶n̶̶d̶̶ ̶̶d̶̶r̶̶a̶̶g̶̶g̶̶i̶̶g̶̶.̶̶ ̶̶B̶̶u̶̶t̶̶ ̶̶t̶̶h̶̶e̶̶ ̶̶d̶̶e̶̶v̶̶ ̶̶s̶̶a̶̶i̶̶d̶̶ ̶̶h̶̶e̶̶ ̶̶w̶̶i̶̶l̶̶l̶̶ ̶̶a̶̶d̶̶d̶̶ ̶̶t̶̶h̶̶i̶̶s̶̶,̶̶ ̶̶s̶̶o̶̶.̶̶.̶̶.̶\n\nThe particle effects look okay, sometimes nice, sometimes not so nice. Animations look good. Textures are sometimes really good, sometimes blurry. All sprites look pretty good. All in all the game looks good.\n\nThe tutorial is very good (but sadly only explains the singleplayer) and you understand the game within minutes.\n\nEven some classic RTS shortcuts work like Ctrl+123....\n\nI couldn't find any really bad bugs and the game only crashed when there was a 1v1 tournament, organized by the dev.\nAnd when this was fixed I didn't experience any bugs anymore.\n\nBtw the dev is really nice and helps where he can.\n\nThe balance of the game is okay I guess, I didn't notice any too powerful/underpowered units so far.\n\nI would love to see some more options for defensive structures like actual towers that you can place wherever you want, or turrets or barricades. I mean there is the catapult and the tar field, but you always have to place it new when it burns down and you have to fire the catapult manually.\n\nOf course I would also like to see more gamemodes/maps, especially for multiplayer. Maybe a coop mode or more than 2 player mode? Unlikely, but I would love it.\n\nSo yea, a pretty good game that could be even better after some updates, but since it was just released I'm looking forward to future updates.","April 12","true","5.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

For the pros I'd give a 4/5\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n\n\n\n\n-As mentioned above it is a very hardcore game which can turn people away from it\n\n-It only has two developers unlike other popular titles with a full dev team\n\n-There are very few hotkeys that have use\n\n-You can select melee and ranged but you cannot select all at once besides the scrolling over the whole map to select all\n\n-It can get very hard at times\n\n-It has a ridiculous amount of microing and if you are not a hardcore gamer that can be really frustrating or boring\n\n-It involves alot of grinding which I personally like but grinding isn't everyones fortae\n\n-For a tower defense game, it has quite alot of data which some computers may not be able to run\n\n-If you don't enjoy tycoon, tower defense games, or you don't like putting a decent amount of hours into a game this may seem like you are just doing the same thing over and over\n\n-Frame rate can get quite low even on a mega computer like mine\n\n-The story is a bit lackluster\n\n-A slightly complicated UI\n\n-The multiplayer community is quite small\n\n-The Content could have more and there seems to be a bit missing, but I'd expect more to be added in the future\n\n\n\nFor the cons; I'd probably rate it a 2/5, The cons can be very disadvantageous and in some cases may not outweigh the positives\n\n\n\n\nOverall as said above it is a 6/10 from me. It combines aspects of different genres into a tower defense game and adds more. For a 5$ game I'd definitely recommend this game.","May 28","true","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A game that you will play after a long day of taking a beating from your boss that happens to have a god-complex.  A game that will make you wish you played more of the retro-style games when you were younger.  A game that will find you staring at your screen in awe as you discover that your defense was meaningless!  On a serious note, though, this game is epic.\n\nPROS:\n-Sexy retro graphics\n-A slight twist (and improvement) on the traditional TD style\n-Replayability is quite ok (for its money's worth)\n-Differing levels of Singleplayer difficulty (Easy, Normal, Hard, Impossible)\n-1 vs 1 casual multiplayer battles in a sort of Warcraft III custom map feel\n-Minimal bugs, maybe 2 or 3 tops\n-An active developer\n\nCONS: (I understand this is a newborn game)\n-A slightly complicated UI, and this might make beginners feel rather overwhelmed (you get used to it after about 15 minutes, though)\n-The multiplayer community is in dire need of players\n-A somewhat linear style of gameplay, and players may find themselves undergoing a repetitive cycle if they aren't enthusiastic about TD\n\nSUMMARY:\n-A great concept, nice gameplay, nostalgia-inducing.  I feel like this game will grow well if the developer continues to work on this, and doesn't leave it dead.  A LOT of potential for tons of updates in the future and exciting content.

Those are harder to defend and thats the time to use Meelee units and you become playing usual RTS game.\n\nThose buildings are vital since they provide useful resources for future upgrades of your castle.

I play through "campaign" two times and the only next thing why to play this is harder dificulty.\n\nSo: Considering this game to its price, its worth the money and if you are not sure, buy it in some sale and you will have fun because its fun!","April 10","true","2.5"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

Old school style RTS/tower defense. Looks simple on the surface but has tons of strategic depth in terms of positioning, unit composition, build order and upgrade options. The game rewards micromanagement skills without relying on crazy high APM to succeed. The tech tree is complex enough to allow for many strategic options and the potential for an ever shifting "meta game" if enough people stick with the multiplayer community. Highly reccomended for RTS fans!","April 10","true","13.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

The strategy inside is deep enough. Higher levels requires more skill. Once you realise the games rules. It becomes very fun. Try not to fight the design by right clicking enemies. Tutorial section is well designed too.\n\n-Could have been with resolution options and more hotkeys to raise our APM even more.\n-Double clicking could have select all the same type units. (but thats an engine issue so I dont think its possible but at least there should be hotkey for It)\n-I guess creating the art takes too much time&resources but I hoped there are more themes ( or dynamic changes) since the only one variation to play the game.\n\nStrangely good fun.

I mean, it's probably possible, but unlikely. I guess I could have balanced that better myself, but just something worth noting\nTwo fairly short campaigns, but also includes arcade mode and multiplayer (which I haven't used)\n\n","April 9","true","2.2"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

I really liked the arcs of fire with different units, it makes the player more active in defending the castle instead of having a 360 degree tower that you build and forget.\n\nUltimately i felt that after i'd finished the first level the game didn't have much left to offer me. I'd completed all the upgrades for my castle and my units, my outposts were fully upgraded and it became very repetitive. I've seen many games like this before on flash game websites, but for the price it's a very nice piece.
