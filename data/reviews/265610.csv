The combat is heavily based on elemental advantage/weaknesses – brute force is rarely an option in harder battles, instead the key to victory is using correct skills and gear.\n\nSpeaking of gear, uniquely among RPGs, newer weapons and armor you acquire are not direct improvement of your old equipment. Instead, each weapon and armor has properties that make it good in some situations and mediocre to bad in others. The result is that no equipment becomes useless, and some of early gear may very much be an option for endgame battles.\n\nInstead of acquiring stronger gear, the game features upgrade system for your equipment, allowing you to improve your gear as you progress through the game (most later upgrades require items that are not available until later). And on final note about gear, each item your character wears, from weapons and armor to small badges visibly changes your appearance, which is really a nice touch!\n\nThe story doesn’t even pretend to be serious, but it will accomplish what it sets out to: make you laugh from start to finish!\n\nOverall, Epic Battle Fantasy is all kinds of awesome. If you like turn-based RPGs, give it a try and it won’t disappoint!","February 27, 2014","true","88.0"," 411 of 435 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","411","435","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/265610/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4903 products in account","It's been a while since I've played a true traditional RPG. I've not particularly taken to the RPG Maker trend and even stalwart supporters of the genre, like Square Enix, have edged their games into more action-oriented mechanics. Ironically, at one point in the Playstation age, I felt the genre had become saturated and stale; nowadays, I'll jump on anything that strips back the gimmicks and offers a wholesome predictable journey.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4, as you have probably determined, is part of a long running series none of which have graced Steam before. Luckily, there's absolutely no reason why you can't just jump in if you haven't played the predecessors; the storylines are simple, rather trope-filled affairs and all the better for it. They're wrapped up by the end of the game and the only continuation between the titles are the main characters and cameo moments that serve as fan service. If you're looking for an epic tale of tyranny, betrayal and sacrifice then you might be disappointed. If you have the time for a charming, genuinely funny and surprisingly deep RPG experience then EBF4 provides in every sense.\n\nYour team of four party members aren't limited to class setups like most games. Instead, you'll develop each character using a huge selection skills that eventually make every character capable of wielding devastating spells and life-saving buffs. This flexibility keeps the combat interesting throughout, with enemy resistances calling for constant experimentation and fluidity of tactics. For a game with such an irreverent tone, you'll be greatly punished if you don't approach the battles cautiously. The ability to rush through battles spamming physical attacks is at an absolute minimum and while some battles drag on longer than I'd have liked, it's always preferable to feel engaged at all times.\n\nSurprisingly, I had most of my fun with EBF4 in the world map. Most areas you travel across throughout the game will have a handful of chests, optional battles, NPCs with sidequests and incredibly well-hidden secrets. Scrubbing the screen with the cursor, looking for a hidden package of loot became quite the obsession and really reduces the tedium of back-tracking or getting lost. With items that grant new skills and powerful equipment on offer for those with a keen eye, it's easy to get swept up in the mechanic and see the battles as a distraction. Thankfully, the monsters appear as sprites on the map, so if you feel that way, they're easily avoided.\n\nGrinding is kept at to a minimum, with the rare moments I felt under-powered quickly corrected by fighting a few mobs I'd opted to pass a few screens ago. There are many options to improve your party's powers if you're struggling. The less common stat-increasing foods are a viable source of instant power, spells can be trained using AP accrued from each fight and gear is improved by crafting upgrades using miscellaneous loot. There's always something new to aim towards, especially if you have an interest in achievements; there are some great situational challenges and the developer did a fantastic job of avoiding a conventional and dull list.\n\nThe care and attention put into EBF4 is impressive; even when an enemy could be considered a palette swap, there will be little touches to the model to suit the change in power or element. The Zelda-esque key items that can remove obstacles encountered earlier in the game encourage a lot of exploration and reward players generously. With it taking upwards of 20 hours to complete everything, it's surprisingly to see even more work put in to encourage multiple playthroughs. The value for money takes it from being a budget purchase for genre diehards and into the arms of anyone that's ever launched a Firaga into a flan's face and loved it.\n\nDespite being a fantastic game overall, there were moments of frustration. The occasional enemy will throw instant death moves that feel a little cheap, though nothing compares to bosses that can heal themselves. These situations are few and far between thankfully and do little to overthrow an RPG that remains so consistently enjoyable.\n\nWith so little competition in the world of traditional RPGs, EBF4 could get away with minimal effort and still be devoured by starving fans. As such, it's hugely refreshing to see so much love and attention combined with a proficient and challenging adventure. There's little I can say against the game which, in turn, is one of the best things I can say in its favour. If you fancy something traditional that isn't entirely predictable then I'd say there's no better choice on Steam than Epic Battle Fantasy 4.","April 18, 2015","true","31.0"," 146 of 159 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","146","159","7","14"

This belongs on Newgrounds.  Wait, this IS on Newgrounds.  Why would I pay for this?  Why would anyone even greenlight this??"  I'll tell you why: because this is the RPG your oldschool heart's been waiting for.\n\nYou've got your turn-based RPG elements, your enemies rating from the silly to the spooky to the right-out terrifying, your countless tongue-in-cheek Final Fantasy/Pokemon/Zelda/Mana/etc. homages.  But then there's the feeling of being a part of this world: rather than "exploring" a "vast" world of triumphs and tribulations, you just sort of twiddle around and run into packs of monsters just sitting there on the worldmap.  There's the never-ending bickering and bantering among your teammates as you progress.  There's the range of hints both silly and satisfying that play out as you spar with your foes and try new techniques.\n\nThe challenge is there too--boy, is it ever.  For a game optimized to be played 30 minutes at a go, you can spend a lot of effort fine-tuning your characters' skills and loadouts for tough fights (and it will *really* pay off if you are playing Epic and going for the achievements).  You'll be able to come back to it over time, too--have the satisfaction of clearing the game, take some time off from it, and come back to it anew in New Game+ (or ++) playing however you feel, without having to collect all those non-key items again but with all the damage numbers exponentially increased for more cheesy epicness.\n\nAnd of course, the content you won't find on Newgrounds here--the Battle Mountain--escalates the challenge further (though you could still get through it pretty easily in Easy mode if you went that route).  It's a chance to step off the beaten plot-ridden path and just smash up tons of monsters--plus all-new bosses both uncompromising and unsettling.\n\nIf you are a child of the 90s or late 80s and don't have time to play RPGs anymore but still admire them from afar, this is your chance to see firsthand what happens when nostalgic thrills meet the present day.  This East-meets-West cultural take just might give you one more fantasy to embrace after all.","June 21, 2014","true","118.8"," 119 of 128 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","119","128","0","0"

Just like real life. 10/10\n\n\n\n\n\nBut here's the real review.\n\nOriginating from a browser game, the fourth installment of Epic Battle Fantasy is on Steam, and for a very good reason. I haven't seen a lot of turn-based fighting RPGs like this one, but it really hits the spot.\n\nIt has excellent humor, and I often find myself laughing uncontrollably as I press space to advance through the chatting/cutscenes, seeing hilarious lines being announced by the characters, either in the arguing present everywhere in the game (because Natalie's boobs/Matt being a disgrace/Anna living in a tree/Lance having microcameras stored in his armor to "look" at Natalie's boobs), or in the battling of hundreds of enemies (because they are too weak/strong/disgusting/cool/tasty/scary, or because they resemble Pok*mon too much).\n\nThe characters are beautifully designed, and their personalities are constantly clashing with each other due to their differences, creating a constantly interesting atmosphere to get your mind off the battling and strategy if you're playing on Epic. There's things to like in all of them (and if you look at my profile you MIGHT find out which one is my favourite), and the soundtrack is amazing as well.\n\nAll in all, it sounds like I'm reviewing a GOTY title. And I can't say I don't love Epic Battle Fantasy the Fourth.

Enough about how funny the game is, let's talk about gameplay, the game focuses on the goal of collection and completion rather than harsh and numerous battles, the creator has also made it so that character's not battling will also gain experience so that you won't have to grind for any other character at a later time. The collection will included things such as: chest locations, random drops for armor and weapon upgrades, those weapons and armor  themselves, certain creatures to fill that damn bestiary, ect.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/265610/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an adventure RPG game, developed by Matt Roszak, releasing on Steam is February 2014. This is my first foray into the Epic Battle Fantasy series and have no other previous experience with other games in the franchise.\n\nGameplay is a simplistic RPG style view, with turn based combat for the fights. Controls are so simple; you literally can play the whole game with just your mouse. The game has a real “Pokémon” feel to it, as you explore you will find parts of the map you can’t explore yet because you don’t have the required skill, for instance, to cut a tree down or to smash a rock. Once you learn said skills, you can backtrack quite easily to explore and find treasure hidden in the previously locked area.   The game has well over a hundred different enemies to kill, and learn their strengths and weaknesses of.  My favourite part of the game play is easily the loot and item system.  The game boasts over 170 different items for your characters to use; you can upgrade these items through using the Forging mechanic which require you to use craft-able items to make the upgrade.\n\nThe combat system is really well designed too; you have a party of four characters eventually, but you can only use three in a battle, the fourth acts as a backup in case one of your others dies. The Pokémon element theme is a key mechanic too; making sure you use the correct weapon with the right effect on the enemy is an almost absolute must most of the time.  Characters can also learn “companions” which acts as like “ultimate” attacks, and any of your characters can use them rather than having them bound to one of your party – the best and most fun by a country mile has to be the Super Nova, which just obliterates the entire screen.\n\nVisually, EBF4 is again, simple, but that comes across very pleasantly. The in game art style looks colourful and vibrant, and has a very 3DS look to it. The narration parts of the game are done in a beautifully, almost hand drawn style of art, as if they have just been pulled out of a children’s book. I was enchanted by the visuals straight away as soon as I saw this. There is little animation in the game, given the 2D aspect, but the small amount of animation in the game is done really well, no odd movement cycles or strange looking attacks. There isn’t any voice acting; however there aren’t walls and walls of text to read through, so that can be forgiven.\n\nEBF4’s difficulty levels can be changed on the fly, and you are almost encouraged to play on the highest difficulty until you start hitting a brick wall. I played the game on a normal difficulty and still felt sufficiently challenged by the fights. You can ramp up the difficulty to epic mode for those wanting to get extra achievements though. Once you complete the game you have the option for New Game+. Not to mention the Fire Mountain area of the game. This area scales with your characters level, allowing you to take on unique beasty bosses for extra special loot. This for me again, reminded me of the Pokémon games and the Elite Four trainers.\n\nThe world, in which you play in, is full of extra little bits to do, with roughly 20 side quests to complete, which offer no real variety but still add a bit more game play. The quests are only collection quests, so don’t expect to be getting really in depth quest lines like other RPGs. The quests will reward you with stat increasing items, or more equipment to make use of. There are also a number of NPCs scattered around the world that whilst they offer no game play advantage, they do have a bit of lore behind them though.\n\nEBF4 took me just under 20 hours to complete. I went into this game expecting it to be over in five hours. I am absolutely amazed at how much content and how long this game actually is. What really does this game the most credit is, I wasn’t bored once whilst playing, and I wasn’t waiting for the end of the game to roll around as I was having that much fun playing. There may not be a massive amount of replay ability given the linearity of the storyline, but the New Game+ mode will definitely cater for any people that are fans of the game play.\n\nTechnically, the game runs in a much smaller resolution, whilst you can play full screen, it is a scaled up version. For some reason, I almost had a lot of stuttering during some moments in the game. This was fixed by reloading the game, but I couldn’t quite work out what was causing it. Obviously the game isn’t very taxing to run, given the 2D graphics, but still, I was dropping frames every now and again.  The game cannot be played using a controller without the use of third party software, but I would recommend people play this game with their mouse.\n\nTo sum up, I am absolutely amazed at the quality of this game. It is easily one of my favourite RPG experiences I have ever had. I remarked quite a bit in this review about the resemblances between EBF4 and Pokémon, and that comparison really does this game justice. It is an absolute masterpiece of a game that looks so simple on the outside, but is beautifully and carefully developed on the inside. The game is so perfectly priced at £8, 99 too, with hours of content and high quality content at that!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It's cheap, too, so you should definitely pick up a copy!\n\n======================================\nPros+ RPG: It's oldschool!\n+ Options: All there\n+ Graphics: Cute, colorful, and with nice animations.\n+ UI: Remembering the last used spells is sooo convenient!\n+ Humor: Very much present.\n+ Price: Low, especially for playtime.\n+ References: EVERYWHERE.\n+ Variety: ALSO EVERYWHERE.\n+ Combat: It will keep you doing different things.\n\nCons- Not higher resolution!\n- KB Mode still requires mouse\n\nNeutral+/- You'll have to fight alot of waves of monsters.\n+/- You'll also have to backtrack quite a few times.\n\n======================================\nEpic Battle Fantasy Four...now that's a name! Like its name, EBF4 seems to be a parody of all things RPG. It sports fairly good writing, self-aware humor, a wealth of items to find, and the equipment all has unique art assets. We're off to a good start! So what's the story like?\n\nIt's a bit like this. You're a girl from a small woodland village. Three protagonists from the previous titles in the series have ransacked your village, and its prized jewel is gone! You track them down and force them to join up with you, after realizing they didn't steal the jewel, as repayment for their pillaging. You then go on to the next village to find their jewel is also gone. Okay, you should grab some popcorn for this: The jewels are meant to be seperated, and when brought together could spell doom for humankind. This is because of Catgod. Yes. Catgod. Catgod created the world, and all its creatures. It created cats in its image, but became jealous of their relationship with humans, and decided to take the cats' arm and legs, and destroy their greatest works in the world. Now someone, maybe these cats, wants to even out the punishment! You must take your lovable band of misfits and stop them!\n\nSo, we're already in for an interesting ride. What else is there you ask? Read on!\n\nThis is the kind of game where the more I play, the more I appreciate it. There is humor in spades, which sometimes falls flat for me, but it's very self-aware, so I still appreciate it. Something also everywhere is references, and I LOVE references! Other things are also everywhere, such as: skills, summons, equipment, upgrades, monsters, quests, hidden treasure, and barriers blocking your path.\n\nThe graphics are cute, with much of the stuff in the game sporting decent and equally cute animations. There are plenty of options in the settings menu. There are overworld monsters, so when you feel like skipping battles, you can. The blockades barring your way actually keep things interesting, since your equipment will all remain useful depending on what enemies you are fighting, and everything in this game can be upgraded or scales with your level. This sets a great pace for exploration, and encourages you to find all the hidden unblocked treasures you can get your grubby hands on.\n\nProgression has a good curve. You'll level up, find items, get new weapons, and clear areas at a steady pace. There's also a lot of content to this game, for only 12$ off sale, so you'll get your money's worth, too. The game likes to parody cliches found in anime, games, movies, you name it. The humor will keep you going even if the gameplay gets old, and if it does, a quick break is all it ever took for me to fix that.\n\nFor example, I once started a battle with a woolly mammoth to then inadvertantly drop a woolly mammoth on top of it right after my party commented about how tough the fight would be. I was close to taking a break, but instead laughed plentifully and wanted to keep going. There are plenty of other nice things that will keep the game convenient and easy to play like the ability to scan monsters and instantly see their strengths and weaknesses, the ability to leave a battle without having to play a minigame or roll dice, zone teleports, instant healing slimecats, recently used spells list, and more!\n\nGetting around in Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is easy. The UI is simple enough, although slightly clunky. There are keyboard and mouse movement options, but keyboard mode still requires the mouse for battles, unfortunately, and there's no controller support. The game also maxes out at 720p, which is quite low for modern displays. There is also, on the negative end, ocassional lag and stuttering. There are plenty of settings to mess with so you can likely find a setting that fixes that for you.\n\nAll in all you'll want to experience this game for the story, humor, characters, references, varied battles, and sheer number of items, equipment, and potential upgrades.\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 25, 2015","true","20.2"," 63 of 77 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","63","77","4","0"

Turn Based battle system, a fun, laid back skill system, and visual cues that darn well give away hints.\n\nIf you're looking for an extremely hardcore RPG, you have come to the wrong place, if however - you are looking for a "comfy" JRPG which focuses more on fun, you have come to the right place. Not to say the game is not challenging - far from it. It's just more relaxing to play than other JRPGs on the market. Hence the term "Comfy JRPG"; it's something you can play all night without realizing the time, which is exactly what happened to me last night.\n\nEven-though I have some of the best JRPGs ever created in my library I choose to play this for hours instead. Now, you're probably wondering why? The answer is simple: Fun. Literally pure fun. With some of the classic JRPGs you get ups and downs, and sometimes just can't be bothered to keep playing - but with this, it's just all ups and I never wanted to put the mouse down. - Would be nice to perhaps Controller support in the future though.\n\nThe story/plot is very unique, and the game has some nice light humour, which is very nice to see in a JRPG. This is a game that doesn't take itself too serious. It's less about hardcore grinding, and more about fun. The story up to now has been great, but I won't say much as it would ruin surprises for you.\n\nIt's quite funny seeing certain thing's in game and you think to yourself "Wait a minute! That looks familiar!) - There are clear references to Final Fantasy, Zelda, Pokemon, etc. It was funny seeing that Pikachu on the fire, and other stuff which I won't mention it as it could spoil the surprise. There are plenty of different foes, and might I add - the art style is very good too. Would be nice to see 1080p support in the future for those who can make use of it.\n\nThe battle system is very relaxing. There is no rushing, no stress. You do stuff in your own time. There are a lot of skills and specials to choose from. Items can also give you permanent boosts, as well as your mandatory heal items, etc you would come to expect from a JRPG.\n\nAt first the item collecting seemed weird - but after a bit of time I realized it's another great element to the game, and it reminds me of when I used to be a kid and collected rare items in games. It's nice to have something like that again. Although, it would be nice if there was a few less item quests, and perhaps a few more hunt x monsters quests.\n\nSo what are the final thoughts for EBF4? It's almost the ultimate comfy JRPG, and that's not a light thing to say. This game is VERY FUN. So if you want to sit on the couch or desk for hours and hours and forget about time and eventually grow a beard and never wash again because you are so damn addicted, then this game is for you. Seriously. BUY IT NOW. Feel free to look at my reviews for other games, I normally score most games low, but this get's an 8/10 from me.\n\nAlso; Did I mention you can make bewbs bounce, and play with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? :3","June 23, 2014","true","8.3"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","41","46","0","8"

Even when I had played it 9 times it was still as fun as it was the first time I started the game. But years passed and one day in 2013 just before I was about to turn off my computer I just wanted to check my Kongregate and there it was, Epic Battle Fantasy 4.\n\nI played the game 2 times or so on Kongregate but never really took the time to beat it but then a half year later when it got to steam I instantly bought it and played it through. I'm currently at my second playthrough and it has been some time since I bought it now.\n\nLets get into the game shall we\n\nArt and Graphics: (10/10 absoultely love the art style)\n\nI personally love the cute anime based art style that the game has and the effects are well animated aswell as the world and items and don't forget all the monsters and characters all have high detail. You may wonder why I say that they are detailed while their not having that mush details like shadows and particles but that is becouse it has a perfect balance between being cartoonish and detailed so i would say that this is a kind of masterpiece.\n\nSound and Music: (11/10 its my favorite game music and I listen to it all the time)\n\nI think that the sound effects in this game fits perfectly with only some few improvements coming into my mind sometimes but thats just if I'm picky.\nThe music which is written by HalcyonicFalconX is absolutely stunning and as it changes from every region you visit it also changes the games atmosphere. From relaxing in the forest to intense in the factory aswell as epic while in the volcano. All I can say is that without the music the game wouldn't have such an impact on me as it had.\n\nGameplay (combat): (8/10 the combat is great but can sometimes get a bit repetative)\n\nThe combat system is that of any JRPG just that it is simple, highly detailed and fun but it does get repetative when going through an older region or before you unlock multi target skills. Anyhow the combat can make you quite impressed sometimes as some skills/attacks is simply epic.\n\nGameplay (exploration): (9/10 the world and exploration is so relaxing)\n\nWith a bunch of puzzles, easter eggs and a large variety of biomes to explore the exploration gets quite relaxing and at the same time interesting as you never know what you will find before uncovering the map.\n\nContent: (8/10 very mush content for having one developer)\n\nThere is a large variety of quests, skills, items and monster but its not as mush content as you will find in an AAA game but thats obviouse that it would not have as mush content. I'm not saying that the game is low on content of items etc. but when you reach high levels for example you might have acctually leveled all skills to max and uppgraded every piece of equipment to the max. There is still enough of content to satisfy any player but I'm just saying that you might end up with nothing more to level up other than the characters levels but you wont reach the "no more upgrades" untill your in New Game+ or New Game++.\n\nStory: (7/10 even without any focus on the story I still like it)\n\nThe game focuses on exploration, upgrading and combat but still offers a small story and its quite lighthearted and ammusing but still every time the game reveales a new part of the story you really feel like you are there in that offten wierd situation.\n\nFinal Score: (9.8/10 this game is a must buy)\n\nWhy such a high score well here is some ups and downs:\n+++ : The music is absolutely amazing\n++ : The sound fits very well with almost everything within the game\n++ : Exploration and puzzleing is very fun and can get you obsessed to clear everything to a 100%\n++ : The combat system is very strategic and interesting but its still simple enough to be played by a child\n++ : The sudden notices from the characters can get quite hilleriouse\n++ : The games easter eggs makes the game quite fun if you try to notice them all that is\n+ : The game offers New Game+ aswell as a large variety of items to use\n+ : Some skills/attacks can only be described with one word only: EPIC\n\n- : There is a large variety of Skills and Equipment but after starting New Game+ it feels like you found everything\n- : Going back to an older region does not provide with any supported combat untill you reach the next New Game+\n\nThis is a must buy for all RPG fans aswell as to all Fantasy and Comedy fans so I hope this review helped and that you might buy this game.","September 25, 2014","true","43.2"," 57 of 73 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","57","73","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/recommended/265610/","orpe11","orpe11","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/","474 products in account","TL;DR: A well done JRPG styled game, with a focus on adjusting your gear and tactics for each group and boss to hit weaknesses and exploit status effects. Requires a bit of strategy for optional things, but no too deep if you just want to enjoy it.\n\nI've actually played all the EBF's so far, and you don't need to play the others to play this one. Technically, you can play it for free on the website, minus some features, but the creator has done some amazing work on this title, so he deserves the money if you want to purchase it.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy has always been about adjusting your tactics to your current enemies, and 4 is no different. The game boils down classic turn based combat into a purely fun formula. Each battle, even bosses, you can run from at will, so if you find new enemies you can scan them, then flee to adjust your gear if you like, or just hammer on through if you can. Most enemies can be beaten by using gear with no downsides and the proper elements, but obviously you will get much better results, especially against bosses and larger enemies, if you adjust your gear to hit their weaknesses. Unlike most JRPGs, status effects actually matter alot in the game, and alot of them work well in conjunction. One of the best combos is the darkness status effect decreases stats over time, and increases weakness to holy...and the holy status effect reduces the other stats over time, and increases weakness to dark. This leads to combos, such as having an accessory that gives the darkness-only debuff to your weapons, and using that against dark enemies so they receive even more holy damage. The game is all about finding those neat combos and useful effects, and using them well.\n\nThe story is bare bones, but it doesn't need to be too epic (Despite the name), the summary from 3 to 4 as told in the intro is 'the heroes saved the world, so they thought they were entitled to everyones stuff, so they took it...that made people mad, insert new heroine'. The game makes light of typical JRPG tropes, without being too caustic. It also introduces new elements as you run into them, so it avoids any sort of tutorial. Sidequests are nothing more than gather materials, give to NPC.\n\nThe game has many things you can do to improve your characters besides levelling, optional skills that you can only give to one character, upgrading weapons/armor (of which there are plenty), accessories, permanent stat boosting items that can be hoarded through numerous NG+s, etc. While you can go through it on easy, the game does reserve the boss achievements only for beating them on the highest difficulty, which is an effort no matter when you do it. The optional area, Battle Mountain, is even tougher for it, as the enemies level up with you, so you have to rely on strategy (and maybe some stat boosting items) to win. Still, every group of enemies is unique in structure, and the difficulty ramps up well, a very well designed curve for the game. There is some backtracking as you gain new items, to collect old stuff, but you don't feel too put upon to do so.\n\nOverall, I highly reccomend this game if you like a good turn based RPG that requires you to think about how to handle each encounter, without getting into a mindless slog through weak enemies.","September 6, 2015","true","31.7"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","0"

I Am so addicted.\n\nHow this game was created, was so thoughtful to details in the terms of gameplay. From witty dialog that pops up but does not get in your face, the excellent setup of the battle system, puzzles, loads of achievements to keep a player occupied, to even the collectable elements. The game is just so thoughfully pieced together.\n\nI Would recommend this game to anyone who loves the JRPG genre, and everyone else alike.","October 27, 2014","true","18.5"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","34","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigJibblies/recommended/265610/","BigJibblies","IIIStrife","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigJibblies/","206 products in account","First off, Yes, you can play this game on Kongregate or Newgrounds (or possibly Matt's DA), however the version you play will not be this one.\n\nIn other words, No, this isn't the same game you can play on the sites I previously mentioned.\n\nWhat you'll play is indeed an RPG akin to the old days of Final Fantasy, when Combat wasn't real-time combat with before-use cooldowns.\n\nTo those unfamiliar with the Epic Battle Fantasy series (namely the ones with actual story elements) This is an RPG game with tons of funny things here and there, self-referencing humor, and things that reference alot of other things.\n\nSo basically the story so far is there's 3 heroes.\nOne is Matt, who jsut wants food, like swords and piracy... He's also a pirate.. Did I mention he has a guitar and likes Death Metal? I jsut did, you're welcome, reason 1 to buy this game.\nThere's Natalie, whose powers are in her awe-inspiring magical powers, witty remarks, different mindset of the others, and her boobs. No seriously she's kinda the "Big boobed girl cliche" of the series, though she's hilariously not jsut eye candy,  dishing out the sage advice and owning remarks. But even more seriously she's literally the only one who can decently heal and revive party members. She's kinda the most important character combat-wise.\nThere's Lance who is a military guy.\nIn a world filled with big demons (like the last villain you kill in #3), sapient cats with no limbs able to wield weapons via unexplained telepathy powers, elementals, magic, Lance is the one who kills things with overwhelming firepower. Seriously though, he melts those who are weak to bomb-type attacks and even has decent fire and electric attacks.\n\nThere's a 4th character, a huntress druid girl for Natalie to relate to.\n\nThis game also has achievements alongside the medals of the game, giving you elevated bragging rights.\n\nYour progress on this version won't be wiped by clearing your cache or cookies.\n\nThere's what I call a Shamievement, an achievement that's more or less a badge of shame like Duke Nukem Forever's Turd Burglar. You'll be rewarded for being a perv by this, though it really could be worse, so in terms of them, it's really not bad.\n\nHere's the part you care about though... The exclusive content.\n\nThis version has more weapons, and more items in general, save for crafting materials (i think) and this game has an entire area called Challenge Mountain. This area is literally filled with enemy encounters which all have 8 enemy encounters each and stronger versions of the bosses in the game which are WAY harder to kill.\nEvery enemy in thise area scales with level, which means you can get past all enemies at level 1, though you do need quest items like the axe or battery to get past some bits.\n\nHow does this game fare? Well for someone who played the first half 3 times on Kongregate, I can say the game fares really awesomely. I mean... never did I once say "Oh god not this part again" or the infamous "Why can't I just skip this" and I'm one of many who found Diablo 2 monotonous after Normal difficulty.\n\nThis game is very fun, has some funny elements and even gets challenging properly without feeling unfair. This game doesn't have any difficulty spikes... until the final area, but around then you're ready for it. This game is simply a blast, the only thing stopping me from playing it is just the simple fact I'm feeling a bit bored of RPGs in general.\n\nAlongside such big titles like Final Fantasy, Diablo, Torchlight, and even anything else you could really think of, this game holds it's own ground. The game is honestly fairly unique in my opinion.\n\nThis game in my books gets a 7/10. It's pretty good honestly, and I'd easily recommend it to anyone who likes Turn-Based games and RPGs, Despite the fact you can play the game on Kongregate with 30% less content for free.","August 13, 2014","true","49.0"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","0"

So much, it was worth buying Kreds to purchase the bonuses. So if this game runs on Kongregate, you are right: this game is Flash-based. Yeah, Flash games have a bad rep on Steam, but this one cuts that, the cake, AND adds icing on the cake, making it a great RPG to play on Steam.\n\nWhat I have loved has, and always will be, the music (http://halcyonicfalconx.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-epic-battle-fantasy-iv). The $12 is worth it, believe me. Favorite track is 'Elfin': makes PERFECT battle music, comparable to many of the SquareEnix jRPGs out there. It's heard once you reach the cavern entrance. For those who have complained about this being a paid game over the free Kongregate version, this comes WITH the OST, located within the install folder.\n\nThis version is Steam Cloud-enabled, so a long-awaited feature, cloud saves, exist finally. Saves will be created in the install folder under .meow's (very funny, Matt...). This one feature has the advantage over the Kongregate version.\n\n...Or maybe it's because I have had this fondness for Natalie, the red-hair, blue-eyed beauty who has this skill named Genesis. You tell me what the creator had in mind, given my username and avatar...\n\nI say BUY THIS!!!","March 1, 2014","true","32.7"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

Its just not so serious like many other RPGs out there.\n\nMy favorite part of the game was the turn-based combat system, along the lines of Final Fantasy, Grandia. etc... But instead of getting new/better weapons, you are provided with a selection of many different weapons with different elements. You really have to think before entering a fight to choose the right elements. At around 25 hours, it's a pretty long game and you can get even more out of it with the boss rush and endless monster encounters.\n\nTry out the flash game on kongregate.com and decide for yourself if you're unsure.

I used to play games from Miniclip and other websites that provide flash games, but for some reason I didn't came across this one. Boy did I missed out. In case you couldn't tell, its a turn-based RPG. It has funny jokes, fourth-wall breaking and references to other games all over the place.\n\nLike every RPG, you go around killing enemies to get materials to upgrade equipment, doing quest and side-quest and buy stuff from shops, you know the usual stuff. And thats what makes this game great. Its a very nostalgic feeling of how a RPG should feel, but they removed one key mechanic that made this game even better.\n\nNO. GRINDING.\n\nItem drops from enemies for upgrades can be bought from shops so you can grind or if u have gold u can just buy it from the shops. This made me so happy to see because so many games rely on grinding to extend the gameplay which is extremely tedious.\n\nThe characters are great, the music can be better (tho i usually play the game with the music and sfx muted cuz i can play while doing something else) and the achievements are challenging and fun.\n\nRPGs lovers have no reason to not get this.

Is it worth twelve bucks? I really don't think so, but its frequently on sale - and it is worth something. It is quite fun and addicting, if not a bit repetitive. I feel it suffers from a quantity-over-quality aspect where there are metric tons of items and crafting recipes, but its all just 'stuff'. Like, I don't care about the loot items, only when I can upgrade my sword. That kind of thing.\n\nEssentially, you grind through enemies over and over. You get loot, you upgrade, you grind more. It is addicting, and the animations and music are all great. While the humor really shines, the story is quite forgettable IMO.\n\nPros:\n+Fun classic RPG that gets a lot right\n+Great animations and music\n+Great humor (wayyyy better than UnderTale IMO)\n+User interface is pretty well done\n\nCons:\n-Storyline is meh\n-Tons of items, but who cares what they are - only if they can be a 'part' to craft that new sword (this is hard to explain)\n-Very grindy; you just grind enemies the whole time\n-Probably not worth full price IMO\n\nI've enjoyed my time in it so far, and will likely finish it.

So don't make it a political thing, it's not.\n\nSecondly, while it's true you can play this for free on Kongregate, the Steam version (like Kong premium version) adds extra features (including new game plus), an entire new zone with bosses on illegal stimulants, supports more resolutions and you get the entire soundtrack, which is, might I say, really, really good.\n\nNow with the disclaimers done and over with, let's get to the actual game.\n\nIt looks old school and cartoony, with turn based combat in which you slash, hack, blast and nuke your way through loads upon loads of critters, ranging from cute bushes (never thought I'd use that phrase seriously) to intimidating elementals. Elemental strength/weaknes system is in play, and there's plenty of elements and status effects to play around with. There's a lot of room for experimentation with gear and skills, and even bosses can be beaten through different approaches.\n\nThe soundtrack, as I said already, is AWESOME. No really. Just listen to it and appreciate it. It does a lot to round up the game experience. HFX has done an awesome job yet again (the only kind of job she ever does it seems).\n\nIt's not a hardcore RPG, even if it offers its challenges, but that makes it no less fun. Just a word of warning: If you decide to play this, better wear a helmet, because those shards of the fourth wall are going to be a-flyin' all over the place.","December 20, 2014","true","101.6"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","28","41","2","0"

It almost stopped me from playing, but i regretfully have to say that this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Everytime i went further in it, it surprised me again with its interesting abilities, good puzzles, and well balanced combat [at least if you play on the highest difficulty, the lower ones are way too easy]. The game lives up to its statements of being influenced by the likes of Golden Sun and Final fantasy, which is amazing since i havent seen a good rpg like golden sun in a very long time.\n\nIts fun, easy to understand, well balanced for good fun exploration, while not throwing in too much irrelevant sidequesting [which is the bane of many games].

There's a large equipment pool and a good variety of enemies. It's technical enough to be fun without dubming too much down. Proper preparation prior to battle can mean the difference between a 20-second battle and a 1-minute battle.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, the game is not very hard. The endless battles, monster marathons, and boss rush modes can provide a mild challenge if you play on Epic difficulty.\n\nAchievement-wise, there are some very simple achievements along with your standard beat-the-game achievements. There's also ones designed for hilarity (click on Natz' bewbs and touch the chicken)! You can tell the person who designed the game has a good sense of humor. The only thing I didn't like is how tedious the game felt while going through the 3rd playthrough. Since I am an achievement hunter, I felt compelled to 100% the game and trek on through playthrough #3 in order to get one of my last few achievements. One thing that I felt could have been done better is some variety when it comes to consequent playthroughs. I found myself picking up chests which served no purpose because it gave equipment I already had. If anything, those chests you've opened on older playthroughs should have something else.\n\nI recommend this game to turn-based RPG fans. It's a good deal and provides 10-15 hours of fun on each playthrough if you casually go through the content.","February 27, 2015","true","60.8"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","24","35","0","0"

Seeing it released on Steam and buying it on the early release got me going with hours of gameplay.\n\nEither way, it is different from the Flash Version, with Extra content and New Game+ and New Game++. Extra Content includes such as the Battle Mountain area which requires more of a strategic approach than the grinding approach. New weapons and armor to help customize to whatever best fitting for you through gameplay challenges.\n\nDifficulty-wise, you can change the difficulty at any time necessary (although, one should be playing on Epic Difficulty); for those who need a challenge or are having trouble with a slime. You should be using strategies you know.\n\nGameplay-time, you can expect to look forward to of around 25 hours to 30 hours of gameplay for your first playthrough (and running on Epic Difficulty while gathering a majority of what you can).\n\nIt provides references to other material while adding its own hint of humor.\n\nIf you're still on the line of buying it or not, consider trying the Flash version for a few moments. If you do enjoy it and wish to support the creator, Matt (and HFX), then you may buy it as so. If you have travelled quite a long distance in the adventure, there is a way to transfer the saves from Flash to Steam.\n\nOverall, if you like turn-based jRPGs with wonderful quality graphics and a different plot than most, I'd recommend it.","March 1, 2014","true","84.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Matt "Kupo" Rozsak made his debut with a stupid ♥♥♥ fighting game where you pressed SPACE before the ai opponent. it had some nice artwork and it was well made for someone working on his own, but it lacked...everything else. Kupo's next game was something far, far better.The first Epic Battle Fantasy game.\n\n5 years or so later he is STILL working on his own and produeced a game of a godlike calibre.  EBF4 was available (as were Matt's other titles) for free on Kongregate, Newgrounds, Armorgame etc for a while, but people where saying EBF3 was so good they'd pay money for it. One installment later, the Epic Battle Fantasy series had a big enough following that 3 or 4 months after the release Kupo decided to put it on steams greenlight, and so it was lit.\n\nKupo had already programmed an expansion pack for ebf4, so obviously that is included in this version. Some minor changes are the inclusion of grey text that appears when an attack isn't very effective, and putting some new mini-bosses in some places. However, one MASSIVE expansion is that of Battle Mountain. Battle Mountain is a gauntlet, essentially. You fight your way up from the base of the mountain to the top, along the way finding the bosses from the main storyline have returned wit a few...slight twists, aswell as the inclusion of the Dark Players should you get far enough in, which are evil version of the characters you play as, mentioned to be the hardest bosses in the game by Kupo himself.\n\nEBF4 is an rpg, plain and simply. as the ladder part of the name reveals, it's taken inspiration from classics such as Final Fantasy among other popular stratagy games and rpgs. in this game you take control of 4 characters on you mission to smite god herself (yes, herself) before she can do the same to you and all the other living beings on the planet.\n\nThe characters you control:\n\n-Matt: Self-inserted pirate-swordsman, Matt Uses almost exclusively physical, single-target attacks which typically don't give enemies statis ailments unless the equipped sword does so.Completely destroys Bosses and has the strongest Limit Break attack in the game (Even stronger than most enemies attacks i'd say) known as "Cleaver", doing 700 Base power(x5) damage without buffs. (The second strongest Limit Break does 550 base power). He also has an ability known as "Revenge" that deals more damage the more total-team health is missing (mostly accounting for his, but if an ally is dead the damage is boosted) making him able to shred through anything aslong as he doesn't die (obviously).\n\n-Natalie: The Healer-mage with huge ♥♥♥♥, Best used as a healer, but can pull her own weight using exclusively ranged-magical attacks, having the widest move pool she's easy to expiremet with and see whether battle-mage or healer is best suited for your stratagy. For Healer, she has the only ability in the game to heal all party members at once, (without summons) and can set up combos by boosting magic attacks of allies and weakening enemies defenses. As a battle-mage, she has the usual fire-ice-electric-boom setup, but also is able to use attacks like "Spectrum" which deals damage and inflicts statuses based on  your currently-equipped staff. Natalie also brings a devestating holy attack know as "Judgement" and it's opposite, a darkness attack "Pulsar" to make quick work of anything of the opposite element.\n\n-Lance: Gun enthusiast and soldier of an unknown army (maybe) -Uses a mixture of Magical and physical attacks, Easily the most powerful against non-boss enemies.He can unload an entire mag of his freakin' awesome gunblade or maybe call in an airstrike, whatever way he takes enemies out, it's always flashy. Lance is able to fire lazers from space, so clearly he is my favorite to play. Easily his most devastating attack is Hyper Beam, where it requires one turn to charge, then, in the the next 3 turns you may fire it, It hits everyone for massive magical damage and reflects the elemental typing of your weapon. Facing five fire enemies at once? Switch to the water cannon and shoop-da-woop their asses out of existence. Awesome.\n\n- Anna: Nature's ♥♥♥♥♥- personally my least favorite, good for inflcting status effects with her Arrow Rain ability, and she also attacks with a mixture of physical and magical damage, leaning more towards physical. She can also learn healing spells so Natalie doesn't have to do all of it, but none of her abilities heal more than one person, to make up for that she gives healed player "Blessed" status, preventing them from being inflicted with status effects. She's the weakest in terms of strength and I find she's only good as a support to set up combos.\n\nThe only negative things about this game-\n1) It's not kind to the uninformed. Not knowing that you're supposed to summon the ScanBot to get information on your enemies' weaknesses and resistences can be devastating during fights. Also, not knowing which skills to get on whom, how to spread your stat boosting items, and other essential things to survival are not taught to you. I suggest playing EBF1 or 2 before attempting this game.\n2) Epic mode is honesty TOO hard. in the older games Epic mode made enemies 40% stronger and gave them new moves. In this game, it makes them 100% harder, and start the battle afflicted with a status they are 200% resistent to (IE- Poison heals instead of damages). This makes the game boring as you are constantly buffing yourself and charging attacks and setting up to do the most damage possible to a level 3 slime because if you don't it will kil you by brushing up against your knees too swiftly.\n3) Items essental to the area you're in being given to you 2 areas ahead. This happens surprisingly often. I recall getting my ♥♥♥ kicked by some ice enemies only to find a staff boosting ice defense and strengthening fire attacks in the next area.\n\nNumber 3 is a personal problem, but 1 and 2 should be headed if you are not a veteran to the RPG style of play. Other than that and a few minor complaints I have about the distribution of critical items, I have no real complaints.\n\nIf you're not in to RPGs, this game may not be for you, as there is little in the way of minigames. If you do not like to spend time micromanaging every bit of equipment, play on normal, if you are used to RPGs in general, play on hard, if you have played through ebf4 prior, play on epic if you choose. The only reason to play on easy is if the Dark Players are making you rage and you just want to kill them already after your 40th attempt...in other words, easy is too easy\n\nTip- Use scanbot during your first move against the enemies, then run away. The flee command never fails, you can use this to get infromation on a new enemy before a fight and allow you not to waste a turn at the beginning of a fight by calling for scan bot after you enter it for the second time.\n\nMeaningless and totally bias score: 10/10 as RPGs go. This is easily my favorite of the RPG genre and I encourage anyone to atleast play the free version if you are a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nAlso, I did say he was working alone, but that's not entirely true, He also Had the help of HFX who handled the music, and was given some additional designs by various fans (listed in the credits).\n\nI salute you, Kupo, You've come a long way since EBF1.","March 8, 2014","true","26.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

It's an "old-school inspired", JRPG-esque game but it's also heavily Western in styling...I know that's a strange sentance but this is a strange game.  The characters and dialogue are cheeky, fun, and likable, and the animations are well done and seem powerful.  The music is pretty good (although repetitive) and there are almost too many collectable and upgradable weapons, skills, and summons to digest at once.\n\nEven with all that said, while playing this game I strangely felt like there wasn't all that much compelling me to keep going.  I got a few hours enjoyment out of it so I don't necessarily regret the purchase but it just wasn't a gripping title by any means.  It's really a glorified web/flash game with a few perks that it picked up when it moved to Steam.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 isn't bad per se, but I don't think I would recommend it to other gamers.  That said, if it looks interesting, I'd recommend playing it for free in its original medium - a web flash game:\n\nhttp://www.kongregate.com/games/kupo707/epic-battle-fantasy-4\n\nIf you like it and/or want to purchase it to support the developer please go ahead, the game works flawlessly as a desktop title and the port from web to client went very smoothly.\n\nAll in all I'd give it a 6/10 - and I would recommend once again that interested parties check out the web version before purchasing.  The game shows potential, but really it seems to be trying to pull off what Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death VII achieve much more gracefully.  However, the production value and syling of Epic Battle Fantasy seems of higher quality than the other two titles I listed, so if the author can make a few tweaks I see bright things for the future of this series.","July 4, 2014","false","3.1"," 165 of 298 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","165","298","2","0"

Take right now for example, you're probably not just reading this review. If I had to guess, you're also eating lunch, catching up on your netflix backlog, listening to music, and browsing your favorite p... nevermind. Some jokes are just too easy to make, and that's no fun.\n\nThe point is, we're living in a time where all of our eyes, ears, and limbs have to be used at their maximum efficiency. On its own, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a solid little RPG. While its threadbare plot and meme-filled writing won't win any awards; there is a certain je ne sais quoi about the adventure. This might be attributed to the fact that boss-monsters tend to guard items that assist in exploration. The first boss guards an axe, which can be used to cut down all of the trees you might have passed by earlier. This is a linear game, but there's always an incentive to go back and collect treasure you couldn't reach before.\n\nEBF4 employs a lot of ideas specifically designed to keep gamers playing as long as possible. Alongside traditional avenues such as gaining experience, you also strengthen party-members by collecting materials and upgrading their equipment. Practically every weapon and armor has an element tied to it, and if you're playing on the hardest difficulty, you'll want to take full advantage of elemental strengths and weaknesses. To really get the advantage, you'll want to explore and obtain all of the rare stat-boosting foods as well. Since this RPG offers New Game+, which begins directly after the defeat of the final boss, you may find yourself caught in the cycle. This all-too familiar hamster wheel promises opportunities to make your party-members even stronger, and see those lovely stats & numbers get really, really high.\n\nUnless you're playing on the harder difficulties, EBF4 works quite well as a "second-window" game. While you're playing this decent little RPG, you can watch some videos, read a book, or do whatever else. There are a few charming cut-scenes over the course of this game that will draw your attention and remind you of what's currently going on. Otherwise your mind is free to wander onto other topics as you lead the heroes through the motions: Kill monsters, collect treasure, upgrade loot, etc.\n\nOne thing I have to nitpick about is how enemy waves are handled. Most battles tend to involve multiple parties of monsters. When you destroy the first set, another set will take its place. This is all well and good, but I have a complaint. If the last enemy in one wave is killed with a counter-attack, the next wave that appears will get a free turn. I figure that this is because it's still considered the "enemy's turn", but it's pretty annoying when it happens. Some of the references and dialogue are also dated and uber-cringe, but it's not that big of a deal. I mean, some of the lines are just plain dumb, but I've already forgotten most of them. Of course it helps that while I played this game I was reading Three Kingdoms.\n\nWith a game like Epic Battle Fantasy 4, there's only so much to talk about. Either you're 100% behind the idea of leading a plucky group of adventurers in the pursuit of higher numbers, or you just want something to busy yourself while watching four twitch.tv streams at once. For what it is, this is a fine RPG, just don't set your expectations too high.","May 15","true","22.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/recommended/265610/","PhyreMatrix","PhyreMatrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/","941 products in account","I've been playing this game for the past 2 weeks and absolutely love it. At first I thought it might be one of those parody/homage to old RPGs but while this game doesn't do anything revolutionary with the turn based formula it does present an interesting challenge without any of the annoyances of past well known games.\n\nFirst thing you should know that it does contain a lot of references from old school games like Final Fantasy to Pokemon to some less obvious. That doesn't mean this game isn't original. It's got a light hearted story and a charming cast of characters. There are a few references of previous Epic Battle Fantasy games that might be lost on you but they happen more so for comedic effect and doesn't hinder understanding the story whatsoever.\n\nI think what really makes this game enjoyable is the battle system. There's a few notable improvements on the old turn based formula that make fighting more strategic and less of a chore:\n\n1. You are able to change equipment and characters on the fly - In the middle of a battle you aren't bound to the 3 characters and if you're not quite properly equipped to handle the foes you're battling you can easily swap out equipment during your turn. Characters in reserve also recover HP/MP each turn so it makes things slightly easier.\n\n2. Elements and status effects play a prominent role in fights - This adds a bit of challenge. Generally there's 10 elemental resistances and another dozen status effects. Instead of always equipping the stronger weapon / armor you'll find yourself adjusting to weapons of different elements for maximum damage and defense. I find this particularly nice and adds a bit of strategy because depending on the foes you're going to be changing equipment a lot.\n\n3. Limits / Summons - Will do wonders if you know when to use them. You could opt for a blind challenge in which you don't know any of your enemies' weaknesses but, if you're not into blindly hitting anything that moves you'll end up scanning foes a lot to learn what makes them tick. Unlike most RPGs the scan feature in this game is super useful. It also helps that the scanned information is readily available after you scan each foe. It doesn't just disappear for it to be forgotten and spam attacks anyway.\n\n4. Upgrades - You keep all your equipment so it helps that you can use various items to improve weapon resistance and deal added damage.\n\nWhile I do enjoy playing most games with a controller I found using my mouse extremely simple to move, access menus  and fight. Also the environments are vibrant and fresh so you don't get bored too quickly. The side quest Battle Mountain and varying difficulty levels are available for those who love a challenge. There's also 100+ achievements for the would be hunters to come back and 100% this game. I've only been on my first playthrough but I don't think replayability is high but for the price you have a decent 20hr minimum game on your hands.

(read in forum how to do this)\nit's pretty damn entertaining, the game makes jokes on itself and the dialog, both in battle and out, can be fun to read.\nbut, damned if your first encounter with "God Cat" won't catch you off guard, and it'll quickly remind you why this game is called EPIC battle fantasy!!\n\nTHERE'S ALSO A FREE VERSION ON KONGREGATE.COM, NEWGROUNDS.COM AND ARMORGAMES.COM\ntry that first, this one's an UPGRADED version with all the additional content included!!\nfor those wondering why buy the steam game over the free browser one:\n-second and third quests included (premium only on browser game)\n-higher graphics, and sound quality (1280x800, and fullscreen)\n-Battle Mountain area which holds the "premium" items from the browser game.\n-cloud saves through steam, if you realize how easily you can lose your browser game data, this is IMPORTANT!!\n-26 track soundtrack included with the game!!","March 10, 2014","true","69.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","2"

It pokes fun at a lot of classic console RPGs, but the real heat of the game is the way they combined what made so many other games so memorable.\n\nThe game is a simplistic true turn based RPG on the outside, but stesses a depth of strategy with a wide variety of equipment and monsters that have elemental strengths and weaknesses.  There isn't a single weapon or piece of armor in the game that is optimal for each and every battle (there are some that come close to defying this though).  You strenthen your weapons and armor through a basic crafting system that requires a hunt of scarce materials, but offers an item shop near the end of the game where you can buy the materials you might need at a hefty cash price.  There is even a achievement for poking...  Uh...  Nevermind.  The storyline and plot is pretty flimsy, but on the flip side, there isn't a need to grind to complete the game.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys console RPGs of the 90s, even if they didn't grow up in the 90s.  There isn't any need to play the earlier iterations of the games to keep up with the jokes.","January 1, 2015","true","42.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

Epic difficulty is very difficult and rewarding at the same time. There are some difficult puzzles. Late game (on epic) has some 30-60minute+ fights which are all or nothing - very tense, and very rewarding. Because of the way skills work there are some which you have to choose which character to take them on - i.e. revive which is only way besides using an item to actually revive a dead ally (which is pretty important since most attacks in the second half of the game are one shots).\n\nThis remains one of the funniest, deep, and difficult games I have played ever. And if you are complaining about getting RNGed all the time - it's the kind of strategy which is beatable in all situations if you play it perfectly. The difficulty comes in devising a game plan and equipping the right items (which all do different things like random buffs). There are also multiple ways to build your party which can all work - a lot of people have Natz as a full carry mage for example, but she is on healer duty for me :)\n\nThe only bad part of this game is the first boss where you have limited options because you have no skills yet :A","December 24, 2014","true","89.5"," 27 of 46 people (59%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","59","27","46","33","2"

Here's a more in depth analysis.\n\nFirst up, I love the inventory.  You can hold every item in the game but there is no problems with clutter.  You never have to worry about a full inventory or wonder if you should sell an item you may need later on.  Huge time saver, I hate managing inventory.\n\nAbilities are chosen with experience points.  There are skills and specials.  Skills are character specific, like the fighter gets sword skills, the ranger gets bow skills.  Specials can potentially be learned by 2-4 characters but only one of them can actually learn it.  For example the skill "power metal" can be learned by either of the guys but not both of the guys.  Limit breaks (yes there are limit breaks) fall into one of these two categories as well.  So there's some careful balancing to make sure your party functions well.\n\nEquipment is easy to manage and you will be needing to switch weapons/armor/trinkets from time to time to deal with various types of enemies.  Your mage wont be needing that fire damage staff against fire elementals, for example.  Equipment can be changed during combat at the cost of a turn in case you get caught by something unexpected.  Certain fights you'll be changing gear more then once as different enemies appear.\n\nEquipment can all be upgraded through crafting.  Not the sort of annoying crafting where you have to sort through tons of crap and figure out just how much rough stone you need to make enough widgets to make 20 springs.  Basically you open the upgrade menu, things that can be upgraded with your current mats are highlighted, things that can't are not.  It cuts the crap and simply boils it down to the desicion of, is this where you'd like to spend these materials?  Most of the items I was using were maxed by the end of the game with no particular effort to farm or buy materials.  2-3 weapons per char, 1-2 armors, 1-2 helmets, and a whole whack of trinkets.\n\nThe real meat of the combat boils down to resistances and damage types.  8 types of elemental damage and 8 debuffs, all with their own counterpart resist stat.  Fortunatley you don't have to memorize 16 stats for every enemy type.  When an enemy typs is scanned with your scanbot, you can hover over them to check their stats at any time for the rest of the game.\n\nThere are also summons, as you'd expect from a final fantasy game, however they are not spammable in this.  You get summoning points for each kill depending on monster strength and use the summoning points to ... summon.\n\nOne thing that always bothered me about Final fantasy and Chrono Trigger was how end game tended to revolve around spamming your biggest AoE, a lot.  It looked like this game was heading that direction in the mid game, but toward the end that was just not possible.  Mixed immunities ensures you aren't just spamming a single AoE forever.  This game really took all the good out of final fantasy and boiled away a lot of the crap.  8.5/10","July 6, 2014","true","19.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The art style is very easy to look at and is one of those styles that will never look old. The animation effects during battles are all awesome to look at. The sounds make every hit and effect seem very powerful. It's not something easy to explain, until you experience it for yourself.\n\nAs the title of this game says, the main focus is on the epic battles throughout the game. Lots of care and attention to detail has been put into the battle system. Gone are the random encounters from outdated RPGs. You see every enemy on the screen now and can choose whether to fight it or not. As soon as you touch an enemy, the battle instantly loads. No more waiting around for loading times.\n\nThe combat system has so much depth. There are *a lot* of different strategies you can use to fight enemies in this game. Different equipment, elemental effects/resistances, skills, crafting and items are all very important in taking down enemies. The boss battles are very epic and will challenge you to see if you have been learning how to play efficiently. You will spend a lot of time figuring out what equipment and skills to use for taking down a boss.\n\nPostgame has the optional Battle Mountain area. Always thought it would be a great idea if RPGs would include a way to fight every enemy in the game during some marathon battles? Welcome to Battle Mountain. Where all normal encounters, minibosses and bosses are thrown into some very difficult battles to test just how good at this game you truely are. Not to mention the extremely difficult new enemies created for that section of the game.\n\nLove collecting achievements in games? This game has over 100 Medals/Achievements waiting to be unlocked. The music is some of the best I have ever heard in a game. You will definately find at least a few songs that you think are amazing. It fits every area and encounter so perfectly. There is also a New Game + mode where you can carry over all your equipment and skills. Enemies will level up and everything will be even more difficult this time around.\n\nThere are so many things this game did right for an RPG. You are truely missing out on a great RPG, if you don't give this a try.\n\nYou will spend around 50 hours trying to complete it.","March 15, 2014","true","179.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The items are great, the gameplay is easy to understand, and the character interaction is hilarious.\n\nEach weapon/attack/item has it's pluses and minuses. What may be great for one battle may be awful for another. This is nice because you actually need to pay attention to equips, not just get "the one armor set." You actually have to use your brain a little bit to play, but not so much that it's exahausting (for example, you wouldn't go into a battle with light creatures wearing only darkness armor, you'd be screwed).\n\nIn terms of gameplay, you can switch between using your mouse or your keyboard, an option that other games lack. Also, in terms of battles, you have plenty of time to think and do what you need. While some may like time-constraints, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 provides for a more stress-free type gameplay. All your abilities and options are easy to navigate to, and thus far I have not run into a single glitch.\n\nThe characters are great. That's something that could be said about this entire franchise, but especially this and EBF3. There is so much interaction between the characters, enemies, and the environment. Battle after battle can get boring, but the witty dialogue balances this out nicely.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is perfect for those looking for a relaxed RPG experience: no time-constraints or reflex-speed battles, vibrant colors that don't strain your eyes, and lots of easter eggs from Minecraft, Pokémon, and more just in case the fantastic characters didn't already have you hooked.","August 3, 2014","true","30.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

YES.\nWorth your money? Yes. definately!\n\nIn this game, you control Anna, a ranger whom ends up tracking down the team of Epic Battle fantasy 3 on the accusation of them having stolen the gem of her village. You end up going on an epic adventure with them, going through adorable settings all over. The game is beautful with hand drawn settings that have tons of love in them, making every single area feel likable, even if it's not your favorite!\n\nYou'll be playing with a total of 4 characters, having 1 of them on backup in case your main team falls, and for me that meant that the person on back-up often ended up being forgotten in regards to stat boosting items and equipment upgrades, but that's how i like to play the game. The person in back-up gets XP just like everyone else in battle, as long as they are alive at the end of the battle. Switching someone out with the back-up is smooth and seamless at the single press of the button, and if you regret it you can always switch right back. The battles move at your own pace, as the enemies cannot take their turn until you are done with yours, making the game move however you want it, wether you wanna go fast and spam your strongest move or if you carefully want to plan out the next upcoming turns.\n\nThe game thrives on it's exploration, the humor and hidden references (which unfortunately had to be partially censored at least by name in order to avoid legal issues as far as i'm aware), but most importantly the music. Oh man, the music is great! It's often high tempo, but it calms down when it needs to, and it does a fantastic job att setting the mood for the current situation, which is really the only thing you'd truly want out of music for an RPG game.\nThe game also features a bit of puzzle solving and NPC quests (most of which are fetching quests where you give them crafting items of different kinds) but if that's not your slice of cake, it's not a problem because the quests are entirely optional as far as i know, and the puzzle solving, while mandatory in some parts, is never so difficult that you feel like you want to take a break because the puzzle is just difficult.\n\nNow, there is a free to play version available on the web, both on Matt's own website aswell as several different gaming websites, but there are a couple of differences. Mainly, on the premium versions on the gaming websites as well as the steam edition, you can access an area called Battle mountain, which features tons of bonus equipment, items, skills, summons and more. But most importantly, it features some very heavy challenges, ones that will have even the best of players on the edge of their seats as they lose over and over, slowly making progress towards that sweet goal, giving you a dark souls feeling of success when you finally complete the ordeal! That takes me to the difficulty of this game!\n\nOverall, this game isn't particularily hard in many ways. The puzzles aren't extremely complex for the most part, the battles shouldn't give you that much trouble, and there's plenty of oppurtunity to heal yourself in between battles (one of which is just to stand around, as you do have natural regeneration on both MP and HP), but here's the fun part.\nOn the options menu, you can instantly switch between the 4 different difficulties at any point on the world map, and since the battles are all actively triggered along with fleeing being 100% reliable, you can customize the experience according to how you like to play your games!\nIf you want to play through the game having a chill time, you could just cruise through on easy.\nIf you want to play through the game having a TOUGH time, you should play on Epic, which is when the game itself becomes so incredibly difficult at some parts that you might have to end up fleeing a battle, changing your entire equipment loadout and then trying again. However, if you feel that a battle is at any point TOO difficult for you, it's always possible to simply flee and turn the difficulty down.\n\nAs for equipment, there is a ton of variation in everything from weapons to armor and accessories.\nEvery character has their own type of weapons, and every type of weapon comes in a varied and unique form, ranging from a gun made of marble in the shape of a fist that will smite undead foes and steal health based on how much damage you do to a bow that will inflict random status ailments on each hit to a staff that is a literal incarnation of deaths' scythe, you'll find your favorite to use pretty quickly. However, even if you find the number one weapon you prefer, almost never will weapons feel obselete as enemies come in a ton of different elements and forms, and weapons almost always carry with them a special element, so ultimately, it comes down to deciding wether you want a weapon for its stats or if you want it because of the special effects it triggers. A lot of different equipment trigger special events before your turn starts, such as a random attack triggering before you get to act, or maybe a random positive buff on your character.\nThe armor is divided into two groups, one with male armor and one with female armor, since there's 2 of each in the game. This is nice as upgrading one set of armor could potentially benefit both of the specified users, however i feel this is also a slight drawback as if one armor set is used by one character, the other one has to use a different once, which can lead to trouble sometimes if you are for example looking for specific elemental resistances and you only own 1 armor piece which protects against it, as you'd then have to choose which one would be allowed to equip it.\n\nFurthermore, accessories are shared across all your characters, and they come in the form of small badges, and while the effect more often than not isn't extremely impactful, it's nice to get small additional bonuses from time to time.\n\nOverall, this game is alot of fun, any fans of RPG games or JRPGs will most likely instantly love this game, and for people that aren't into RPG's yet but are looking for somewhere to start, this would make a great candidate!\n\nRating for this game:\nVisuals: 9/10\nAudio: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10 (my only problem is that i wish there was some other way to control the battle menu besides the mouse :C)\n\nFinal grade: 9/10\n\nIf this game is on sale, do consider buying it, as it will 100% garanteed (by me) be worth it.\nAlso, you gotta give him some credit, it's a single (not relationship wise) guy doing so much work, by both drawing everything, programming everything and man, you KNOW there's been put some blood, sweat and tears into this game!\nI love it!","May 6","true","81.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The dialogue is not the best, but it is very light hearted and not intended for the overly serious.\n\nThe game it'self has a large amount of content, which will keep you occupied for hours upon hours. The story alone is 10+ hours, which is double what most "real" games have thse days. And that 10 hours is a lower esitimate, only if you are fast and don't go gear hunting etc.\n\nYou may see people complain that someone is daring to charge for a game you can play for free on New-grounds, Kongregate and Armour games.\n\nA couple of points against these naysayers.\n\nFirstly, you are paying to support a developer who already has this game and 3 others out for free (and others of differing genres, like bullet hell?) Don't wanna pay? you can play it for free, so how is that even a relevent complaint.\n\nBy paying for this game, you gain access to extra content, an awesome soundtrack (that I hear costs $12 by it's lonesome), which can be found in the install folder. And you support a developer who has devoted years of his life to creating such content to give to the world for free, think of it as a donation.\n\nGFX 8/10 - The overworld spriates are lacking, but have a certain charm to them. The in battle sprites are full of life and charm.\nMusic 10/10 - halcyonicfalconx never fails to deliver. http://halcyonicfalconx.new grounds.com/\nGameplay 8/10 - A good old classic turn based RPG strategy battle game. Nothing groundbreaking, but don't fix what isn't broke amiright?\nReplayablity 8/10 - Lot's of content, newgame+, battlemountain challenges, medals, achievments.\nOverall Rating 8.5/10 - Well worth playing, even if you arn't willing to buy it, go play it for free on Kongregate or New-grounds","February 27, 2014","true","14.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The game is pretty lighthearted and doesn't take itself too seriously. Large variety of items/gear to collect, skills to unlock and chose from, and monsters to encounter. On the higher difficulties, you have to make sure your party make-up is balanced as far as elements, as monsters all have various elements and status conditions that they are either strong or weak against. Combined with the possible synergies between gear and skills, it gives the combat system enough depth to have it not feel stale after a while.\n\nSome minor knocks include lack of widescreen support and lack of built-in controller support.

I played the older veriosn first and other minigames made by the same person (group now i think) and enjoyed them in my younger years.younger being important because you would find many things fun. i was hyped for this game and i am  overwhelmed with it, it delivered\n\n\nMeow,Meow, MEEEOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I mean come one  >:O Epic battle fantasy 4 on steam .This is where it belongs >:OOOOOO. Its a flash game but allllllllll that effort put into it is amazing .The art ,music everything and it all works. the combat may be turn based but once you have the swing of things  :D Its not a short game too which is awesome and with all that loot out there youre gonnna have a goood time. I played this on Kong yes the *free version*  ( DONT BUY IT ON STEAM ;=; this man is ripping you off)  yeah right >.>  only people who dont read say that ;ppppp so dont let that stop you from buying this epic game. Cause you have to buy that extra stuff online for more  so why are people saying this is a riff of if its a bit cheaper here >.> even if its the same price its still better on steam and why not support this dev , I mean look at the quality of the game and all the effort put in from this small team maybe even just the dev himslef has done plus no adds, no need to go on  armour games or anything like that . Its just epic battle fantasy and you till ya bored,which will take a very long time) . Another thing i like is how the dev uses fanart\nand even got one  of his enemies from the fanbase. How cool is that.\n\nStory 8/10 (yes there is a story)= Cats plotting to take over the world!!?? Now thats new.(wierd but it works alright,might need to understand ebf and is preious games to understand some jokes but it does eplain briefly)\nGameplay 10/10= its rurn based combat and it works like silk, you move around a the map from birdseye,play the free version because this can be an issue for some people.\nMusic 10/10= is Ammazing and everyplace has its own theme and combat mode themes adding atmosphere\nFun 9/10=depending on your difficulty, i play epic so there are some boss battles and even access to new areas when you just give up but do return.Ramping up the difficulty does provide and *Epic* challenge and it might seem undoable but with the skills and items you have Victory is always possible and for anyone whos into these types of games you will spend hours on this game.The homour is great among our characters who all have their own traits and since they are silent you can voice them in your own way.(Which can be extremely entertaining)\n\nThe free version itself is amazing anyway and thats all it took for me to throw my money at my screen when this came out. If you dont like this kind of rpg turn base stuff then maybe the anime refereneces will keep you going >.< if that does not maybe try the free version online and if you like it a lot  buy it and get all the extras here and share it with ya friends :DDD.\nim to excited for the future of Epic Battle Fantasy series as a whole.","February 27, 2014","true","32.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

Anyway…\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 is a turn-based RPG. This was not my entry into the series, I played this and its three predecessors over at Kongregate. Yes, that’s right, I played this Flash game for free on Kongregate. And beat it. Several separate times. And when it came out on Steam, I bought it, and beat again. Yeah, you can play a slightly less content version of this game for free if you want. But stay with me for a little longer as we get into this recommendation.\n\nI’m not going to deny the game is a little immature. I mean, “anime boobs” is right there on the Steam page. But I will say it’s not that horrible. The fan service isn’t really overbearing, nor is it even all that present. A comparison would be, if you watch anime that includes fan service, then this game has less. If you think most/all anime is horrible and incredibly juvenile, then you should probably pass on this game. Just putting that out there.\n\nThe game is lighthearted and doesn’t take itself seriously. NoLegs the cat has no legs (all the cats have no legs, actually), Matt is a big sword fan (in both meanings), etc.  Character dialogue (no voice acting) is humorous in a cheesy, silly way.\n\nLook, I bought this because I enjoyed the series, and wanted to support the developer. I do recommend getting this game on a sale. You want a demo? You don't want to buy it? Look it up online. Play it. You’ll miss out on a little bit of extra stuff. Whatever, I can’t stop you. Steam version does come with free soundtrack download though, and the soundtrack is pretty nice.\n","March 17","true","74.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you only have a laptop that's a few years old (like I do) you may need to turn down the settings a bit as there's a bit of lag. If you have a good computer, though, max it up. So, here's what you need to know about the game before you buy:\n\n1. It's a turn-based JRPG. Think Final Fantasy up to FFX and you'll get a good idea about what you're getting into.\n2. There is a story, though it's usually behind a lot of humor, including a bit of meta humor. If you want a game where there is a story, but with a lighthearted tone (for the most part), this should be good.\n3. Depending on how you play the game can be preeetty lengthy. It depends on whether you want to grind just enough to beat the bosses or grind A LOT and look around for any treasure.\n4. Lots of skills to learn and equipment to find, and all of them can change your appearance. It's a good way to mix and match the characters you get in terms of the roles you want them to have in combat.\n\n12 dollars is an alright price for what you get here (though it'd probably be smart to wait for a sale). If you're really stringy about if you want this game, though, you can play the first three EBF games (as well as a slightly stripped version of this one) for free on most flash game websites.","March 17","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's actually a really good time for fans of this sort of game, with game creation software in the hands of anyone who wants it, we have a lot of SNES style RPG games to choose from.  EBF4 really rises above the herd in many ways.\nThe graphics are pleasing and detailed, which is especially nice since the game has such a wide variety of gear.\nThere is a good variety of elemental damage and resistance in skills and gear, so that what you  wear can really change the outcome of a battle.  Along with that is the fact that you can always flee from battle and start it over, so you never have to find yourself in the awkward situation of being slaughtered by ice monsters because you wore your fancy fire armor that day.\nThe humor in EBF4 is self-aware and somewhat silly, without being over-the-top hey hey look at me arrow-knee pie-face lulz.

It's a totally solid JRPG-style game. It's easy and intuitive to play, well-written, and a great way to waste five minutes or five hours. It plays equally well in short bursts as it does long sessions.\n\nAbout the only criticisms that can be made are that the game can be a bit anime-fanboy-crude, with emphasis on fan service with breasts and scantily-clad females, but the actual characterizations of the female characters are well-done, so if you can look past the lewdness, it's really not bad in that regard. The other thing is some battles can get a bit long and repetitive. Most of the time, combat can be over quickly if you're paying attention to your elemental damage, but then sometimes you'll be up against an enemy that has a ton of health, and while the enemy doesn't pose a huge threat to you, it takes a long time to kill. Still, a few battles turning into a bit of a slog isn't that big an issue, either.\n\nOverall, it's funny and well-written and the gameplay is just an absolute charm. There are a lot of elements between the equips and elements and consumables and upgrading of items, but none of these elements are overly complex to the point where thye become annoying. It's easy to find almost any piece of information you want, and the gane doesn't penalize you too heavily for forgetting to attend to any of the ongoing tasks.\n\nA solid installment in a solid series, heartily recommended to anyone who enjoys RPGs, anime style, humor, or casual gaming experiences. Not that the game is overly casual, but it's so easy to learn, it's a great gateway into RPGs for the casual gamer.","November 10, 2015","true","22.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Battle mountain poses a challenge at any level, makeing the player use elemental weaknesses and strengths to their advantage without even knowing what they will have to use.\nthe art style is quirky (in a word) but still really good, the particle effects of the skills are something else completely, in a good way of course.\nall in all. i love this game (not to mention the creator and the artist) i'd reccomend it to anyone wanting to have some nostalgia in the turnbased combat system, as well as all the references to boot in the game.\n10/10 complete must buy, deffinately worth the moneys.","October 11, 2014","true","37.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

The combats are things you initiate, but the monsters are varied enough that equipment selection isn't as simple as "take ice weapons in fire place."\n\nA further point in its favor is that you don't have to waste any time with extended tutorial nonsense- straight to the gameplay with all the systems available pronto!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarinunit9/recommended/265610/","tarinunit9","TARINunit9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarinunit9/","70 products in account","Epic Battle Fantasy has always been one of my favorite parody series, which is itself one of my favorite genres. But unlike your average "take that, Final Fantasy!" mimicry affair, EBF stands on its own in every regard:\nColorful art design, imaginative enemies, and I can't think of an adjective for the writing that quite encapsulates the unique blend of self-depriciative humor. The protagonists have a "band of idiots" shtick that in any other parody would just come off as mean, but EBF manages to convey a genuine sense of chemistry, that these idiots have been working with and through each others' eccentricities. The humor really comes alive when EBF satirizes not just the genre but also its players, with Anna playing straight man to a trio of 4th-wall-breaking powergamers.\n\nIt wouldn't be a Japanese-style RPG without a story, and where the first three EBF games went for the "here is a villain go fight him" excuse to skip to the action, the fourth instalment has tried its hand at some actual worldbuilding this time, though at the cost of assuming players are familiar with the events of the third game. Returning party members Matt, Natz, and Lance are quickly discovering that the various save-the-world plots aren't as standalone and isolated as they assumed, and larger forces have been resetting their little pawns whie they were busy level grinding the Pickpocket skill.\n\nAs for gameplay, EBF is quickly recognizable to anyone who has ever touched a Square Enix RPG, and at the same time found its own way to keep the turn-based combat fresh. Not content with just elemental rock-paper-scisors, EBF ensures stats buffs and status effects/ailments are incredibly critical during the late game, but thankfully the player is slowly eased into it all. There's a great deal of customization, especially if you want to eek out every precious damage point from your foes, but if you feel that you're stopping too often to fiddle with menus the game leaves open the possibility of overleveling yourself (to a point). If you know what you're doing the game will be happy to throw you enough curveballs to keep yourself from feeling overpowered but never tries to make you entirely helpless either.\n\nThe only real thing to watch out for is possible slowdown. Might wanna check how your computer handles Flash, since that's what this game was originally built in, and large numbers of vector images, since that's what the original Flash engine rendered in. My other main complaint is that late-game bosses can be a bit of a slog if you aren't an absolute min-maxer, but in a way that's sort of the point.\n\nOverall, EBF4 is a happy, charming little affair from start to finish. Matt Roszak has stated that he made the series so he can see a game with everything he likes in it, and the level of love put into the product from start to finish really shows through. If you like swords, sorcery, slimes, and squishing the latter with the former, I recommend giving Epic Battle Fantasy a look; chances are there will be a lot you will like as well.","August 20, 2014","true","7.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Though it is just a little flash game, but the entire performance presented, in my opinion, has excelled many state-of-the-art RPGs of the same genre obviously. Lots of humorous conversation, elaborately designed combat system and funny character setting make it so different and outstanding. And most importantly, it catches the essence of what each RPG should has, that is, the capability to keep player involved for hours without feeling any bored. It no doubt does its job very well in this aspect.

What is this 3rd rate Flash game doing on Steam? I'm an achievementhunter (beginner) so I scrolled through the achievements. I saw an achievement about boobs. I was like: "Wait what? They got bewbs in this? Ok. You got my small brain's attention now." So I fired up the game and... what to say. I never saw the bewbies, BUT: I was rewarded with an easy yet intriguing old school battlesystem-RPG. The battle system reminds me of one of those RPG makler games, but the graphics are cute, the humor is excellent and the gameplay is fun. This game is for you if:\n\n-You like Old Scool RPGs\n-You like good humor on a family friendly basis... well most of it ;D\n-You like to bounce around boobies...\n-You like nyan cat\n-You like cute stuffs\n-You like to hunt desperately for pron where none is to be found because of a boobieachievement.\n-You played the pervious titles.\n-You play the Game on Kongeate/Newgrounds but despise the Ads.\n-You like a nice soundtrack.\n-You wanna see an actual GOOD flash-game selling on stem (yes this is flash, deal with it)\n-You can like achievementhunting.\n\nThings you might dislike even if one or more of the above points are positive for you:\n\n- Full screen mode only supports a few resolutions, game kinda stays in 4:3, you get a colored border which is much like black bars if you use 16:9 resolution.\n- 2D graphics\n- Artstyle might seem a little childish to you\n\nBY ALL MEANS: THIS IS A CHILDISH GAME WITH CHILDISH HUMOR, IF YOU LIKE THAT, BUY THE GAME! IT IS GREAT IN WHAT IT DOES!\n\nI like it. :D","May 14, 2014","true","75.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The Steam and Kongregate Premium versions have a pretty nifty sum of extras for the more devoted fans of the game to unlock as well. Plus, you get the soundtrack as an added bonus if you buy it here.

The character designs aren't exactly good... Okay, since these are both one-man projects, I'll at least say that it looks much better than Undertale.

This has a lot of advantages.\nIt pays respects to its elders but never tries to be lazy about anything. My main complaint? It's a very difficult game... If you want to 100% it, you'll suffer. A lot. Be prepared to spend tens of hours on it. I'll just be happy with at least two thirds of the achievements. If you don't mind not getting everything, then... I get it's doable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blakzer/recommended/265610/","blakzer","blakzer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blakzer/","76 products in account","Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an incredibly fun adventure roughly based off of games such as the early Final Fantasy games. As its title implies, there are also three entries before it... there are also two spin-offs. EBF4 has a flash version that's free to play, but you will have to pay for the Battle Mountain zone regardless, and the flash version tends to be rather laggy at times. Unfortunately, due to the earlier three games containing things that would bring its developer, Matt Roszak, into legal trouble (most notably the first game having a few pokemon for summons, and the final boss of the first game being Goku), they will not be appearing on Steam.\n\nPlot\nIn between the events of the third game and this one, the heroes, Matt, Natalie (Natz for short), and Lance, turn to a life of crime, since they lack the funds to buy food. They think that this is justified due to them saving the world before, although this is a rather flimsy excuse. They finally go too far when they steal an important jewel from Greenwood Village, causing her to seek them and finally deliver justice to them... only to learn that they did not steal the jewel. Anna must team up with the heroes, and track down the thief before he/she/it/they can steal the other two jewels and summon forth Godcat, who will destroy the world.\n\n...It's rather bare-bones, and can rather easily be ignored in the favor of picking fights with wild animals. Aside from a few rather minor references to the third game, you can easily jump into the game's plot without playing any other games in the EBF series. Interestingly enough, the entire series runs on the plot structure of "Stop this thing by beating it to a pulp," although this game diverges itself from this plot a little more.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is split up into two areas: The overworld and combat.\n\nIn the overworld, you can walk around, accepting quests to get items for complete strangers with the promise of some stuff in return, harrasing the wildlife, stealing items from treasure boxes, and buying items to prepare for combat. When one wishes to enter the combat phase of gameplay, one simply clicks on an enemy on the map. If one goes to the options tab, one can switch between using the keyboard and the mouse to travel on the map.\n\nIn combat, you have a myriad of standard JRPG skills, including several that are based off of elements. As one of the game's tips says, attack enemies until they die. If red numbers appear, that means the element of that attack is pretacualy effective against that foe. If grey numbers appear, that means the foe is either immune or resists the attack. One can also use the Scanbot summon to reveal the weaknesses of these enemies, revealing their weaknesses and stat totals for all enemies of that type. Battles may be split into multiple waves, too. In one of the lower points of the game, your party's turns are not refreshed at the start of each wave, which can result in up to five enemies getting free attacks if you use your last action to kill an enemy. This is especially bothersome with the final boss, who will "kill" itself after a few turns on the waves where it's invulnerable, giving its next phase free, powerful attacks.\n\nAfter winning a battle, one is rewarded with Gold, EXP, and AP, all used outside of combat. Gold is used to buy new equipment, items to upgrade your equipment with, things that hurt enemies, and items to heal your party members. EXP will make your characters stronger. AP can be spent under the "Skills" screen to unlock new skills, or upgrade ones you've already learned. Any skills under the "special" tab can only be learned by a single character and have to be forgotten if you wish to teach them to another character, adding a layer of strategy as to who gets what skill.\n\nDifficulty\nEBF4 is divided into four difficulties. In order from easiest to hardest, they are: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Epic. The difficulty can be changed on the fly, so unless one is having trouble on Easy, the difficulty can be lowered with ease. By default, the game is set on Normal. If one were to select Hard or Epic, enemies will also recieve bonuses that aren't directly stated, such as some enemies that absorb fire damage entering battle with a status that deals fire damage every turn, or fire-weak enemies starting with a status that lets them resist fire. Bosses that are defeated on Epic difficulty also give medals, which directly corrolate to Steam Achievements.\n\nIn short, do I recommend this game? Yes. I am aware this type of game isn't for everyone, especially considering the rather cluttered interface, but it's a damn fine one. Also, to those who ask where the other party members are at the start of the game, you'll find them as you progress through Ashwood Forest, before finally finding Lance after defeating the Mighty Oak and entering the Crystal Caverns. Each party member also has a different role, which should be relatively obvious looking at their stats and personal skills they can learn.","July 20, 2014","true","38.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Interestingly enough, the entire series runs on the plot structure of "Stop this thing by beating it to a pulp," although this game diverges itself from this plot a little more.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is split up into two areas: The overworld and combat.\n\nIn the overworld, you can walk around, accepting quests to get items for complete strangers with the promise of some stuff in return, harrasing the wildlife, stealing items from treasure boxes, and buying items to prepare for combat. When one wishes to enter the combat phase of gameplay, one simply clicks on an enemy on the map. If one goes to the options tab, one can switch between using the keyboard and the mouse to travel on the map.\n\nIn combat, you have a myriad of standard JRPG skills, including several that are based off of elements. As one of the game's tips says, attack enemies until they die. If red numbers appear, that means the element of that attack is pretacualy effective against that foe. If grey numbers appear, that means the foe is either immune or resists the attack. One can also use the Scanbot summon to reveal the weaknesses of these enemies, revealing their weaknesses and stat totals for all enemies of that type. Battles may be split into multiple waves, too. In one of the lower points of the game, your party's turns are not refreshed at the start of each wave, which can result in up to five enemies getting free attacks if you use your last action to kill an enemy. This is especially bothersome with the final boss, who will "kill" itself after a few turns on the waves where it's invulnerable, giving its next phase free, powerful attacks.\n\nAfter winning a battle, one is rewarded with Gold, EXP, and AP, all used outside of combat. Gold is used to buy new equipment, items to upgrade your equipment with, things that hurt enemies, and items to heal your party members. EXP will make your characters stronger. AP can be spent under the "Skills" screen to unlock new skills, or upgrade ones you've already learned. Any skills under the "special" tab can only be learned by a single character and have to be forgotten if you wish to teach them to another character, adding a layer of strategy as to who gets what skill.\n\nDifficulty\nEBF4 is divided into four difficulties. In order from easiest to hardest, they are: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Epic. The difficulty can be changed on the fly, so unless one is having trouble on Easy, the difficulty can be lowered with ease. By default, the game is set on Normal. If one were to select Hard or Epic, enemies will also recieve bonuses that aren't directly stated, such as some enemies that absorb fire damage entering battle with a status that deals fire damage every turn, or fire-weak enemies starting with a status that lets them resist fire. Bosses that are defeated on Epic difficulty also give medals, which directly corrolate to Steam Achievements.\n\nIn short, do I recommend this game? Yes. I am aware this type of game isn't for everyone, especially considering the rather cluttered interface, but it's a damn fine one. Also, to those who ask where the other party members are at the start of the game, you'll find them as you progress through Ashwood Forest, before finally finding Lance after defeating the Mighty Oak and entering the Crystal Caverns. Each party member also has a different role, which should be relatively obvious looking at their stats and personal skills they can learn.","July 20, 2014","true","38.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Epic Battle Fantasy 4 (or ebf4) is a Strategy RPG similar to Final Fantasy 6 and below. There are Four main characters, Matt the theiving, high attack high defense tank, Natalie, the good natured mage, Lance, the phsycotic, perverted gun freak, and Anna, the tree hugging goody two shoes with a bow. the game starts off with you in the overworld, and when you enter a hostile area, you'll notice the enemy sprites. Yes, the creator got rid of random battles. Thank Christ. when you enter battle, you control three of the four hero's attacks and strategies along with equips. for strategies there is "benching" a character for another, there is switching turns for a character, surrender, and block for the most part. equips follow the rules of, you can change wepons, outfits, flair mid battle, but it costs you a turn, same with consumables. attacks are the highlights of the game. each character can learn their own special set of "skills" for them only, but you ccan find "specials" out in the feild usually after boss fights or quests. theses "specials" can be used by any character provided they meet the parameters. overall, the game is fun, some very small tech bugs, good design and a wacky story. 8.5/10","July 28, 2014","true","35.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although it's a port of a Freemium Flash game, it runs smoothly and is thankfully devoid of a Cash Shop. The graphics are whimsically cute, and the gameplay can be considered JRPG-lite for Westerners...as it has everything you'd expect in a JRPG but without the insane grind (you can make it through the entire game within 12-14 hours as opposed to hundreds of hours in a typical JRPG). The humor and use of standard JRPG tropes is comical to where you can't help but smile and giggle incessently while playing (down to the non-apologetic blatant remix of the victory theme from FFVII).  It may not be a hard-core JRPG, but it is a delightfully fun tip of the hat to classic JRPGs.

EBF4 is a tongue-in-cheek RPG with hilarious characters who dress as stereotypical pirates, rangers or red mages. On the over-world map you collect hidden goodies, explore branching ways and follow the farce of a storyline. If you choose to bump into an enemy the fighting starts, no tedious random encounters after any x steps. Also heroes slowly heal after battle for convenience and most creatures respawn.\n\nThe battle system isn't boring but really fun with lots of different skills, weapons, equipment, usable items.\nSkills are unlocked and upgraded with skill points. Levels are gained by experience. Weapons and Armor are found or bought in shops and upgraded with items. There are also summons usable by anyone, limit breaks and "specials" which are skills you can assign to complement a characters skill set like a fire attack or a heal spell.\n\nYou may try out the EBF game series on some websites for free to understand how the game works.","August 3, 2014","true","22.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gar1onriva/recommended/265610/","Gar1onriva","OzymanGeran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gar1onriva/","302 products in account","This game I bought because the different art styles were all cute and interesting. What followed was a shockingly good experience that I really didn't see coming.\n\nThis game is based on RPGs like Final Fantasy and Golden Sun, but where they can be very slow (the former, particularly), this one is incredibly fast paced. I've played a fair amount of FFxiii, but I managed to catch up to my playtime for that game in a much shorter span due to how enveloping this game can be; I've wiled away more than one night by just playing the story of this.\n\nGrinding is possible, but wholly unneeded. It seems most of the enemies have some kind of scaling, but maybe I was just at the perfect level for everything... Not being able to tell which it is is a very positive thing.\nIt also have a Game+ mode where you just restart the story with all your levels, skills and equipment. This is a nice feature, but I wish it had asked first as I was close to a few end game achieves that reset with the story.\n\nThe actual gameplay is, as I said, fast and flowing. A little less dependence on the mouse would have been nice (you need to click to exit combat, for example), but I still love the way this game controls. Although the interface is mind-bogglingly complicated when you first see it, everything has its place and all fits together surprisingly well for a system as detailed as this. There're skill trees, equipment collecting, weapon and armour modifications, 'flair' trinkets, stat boosters, element resistance, buffs/debuffs... You get the point. But by a few hours into the game, I understood the majority of it.\n\nCharacter balancing was a bit off for me... I dunno if it was bad use of stat items and skills, but my best fighter was also my best healer and had half the max health of my others. Due to the sheer number of options, I found it hard to keep it straight in my head which character should have which (I did consider making some kind of spreadsheet, but decided against it), but I managed to complete the game on normal difficulty without too much hassle. Don't think I ever lost a fight.\n\nEnough about gameplay, what about the story and tone? The tone is brilliant. Spot on. Phenomenal. It'd be worth playing this for the characters' interactions alone. It plays beautifully with RPG and gaming tropes, references are everywhere and as I said at the beginning, the art style is amazing. Cutscenes are done in a felt-style looping animation, battles are anime and overworld travel are chibi things. They all work surprisingly well together and give the game a very lighthearted feel that becomes all the better when the team encounter horrific atrocities.\n\nAlso there's a little easter egg that I stumbled upon entirely by accident, but could NOT stop laughing at. I won't spoil it. But damn. It just epitomises the game.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic light RPG that is deep enough in gameplay to be elevated beyond the flash game it is and become one of my favourites. Resolution options are terrible, mind, and it isn't integrated with steam very well. Still. Amazing game.","December 17, 2015","true","38.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you are a fan of oldschool turnbased JRPGs, you will love this, the games light heartedness & humour really does it for me. It still has the cliche "Oh no the world is going to end unless we kill a god or something" storyline but it has a slight twist, while the game doesnt take itself even the slightest bit serious.\n\nUnlike Final fantasy where its like "You MUST defeat the main villian because he WILL destroy the world and ONLY YOU, a 15 year old kid or something, can defeat him! Along with your companions of, a dog, another member, a machine gun armed guy, and Bewwwbs (Come on you must know who I'm referencing there).\nWhile this game is like "Oh no the world will be destroyed by an evil god, who is a cat. Who has other cats which will kill you... Yeah. Oh and also you can get an achievment for poking a woman with large breats enough. Have fun!"\n\nBut yeah, I fell in love with the series after finding it from EBF 3. The game has been massively improved from that one & many more things have been added. Usually, I find it crappy where games have a crafting system where its not needed, *COUGH* (Alien: Isolation) *COUGH*, but this game does it perfectly, it is an optional thing to do, all it does is make your equipment better & you can easily buy most of the materials needed from the shops. This game also has quite a few references to other games too, like the Tr*force badge.\n\nThis is droning on, I'll shut up now. Over all review, buy it.\n\nEDIT: No I am not correcting horribly spelt words & poor grammar.

"This guy hasn't even started playing this game yet, why should I listen to his review?"\n\nWell, the truth is, I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game's free version on Kongregate.  I also played the ♥♥♥♥ of EPF3.  And let me tell you, if there is any game on Kongregate that deserves to make it to the big time, its EPF4.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 once again stars the trio of heroic, yet dimwitted adventurers Matt, Natalie and Lance.  This time, however, they're joined by a new character, the ranger Anna, who is easily the smartest of the bunch.  Together, the four this time must travel across the land, searching for crystals and uncovering clues about a new feline menace.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy has always prided itself on gut busting comedy and intense, over the top action, and this game is no exception.  There are hundreds of weapons, skills and summons to collect and use against literally hundreds of enemies, and the game is full of tongue in cheek moments such as Nat's oftentimes futile efforts to get Matt and Lance to care about the environment, or Anna trying to curb Matt's kleptomaniac tendencies.\n\nAlso, is case you're wondering why you should buy this version, well, its because it grants you access to the Premium Pack.  This pack adds a ton of new content to the game, including new weapons, new armor, new summons, new enemies and bosses, and even an entirely new area.\n\nIf you're a fan of turn based rpgs, of self-referential comedy, or just plain fun RPGs, then you owe it to yourself to try this out.  Check out the free version on Kongregate, and if you enjoy it, you should definitely considering going Premium by buying the Steam version.","February 25, 2014","true","12.2"," 37 of 72 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","37","72","0","0"

I don't know what it is about the games that makes me love them to bits... I guess it's the characters and the wholeheartedness of it all. What I feel: Kupo wants to make these games for the love of making them. Also, you can't say that the characters haven't had any development. I remember how Lance joined the team (not in EBF4) - which was hilarious. Then there's Anna who learned to tolerate Matt's love to ste- err, take "Free Samples" whenever he wants. A love development can really complicate the narrative if mis-handled, so please be careful and don't rush it!\nMy bit of critic, I.E. the only problem I had: wave transitions are cruel. Q.Q;\nMaybe it's intentional, but once all the enemies attack then they all die of poison or whatever, the next enemies come in and they get to go first. Also, if the last (and only) enemy attacks and then die from a counter attack, I start hating my characters' awesomeness since I have to deal with the next wave's attacks before I can heal or something. It'd be great if that were dealt with. :D\nThat's literally my only complaint, with the first sentence in mind, so YES! Get it and play it! Totally worth it!\nLastly: I love the reference to Golden Sun. >.>","June 26, 2014","true","80.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's powerful role playing essentials prove that an RPG does not have to be made with great graphics or new complicated battle mechanics - it just needs a firm storyline such as this.\n\nThe story unfolds with four heroes that find each other along the journey, fight monsters, and as usual, attempt to claim world peace from this unseemingly harmless boss - the Godcat. Throughout the way, dry R16 humour develops throughout the story, and even when you are engaging in difficult battles, somewhat the characters randomly crack jokes in a light hearted manner. Hmm...\n\nThe system is brilliant. Brilliant in the sense that the forging and money systems go hand-in-hand nicely unlike many other games that introduce poverty into the heroes. Summons actually help a lot, and battle statuses are not just those nice symbols floating on your heads - they actually kill you. Simple but effective.\n\nMusic is fine, although the tunes are reminiscent of popular music. Canon in D - main theme. Enjoyable but I didn't love it as much and it somewhat did not match the situations.\n\nOverall, a must try for fantasy fans.

You have three people in battle and one back up.  You buff, cast magic, and attack - what you would expect.\n\nThe core of the combat is fun, but in the later stages of the game: it becomes a little bit of a chore at times.  I didn't find the game to be hard - infact it was easy for an RPG, even the bonus areas.  It was very easy to stay alive and slowly reduce a big boss over time.... however that being said - I have years & years of classic RPG experience and most of the "close calls" I bounced back quickly.  I actually died once just to see what happened.\n\nAnyway - this is a fun, classic, RPG style game with a lot of spells, summons, and monsters to fight.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReneG8/recommended/265610/","ReneG8","ReneG8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReneG8/","245 products in account","Epic Battle Fantasy is a story set in a fantasy land that encapsulates total humour. It's powerful role playing essentials prove that an RPG does not have to be made with great graphics or new complicated battle mechanics - it just needs a firm storyline such as this.\n\nThe story unfolds with four heroes that find each other along the journey, fight monsters, and as usual, attempt to claim world peace from this unseemingly harmless boss - the Godcat. Throughout the way, dry R16 humour develops throughout the story, and even when you are engaging in difficult battles, somewhat the characters randomly crack jokes in a light hearted manner. Hmm...\n\nThe system is brilliant. Brilliant in the sense that the forging and money systems go hand-in-hand nicely unlike many other games that introduce poverty into the heroes. Summons actually help a lot, and battle statuses are not just those nice symbols floating on your heads - they actually kill you. Simple but effective.\n\nMusic is fine, although the tunes are reminiscent of popular music. Canon in D - main theme. Enjoyable but I didn't love it as much and it somewhat did not match the situations.\n\nOverall, a must try for fantasy fans. Also has a very high replay value.","July 10, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have three people in battle and one back up.  You buff, cast magic, and attack - what you would expect.\n\nThe core of the combat is fun, but in the later stages of the game: it becomes a little bit of a chore at times.  I didn't find the game to be hard - infact it was easy for an RPG, even the bonus areas.  It was very easy to stay alive and slowly reduce a big boss over time.... however that being said - I have years & years of classic RPG experience and most of the "close calls" I bounced back quickly.  I actually died once just to see what happened.\n\nAnyway - this is a fun, classic, RPG style game with a lot of spells, summons, and monsters to fight.  Not a lot outside of the combat but enough to keep you entertained for awhile.\n\nI would recommend it!","July 10, 2014","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style is over the top and fits the game perfectly, the writing is sharp as hell and the mechanics are solid and really enjoyable.\n\nThis is a welcome addition to any RPG fans collection, it's also worth noting you can play it entirely with mouse clicks (I found this to be really rather nice for a laptop owner).

Challenging yet not impossible, funny yet smart - it keeps you playing, but never lets you get bored.\nPersonally I find fighting mechanics extremely enjoyable - well balanced, but requiring some level of skill to end up effective and successful. Storyline is nice, though I liked it more in EBF3 - there were more fun stuff and I really loved all those witty anime refferals. I want to point out - that in EBF4 quality level DID NOT drop, it's just that now such things are expected (for those who played previous part obviously).\nCharacters are great - they are not one bit like classic boring "heroic" heroes or angsty anime kids. Well... there are some problems - Lance with his naz... black uniform does look a bit disturbing. I just don't understand authors position on this one. So I picked different outfit and tried to forget. =) And did I say Natalie got some classy eyes, -wink -wink?!\n\nI recommend this game to everyone...  unless you find Final Fantasy style of battle system unaccepatable.

The amount of work done to this game is phenomenal. I remember playing this on Kongregate and enjoying the hell out of it. Once I heard that the full version of the game was selling on steam, I told myself that I had to buy this. AND I played through the whole thing, including through all of the additional contents with Battle Mountain! Here's why this game is worth a look!\n\nPOSITIVES:\n- HOURS of content\n- Not so serious story with humorous elements of characters\n- Four characters to play as (Each with unique skills)\n- Many ways to customize characters (Skills, Costumes, Badges)\n- Several areas to explore and tons of foes to face!\n- Game presents a challenge and difficulty scales gradually\n- Many RPG elements that people who are familiar OR new to them will love\n- Many rewards, many prizes!\n- Don't need to grind this game in order to beat it. From what I remember correctly, enemies scale to your level.\n- SOUNDTRACK IS AMAZING!\n- Art design of world and characters are attractive\n- Can save your game anytime\n- ACHIEVEMENTS!\n\nNEGATIVES:\n- No gripping or remarkable story\n- For people who do not like casual RPGs, this is not your cup of tea\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing through this game again and experiencing the challenge of Battle Mountain!

Or even better, it gets crushed by a falling mammoth out of nowhere. Or two of them.\n\nIf you feel that's underwhelming, maybe this isn't for you.

Most of the fun will be had in battles, where diverse enemies and an easy-to-understand element system make it a strangely relaxing experience.

The plot is so over the top that it actually gets intresting at some points. The gameplay time , if you play with side missions, farming exp and gold , finding rare armor etc. , and try to finding all the easter eggs will be about 40-50 hours, if you play only the main story line it will be around 15-20 hours.

From a replayability standpoint the humor and plot obviously doesn't hold up well, but the combat is still engrossing, and what more can you ask of something titled "Epic Battle Fantasy"? The soundtrack is shockingly good in a nostalgic synthisizer sort of way, and though the tracks loop fairly heavily after 11 hours and counting I haven't muted it yet. The most impressive part for me is the level design. From start to finish you are never asked to backtrack without being rewarded for it.

It's smooth, engaging, and there are a lot of challenges that'll keep you on your seat for a long, long time (from puzzles to bosses on Epic difficulty). The artwork is cute, and so is the plot. And finally, the characters are absolutely lovable and memorable, with each one having a unique (and sometimes unusual) personality.\n\nOne of the best games I've ever played, and though it will probably not come out, I do hope that Matt creates an Epic Battle Fantasy 5.

New to the series I had no Idea what I was getting myself in to, but it quickly found a warm and fuzzy place in this avid RPG fan's heart.\n\nThe art style in this game offers a fun, playful experience, keeping well away from the dark and gritty with generous amounts of color to satisfy everyones pallet.  The Soundtrack. MY GOD THE SOUNDTRACK is what makes this game for me. The various battle themes keep you pumped from start to finish and with every new zone comes its own thrilling and whimsical theme tune that serenades you on your fantasy adventure and well after that. Going by the music and game design alone, it is clear that the developers and those involved in this humble indie game have a  clear understanding of both fun and fantasy.\n\nThe ammount of  hours you can get out of this game is up to you. With an endless supply of monsters showing up in previously explored areas, you can level your characters as much or as little as you like. The enviroment puzzles, although optional will keep you busy and reward you fairly.  Oh and feel free to grind materials and upgrade your gear for  even more of an edge in battle.\nAnd I can confidently say this game has plenty of replayability, the main story is short and sweet and wont run the risk of boring you halfway through your second, even third playthrough. You have some control over what abilities your characters learn or not, and mixing up the gear and permenant upgrades to your characters stats can certainly effect their roles and the outcome of battles. Plus multiple difficulty settings for all your bragging-rights needs!\n\nA damn fine Fantasy RPG that will amaze, inspire and reward your efforts with equal affection.\n\nGuaranteed satisfaction 10/10","May 6, 2015","true","36.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

The game plays like a traditional RPG, where you walk around the world, find items in chests, complete a few quests for NPC's (and by 'quest', I mean go and find them some junk and bring it back), and fight enemies.\n\nOf course, there is a deeper play to it. Anyone who has played the prior Epic Battle Fantasy games on Flash game sites such as Armorgames or Kongregate will know that equipping the right stuff is key to the game, and even armor and items you find early on may play key roles later on, especially if you upgrade them. No weapon or armor is useless in this game, and it allows for a good amount of customization. Plus, the proper armor and weapons show up on the character as you switch them, which is a fine little bonus~\n\nAnd for those who are skeptical of buying this knowing that there is indeed a Free-to-Play version out there, the money is well worth the spending, because you're not only supporting the creator of this fine series (kudos to you, Matt Rozak), but you get some extra content in the form of new weapons/armor, new summons, and a tough optional area that will test your skills in more ways than one. Plus you get the soundtrack to boot~\n\nOverall, it's a very good game, especially for one made in Flash. If you're looking for a light-hearted RPG, this may just be the one for you.~","June 29, 2014","true","57.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quinzark/recommended/265610/","quinzark","Quinzark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quinzark/","142 products in account","Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is the latest game in the series of flash driven, turn based RPGs by Kupo Games. Its tiny development team, headed by Matt Roszak (Whom is credited for design, art, story and programming).\n\nThis is a game which should be praised, for the amount of effort put in. The result is a well realised and full RPG experience full of character and heart.\n\nThe game retains enough nostalgia from old school RPGs but still manages to feel fresh and new. If you’ve ever played any Final Fantasy title pre FFXI you’ll be familiar with this format.\nIt gives a master class in how a turn based system should play along with all the usual elements you’d expect, being able to cast magic, summon other creatures, use items and attack and it does this as well as any JRPG does. Its appeal for me was that this is a finely tuned machine of a game. Usually with turn-based RPGs you eventually become so powerful that nothing is really a challenge, except maybe some bosses but with a combination of a difficulty slider that makes a difference and some well paced scaling of foes, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 keeps you on your toes and makes you think a little bit.\n\nI’ve always loved turn based RPGs when done well and RPGs in general, but turn based more so than Action. The reason being it brings an element of strategy with out reliance on quick time events [which i hate]. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 makes full use of the strategic element of the genre.\n\nIt does this through its use of equipment and skills. The majority of weapons have an elemental effect which will assist you in tearing through enemies that are weak to that element and each piece of equipment has a use, without the collect and discard method used in most games. Weapons can be swapped out in combat also but this will take up a valuable turn to do so. Not only that, you won’t be receiving that free ride through an area.\n\nThe skill and specials pool is a very well implemented way of customising your characters and their skillset. Skills can only be learned by that specific character and specials can be learned by all, but only one character may have it at any one time. Once again, brings some difficult decisions forward. You can also equip the characters with items that will provide passive bonuses or abilities within battle, another little customisable option for balancing your team some buffing characters and some casting abilities at dice-rolled intervals. Gone, in this game, is any idea of an “Ultimate” weapon. For me, that’s refreshing. Each weapon can be upgraded as you collect items from combat or treasure.\n\nThe characters are well written and interact nicely. The personalities feel genuine and It seems like they are inspired by or based in some way on friends of the developer. At times they do act like close friends who have a lot of fun in each other’s company. This game is no doubt a labour of love and the small team at Kupo Games must have poured a lot of time into this game. It is increasingly rare to see triple-A games give this creative warmth, probably due to the size of the teams but Steam lets this flourish.\n\nThere are a lot of small gestures and references that experienced RPG fans will appreciate showing a good dose of humour. From the snow covered Djinn from Golden Sun in Whitefall Town to the name of some of the achievements you can gain for using new items they flow through the whole game well.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy’s achievement/medal system is well implemented. Some are very difficult to obtain, some pretty much laughing in the face at how ridiculous achievement systems are. When combined with the bestiary gives you that feeling of collection that a lot of games look past. It makes you want to collect them, this is important.\n\nA game by a turn-based RPG fan, for turn-based RPG fans, this will likely not appeal to those who only play Shooters or Wii Fit games but give it a chance and it may well draw you in.\n\nTo wrap up, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an absolutely fantastic game, made even more impressive by the huge contribution by Matt Roszak.\nIt is a game i’ve played over the Christmas holidays and will likely play again soon. With a Newgame+ option it is set up well for this. The art is soft and friendly, the enemies range from menacing to adorable. The mechanics are solid, the story is well written, the characters engaging and the experience is enjoyable.\n\n\nIt can also be bought for next to nothing because ‘Steam’.\n\n4 Ferrets out of 5","January 2, 2015","true","57.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have been following Matt (Kupo, the creator)and playing his games for a few years now. Bullet Hell, EBF3, EBF4, and a few other titles. I have to say, this fourth installment of EBF is the best. The game gets better every single time. each game has more equipment, strategies, monster and boss variety, skills, and medals. There is no way to express how much I really enjoy this game. There are tons of light-hearted jokes, and meme references. Also, there are a ton of referneces from old school games and shows - especially pokemon. "Don't thing too hard - you may hit yourself in confusion." "IM NOT THAT DUMB."........" Weak generic bat enemy used wing attack!... It wasn't very effective." Littlle things like that (and there are tons of them) make this game so much more enjoyable. Also, Matt ridicules himself and the game several times through his characters. He doesn't take himself or the game too seriously, yet he makes every aspect of it near flawless. Its one of the few games I can actually sit through more than once and do it multiple times. Also, the ability to switch from easy to ♥♥♥♥ instantly is great. Some might think its cheap, but honestly, you only get achievements on epic... no need to fight 1000s of monsters that mean nothing on epic when on the bosses matter on that difficulty.\n\nPros\nSkill variety\nMonster variety\nEquipment variety\nStrategy (You will get crushed... especially on Epic difficulty... if you don't think before you act)\nHumor\nAchiements/medals\nEndless monsters and challenges\nPuzzles\nMultiple characters\nTons of secrets and hidden chests\nLots of quests\nGraphics (pretty intense for a flash game)\nMusic (and they say video games don't have real music)\nNew game+ and several difficulties, along with ability to switch difficulty whenever.\nLarge map. Seemlessly merges together once you open all pathways. Lots to explore and discover.\n\n\nCons\nSometimes choppy on steam. Probably not the game's fault. Plays fine on Kongregate.\nA lot of backtracking and memorizing. I personally don't mind this, but some might. There is a walkthrough for this game on kongregate if you cant find something or get stuck on a boss.\n\n10000/10.","January 5, 2015","true","74.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can run from any battle everytime including boss battles, when you scan an enemy it stays scanned in future battles, items are clearly sorted based on type and effect, in-fact if you were to describe everything you hated about RPG's in the past 5 years, this game takes all of those things and removes them replacing them with something better.\n\nIf I had one wish, it would be that the game was on a better engine with better presentation and that more people heard of this game because it is truely an underrated classic.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","June 28, 2014","true","141.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Before I get into the controversial stuff that I like... let me just say that the battle system in this game is amazing.  You can decide which characters get which special moves, you can level skills up that you want while leaving others in the dust if you choose, you have to level up your equipment (especially in later battles) to ensure you have a nice diverse set of resist gear to survive the challenging boss fights (depending on the difficulty you set it on).\n\nDid I mention that there are tons of hidden chests, quests for npcs (that aren't necessary for progression, just a bonus), an extra difficult bonus location for those of us that bought the game, and an amazing sound track?\n\nI personally really got a kick out of some of the commentary between the characters.  The story is obviously very light-hearted and the gimmicky chats between the heroes is usually comical - not to mention you can click on Natalie for a chuckle now and then.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 for me was a breath of fresh air in a market that no longer caters to those of us who liked the traditional jrpg such as the early FF games/nes/snes rpgs of the past.  I like Skyrim and all of the clones of that new genre of rpg that are out, but I REALLY like the old style.  As someone who grew up in the 80s and 90s playing the rpgs of that time, and if you did too, you will like this game.\n\nThank you so much Kupo for putting this together, I just wish EBF5 was out...","April 8, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love jrpgs and there aren't that many good ones on Steam or the PC for that matter. But then there is EBF4. The story isn't much to write home about but it's still cute and the writing is pretty humorous with tons of references to other classic games.  The world is pretty big and each area is unique and has plenty of different types of monsters. Crafting is simple and straightforward but satisfying and there are tons of skills to choose from.\n\nI have two very big complaints however. There is no controller support. Which is a shame because I wanted to sit back and relax whilst playing. The other complaint is the UI is a little cluttered. Even after hundreds of battles I can't remember which menu a specific skill is in but that's probably just because I'm dumb.\n\nEither way the game is well worth the money and I'm will be playing it any time I need to satisfy my jrpg urges.","March 15, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maverickrzx/recommended/265610/","maverickrzx","Maverick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maverickrzx/","510 products in account","I honestly have a feeling that all the negative reviews are from people who've never even bothered playing the other 3 games and know nothing about the engine that was used for this or even gave it an actual chance. It wasn't RPGMaker so you obviously fail for trying to compare Kupo to a "reddit RPG Maker /b/tard". If anything since you know reddit so well that you used categories and seen for yourself how people are on there then you must be one of said "/b/♥♥♥♥♥.".\n\nThis game is literally an indie RPG masterpiece referencing all types of games and genres and heavily Final Fantasy referenced. I played this mostly on Kongregate and the moment it was on Steam I bought it. The OST is AMAZING. I listen to it all the time at work. Halcyonic Falcon X aka Phyrnna <3 I love you <3. You can get all the EBF4 music on her YouTube or Spotify channels. Maybe Pandora, I don't know because I don't use Pandora. You can also get the soundtrack from the Steamapps folder of this game too.\n\nI've been a long time fan since EBF1 and Bulletheaven.\n\nI can't stress how awesome this game is for what it is. There's actually A LOT to do in it and you can easily upgrade EVERYTHING. However I'm missing like 1 piece of armor I think, I can't remember but I read something about it only being available at a certain time? I forgot the full details of it. It's a well known question a lot of people have been asking about in the game because they can't 100% the armor collection. Still haven't figured it out yet.\n\nThe thing about this game is, if you want to speed through the game, you can change the games difficulty to easy. The only difference the game makes is the damage you receive from enemies and how much health they have. Basically just a stat difference. There isn't anything too significant unless you're trying to get all the achievements in-game. The game doesn't seem to give you extra rewards after battles, just the overall challenge of the fights. I usually find it easier when I'm trying to rush through the game to just set the game on easy until I get to a boss fight because a lot of the enemy fights tend to get pretty tedious over time the I crank up the difficulty to hard or something because I can't do epicyet and I'm on my second playthrough. This game does have pretty good replayability to it. Especially the fact that you need to clear the game 3 times in order to get the achievement. However that 5m damage achievement is insane. I can't seem to pull that off with the Revenge skill when everybody but Matt is dead and Matts near dead while atk buffed. I guess I just need to farm for atk stat boost items.\n\nI honestly give it a 9/10 for me only, because some of the non-boss battles can get really tedious and it does lose entertainment value after awhile. It's good to play this game for a few hours a day unless you decide to play on easy  the entire time until boss fights show up and crank up the difficulty.\n\nBut in general I give this game a 10/10 just because of how well made it was by 1 man and how well the music is for the game by 1 woman. It's definitely a masterpiece indie RPG.\n\nI can't really find anything wrong with it in general. Just a few personal afflictions I had that shouldn't affect a lot of other people as much as me.","April 29, 2015","true","54.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game plays like a traditional RPG, where you walk around the world, find items in chests, complete a few quests for NPC's (and by 'quest', I mean go and find them some junk and bring it back), and fight enemies.\n\nOf course, there is a deeper play to it. Anyone who has played the prior Epic Battle Fantasy games on Flash game sites such as Armorgames or Kongregate will know that equipping the right stuff is key to the game, and even armor and items you find early on may play key roles later on, especially if you upgrade them. No weapon or armor is useless in this game, and it allows for a good amount of customization. Plus, the proper armor and weapons show up on the character as you switch them, which is a fine little bonus~\n\nAnd for those who are skeptical of buying this knowing that there is indeed a Free-to-Play version out there, the money is well worth the spending, because you're not only supporting the creator of this fine series (kudos to you, Matt Rozak), but you get some extra content in the form of new weapons/armor, new summons, and a tough optional area that will test your skills in more ways than one. Plus you get the soundtrack to boot~\n\nOverall, it's a very good game, especially for one made in Flash. If you're looking for a light-hearted RPG, this may just be the one for you.~","June 29, 2014","true","57.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It feels like a new game. But, at the same time, I suppose instead of innovating, it's simply... more content. Coupled with a map that's of a decent size, yet feels surprisingly small. That, and of all the swords that we've got still in the game even from EBF1, no Soul Eater. My absolute favourite sword is not here. That makes me a very sad cookie. Soul Eater, featured in every game up until but excepting this one. Very fun because of the drastic reduction in survivability stats, but a huge increase in damage.\n\nI'm only 17 hours in, at the final boss, and I expect to be here for a while longer, simply because I'm gonna need to grind up a whole bunch more XP off... something, and a whole bunch more money, off... something, since I expect I am going to need a pile of it to upgrade every piece of equipment I need so I can finally beat the boss.\n\nNow let's get something straight. I don't mind grinding. I play Disgaea 1. Yeah, play. Not played. I'm still going.\n\nBut in EBF4... for some reason, I'm not really enjoying the grinding. I'm not really certain why. I spent hours upon hours finishing up EBF3, and it was incredibly satisfying to finally tick every box, but with EBF4, I'm struggling to work up the effort to beat the final boss.\n\nWhy do I recommend this game?\n\nI recommend it because it's a good game. It really is. It's a $12 JRPG-type game, it's great fun, and it's terribly, wonderfully simple in scope. It's exactly what it looks like, a turn-based JRPG. If you like turn-based JRPGs, you will like this one.\n\nIf your finger is hovering over that 'Add To Cart' button, and you're just not sure, then give Epic Battle Fantasy 3 a go. It's free, and a good representation of what you're going to find if you purchase EBF4.","September 16, 2014","true","27.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Reminiscent of the RPGs of old, with unique new twists. Offers an arcadey experience with a plot as intricate as the Mario franchise, so you don't really need to worry about getting caught up or anything since anywhere you start is pretty much all you really need to know.\nLike I said, a very arcade experience for those who want good, strategic combat out of their RPGs. Multiple difficulty levels which can be changed outside of combat. Alot of the game will be you having epic combat in a fantasy setting, but I suppose the title could have told you that much.\n\nThis game gives plenty of replay value, despite the 28 hours I clocked in at the time of this review, I haven't finished a single playthrough yet. Provided, I did alot of mucking about with sidequesting and took my sweet time, and if I went straight for the final boss things could have been done quicker, but this game features a whole host of battles that aren't part of the main map and further enhances the whole "arcade" view point.\nAlthough, by no means is this game tedious just because you fight things alot; the main focus of the game is RPG combat, as referenced by the title, and it delivers.\n\nPeople have said there's a free flash version of this game, and there is; but it doesn't include the content this has. Said content is the particuarly large "Battle Mountain" portion which has a HUGE amount of content, and this version supports up to three newgame+ runs, with enemies scaling with player level each NG+. This also runs better than the flash version, which is a given due to being a stand alone client now. The dev also did a good job with the previous three flash installments, so why not show him a little love? Alternatively, you could purchase the "full verison" on kongregate and play it there, but I feel that's less optimal. It's cheaper, but it's still going to be in flash there and ultimately not as\n\nDespite not having a indepth story, which isn't a bad thing mind you, the characters were still interesting to me. Graphics are pleasantly cartoony and colorful, with lots of detail and style.\n\nAlso, unlike the flash version, this has cloud saving, so temporary internet file shenanigans won't muck anything up.\n\nAlso features comedy and good times!\n\nUltimately, this was a good buy. I forget whether I got this on sale or not, but looking at the price I'd call it worthy of twelve dollars. On the other hand, I am a real scrooge, so I prefer to save as much money as possible when I buy things.","January 4, 2015","true","61.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Going by the title alone, you almost expect this to be the most cliche RPG ever, and it is - in a good way.\n\nEBF4 is a bit of a parody of RPGs. You have turn based combat, level ups, and gear, just like in all your normal RPGs. You've also got characters that crack jokes at their own game, and much like the little indie game EvoLand, it likes to make reference to other games fairly often as you bash enemies over the head with oversized weapons.\n\nAt first glance, this game looks like the kind of flash game you'd play in your internet browser when you were little - the art is colorful but looks primitive and the controls aren't complex. Yet this is the kind of 'flash game' that someone poured hours and hours into, and it shows; the art style may very well be simple, but that's before considering how much you can customize your characters. Each and every helm in the game gives the characters a different hairstyle, for one - heck, I spent more time than I'd like to admit mixing and matching outfits to see what was both stylish and combat practical.\n\nThe game is very lax in terms of its rules. It could almost be said that it got rid of all the little bits that make RPGs frustrating - encounters are not random, running away is penalty free, all gear is useable once upgraded, grinding is not necessary (except maybe for Epic mode) and upgrade ingredients are plentiful. The game doesn't have you trecking an hour to get a single ingredient - everything progresses at a quick and painless pace.\n\nMake no mistake, the game is challenging on Hard and Epic modes. One's ability to arm characters with the right attacks and gear is mandatory for taking on the game's big bosses, even if said big bosses look too comical to take seriously.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant game, and there's no way I can't recommend it. It's not the kind of gripping story about trust and betrayal that will move you to tears, but it's a fun little title that does everything right, and should be recognized for it.","March 13, 2015","true","38.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you're a fan of the old-school Final Fantasy games, this game is for you, especially if you like cats. :3 It's very rewarding, too, since the visuals are fantastic, the writing is fun, and the battles are tense (especially toward the end). I can't count the number of times when I was sure I was going to lose, but I somehow managed to get it together just enough to crawl to victory.\n\nThe final boss is the most tense battle I've ever fought in an RPG.

When victory finally comes, you will know it's because you tore it from the the maw of defeat with your bare hands.\n\nAt least, that's how I felt. Hopefully, I'm not just bad. :P I'm sure I could have leveled up more, but the pacing of the game made it feel like this was where I was supposed to be, and that feeling persists through the entire game.

(Not-So) Subtle references abound to various other games and anime, and the steam version adds features that even earlier versions of the same game did not have.\n\nQuite similar to the classic 90's RPG games, you'll think final fantasy primarily.

Lots of options and depth to the game in terms of elements/stats/effects/gear, and the fact that you can make the 4 characters into almost any type of class you wants negates the fact that there's no real character variety.  The one real downside I will say is that the storyline and comedy really wasn't there for me.  Maybe some spots where it made me smile, but nothing resembling laughter or really funny moments.

With 4 difficulty options that can be swapped at any time, the game has appeal to all fans of the genre, whether you're a hardcore power leveler or just rushing through the mandatory battles, the combat is simple and with many skills to level at your command, battles become more reliant on your own decisions. The dialog both in combat and in the field is witty and surprisingly well written, though some dialogues can be misplaced if missed in an earlier fight. The art in the game is fantastic - the character and enemy models are well-drawn and all have a distinct EBF artstyle. Each piece of equipment modifies the character models enabling the player to decide what their character stats will be and cool or cute they look. The story mode is fairly lengthy, taking anywhere from 15-25 hours on a normal difficulty run depending on completion and grind and features several optional challenges, with massive replayability including New Game + and Battle Island. Last but not least the music, by HalcyonicFalconX is not only great, but each piece fits amazingly with the nature of the battle or field, making the entire RPG experience phenomenal.","December 20, 2014","true","49.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sorry, I was too busy playing EBF4.\nAnywho, EBF4 is an RPG where you control 4 characters but you only have 3 at once. That 4th character is your backup, so you're thinking "Oh I have to take a turn to switch out and now it's going to get mulched by the enemy, great." but nope! Totally free, just take that action and you can still attack! (You can do this multiple times as well...for fun I suppose?) That's the thing with this game, it leaves out all the bull**** (Pardon my French) and leaves all the fun, such as no random encounters. But doesn't that make the game too easy? Ha ha, no. If the game is too easy, you can easily take on the upgraded bosses in the bonus stages but the normal bosses are hard enough. Considering that I always make sure to be two levels above the current boss's level, it's easy for me but I figure if I didn't do that, it'd be a challenge. A fair challenge, but a challenge nonetheless. The game is exciting and fun to play, there's always things to look out for such as hidden items, enjoyable character banter (Your mileage may vary, obviously), and so much more. It's only 5 bucks due to the sale but if it was priced on merit, I'd say it be 40-50$, 60$ would be stretching it but for a game like this, I sure won't mind coughing up the dosh for it!\n","December 20, 2014","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is still moderately engaging, and doesn't just devolve to "go here because we aren't gonna say". At least I can still remember what happened in the game.\n6/10? 6/10.\n\nThe Graphics\nVery colorful, slightly animu style graphics that are all in all nice to look at. Also, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, some of those abilities are amazing visually (mostly the limit breaks).\n8/10 m8\n\nThe Gameplay\nMy first runthrough was on normal mode, cause I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥. But I'm currently trying to get through the game on Hard and later on Epic, so yeah.\nBasically, this game doesn't fall into the common RPG problem of being able to just spam normal attack to win except on bosses or something, and actually requires a large amount of strategy to get through it. You actually need to be able to adapt to situations, and exploit certain weaknesses to be able to defeat certain enemies (ex. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Cosmic Monolith)\nExploration is also awarded well in this game too. There are several points in the game where backtracking and exploration can be very useful to you, mostly after you get key items. As well, this game has two optional areas, one small and pretty easy, with the other being basically a super dungeon where the enemies scale to your level and you fight some really powerful bosses. (Again, ♥♥♥♥ cosmic monoliths.)\nAlso, there are a metric ton of deifferent pieces of equipment to customize your character with, allowing you to find a way to fit almost any situation by the time you begin the New Game+ runthroughs.\nAlso, the two NG+ runthroughs cause the enemies to level up with you. That's pretty damn awesome.\n10/10 Am playing again\n\nMusic\nYou ever heard of Phyrnna? No? well you should listen to her songs. The EBF 4 soundtrack, along with the soundtrakcs for EBF 3 and 2 provide some of the best songs I have heard in a video game ever. Weshdoor Concert? Amazing. Derelict Factory of Twisted Metal? Amazing. Outside the Battlements? Amazing. The Rim of Battle Mountain? Amazing. Fallen Blood? Best final boss theme ever. Every single track here is amazing, and you should listen to all of it.\n10/10 would listen to Fallen Blood for the fiftieth time\n\nsrsly, get this game, also is pretty funny.\n\n9/10 am playing several times again.\n","March 13, 2015","true","38.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I had to make one suggestion, it would be that with each continued playthrough as you obtain the same equipmet item, you should get a +1 added on to its level 1-5 for each time you find it. I am trying to get the "beat the game three times acheivement", but it seems useless to collect the same items over and over again with no real insentive to do so. For example if I find the ice sword for the second time after getting it to level 5, it would be level 5 still just with a +2 modifier beside it adding to its overall stats and effects. just a suggestion.","February 14, 2015","true","46.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Seeing the series evolve as much as it has, finally reaching an actual release on Steam? It's a great sight.\n\nI've never been a fan of JRPGs, but I never found EBF to be frustratingly difficult. It requires the right enough amount of micromanagement, planning, and strategy to appeal to both casual and hardcore RPG players. It's also got a very parody-minded sense of humor that's usually quite fun and rarely runs dry. One example in it's favor is South Park: The Stick of Truth, which I did like for it's humor, but the tongue-in-cheek delivery kind of killed it for me halfway. EBF doesn't do that, and I'm glad about that.\n\nWhile my only real complaint would be the relative lack of backstory to cover the events of past games for those who might be new to these games, it's never so drawn out and overly complicated to not pick up on quickly. If you're looking for a new RPG to add to your library, I'd definitely make no higher recommendations.","November 30, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is still moderately engaging, and doesn't just devolve to "go here because we aren't gonna say". At least I can still remember what happened in the game.\n6/10? 6/10.\n\nThe Graphics\nVery colorful, slightly animu style graphics that are all in all nice to look at. Also, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, some of those abilities are amazing visually (mostly the limit breaks).\n8/10 m8\n\nThe Gameplay\nMy first runthrough was on normal mode, cause I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥. But I'm currently trying to get through the game on Hard and later on Epic, so yeah.\nBasically, this game doesn't fall into the common RPG problem of being able to just spam normal attack to win except on bosses or something, and actually requires a large amount of strategy to get through it. You actually need to be able to adapt to situations, and exploit certain weaknesses to be able to defeat certain enemies (ex. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Cosmic Monolith)\nExploration is also awarded well in this game too. There are several points in the game where backtracking and exploration can be very useful to you, mostly after you get key items. As well, this game has two optional areas, one small and pretty easy, with the other being basically a super dungeon where the enemies scale to your level and you fight some really powerful bosses. (Again, ♥♥♥♥ cosmic monoliths.)\nAlso, there are a metric ton of deifferent pieces of equipment to customize your character with, allowing you to find a way to fit almost any situation by the time you begin the New Game+ runthroughs.\nAlso, the two NG+ runthroughs cause the enemies to level up with you. That's pretty damn awesome.\n10/10 Am playing again\n\nMusic\nYou ever heard of Phyrnna? No? well you should listen to her songs. The EBF 4 soundtrack, along with the soundtrakcs for EBF 3 and 2 provide some of the best songs I have heard in a video game ever. Weshdoor Concert? Amazing. Derelict Factory of Twisted Metal? Amazing. Outside the Battlements? Amazing. The Rim of Battle Mountain? Amazing. Fallen Blood? Best final boss theme ever. Every single track here is amazing, and you should listen to all of it.\n10/10 would listen to Fallen Blood for the fiftieth time\n\nsrsly, get this game, also is pretty funny.\n\n9/10 am playing several times again.\n","March 13, 2015","true","38.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the Epic Battle Fantasy series when it was just an evolving flash series (with a really fun bullet hell offshoot) on Kongregate. I loved each and every iteration, and I loved EBF4 to the point I sat down and went full nerd-out on it with writing things down, calculating, minmaxing, the whole nerd-works. I loved it enough I actually put money towards the microtransaction it had. When I heard it was coming to Steam, I was super hype for it, but I never was able to get around to snatching it. Now that I have it, i've revisited it and am having just as much fun - if not more! - than I was on Kongregate.\n\nThe game itself is what I would call a tribute parody. The entire thing is self-aware of its genre, but also faithful to what it's parodying. Classic turn based combat with a rock-paper-scissors elemental / buff / debuff system, many items to equip to this end, a buttload of spells and abilities both natural to each character AND others that can be passed between each. Saving on the fly, resuming on the fly, overworld monster encounters instead of the random encounters we all are used to from classic RPGs, and those monsters tend to disappear permanently if they areb locking your main path. The scanbot allows you quick reference mid-battle to what an enemy is capable of, while also giving you a permanent bestiary entry for later reference. There are plenty of other features that really speak that an RPG enthusiast is behind the development, who has gone through the caveats and annoying nuances that many RPGs over the years have tossed at us that plenty a gamer have thrown their hands up at in rage. There is an abundance of humor, including puns, references, tropes and similar things that make fun of itself and its genre, and also referring to other games, series, memes, etc. without being overbearing and causing you to roll your eyes.\n\ntl;dr: This is an RPG made by, and for, RPG lovers, and I could honestly say you're missing out if you pass this up and are an avid player of RPGs.","March 2, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aside from the excellent game play, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 has great music that really sets the tone for the game in each area. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is definetely worth the $12 since most games that have 24+ hours gameplay cost 5+ times as much. Very excited that the developer will be making an Epic Battle Fantasy 5. Will definetely buy that when it comes out.","August 8, 2015","true","77.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This doesn't change throughout the course of the game, but it doesn't seem to hurt it either.  The battle system is fast, fun, and addictive.  The puzzles range from simple to mind-bending.  The amount of quests you get as well as bonus upgradeables is fairly extensive as well.  If you can get through the first initial groanings of the plot, you will find an incredibly fun experience.","March 14, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to say the first two are bad imo, since they still have their special place in my flash gaming days, way back 8 years ago.\n\nEBF is ultimately a tribute to the classic 16-bit Final Fantasy games, but it has its own unique style with its art and its cheesy yet delightful humor. The game has come a long way since its times without an overworld, NoLegs spam and trying to defeat final boss Goku. But I believe EBF 4 really shows the peak of Matt's RPG making skills.\n\nIt's well balanced with addictive gameplay that's simple and features likeable characters, adorable enemies, cool bosses and a fun, quirky story. This is definitely my favorite indie game and i recommend you at least check it out if you're interested.","June 18, 2015","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wheretheuniat/recommended/265610/","wheretheuniat","Nepgear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wheretheuniat/","49 products in account","This game is a joke, being a parody of Final Fantasy,\nBUT\nIt's not a joke.\n\nNot only does this include a difficulty system that actually tells you everything major that changes (Besides things like the Bomb Slimes and Purple Squids entering battle with nine poison stacks on Epic) but the game is still reasonably difficult without putting it on Epic, unless you're so used to Epic that in your second playthrough on on a sequential save half of the enemies one-shotting you in the power plant due to you being two levels underleveled feels normal. My first experience with Epic was nearly getting killed on the first battle in the game, gg. What truly makes this game difficult is Epic is insanely hard, but you can adapt to it. You can get hit by the enemies and survive, and most things that the enemies can do aren't out of your power, unlike a lot of games you see today. It puts the player and the enemies on nearly equal ground, but manages to still keep the game reasonably difficult. That is a sign that the game's difficulty is well designed.\n\nThis game contains parodic references to almost every game in the book that your childhood was composed of. My favorite cluster of references is the graveyard in Graybone Cemetery, there are many tombstones on one screen, a few of them are damaged, but the ones that aren't contain jokes that are mostly references of some sort. This is only a pinch of what is included in the actual game, though.\n\nThe dialogue in this game somehow keeps a decent balance between "Absolutely hilarious and cannot be taken seriously" and "Deep storyline" despite the final boss being *SPOILER* a cat god.\nI think my favorite thing about the dialogue in this game is either the fact that there is a one-liner for nearly every skill in the game, or the fact that dialogue can randomly trigger when walking around the map, and these times it's at it's funniest. There is one cluster of dialogue where Lance is staring at highschoolers and Natalie calls him a pedophile. Another is a conversation between Matt and Lance where Matt seems to be trying to explain to Lance that despite all the cameras he apparently has in his posession that he uses to stalk Natalie, it's still stalking and over the top stalking at that. The items even get some of this amazing humor, every one having a one-liner for a description. Achievements even get thrown into this bucket, there is one that nearly everyone knows about for clicking Natalie's boobs.\n\nThe only negative that comes to mind is the lack of an optimized full screen resolution and no access to STEAM features ingame, besides syncing, achievements, and cards. However this is understandable for a game ported from flash.\n\nThere isn't much to say about art style, it's not super duper flashy, and it definitely doesn't try to be edgy. It just tries to be cartoonish, cute, and funny, as it should.\n\nI can't say much about the music, purely because music is almost never my main focus. Although I can say the music is definitely catchy and worth listening too, HFX definitely did a good job in my opinion.\n\nThis game has very nice replayability too, but the story isn't really the strong suit. I personally replay for the comedy and the challenge, and I do NG+ to get gear and etc. I didn't grab the first time around.\n\nOverall, Matt deserves much more attention than he gets, but should never stop being a semi-solo developer. When you work with a lot of people and publishers, games like this are only dreams.","December 7, 2015","true","42.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Matt Roszak has done a lot on this game, and there is a lot of content that many other flash games do not have. He definitely deserves way more than what he is getting.

It's as much stratagy as it is action. With the multitude of skills available and diffrent weapons and armor, No battle is ever the same. Any battle can go from a walk in a park to the most intense feeling of  "oh we're srewed" you have ever felt, just because one enemy decided to de-buff you.\n\nThat being said if you dont like unreasonable amounts of damage, or instakills, or the table turning battle, and prefer a slower paced, reasonable damage, and no doubt what so ever. Try for a diffrent gsame. Otherwise give this a shot.\n\nYou should try to play all the other games before this one.

There are attacks and spells, buffs and debuffs, resistances and weaknesses. Enemies have attack patterns which can be predictable at times.\n\nThere are numerous pots. Equipment wise, you can equip a weapon, a headgear (hat), an armor, and 3 flairs (badges for small bonuses).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wheretheuniat/recommended/265610/","wheretheuniat","Nepgear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wheretheuniat/","49 products in account","This game is a joke, being a parody of Final Fantasy,\nBUT\nIt's not a joke.\n\nNot only does this include a difficulty system that actually tells you everything major that changes (Besides things like the Bomb Slimes and Purple Squids entering battle with nine poison stacks on Epic) but the game is still reasonably difficult without putting it on Epic, unless you're so used to Epic that in your second playthrough on on a sequential save half of the enemies one-shotting you in the power plant due to you being two levels underleveled feels normal. My first experience with Epic was nearly getting killed on the first battle in the game, gg. What truly makes this game difficult is Epic is insanely hard, but you can adapt to it. You can get hit by the enemies and survive, and most things that the enemies can do aren't out of your power, unlike a lot of games you see today. It puts the player and the enemies on nearly equal ground, but manages to still keep the game reasonably difficult. That is a sign that the game's difficulty is well designed.\n\nThis game contains parodic references to almost every game in the book that your childhood was composed of. My favorite cluster of references is the graveyard in Graybone Cemetery, there are many tombstones on one screen, a few of them are damaged, but the ones that aren't contain jokes that are mostly references of some sort. This is only a pinch of what is included in the actual game, though.\n\nThe dialogue in this game somehow keeps a decent balance between "Absolutely hilarious and cannot be taken seriously" and "Deep storyline" despite the final boss being *SPOILER* a cat god.\nI think my favorite thing about the dialogue in this game is either the fact that there is a one-liner for nearly every skill in the game, or the fact that dialogue can randomly trigger when walking around the map, and these times it's at it's funniest. There is one cluster of dialogue where Lance is staring at highschoolers and Natalie calls him a pedophile. Another is a conversation between Matt and Lance where Matt seems to be trying to explain to Lance that despite all the cameras he apparently has in his posession that he uses to stalk Natalie, it's still stalking and over the top stalking at that. The items even get some of this amazing humor, every one having a one-liner for a description. Achievements even get thrown into this bucket, there is one that nearly everyone knows about for clicking Natalie's boobs.\n\nThe only negative that comes to mind is the lack of an optimized full screen resolution and no access to STEAM features ingame, besides syncing, achievements, and cards. However this is understandable for a game ported from flash.\n\nThere isn't much to say about art style, it's not super duper flashy, and it definitely doesn't try to be edgy. It just tries to be cartoonish, cute, and funny, as it should.\n\nI can't say much about the music, purely because music is almost never my main focus. Although I can say the music is definitely catchy and worth listening too, HFX definitely did a good job in my opinion.\n\nThis game has very nice replayability too, but the story isn't really the strong suit. I personally replay for the comedy and the challenge, and I do NG+ to get gear and etc. I didn't grab the first time around.\n\nOverall, Matt deserves much more attention than he gets, but should never stop being a semi-solo developer. When you work with a lot of people and publishers, games like this are only dreams.","December 7, 2015","true","42.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seeing the series evolve as much as it has, finally reaching an actual release on Steam? It's a great sight.\n\nI've never been a fan of JRPGs, but I never found EBF to be frustratingly difficult. It requires the right enough amount of micromanagement, planning, and strategy to appeal to both casual and hardcore RPG players. It's also got a very parody-minded sense of humor that's usually quite fun and rarely runs dry. One example in it's favor is South Park: The Stick of Truth, which I did like for it's humor, but the tongue-in-cheek delivery kind of killed it for me halfway. EBF doesn't do that, and I'm glad about that.\n\nWhile my only real complaint would be the relative lack of backstory to cover the events of past games for those who might be new to these games, it's never so drawn out and overly complicated to not pick up on quickly. If you're looking for a new RPG to add to your library, I'd definitely make no higher recommendations.","November 30, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has over 72 hours worth of game play(which is becoming more rare in newer games) and four difficulties for even further challenge. There are many skills you can learn in the game and some are character specific while some can be learned buy multiple characters to add strategy to the game. In addition to many skills, there are many different types of equipment, each with their own special effect and stats. Aside from the excellent game play, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 has great music that really sets the tone for the game in each area. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is definetely worth the $12 since most games that have 24+ hours gameplay cost 5+ times as much. Very excited that the developer will be making an Epic Battle Fantasy 5.

You start with 1 and quickly collect the rest of your party.\n\nMinor spoiler for party formation if you play previous games:  You start as the new game character instead of any of the original characters.\n\nCombat is really simple yet can be indept. There are attacks and spells, buffs and debuffs, resistances and weaknesses. Enemies have attack patterns which can be predictable at times.\n\nThere are numerous pots. Equipment wise, you can equip a weapon, a headgear (hat), an armor, and 3 flairs (badges for small bonuses). While you can not craft any items, you can upgrade them to improve their existing stats and sometimes add new ones.\n\nStory is cheeky and predictable.

I'm surprised by just how much I enjoyed this.\nThe skills are cool, and some are amusing (Like dropping a tank on top of your enemies), and I was playing simply to unlock more skills to see what they were like.\n\nThere isn't a lot of dialogue, and most of it's just random comments from the characters when you use new attacks are find something new, etc. Although not really bad in a game like this, it'd be better if there was more story to it, no matter how much seriousness said story lacks.\n\nIt's not all that difficult if you play on normal, most enemies are some kind of creature crossed with an element, and so have weaknesses, you get a scan bot that lets you see said weaknesses so honestly as long as you don't forget to keep your weapons and skills diverse you're going to be fine. Each area generally has a focus on one or two elements, so you can focus on those with your weapons as well.\n\nThe shop so far has been pretty pointless. I've not completed it yet, but I've literally only bought a few coffees from it before a boss, you don't really use items enough to use up the ones you find, and the weapons you find are generally good as well. Getting materials for crafting is simply a case of grinding as well.\n\nBetter quests would be good, it seems all the npc's just want food, even just a "kill n monsters" or something would keep it more interesting. Just going out and fighting is fun enough in itself though, so it's not really a big issue.\n\nI feel like I've complained a bit about it, but despite everything I've said, the game is genuinly enjoyable, which is generally the biggest factor in a game.","December 28, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wheretheuniat/recommended/265610/","wheretheuniat","Nepgear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wheretheuniat/","49 products in account","This game is a joke, being a parody of Final Fantasy,\nBUT\nIt's not a joke.\n\nNot only does this include a difficulty system that actually tells you everything major that changes (Besides things like the Bomb Slimes and Purple Squids entering battle with nine poison stacks on Epic) but the game is still reasonably difficult without putting it on Epic, unless you're so used to Epic that in your second playthrough on on a sequential save half of the enemies one-shotting you in the power plant due to you being two levels underleveled feels normal. My first experience with Epic was nearly getting killed on the first battle in the game, gg. What truly makes this game difficult is Epic is insanely hard, but you can adapt to it. You can get hit by the enemies and survive, and most things that the enemies can do aren't out of your power, unlike a lot of games you see today. It puts the player and the enemies on nearly equal ground, but manages to still keep the game reasonably difficult. That is a sign that the game's difficulty is well designed.\n\nThis game contains parodic references to almost every game in the book that your childhood was composed of. My favorite cluster of references is the graveyard in Graybone Cemetery, there are many tombstones on one screen, a few of them are damaged, but the ones that aren't contain jokes that are mostly references of some sort. This is only a pinch of what is included in the actual game, though.\n\nThe dialogue in this game somehow keeps a decent balance between "Absolutely hilarious and cannot be taken seriously" and "Deep storyline" despite the final boss being *SPOILER* a cat god.\nI think my favorite thing about the dialogue in this game is either the fact that there is a one-liner for nearly every skill in the game, or the fact that dialogue can randomly trigger when walking around the map, and these times it's at it's funniest. There is one cluster of dialogue where Lance is staring at highschoolers and Natalie calls him a pedophile. Another is a conversation between Matt and Lance where Matt seems to be trying to explain to Lance that despite all the cameras he apparently has in his posession that he uses to stalk Natalie, it's still stalking and over the top stalking at that. The items even get some of this amazing humor, every one having a one-liner for a description. Achievements even get thrown into this bucket, there is one that nearly everyone knows about for clicking Natalie's boobs.\n\nThe only negative that comes to mind is the lack of an optimized full screen resolution and no access to STEAM features ingame, besides syncing, achievements, and cards. However this is understandable for a game ported from flash.\n\nThere isn't much to say about art style, it's not super duper flashy, and it definitely doesn't try to be edgy. It just tries to be cartoonish, cute, and funny, as it should.\n\nI can't say much about the music, purely because music is almost never my main focus. Although I can say the music is definitely catchy and worth listening too, HFX definitely did a good job in my opinion.\n\nThis game has very nice replayability too, but the story isn't really the strong suit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wheretheuniat/recommended/265610/","wheretheuniat","Nepgear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wheretheuniat/","49 products in account","This game is a joke, being a parody of Final Fantasy,\nBUT\nIt's not a joke.\n\nNot only does this include a difficulty system that actually tells you everything major that changes (Besides things like the Bomb Slimes and Purple Squids entering battle with nine poison stacks on Epic) but the game is still reasonably difficult without putting it on Epic, unless you're so used to Epic that in your second playthrough on on a sequential save half of the enemies one-shotting you in the power plant due to you being two levels underleveled feels normal. My first experience with Epic was nearly getting killed on the first battle in the game, gg. What truly makes this game difficult is Epic is insanely hard, but you can adapt to it. You can get hit by the enemies and survive, and most things that the enemies can do aren't out of your power, unlike a lot of games you see today. It puts the player and the enemies on nearly equal ground, but manages to still keep the game reasonably difficult. That is a sign that the game's difficulty is well designed.\n\nThis game contains parodic references to almost every game in the book that your childhood was composed of. My favorite cluster of references is the graveyard in Graybone Cemetery, there are many tombstones on one screen, a few of them are damaged, but the ones that aren't contain jokes that are mostly references of some sort. This is only a pinch of what is included in the actual game, though.\n\nThe dialogue in this game somehow keeps a decent balance between "Absolutely hilarious and cannot be taken seriously" and "Deep storyline" despite the final boss being *SPOILER* a cat god.\nI think my favorite thing about the dialogue in this game is either the fact that there is a one-liner for nearly every skill in the game, or the fact that dialogue can randomly trigger when walking around the map, and these times it's at it's funniest. There is one cluster of dialogue where Lance is staring at highschoolers and Natalie calls him a pedophile. Another is a conversation between Matt and Lance where Matt seems to be trying to explain to Lance that despite all the cameras he apparently has in his posession that he uses to stalk Natalie, it's still stalking and over the top stalking at that. The items even get some of this amazing humor, every one having a one-liner for a description. Achievements even get thrown into this bucket, there is one that nearly everyone knows about for clicking Natalie's boobs.\n\nThe only negative that comes to mind is the lack of an optimized full screen resolution and no access to STEAM features ingame, besides syncing, achievements, and cards. However this is understandable for a game ported from flash.\n\nThere isn't much to say about art style, it's not super duper flashy, and it definitely doesn't try to be edgy. It just tries to be cartoonish, cute, and funny, as it should.\n\nI can't say much about the music, purely because music is almost never my main focus. Although I can say the music is definitely catchy and worth listening too, HFX definitely did a good job in my opinion.\n\nThis game has very nice replayability too, but the story isn't really the strong suit. I personally replay for the comedy and the challenge, and I do NG+ to get gear and etc. I didn't grab the first time around.\n\nOverall, Matt deserves much more attention than he gets, but should never stop being a semi-solo developer. When you work with a lot of people and publishers, games like this are only dreams.","December 7, 2015","true","42.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the only one in the series I've played, so I don't know how it compares.","January 31","true","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Always wanted a game that pulled it all together.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the character design (at least for humans) outside of battles, as it seems inconsistent with the rest presented. A few of the inventories could stand to be combined instead of having a separate one for equipping and upgrading. Those are the only two glaring flaws I'd noticed\n\nExcellent battles, characters, weapons, items. Oh and the art is gorgeous, staying true to the style but looking more clear and pretty than ever. Awesome game.\n\nTL;DR 10/10 would earn "Pervert" again.","December 26, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you love Final Fantasy, or Chrono Trigger, or Golden Sun, or really any rpg ever I almost guarentee that there is something here for you. The story, while geared more toward the 12-25 age range, is still an enjoyable, simple story that lays itself out nicely throughout the story. The gameplay flows very well, and it is very easy to notice that there was time put into making the characters and abilities balanced and scale throughout the game. While the game can be very easy when using the corresponding elemental rock,paper,scissors equipment to fight enemies, the battles can still be very long and challenging, making the title of "Epic Battle" very evident, especially on epic mode. The art is very well done, and the music fits the game incredibly.\n\nIt's also important to note that the other three games in the series are FREE online, so if you want a primer to what you will be getting you can go play those aswell, which I would also recommend.\n\nAll in all, this game, and this series, was a great effort by Matt Rosak and HalcyonicfalconX.

It's the first of the series to be on steam, as the others were browser games on websites like Kongregate and Armor Games. I  remember playing one of the EBF games, although I don't remember which one. I don't remember much, so I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nThere are quite a few unique mechanics in EBF 4. First, the backup mechanic requires one of your four people to be in "backup", and therefore not fighing, who can be switched in without using a turn. At first I hated the mechanic, but I grew attached to it and it does make for some interesting situations. Second, when you win a battle, you get AP. This is how you obtain and upgrade skills, as not a single skill is learned through leveling. Skills in the "special" catagory can be learned by two or more different party members, but only one can actually learn it. For example, Anna and Natalie can both learn heal, but if Natalie knows it, then Anna can't. Which, I recommend you do just that, but that's just what I do.\nThere is also "waves" system where if a battle has three waves, you have to clear out three screens worth of enemies. This is backed by the fact that all enemies are on the map, and you can engage them at any time and flee at any time, with the only punishment for flee being that the hurt or killed enemies reset.\n\nOne of the things I love about this game is that both hardcore RPG fans and newcomers to RPG's can both enjoy the game. There are ten elements and twelve status effects, every enemy has unique resistances and weaknesses to elements, statuses, and debuffs, your party's weapons give them elemental normal attacks and armor give elements and status resists and weaknesses, a complex upgrading system with a large array of crafting materials, and the HUGE amount of skills is insane! We've got buff spells, debuff spells, elemental spells, partially elemental and partially physical, spells that damage and may caused status effects, spells that damage and may debuff enemies, spells that take away enemy buffs, take away your team's debuffs, limit breaks, spells that element changes depending on the weapon you use, spells that power up in certain conditions, spells with lots of power but debuff your character, HOLY CRAP, I'm geeking out! At the same time though, the first time you use a certain spell, or get hit by a certain attack one of your characters says some, whether it be funny (most of the time because the spell speaks for itself and doesn't require explanation), or it be important information like saying the Barrier and Heal More spells are really important (which they are probably the game's two most important spells.)\n\nGraphically, the overworld looks much different than the battle graphics, but both serve their part well. The story isn't impressive, but it certainly gets the job done, especially considering the game is lighthearted and never takes itself too seriously. Until the final boss. That's some dark crap right there. Also, I feel the need to say this. I won't spoil anything, but I had Anna and Natalie at 31, Lance and Matt at 32, and didn't even use Lance. I changed my armor sets according to the different forms for maximum effieciency. The fight took me an hour, no joke. Speaking of the final boss, the music in the game is great. Not Shovel knight is Mega man levels of great, but pretty close in my opinion. Oh yea. The final boss theme is great. The game's lighthearted theme and humor is one of the things that kept me engaged. I loved laughing the hilarious and silly dialogue, as it just added a unique spice to the battles.\n\nIf I had to find some complaints I had, they would be few, but the one big issue I had that there is a bunch of optional content, and I wanted to do as much as possible, but it just wasn't as interesting as the main quest. There is a whole bonus area with upgraded versions of the bosses in the main story, but fighting the same enemy with better numbers and a few more tricks just... isn't engaging as fighting them for the first time. But the big kicker that killed my motivation for the bonus area was that you don't get any EXP, AP, or gold from the fight. If I got even a little, I might have gone a bit farther, but I didn't even feel up to getting past the second boss.\n\nOverall though, it's amazing. Definetly in my Top 20 or maybe 15 favorite games I've played. Top 10 would be a bit of a stretch, but it's possible. Get it if you are a hardcore RPG fan or want to start getting into RPG's. I mean, I've played RPGs ever since I was 6, I know a good RPG when I see one. And this is a good RPG.\n\nTL;DR Read the last few sentences.","June 24, 2015","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's as much stratagy as it is action. With the multitude of skills available and diffrent weapons and armor, No battle is ever the same. Any battle can go from a walk in a park to the most intense feeling of  "oh we're srewed" you have ever felt, just because one enemy decided to de-buff you.\n\nThat being said if you dont like unreasonable amounts of damage, or instakills, or the table turning battle, and prefer a slower paced, reasonable damage, and no doubt what so ever. Try for a diffrent gsame. Otherwise give this a shot.\n\nYou should try to play all the other games before this one. Because there is a bit of a story line.\n\nRate 10/10\n\n\n\n\nAll Hail Godcat","July 21, 2015","true","42.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it for about $2.50 and at that price I heartily recommend it. Anyone who likes turn based fights like FF or Pokemon will enjoy this. The humor isn't bad although there are a lot of running jokes from the previous games, so if you're not into the series you probably won't be into this. 100% achievements in 25 hours pretty damn good for a flash game.\n\nOnly downsides are some performance issues due to being flash (usually can be fixed with a restart) and low replayability once you've done everything in the game once. NG+ is more of a grind for an achievement than a chance to play around with early enemies with end game skills and gear since the enemies scale with you from start to finish.","December 25, 2015","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
