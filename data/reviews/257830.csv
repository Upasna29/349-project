The environments are a tad creepy in nonsensical, illogical and flat out bizarre type of way, much like Wonderland, Oz or where ever Corinne took place, are.\nAnd to all those "there is no story line" complainers out there please explain to me how Alice in Wonderland made any sense at all, ever, in either book or any of the countless movies (and movie remakes).  Violett's entire storyline occurs during the preliminary movie, and has absolutely no bearing on the adventure.\n\nPuzzles: Unique and with some very obscure clues at times, plus the gamer really has to look at the details in the background to realize what to do in some cases.  Good for that out of the box thinking and improving those observational skills.  The logic for the puzzles is there, a tad obsure at times, I admit, but if the gamer takes the TIME to LOOK FOR and TALK TO all the characters, the characters will explain pictorially what to do.\n\nWorst puzzle: Chimneys.  Not difficult to figure out just timed.  I knew what to do but was highly frustrated by the fact it took so long to do it.  Only time I needed a hint, and the hint I needed was that the puzzle was timed.  (It would have been easier to do with a reset button too.)\nA side note to the puzzles and overall concept: this game makes far more sense and is far easy to play then Limbo.\n\nWhile playing watch Violett.  If she makes a negative Uh-huh sound while vertically moving her hands the gamer is on the wrong track.  If she puts her hand under her chin in a thoughtful pose then the gamer is on right track.  She is the best clue giver in the game.\n\nFor most gamers I would say the biggest drawback is actually taking the TIME to look around and examine the objects while thinking about what to do and where to do it.  Half way through the game the gamer starts accumulating an inventory which needs to be used in another environment.\n\nCollecting orbs:  In my first playthrough I collected 80+, 90+, 90+ of the orbs.  Unfortunately some of the green orbs are so well hidden the gamer needs a guide to find them. (They are invisible basically and the gamer needs to know exactly where they are.)   Collecting orbs takes TIME, a keen eye, and just a bit of intuitive thinking.  They are needed for the end game, so the more the gamer has, the better off the gamer is. (I highly recommend Dspecht's orb hunting guide.)\n\nOverall: Wonderful game with whimsical if not fantiful music.  Simple yet highly detailed environments. Logic puzzles based solely on the "thinking" of illogical characters (In other words, what to do would make sense to them, not us.)  Admittedly the end game surprised me, I definitely was not expecting it.\n\nBiggest drawback: TIME.  From all the reviews and comments I have read after I played this game time seems to be the biggest complaint.  This game took me a couple of hours to play through the first time, in a very leisurely and casual manner.  I enjoyed it immensely, looking at the detailed environments, chuckling over the diary pages, and simply shaking my head in amusement at the overall bizarreness.  This is not the type of game to speedrun or meant to do as fast as possible.  This game is meant to casually stroll through, while doing things like solve puzzles.  If an action packed speedrun type of game is what you want then this is not the game for you.","July 11, 2015","true","35.6"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","44","50","3","2"

The best puzzle-adventure games use subtle signalling to show the user what's possible and have a sort of internal logic and consistency.  Violett is not really one of these games.  There were a number of really nice "Oh hey, this situation reminds me of this thing I saw a couple rooms back maybe I can use that oh look it worked" bits, but maybe 20% of the time what you were required to do made no sense at all and it just degenerated into "click random things on the screen until something changes."  Especially the parts where there are several on/off switches strewn about the screen and you get to guess which ones should be set which way.\n\nThey probably knew this sort of thing happened, which is why they put in the hinting system.  Unfortunately, even if you take the hint for what you're supposed to do there's still no guarantee that you can actually do it: the controls are often fidgety and difficult to get to work with a mouse, something that was especially frustrating in the later parts of the game where you had to actually time actions properly.  I'm guessing the controls were actually designed for a tablet of some sort.\n\nThe first part of the game is by far the most irritating, due to needing to getting used to the controls and on account of the illustration-based explanation style.  Probably they did that in order to avoid needing translation, but sometimes the explanatory illustrations are as mysterious as much of the rest of the game.\n\nSpeaking of translation, they clearly didn't get anyone native to look at their English.  Fortunately it's all flavor text so you can ignore it.\n\nAll that said--it's not actually bad, so pick it up if it's on sale or something.  Just expect to spend the first 30 minutes cursing.\n\nGeneral disclaimer:  I don't generally play casual point-and-click games, which might account for some of the controls difficulties.  I do like and play puzzle solving games.","March 21, 2014","false","8.3"," 48 of 58 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","48","58","0","0"

I've gotten two of the jewellery pieces, and have solved a few of the puzzles. The controls are a little clunky, but once you get used to how they work it gets a lot easier. That's another thing I liked - this game isn't too easy!\n\nToo many modern games seem to hold your hand a lot and have really easy puzzles with a default easy setting that you have to ramp up to "hard" so it's not boring (vanity difficulty?). Not this one; I find that it defaults to challenging.\n\nViolett reminds me of older games that you kind of had to walk away and stew on them a bit to figure out.  I have had it crash a few times, but it autosaves well and reloads without issue, but that may have to do with the game setting I've chosen. I haven't had it "stick" in places like other users have mentioned. I did start with the hints turned off, and when I got stuck on the drawer puzzle I turned it on. Unfortunately, the hints stayed off. Looks like I'll have to solve it the old fashioned way. It's probably for the best, doing it on my own will be a lot more rewarding!\n\nDespite the minor operational issues, I REALLY like this game. Lush, vibrant environments and a lovely sountrack to boot. It's very charming! With the sale going on right now it's really worth the time and investment.

Not necessarily because the puzzles are extremely hard or because the game play is terrible. Simply because it's a point and click puzzle game and they tend to come with their own brand of problems.\n\nThat said, I found Violett enjoyable. (For the record, if you don't like point and clicks, don't play this. It will drive you up the wall. I've seen a few reviews by people who said they don't usually play point and clicks, so why on earth did they play this?)\n\nThere are a few bugs to the game:\n*The cursor doesn't always seem line up with what I'm trying to click on, some times there are more technical bugs (I personally didn't run into any, but there are reports).\n*Some of the puzzles don't make the most sense.\n*There are a few plot holes (the Diary is referred to as Uncle's diary. Is it her Uncle? Is that why her family moved there when she is clearly more a city girl?)\n*Achievements aren't always rewarded as advertised (I got Sherlock Holmes in a game that I used hints but have still yet to be granted Supercharged...)\n\nThe game feels like it was designed for a touch screen. The recommended setting is for a swipe setting, which doesn't always translate to mouse movement well.  Which, thinking about it, is probably why the mouse cursor doesn't always line up right. A finger working as the cursor would have a much larger interaction than the mouse cursor. I definitely had the sense in the beginning of "What the hell am I suppose to be doing?" It's hard to determine what's interactable environment and what's not.\n\nOn the other hand, the music is delightful and subtle. The puzzles aren't repetative, which is a frequent problem I have in point and clicks. Once you figure out the quirks of the game, they're fairly consistant over the entire game. The Diary has wonderful insights in to the world you're running around in and I'd really love to see more of this, maybe in a sequel? (Seriously though, I'm never going to look at garden gnomes the same.) I'll fully admit, I don't mind replaying the game over and over, trying to get the achievements (I'm at run through #4 now, trying to get Supercharged).\n\nSo, while not my most favorite "OMFG you have to play this" game, it's definitely been a delightful little game and I've enjoyed working on it.","December 8, 2014","true","16.0"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","24","24","0","1"

You might have some inventory items and you may need to backtrack every so often in order to get all the pieces. All that stuff is in Violett, if you're a fan of something like the Monkey Island series you'll feel right at home here. Violett differentiates itself through its mysterious nature\n\nViolett is a world where nothing seems to make sense and there’s a lack of cohesion between levels, and that’s a good thing. It represents how crazy this world Violett is in and keeps things fresh and non-repetitive.\n\nThere’s no comprehensible language, as such you learn everything about the world visually and through interactions with other characters. They do have speech bubbles but they’re filled with various pictures/drawings and from that you have to solve the puzzles.\n\nWhile this helps the narrative of Violett and brings a sense of mystery and wonder, it’s also where a large portion of the frustrations come from. Sometimes objectives are unclear and you’ll spend more time trying to work out what the objective is rather than trying to solve the puzzle. Violett does its best to alleviate this issue but it doesn’t always succeed.\n\nViolett features a really nice soundtrack, though they feel more like compositions than BGM. It comes free with the game so you may as well give it a listen! The songs for the most part are well choreographed with the background images.\n\nThe scenery is of a high standard and there’s enough going on that you can spend a large amount of time just taking it all in. In saying that Violett does seem to stand out very harshly in some of the environments and while it can be said this is to show how she’s out of place, it sometimes ruins these amazing backdrops. This isn’t always the case though and is only something you notice in the more simplistic levels.\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Potentially serious bugs. Buy at your own risk.\n\nLong version:  You play as Violett, a young girl trapped in fantasy world trying to piece together an amulet to get home. The game starts quite promisingly with a nice cutscene and some excellent artwork. It really seemed like an interesting world to dive into and even if the heroine of the story was very silent it seemed like she would be given a lot of personality (like in Machinarium). I only played for about an hour and a half  though (according to Steam) with a break inbetween, so don't take this as a review of the whole game.\n\nThe reason I quit was because there does not seem to be much beneath the surface. The interface is incredibly clunky and seems to be suffering from "I'm designed to work on a phone"ites. It is impossible to even guess what will happen when you click something and sometimes you have to click multiple times to get it to work. It is also hard to click precisely on something when several items are near. So thank you for the "Keep clicking pointless things" achievement game... I like being insulted by the games I play when I have a good reason to blame the game for the problems.\n\nThe absolutely biggest problem though is the lack of feedback though. You click on something and Violett shrugs... can she do nothing with it? Do I need I item to use on it? Do I need to click something else first? No clue. Hell, there are some items that you can drag and others that you can't. You better hope you realize when you can because otherwise nothing will happen... or as with the wheel in the caterpillar room, it will do something which means you won't realize you can move it unless you accidently drag it. Speaking of the caterpillar... he asks for a ring to give me the key. I give him a ring, he takes it. Nothing happens. Talk to him again, he still wants a ring? Was it the wrong ring, but he took it? Does he want two rings? Is it just a bug and I should restart from before I gave it to him? Not a clue.\n\nAdd in the mazelike hubworld that you have to run around to get to different places that is a complete waste of time and also have deadends... nah. A game needs goodwill for me not to be annoyed by timewasters like that, and Violett has none. I would not recommend buying or playing Violett. Maybe it gets better later on, but I doubt it and I will not try to find out.","October 28, 2014","false","1.3"," 51 of 71 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","51","71","2","2"

This is hard to do because if only these game would have a couple of details done right, the experience would be so much different.\n\nLet's start with the positive things. The visuals are really well done, they are colorful and kind of trippy at times and that's awesome. I love it. Have you ever watched Coraline? You know, the creepy movie that doesn't look like it's going to be creepy so it's even more creepy? Well, this game seem to be heavily inspired by Henry Selick's film so if you liked it, this game should call your attention. The soundtrack is kind of good, I guess, it's not something mindblowing but it does goes well with the lore of the game.\n\nSadly... that's about it.Puzzles in this game are horribly bad done and you start noticing it at the very beggining of the game. They just make no sense,  most of the times I actually solve a puzzle I have no idea how I did it and when I do, I realise there is no logic to it. I frequently find myself just clicking around and hoping something happens, because when I think I have figured something out I realise that is not the way this game wants it be done.\nThe actual story of this game is not much better. Since there is no actual dialog, the only input you have from the characters is from communication bubbles showing drawings inside them (kind of like The Sims showing you what they want or what the are talking about). They mostly show items as hints but the problem is that it's difficult to understand what is being told or how you are going to do what you think is being asked. Actually, this game tends to not explain me where I'm going or what I'm doing and sometimes I end up picking items at random that I don't know how to use.\nThis is this game in a nutshell: completly confusion and frustration with a beautiful package.\n\nSo, should you buy it?Well, not at full price. At least I wouldn't recommend it. But if you can catch it on a bundle or with a discount you might want to try it. Also, I would like to keep track on the developer's next work. I expect Forever Entertainment to learn from this mistakes and make an awesome game to recompense for this one :)","July 7, 2015","false","1.8"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","0"

It is quite an engaging atmosphere to traverse as you go from each distinctly different room to the next.\n\nYou start in a cage and you are on your own from there.  It can be rather daunting trying to figure out what you are supposed to do, even from the get go, and you are going to be doing a lot of random clicking on objects that are both identified by a cursor change to let you know that an object is intended to be used or picked up, as well as interactive objects that you are offered no cursor change to signify whether or not it is something that can be used, picked up, or perhaps intended to later be used as part of the seemingly random puzzles that each room offers.  There will be lots of orbs that you pick up, with no explanation whether these are merely collectables (which they are as it turns out, so far as I have noticed--I am just past the first "part" of the game) or "inventory objects" for puzzles.\n\nIf you don't mind thinking WAY outside of the box and relying mainly on experimentation (or a walkthrough) than this game has a lot to offer.  It breaks the traditional mold of a point and click adventure game, and I have yet to decide whether this is a good thing or a bad thing.  I, personally, enjoy both point and click adventure games as well as hidden object games, and I grew up playing all of those silly Sierra and Lucasarts games that had you often using item in unexpected ways, so the culmination that is Violett is overall appealing to me.  It certainly won't be for everyone, but if you can pick it up cheap or in a bundle somewhere, it is definately worth taking a look at.  There is something very luring about the abstract areas that you explore, and while some parts are hair-pullingly frustrating, other parts cannot help but make you smile and want to see where else this odd game is going to take you.","March 19, 2015","true","3.1"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

The initial premise evokes strong deja-vu of Coraline almost to the point of feeling like a blatent ripoff. You play Violett, a goth girl who moves into an old house and finds herself lost in a strange world - complete with a spider antagonist. This is where the simularities end however... as well as the depth of story. Simply put, if you're someone who prefers a heaping dose of narrative and gets annoyed when things are left vague, this game isn't for you. If you don't mind a game that gives you the breadcrumbs and encourages your own interpretations, you'll find an adventure reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland or The Neverending Story.\n\nEach scenery you'll encounter is incredibly imaginitive, from opera singing frogs who can control the weather with their voice, to haunted teapots that torment their owners. The puzzles can be frustrating, but for the most part are never truly illogical. At least, they're generally as logical as a Wonderland-esque world ruled by the phrase "we're all mad here" is capable of being. The overall aesthetic is unique and (I felt) fascinating. The soundtrack is alright and comes with the game automatically.\n\nAnd now the bad side. First off, the controls can more often than not be frustrating to deal with, especially if you're moving between several rooms at once. I also encountered some bugs. For example, one achievement failed to pop because one of the criteria glitched and I was forced to start a new game to complete it. Another bug involved ants that forced me to exit and enter the area several times to correct. The "boss fight" at the end is also a complete joke.\n\nBottom line, I would say the game is worth looking into if you're a fan of the aforementioned stories, but due to the potential problems with bugs I can't recommend paying full price.

That said, don't let the bug complaints in other reviews deter you.\n\nViolett. Admittedly, this is a tough one. I adored the music, the art style (the 2.5D in-game, not the 2D intro/ending), the colorful characters, the bug world, and the goals. I'm a fan of puzzle games and "collect-them-all" type of scavenger hunts, and I rarely have difficulty completing them on my own.\n\nHowever I simply could not complete Violett without a walkthrough. Many of the puzzles are ridiculously convoluted, and that's aside from the main 4 required for the Brain Overload achievement. The roof elevator puzzle alone nearly made me weep and ragequit.\n\nEven "simpler" puzzles are not at all intuitive. They could take hours of trial and error, especially:\n- If you miss a necessary item that you can only get in another scene (but you aren't told where);\n- If you move to one side of the screen, the scene elements can block the very thing you need to click on (e.g. the Kitchen & Garçon de cuisine achievement, or any number of orbs that are hidden from certain angles);\n- Any instance of "nope, can't have this/get there till you do this/find that/give this character X number of these";\n- If you don't figure out the specific puzzle mechanics or "logic", which are rarely or never explained.\n\nI'm not saying games should hold your hand through puzzles. That wouldn't present any challenge. But when the clues and/or a solution to a puzzle are so COMPLETELY off-the-wall and nothing you'd even think to try without tripping over it accidentally -- that's just bad foresight in the puzzle design itself.\n\nAnd then there are the doors. Oh god, the doors. Go in here, come out there. Go back in the same way, come out on a different level. Rinse, repeat. It's like a damn Benny Hill hallway chase scene, except you're the only one running around like a loon. Oh, and even worse, if you pull a lever/push a button in those scenes, every route changes and you have to figure it all out again. *facepalm*\n\nI do wish the characters had a bit more interesting/interactive elements instead of just being part of the scene or spouting chimpmunk-speed gibberish (sounded like Russian at some points) along with a single picture bubble as a "clue", but that limitation didn't really take away from [mostly] understanding what they wanted from you.\n\nYou WILL need a guide if you're going for the Supercharged achievement to collect all the orbs. Some of them are so hidden away it's like the devs don't want you to find things unless you click every spot on the screen. At least there aren't any click penalties, cuz man, would I be in trouble.\n\nSo why do I recommend the game?\n\nAside from the frustrations of the puzzles, I would still say Violett is a unique and fun experience. I didn't really mind using a text or video walkthrough for some most parts, because I could look past that and enjoy other aspects of the game, like the art, character design, "2.5D" level design, and silly Alice-like atmosphere. If you have no issues with "reading the directions" and then just enjoying it while you follow them, you may get the same level of enjoyment out of Violett that I did.\n\nIt's not a masterpiece by any definition, but even after a complete playthrough my mind drifts back to Violett's bug world now and again, and in that sense I would say the game is pleasantly unforgettable.\n\nI wouldn't get it at full price (mainly because the insane puzzle designs waste far more playtime than they should), but when it's on sale (especially for .99 cents), you should consider giving it a shot.","January 17, 2015","true","5.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","0"

The art is excellent, most (but not all) of the puzzles are challenging but not impossible, and I liked the hidden item collection. The Machinarium-style pictograms were a good choice, making localization a breeze.  Music was great too, and I appreciate the OST coming with the Steam release sale.\n\nThe Not So Good:\n\nThe hint system is TERRIBLE!  Totally tells you nothing you need to know. Plus, some of the puzzles aren't tremendously intuitive, and when you suddenly need to start backtracking after a series of self-contained rooms it's unexpected.  The hidden item aspect, which I do like, actually makes no sense in terms of mana since you never use it. I haven't tried, but I expect you can finish the game quite handily without picking up a single bit of mana throughout which makes it pointless except to gain an achievement.  Finally, there's the rather inexplicable ending scene which I suspect was intended to be interactive but somehow plays automatically.  Makes no sense in context, since you haven't seen or heard about this character from the beginning, so it's quite confounding.\n\nI should make special mention of the story, or rather the lack thereof. At the beginning, we are given a pretty bare-bones setup. Unhappy girl, taken to big house, finds amulet and gets sucked into another world.  And...that's pretty much all you get.  Other than a glimpse at the beginning of the game and a diary entry that you can easily miss out on, the player has NO CLUE who the villain at the end is. Even then, there's no indication if they're the one who brought you into this world. You also aren't given any idea what this place is, or how it's related to you. There's one reference that the diary belonged to your uncle, but that's the sole mention of him, so again we're lost.\n\nFinally, there are the bugs. I only had to restart the game from the beginning once (from the library) but others have had to do it multiple times. I also ran into a couple of graphical glitches towards the end. Better quality control should have been done before this was released onto Steam, for sure.\n\nOverall:\n\nDespite all that, I'd still recommend the game although you might need to look in the community for hints. It is undeniably charming, and that's a large part of it for me. I just wish there were a more engaging story to go with it.","December 16, 2013","true","10.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

This game didn't do that.

I would say it's about 50/50 whether I can recommend this game or not. If you enjoy classic style point and click adventure games, this one may strike a chord with you. However, it's also very frustrating and generally incredibly vague on what you need to do next. There's really no story associated with the game, and the only dialogue is in pictures and garbled voices, so there's no Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle style quips to keep you entertained, and no real cohesion between levels other than you're very small and in a sort of fantasy insect world.\n\nOverall, there have been times when I've enjoyed this game, and times that I've been so frustrated that I turned it off and went and did something else. And unfortunately, the latter has been more prevalent. The graphics in the game are cool, I really like the concepts that the designers came up with. The music is very well done, but it gets a little obnoxious playing on repeat if you get stuck on a certain level for a long time. For the most part it fits in well with the game, though.\n\nI've really enjoyed the design of some of the puzzles, like the cupboard with numbered drawers and the Mole Man water puzzle. However, a lot of the puzzles don't really seem like they're things that make you think, just things that make you click on a lot of different things or give up and use a hint. The elevator with the arrows, for example. I figured out the left and right part easily enough, but I never would have gotten the specific solution if I hadn't used a hint. And there are a lot of puzzles like this, unfortunately. With the updated hint system though, while it hurts my pride to admit defeat, I can still use a hint and get past it instead of being stuck and not being able to play the game any more.\n\nMy only compaint about the hints is that if I'm 90% through a level when I get stuck, if I haven't used any hints up to that point, it makes you use the hints in order. I have to use 4 hints just to get help with where I'm currently at. It would be nice if it would keep track of your level progress and grey out or skip hints that no longer apply to you.","January 4, 2014","false","6.8"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

I have to admit feeling a little lost at the beginning as there is no spoon feeding. You are plunged straight into an environment that encourages you to explore. I normally enjoy these sort of games but I find Violett frustrates me more than entertains me. I'm a good portion of my way in and I no longer have the satisfaction of solving a puzzle or the excitement of a new location.\n\nGraphically it is interesting and the imaginative game world, inspired by Alice in Wonderland, certainly adds a new dimension. Music is okay and helps set the atmosphere. But something is missing, something just doesn't quite gel.\n\nMost of the puzzles do make sense in their own, sometime surreal, way although I do find myself randomly clicking on things without a sense of direction when I'm stuck. Other times I've missed important clues that blended a little too well with the background or solved something by accident without really knowing what I did. A few puzzles were simple enough to solve but tedious to execute and my only satisfaction in completing them was I didn't have to do it again.\n\nMaybe part of what is missing, for me at least, is some sort of feedback mechanism. I feel detached from what is going on in the game. I can only make sense of the various scenes by what I see with my eyes. Violett does not attempt to enrich that with any further explanation, for example items that are picked up cannot be examined closer nor do they have labels. I've come across a few things that I have no idea what they are let alone what to use them for. Violett is also a little helpless when trying something that isn't valid. Just a shrug with little indication (in most cases) as to why it is not valid. It reminds me of those old school Text Adventures that had the default response "I can't do that". I'm never sure if it's because it is impossible in the game or I haven't satisfied all the prerequisites.\n\nIt must be noted that the controls are simplistic but unfortunately a tad clunky. They feel as they've been designed with a touch device in mind. I'm playing with a keyboard and mouse so that may be why.\n\nI can't not recommend this game as it certainly does have merit, it's reasonably executed and it has generated a lot of eager discussion and favourable comments in the forum, but for me I don't think I have the will to progress much further. If you enjoy puzzle based games then you may get something out of Violett but mileage will vary.\n","December 16, 2013","true","23.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rybrin/recommended/257830/","rybrin","Rybrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rybrin/","250 products in account","Violett is a delightful point and click game, though partially also a hidden object game, containing engaging puzzles, colorful and creative landscapes, and a memorable soundtrack. It's a bit of a blend between Coraline and Alice in Wonderland; you fall into this world of intelligent, sophisticated insects and tiny mammals, and are working towards freeing them from tyranny, and yourself from being tinier then a mouse.\n\nWhat I liked best about this game was easily the setting and the audio. The maps were colorful, a creative mix of exotic flavors and household objects, and the mini game of finding all of the hidden objects (there's an achievement involved with that) helps you explore and appreciate it a little more thoroughly. The music...it's charming, and cute, and gets stuck in your head easily. I'm a fool for a neat artstyle, and both the powers you use in the game, and the style of the game, reminded me a bit of Psychonauts. While the plot isn't directly spelled out for you, journal pages and direct observation provide the bulk of the simple, age-old story.\n\nMechanically, the game was decently smooth. It was always clear where you could go, the pathing was very fluid, and the animations never glitched or did anything unpredictable. There was no mad clicking, and whenever it required anything different then clicking, a helpful icon would appear at the bottom of the screen telling the player to drag the mouse in a certain direction.\n\nThere are a couple of known glitches at the time this review was made, though they didn't retract from the game. One is an unclickable orb, which does not prevent the achievement from granting, and the other is around an area called the Labyrinth, where the game crashes while saving. It saves successfully, and autosaves frequently, so you won't lose any progress, but might need to restart in that area a couple of times. While yes, it's not perfect, it hardly bothered me and was the last time I saw a glitch in the game, in that early area.\n\nThe major topic of the puzzles...The one every fears and has a great deal of conflict on, whether puzzles are understandable and readable, or if they are counter-intuitive and too hard. To my perspective, Violett is not difficult to understand. There's visual cues in every level, detailing what you should be focusing on. In every level, there's either interaction with NPCs who directly tell you what they require from you, or a visible problem that you must correct to proceed. A couple of the early levels are actually the toughest, involving long puzzles with back and forth steps required, and items from different areas necessary to complete puzzles from previous areas. The game actually gets progressively easier and more intuitive, which I wasn't expecting, the puzzles later on being far more isolated within their given screens or pathway forks.\n\nOver all calls? This game is worth playing for it's creative atmosphere and decent puzzles. It has a couple of issues, but the puzzles follow the logic of the story, and at no point did I ever hit a wall. New content and glitch fixes have been added recently, so it clearly gets attention from it's developers.\n\n\n((Ways to improve the game? More visual cues, looking at the reviews. Maybe unique sounds for when the screens are complete, or all the orbs are gone from a screen, or a puzzle mechanic is finished. The newly added content was maybe even a little better then the original content, and didn't feel forced or shoehorned in.))","March 14","true","11.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

There were some control/command issues that I found which made gameplay irritating in many places....including the boss fight. The plot lead in and ending could have been better, but the adventures during gameplay were interesting enough to keep me slogging through the control issues. I did love the artwork and animation. The solitary cut-scene was kind of random, but it's skippable. I finished the game with about 12 hours of game-play. It kept me entertained while I was sick.\n\nThat being said, I know the developers have recently mentioned finding bugs and working to fix said bugs. Patches have been rolled out etc. I'm certain with more time they will be able to smooth out the control issues, particularly if people are willing to let them know about them.\n\nI think I'm going to go ahead and be optimistic that more debugging in the future will help the game and go ahead and recommend it to others. But with a warning: if you are easily frustrated with buggy controls, don't bother until more debugging's been done. Currently I give it a 4 out of 10, but it has the potential to be much better with further debugging.","December 14, 2014","true","7.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

In addition, even though the story is largely derivative of Lewis Caroll's Alice in Wonderland, the diary pages do provide some interesting and amusing backstory to the characters that you meet along the way.\n\nIn terms of art style, Violett has some very pleasing hand painted 2D background art and the 3D models are not too shabby either. Also, don't fret about turning this game's graphical quality up to the highest. It barely causes the fan of my low end graphics card to spin faster.\n\nFinally, the puzzles and challenges of this game aren't too difficult provided that one has a keen eye in spotting patterns and hidden clues.

It would be nice if you got some hints about the remaining orbs once you'd beaten the game or something since they already have hints for the main game and it's less spoilery than looking up a guide that tells you outright where they are.\n\nThe boss fight feels a bit odd, standing out from the rest of the game mechanics-wise, but it gives meaning to collecting all those orbs which is more than a lot of other games bother to do. And it's not too hard once you get the hang of it. A practise room with a dummy would've been cool though, so you can have used the skills before fighting the big bad.\n\nUpdate: The free update was pretty good as far as I can tell: the new areas had fun, well thought-out puzzles. They fit in seamlessly and apparently there are other improvements which I didn't encounter when I replayed the game. (Possibly they were hints.) It was pretty decent of them to add free bonus content, improve graphics and more fixes to the game.","November 12, 2014","true","12.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

While the main aim is to find back home to her parent's house, she needs to solve lots of puzzles with many crosslinks. The graphics are nice and cute, the music is interesting like some film score.  She can only walk - in the beginning. Through her journey, she will find many balls/orbs in three different colors and three special glowing orbs that gives her special powers (jump, psychokineses and defense shield). The normal balls will fill the energy levels for all three powers.\n\nShe has to go to the same scenes several times to completely solve all puzzles and many orbs are hidden very well (sometimes they are invisible hidden). If you are stuck, you can get help with the icon circle in the lower right. If she speaks with animals, you only here some strange queeks with some words and speech bubbles explaining the required item in sketches.\n\nThe very first scene, where she is trapped in a cage, can only be played once - all other scenes can be visited again. There is an autosave feature but you might want to save your game already right in this first scene (in case you want to get all achievements by finding all orbs). You can also save your current game in new save slots, if you like. Unfortunately, the game "froze" a few times, i.e. Violett wasn't able to move anymore, everything else continued on the screen. But saving and restarting solved these issues.\n\n<SPOILER ON>\nThe very last scene is some kind of boss fight with the spider queen but I wasn't able to move Violett as I liked to. I somehow made it but this was just try and error and some luck. Too bad as an end for this nice puzzle adventure.\n</SPOILER OFF>\n\nDespite the few glitches, I recommend this time waster as it is challenging and has nice graphics, music and puzzles.","February 23, 2014","true","27.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Second off the controls in this game are just awful. There are no indications for doing anything right and the puzzles are overly simple. The only reason I had to use a walkthrough was because I wasn't sure if I was doing something right, simply because the controlling was so off. I couldn't beat the boss in the end because the fireballs wouldn't release. This game is definitely not worth $10.00 in my opinion.

While doing so, you'll be enjoying excellent background music, which is also included with the game as MP3s. Violett is a point-and-click adventure game, with elements of a hidden-object game. Not only are many objects with which you need to interact hidden, but there are also collectible "orbs" which (as far as I can tell) only earn you an achievement if you bother to collect them, in addition to diary pages which flesh out the mythology behind the fantastical creatures you encounter. The player is thus rewarded for carefully inspecting each landscape and interacting with everything. Overall, I found the puzzles to be pretty reasonable, though there are some needlessly repeated actions in a few cases.\n\nSimilarly to Journey of a Roach, the game does not include actual spoken dialogue (the words spoken are gibberish), but instead relies on pictographs to convey meaning. Mostly, this works pretty well, but in a couple of cases I found it hard to decipher the meaning of the pictograph, until I had inadvertently stumbled upon part of the solution to the puzzle at hand.\n\nHowever, that leads me to the issues I have with this game, the main issue being the control scheme. Actions typically involve either clicking on stuff (which works well), or dragging items from the inventory or from one place to another on the current screen. Unfortunately, it can be rather difficult to drag stuff, and I even had difficulty with something as simple as dragging items out of my inventory. This was a constant source of frustration, and the only positive I can say with regards to this control-scheme, is that the game will tell you when you have to interact with an object by dragging it.\n\nSecondly, the game is rather buggy at this point, with one patch just released. Several times, Violett would be stuck in a "can't do that" animation loop, and I was forced to quit to the main menu and resume the game to continue. Even worse, one puzzle forced me to repeatedly reload, so that it would reset to a state where I could exit it from my current position (the elevator puzzle). Similarly, I could not interact with a couple of items (plant-bulbs), even though I had obtained the prerequisites to do so, and missed a couple of diary pages due to this.\n\nThirdly, the actual plot is very sparse (due in part to the lack of dialogue), and the ending came as a bit of a surprise.\n\nHowever, if you are willing to put up with these issues, then I'll gladly recommend trying out Violett.","December 18, 2013","true","6.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is light on the story, but features some really interesting and beautiful environments. None of the puzzles are alike, although you begin to learn the logic behind the puzzle makers as you play through. Each room is a puzzle to be solved. Outside of a few rare cases, you shouldn't have to leave your current room for other items in order to solve the puzzles there. In the few cases when you do, the faries are asking for something that you know you can't find in your current room. On the downside, the game is quite buggy. I've been lucky that I only had a game stopping bug once. I was able to play through the rest of the game without too many issues. Most people are advising you make a new save for each new room you enter on the off chance you bug out. The developers are listening and have been patching to resolve some of these issues. Try everything. Some of the puzzle solutions are not obvious and take quite a bit of work to get there.","December 16, 2013","true","11.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It was on my wish list, and the artwork and video looked very pretty and engaging. While playing, I soon became aware that there are no real hints to help you figure out your path, you have to click on almost everything to figure out what moves what doesn't, no highlighting of items when hovered, no change of mouse clicker unless activating a button or such. I had to go through a couple of walkthrough's to figure out where I was missing something, realizing it's not just a fun push forward game like I expected, you have to backtrack alot. after 8 hours of gameplay, i came to a point where it seemed as if i should give 2 items to this in game avatar, so i did. This has since been the downfall which caused an action integral to move forward not to take place. Since it autosaved,which others in the discussion board said didn't happen, I lost the ability to go back 2 hours of game play and start there. So I am done with it now.\n\nWhat really makes it pointless is you collect orbs throughout the game which have no value on how it ends or your powers or anything but achievements. It has a difficult puzzle adventure game that is not kid friendly, although the art would make it seem so. It's just too difficult for a kid to get. I'd give this a 1 out of 5 if i could.

There are one or two translation errors in the found diary pages, but since they are 'only' flavortext, this does not matter much.\n\nThe puzzles are nicely tailored and make sense most of the time, but this is where my ranting starts.\n\nThe logic of the riddles is not very consistant leaving the player to simply grab unreachable objects by magic in one case, and completely ignoring this ability in another, similar case. Also there are some timing-based riddles, where you need to hit the right spot at the right time. The Bossfight - just so much: collect as much of those 'orbs' as possible, you will need them.\n\nEspecially the 'dynamic' puzzles and the 'swipe' mechanic might feel pretty alien to someone who is used to point and clicks, but I recon it a worthy experiment.\n\nAll in all the game is not as frustrating as it seems to be, it's not too short… just a nice, and really sweet looking short story.\n\n\n\nIt's absolutely charming, neatly drawn, and certainly worth your money if you like dream-like fantasy, insect kingdoms, 'shrunken characters', busy-picture games, magic, fairies, or just quirky non-mainstream art.","January 16, 2015","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonsbayne/recommended/257830/","dragonsbayne","DragonsBayne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragonsbayne/","53 products in account","If you like games that state the obvious such as you cannot use this item here or you need another part to complete this task, then this game is NOT for you. This game does not hold your hand.\n\nVO’s:\nThere are no VO's so to speak. If you can akin their speech to "SIM" talk, that's what you get here. They kind of chitter or chirp you could say. The basic story is about a teenage girl who is defiant to her parents, doesn't listen, you know the usual. Her and her parents have moved to this old house and while her parent are fighting she goes up to her room. She finds something that shrinks her to insect size and is now on a quest to get back to her parents while along the way helping the friendly little bugs and insects that reside within the walls of the house and outside. If you help them then they will in turn help you.\n\nHINTS:\nThere is a hint system, but not in the typical sense. This game does not use words to give hints but rather pictures. There is a circle in the bottom right hand corner of the screen that is quartered and numbered I, II, III, and IV. If you are unsure of what to do you can click on each section which gives you pictures of what to do next. Hovering over certain items will give you pictures as to what to do with that area. It's not easy as sometimes the clues don't always point out that you have to do something else in order to accomplish that task even when you use the hints in the bottom right.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe graphics are cute. They are bright, charming and very imaginative. Makes you think of what it would actually be like if bugs did live like this.\nSOUNDS:\nThe music and sounds are cute. It's not over bearing and doesn't drive you insane. Of course you can adjust it in options.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThis is a point and click adventure. Shoes will show up if you can travel to a certain spot. A door shows up when you can travel to another area. A hand shows up if you want to move something, which you click and hold then drag to the desired spot, or if you can slide a door open for instance. A speech bubble, with pictures of what one wants, will show up over characters you can interact with. These are your quests. You have a backpack that is in the upper right hand corner of the screen where your collectibles and usable objects are stored. You hover the mouse over it and click and drag the object to where it needs to go. You collect little green, blue and celadon orbs, which I think help with upgrading your powers. You also collect diary entries on the different species that are in the game. In the beginning you get the telekinesis power from a fairy. This is something you will use quite often. Some areas require you to dress a certain way in order to continue on to the next area. It seems hard but once you get used to the gameplay, you start figuring out what makes sense for each area. I never used the hints. You just have to put some thought into it, even if it doesn’t make sense. These are bugs we’re talking about here.\n\nThere is no choice for hard or easy that I saw. You can change the controls to touch or swipe. As an example, in the beginning you have to swing a cage back and forth and I found it easier to use the touch rather than swipe. I couldn’t get my mouse to swipe well. I recommend using a plug in mouse rather than the built in laptop mouse for this game. But to each their own.\n\nPUZZLES:\nThe puzzles are pretty easy. In the beginning for example you have to swing a cage back and forth to hit another cage next to you to get your telekinesis power, then you use that power to move things around so that you can get free from the cage. In the next area you have to distract something in order to get past it. In other areas you have to find objects that will complete something that can help you move from one side to the other or you may have to move ladders in a certain way in order to climb something. In another puzzle you have to divert water a certain way in order to acquire an object to use for another part of the area. Once you understand the mechanics, the games starts going faster.\n\nOVERALL:\nThis game is not for everyone. I loved it because it was different and I don’t like my hand being held. I liked the idea that they used pictures for what to do instead of words. I’m usually the type of person that doesn’t go with everyone else. So try it out first and this game may surprise you","February 8","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was hard to click on a few things and I can see some people getting frustrated with figuring out what the picture instructions/hints mean. There was a decent amount of world building in the game through these loose pages that you can find that are like a beastiary of the different characters you come across.

It's really cute and funny, and, what's important - you always have an ability to use hints, so the hardest puzzles can not ruin your enjoyment if you are not a hardcore player.\n\nI hadn't completed it yet, but the only bad thing about the game - is that it's remaster is much more buggy than original version, and, also, remaster don't work on my main PC on Windows XP, while the original do. Anyway, I bought it twice, so I can download older version from torrents, what I can suggest to you if you bought it and don't care much about cards, achivements and other playtime ruiners.\nSome can add to contras that it has some minor errors or illogical puzzles sometimes - but it still plays good. None of mentioned fatal bugs affected me in both remastered and original versions.\n\nUPD: Just finished. All the illogicallest puzzles looks really obvious on the second thought, after they've been completed. It's definetely worth playing. Sorry to see it lose it's cost so quickly and hope to see more games from dev team, especially - if they will be able to spend more time on game.

The visuals are obviously a labor of love, the characters silly but interesting, and there are tons of interactions and little easter eggs to find, without feeling like a cheesy hidden object game.  The lack of speech or text works, but having nothing but a symbol or two for a hint can definitely leave you lost. If you enjoy brain-bending logic puzzles that are usually pretty fair for the world they're in, this is your game. I don't think I met one puzzle that I felt was completely stupid, just lots that were a little too complicated or where I had been right but clicking slightly off. It's not an unqualified approval, however.\n\nNow for what's broken: I'm not 100% sure that all the earth globes are actually there. I've even tried following a globe walkthrough and got nothin'. The achievements are bugged; the wardrobe one doesn't trigger no matter how many times I change, and other people have lots of trouble getting a particular puzzle's achievement. The full journal one actually triggers BEFORE I get all the pages, as soon as I get the last page, in fact. (I went back and found more that I'd missed.)

If you get stuck too long there are supposed to be hints...but usually they were either completely unhelpful, or it was an action that you couldn't do just yet, or I'd miss it all together because if you're not paying attention you won't notice the faint sparkle that indicates your target. There are also sheets of with notes about some of the characters you seem to run into...but they fail to include any information on how to get past them.\n\nThen, when you finally think you've figured it out, the actions don't always work, or they require you just clicking repeatedly until they do what they should. I had only made it as far as the second room when attempting to control a buzzing fly drove me nearly insane with clicking.\n\nYou collect little stones but have no idea why. There's a little animation that appears in the corner sometimes indicating I should move my mouse side to side? I think? But I have no idea why. I'm not sure if it's a hint or what. Having no idea why seemed to be the theme generally.\n\nOn top of all this, the game was glitchy and had to be restarted a couple of times because all my actions froze, which I know was an issue with my friend playing as well.\n\nI love a good challenge, but randomly clicking all over a screen hoping something will happen is just frustrating and left me wanting my money back.","January 4, 2014","false","3.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But the logic behind the puzzles" is illogical.  Everything is difficult, simply because the solutions are so far from any classic point n click logic, that it's very frustrating.  For example, there is a puzzle which involves water and pipes.  Violett must activate valves to flow water.  But nowhere is there an indication where the source comes from to know which valve does what. Narrowing down what I thought would be the source pipe, turning valves in certain directions doesn't match with other combinations.  I had give in and use a guide.\n\nIn a nutshell, this game is impossible without a walkthrough.\n\nStory progression is messy and lazy. Off the start, we have no idea why Violett is in her "Wonderland".  I almost thought I missed a cutscene.  Violett meets all these characters which have no personality, and somehow as the player, you're supposed to want to solve their convoluted problems. But you don't know why they want help or have any interest.  You just want to get the puzzle done to see more of the game.  Then there's the completely pointless hidden object mechanic.  You can locate hidden orbs throughout the game - which I'm sure do nothing except give you an achievement - no idea.\n\nOh yes, there's the hint system.  The pathetic hint system - which is a puzzle itself trying to figure what the hand-drawn sketch mean exactly is more frustrating than rewarding.  And it's timed.  You'll find yourself clicking the hint button numerous times, just to get a long enough view of what the picture is supposed to represent.\n\nSuch a promising notion - a game with gorgeous visuals and abysmal logic design.  As a fan of Monkey Island, Torrin's Passage, King's Quest, Grim Fandango, Toonstruck, Day of the Tentacle, etc, Violett simply sucks.\n\nThe major basic reason Violett fails as a game, is that you puzzles are neither interesting or rewarding. You just want to see get them over with to "see" more of the game.\n\nI couldn't finish the game.  Sadly, this game has multiple bugs.  I came to a part called "Clock Tree" or "Tree Clock", I can't remember. But the game broke.  Violett is supposed to get 3 corks from a black ant.  But the ant and cork have disappeared from the game.  Numerous people have reported this same glitch, and supposedly a game patch came out before I purchased the game to fix this.  Well, it's still broken.  And since the game uses auto-save, apparently the only fix for me to restart the game.  Well, that's not going to happen.  I hope this review helps you avoid this broken game.\n","July 26, 2014","false","6.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The Trading cards on offer are currently selling at a very high price on market.\nCons:\n1. There is always lag when you click because of the character animations. So you cannot click twice or thrice quickly because the character animations need to complete after each click. This makes the whole experience a very frustrating one.\n2. There are many puzzles requiring quick clicking rather than intelligent solution. Combine it with the lag pointed above and you have the complete recipe for frustration.\n3. There are many instances when your click don't register because the click activation zone for an object doesn't match the artwork of the object itself. So if you have rod object, it has the same click activation zone as a balloon object. So clicking at one end of the rod object doesn't register a click.\n\nVerdict: 2/5 for me.

Seriously, her walk animation looks really silly on some of the paths that they make her take. This is also shown by orbs that are hidden in each scene that don't give the "clickable" mouse when you hover over them, which is the general basis of their replayability: to find all these orbs.\n\n-The music is also well done; it had quite the catchy main theme and enough tracks to have a different song for each area.\n\n-The puzzles not making any sense actually makes sense in the context of the game, as you are a young girl lost in a fantacy world where things really shouldn't make sense. This however, like stated by many of these other reviews, does not create a healthy game environment as a lot of the time you are just clicking objects randomly until the pieces start to "fit" together. To be honest, I only flew right through the first puzzle only because I watched a gameplay demo before playing, however, I was quite tied up on the next room and it took me nearly an hour to figure it out. The only reason I didn't stop there is because I'm a little biased towards it for its resemblence of Coraline, which I absolutely loved.\n\n-The thing I hated most about this game was the minimalistic gameplay, which is expected in a point-and-click adventure game, but this one was even more so. There were only a handful of mini-game puzzles and a couple times where you were timed on your actions, but outside of that, a lot of the time it's just you watching Cor... Violett walk across the screen to where you clicked only to watch her shake her head in shame. But even this didn't come close to how frustrating the end was. It looked like they had created an entire mini-game based around you actually fighting the main antagonist in the game (which really can't be called that because you don't really know it's the antagonist unless you read the flavor-text diary pages) but cut it out last minute and decided to turn it into a "cutscene" by having (spoiler) Violett defeat it in ONE throw of a fireball. JUST ONE ATTACK DEFEATS IT, AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET TO DO IT! It was the biggest let down I have ever experienced in a game before, the devs laughing like, "oh you wanted to do this? Too bad!". I'm probably exagurating this too much, as they probably just didn't have the time/will to script the battle scene, which is sad because it looked really fun.\n\n-I didn't run into any glitches that the other reviewers mention, however, there was a point where it seemed like it when she was on a ladder. Other than that, the game ran through it's scenes pretty well.\n\nTL;DR: Great art, seems like it was supposed to be a different game, terrible ending, hard to get into, great for any Coraline/Alice in Wonderland fan if they're persistant.","June 30, 2014","false","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While I can apreciate their attempt to tell a story with no actual dialogue, they werent thorough enough to give me any idea what the hell was going on after the game's intro. I was unable to understand Violett as a character or feel any sort of empathy for her.\n\nIn the beggining of the game, it was pretty much impossible to get trough the puzzles without hints, as the first few "rooms" you are presented with make no sense whatsoever, it's like trying to logic your way out of a fever dream.\n\nAlso, navigating an Escher maze to get trough the first 4 or so rooms? HATED IT SO MUCH MY BLOOD BOILS AT THE MEMORY.\n\nSo, uh, no, if you are a fan of pont and click adventures, look elsewere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiwiSalad/recommended/257830/","KiwiSalad","KiwiSalad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiwiSalad/","572 products in account","Violett is a point and click adventure game. It's story is told through your actions as violett, and the game's imagery(mostly without words, the diary pages being the exception). This is a really cool concept, letting the player discover the story through the gameplay and not the other way around. However even with the games very pleasant artwork, and smooth animations The game struggles.\n\nThe puzzles are very unintuitive, and the game carries very little direction for the player to follow. Most of the time spent in the game is wandering aimlessly around trying to figure out what to do next. A puzzle's hardness should not be defined by it's lack of clarity, in an attempt to elongate game time. Most point and click games have some amount of vagueness to them, but this one kind of takes it to a new level. There is a pretty generous hint system in the game, but you shouldn't NEED that hint system to progress.\n\nOther than walking around and solving some puzzles you have the ability to collect colored orbs, which is less optional then the game lets on. These little orbs are power for your abilities that you will need to fight the final boss. So if you spent the game ignoring them and ou get to the end, you'll find yourself having to do a lot of backtracking to tediously comb over completed areas. It can be a bit fun looking for the little trap doors, or moving objects to find them, but several of them are behind immovable scenery and are effectively invisible. Meaning unless you get lucky clicking around, or pick up a guide you won't find them. There is also no real way to know if you've found all the orbs in one area, making the whole thing a bit difficult for no real reason.\n\nMy last big gripe against the game are the glitches. The controls aren't great, so sometimes you end up getting stuck in one spot and are unable to leave that spot (I got stuck in the library next to the weather book, and a few other places where my icons just dissapeared, looking for orbs).I immediately went to quit the game without realizing that even though I had saved in another slot, it would continue to auto save over my manual save, leaving me trapped on the book case unable to do anything. I had to start over. It was partially my fault for not being more careful, but if you're going to force players to re-search areas having glitches like that are pretty annoying.\n\nOn the positive side I found the art very pleasing, And the diary pages' snippets of inhabitant lore very cool. Those two elements very clearly had a lot of hard work and love put into them.\n\nOverall, I don't recommend the game, because pretty art, and tidbits of interesting lore don't make up for the gameplay it lacked.\n\nTLDR;\nPros: nice artwork, some cool world lore.\n\nCons: unintuitive puzzles and gameplay, lots of wandering around aimlessly, Hard-to-find-for-no-reason orbs, lots of backtracking to pad the game, glitches that may cause you to restart entirely.\n","August 5, 2014","false","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's some awesome environments, and the interactions are pretty cool, even without words, and in fact, the words are some squeaky gibberish that almost makes it seem like more of a fantasy, which is weirdly cool. The puzzles can also be challenging, but the game lets you buy hints, which is a plus for those who are and aren't good at puzzles.

This game just makes me want to play Monkey Island again.\n\nIt's... not even a BAD game. It's just not one I foresee myself ever playing ever again. I looked at the game, and the graphics weren't nearly charming enough to make me keep playing. That's what happened. I had no fun, I clicked things, nothing interesting happened.\n\nMaybe one day I'll actually play it all the way through. For now I'm rating it down, because I was expecting to be thrilled by a fascinating new universe - instead I feel disappointed. I was promised a gorgeous world.\n\nSome people have mentioned it was made for mobile devices. If so I absolutely see what's wrong: there's nothing for me to gawk at.\n\nBastion was a bright and vibrant game too, with graphics I found far more charming. And that was completely 2D. That's what Violett should have been in the first place: entirely 2D with entirely hand-drawn animations and art. The guys who made this game seem to pride themselves on that, so lets see some more of it. 3D models that look this poor are just unappealing to look at.\n\nI'm not whining about the quality of graphics. I'm not saying it needs to be in Unreal Engine 4 with godrays and cel-shading. I'm not saying everything needs to be a 300,000 polygon model with 4096x4096 textures or anything. I just wish that they'd stuck with one thing. Stretched out on my desktop, this game just doesn't look good.\n\nMonkey Island still looks good, it's charming, funny, and has voice acting on every character, leading the world to feel far more alive than it would otherwise - for instance, in Violett.\n\nMaybe this genre should stay dead.","September 27, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like that, than by all means have at it. Personally, I get enough of that in my day-to-day life.\n\nWhen the game indicates what you should be doing (or where the puzzle even begins) it is so subtle that I don’t realize it until I’ve accidentally triggered the next step of the puzzle, e.g. “Oh! That’s why it’s a mouse and cat!”\n\nIf the game developers implemented a little bit of character dialog to shed light on why actions don’t work, a tad more plot to explain the fantastic scenes, and more indication in the game mechanics on what is actionable (for example, it’s unclear what you need to drag backpack items to), I think it would be great!

I liked the art (except the noses in the cut-scene but I got over it), the normal game art was beautiful. I tried so hard to like it, I really did, but it left me bored and wanting it to end. I didn't care if Violett saw her parents again, or if she even made it out of there. I just wanted to stop all of the tediously boring 'puzzles' if you can even call them that. It's a very vague game that gives you no direction. If your not lucky you'll have to do even more mind numbing, slow, backtracking just to get things done, and are lucky if you know what you're doing before doing it. It has an unspoken, glimpse of a story that's easy to forget in the chaos, no dialog which would of helped instead of nonsensical noises with vague thought bubbles. It's a point and click that I hope I'll never click again. In my view, only play if you have nothing good to do or play and only buy when it's on sale and there's some money burning a hole in your pocket. Before you think maybe I just haven't played a point and click before, I have, I loved Deponia, but this is a magicarp using splash in comparison.

Theres not much point to this game. No storyline at all except for the beginning opening scene. DO NOT purchase if u like adventure games with indepth and rich character development + stories, this is not the game for you.\n\nIllustrations are nice but im just not a fan of 3D modelling artworks so didn't really enjoy it very much. But the lack of storyline and point to this game just really turned me off. The controls of the game is weird cause violett can use her telepathic skills on some objects but not others when its just next to it. The puzzles do not make sense, so i was just guessing everything, touching every object to see if it works or not. i just dont like puzzle games that dont make sense.\n\noh and also, violett's "AHH" sound is just annoying, she makes that sound whenever you touch an object that you cant interact with.\n\nOverall, the theme of entering a magical world with magical creatures is interesting, but the controls, weird puzzles and lack of storyline killed it for me.","April 10, 2014","false","5.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A true piece of art. If you're looking for an abstract painting (you'll recognise its inspiration, such as MC Esher), but that you can interact with a little, than you've found something you'll like. Otherwise I have many grippes with this game. After less than an hour it was too annoying and I couldn't keep playing.\n\nFirst off, the interaction system is wayyy too clunky. I much prefer the good ol' verb-based system : push, pull, take, talk, etc. Here you have to actually pull stuff by making very specific motion with your mouse. And because of this, it took me the longest time to get out of the cage at the beginning. After clicking furiously all around the screen, after having poked and pulled at the paperclip to no effect I was about to give up already. Then I just went crazy on it, moving my mouse all around, and it finally fell. My only thought was : ARE YOUR SERIOUS?\n\nSo yeah, this isn't nearly as intuitive nor as charming as Monkey Island, unfortunatly. The few characters there are only speak with speech bubbles and gibberish. This would be fine if their message was interesting, but they are only boring. Yes, the characters are pretty much untinteresting at best, shallow and blank at worst. Even the main character is weird and uncharacterised. He/she never speaks, you don't really know anything about him/her except that his/her parents moved in a new house and she is pulled into this miniature dimension. It would of added a lot to have given him/her an actual voice, so he/she could give his/her thoughts about the strange world he/she got into.\n\nThe puzzles themselves seem very contrived and strange, which follows the style of the world. I guess I'm just not smart enough, but I honestly couldn't solve most of them. The problem being, I didn't even know what the problems were most of the time. One room I solved out of pure luck, distracting an evil teapot with a fly I randomly captured in a bottle. Half the time I just looked, scratching my head, trying to understand what I was looking at. If the character could at least of given me a hint or something to identify what I needed to do it would of helped. Unfortunatly, after seeing all the strange rooms and not making any progress, I decided to stop playing. Now you might decipher the cryptic solutions to these rooms, connected by a kind of MC Escher maze, but I wasn't enjoying it so I couldn't be bothered. The last straw was a room where a firework kept firing in an endless loop of ear-destroying pain, while I got posed by a piece-swapping puzzle to this noise. NO THANKS. I'M OUT.\n\nSo yeah. Very pretty game, but mechanically too frustrating. If you're the type, like me, to enjoy artsy visuals, than I recommend this. Otherwise, if you want a well put together point n' click game, look elsewhere. Unless its on sale for very cheap. If you want a number, I'll give it a 6.5, 5 points for excellent visuals plus 1.5 for playability. It just couldn't pull me in (pun intented).","December 20, 2013","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A good example being the power of telekenesis, the use of which is not at all clear until you start waving the mouse pointer around and seeing how the icon changes.  The lack of guidance adds to the frustration as does the lack of description for the inventory items aquired.\n\nI am disappointed because the graphics and music are nicely polished.  Maybe if the problem elements were ever redesigned I would revisit it.\n\nA great premise from the intro which sadly turned into a frustrating experience.","January 1, 2014","false","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

She finds a necklace, but then is in some fairy prison? It didn't take me long to decide that I didn't even really like her very much, and the "dialogue" screeches (in the style of Link) were irritating.\n\nAs far as gameplay, I'm not a fan of point-and-click, so that certainly affects my experience with the game, but even so these puzzles seemed particularly unintuitive. You have to capture the fly instead of just taking the cork and stopping up the kettle's spout? The little wooden cat and mouse leave the screen to return with a matchstick, but not the wooden dogs? So the Jawsome Beaver hates soap, so why aren't I looking for some soap instead of a raft (that he ends up eating anyway)? Alice's Wonderland had a wonderful logic to it (a caucus race is good exercise: to dry off, try a good dry lecture): this doesn't. I don't have the patience to click all over the screen, anyway.

The Backgrounds are lovely, colourful & have an Alice in Wonderland meets Honey I shrunk the kids sort of charm. It is a point and click adventure with a cute story waiting to get out.\n\nUnfortunately the story never really does get out. There is little narrative in any form of presentation, verbal or non verbal and even less direction. The titular young girl has some telekinetic powers which seem to be limited to the very specific items the creators did not feel like animating while other times you can practically reach an item you need but have to float a ladder over to it to climb up and retrieve it. Where are her mind powers there?\nThe other abilities are only used to bypass a couple of road-block hazards which themselves are only blocking collection items. One of these skills is a floating power, kind of a limited flight, which is only used in maybe three instances and yet in the many other situations where it would be a big help in reaching some place it is somehow imposable for her to use.\nIf this had been part platformer these abilities would have been a lot of fun to play with but as it stands they seem to be just tacked on to again cut down on animation.\n\nThat said I, having studied animation myself, understand how much time and tedium can be involved in seeming simple motions so I do not blame the creators for that trick.\n\nPros : Easy to pick up and play\nPretty to look at\nOften available for next to nothing.\n\nCons: Like a lot of point and click games, the puzzles are less about intellect and more about noticing what piece of the background is a different shade or makes the arrow become a hand.\nLittle story development.\nA lot of very slow moving to and from-ing.\n\nPick it up on sale if you like point and click, don't if you don't","January 20, 2015","false","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a traditional game with a simple structure and puzzles that are challenging without being overly frustrating.  In an era of revitalizations of classic genres and reboots of the great titles of yesterday, Violett is a combination of modern art design, and genre-traditional gamepay.  The little touches in level design and the way the story is silently told make this another entry in the recent trend of games that has been creating artistic statement in the narrative by embedding the story in the gameplay.  Violett is a lovely new entry in a series of titles that are taking gaming into a new more artistically-mature direction alongside games like Limbo, Braid and, more recently, Gone Home and The Stanley Parable.","January 15, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Apart from that there isn't much to tell about this game. It's short, lacks flow of movement in certain moments, annoying controls (bad port from tablets, maybe?) and quite short with unimaginative riddles (mainly about click here or there). The story is way too simple and uninteresting.\n\nAll in all, buy it only for a day of fun and cheaply.

You will be noticing many references if you watch cartoons like I do but I am not sure if its a good thing . It almost feels like game is borrowing too much from other sources .\n\nThe level design and animations look very high quality so they probably had good budget . Definetly the biggest plus of this game is the aesthetics which are superior to most games in this genre . If you like fantasy inspired worlds with slightly sinister atsmophere then I would recommend this game .\n\nGameplay or controls I should say are a bit wird . Normally you have a 3D character that has to come close to interact with objects but Violett combines that with a long range Hidden object gameplay. I think negative reviews for this game are based on the fact that people can't grasp that mechanic right away.\n\nMy biggest beef with Violett is lack of voice acting or even text for that matter . Violett just mumbles which is intentional design I guess but I can't say that I like it .\n\nMany people complain that puzzles are too diffecult which is poor argument considering that target audience for this game are people who like complicated solutions . I mean its kind of what this game is (press everything you see and make sense of it if you can ) Personally I think level design was pretty good and puzzles are enjoyable .\n\nYou can use rechargable Hint so . Don't say game is hard to figure out, the cheats are build right into panel .\n\nAnyway this game is good visual experiance . Some flaws here and there but if you a puzzle game junkie don't pass this .","November 3, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's art is great and so is the music. For some reason the main character is the worst looking thing in the game.\n\nViolett moves to a spooky house in the country with her parents. She seems unhappy about it. In her room she discovers a magical amulet in a mouse hole. This takes her to a magical world of fairies and bugs. Think Coraline with a lighter tone and more colours.\n\nThis game is incredibly frustrating in many ways. Some times it's hard to know where you can walk because of the layout of the map. Some times this is solved by the creators by putting an arrow in the landscape, so I guess they realised their error and fixed it an easy way. The clickables sometimes changes the mousecursor to an 'available action' hand, some times not.\n\nAs a completelist I haven't been this frustrated about collectibles since as long as I can remember. The orbs are sometimes easy to spot, some times can only been seen from certain angles, sometimes actually invisible. Some of the hidden places are the same way; some easy to spot some you will only see in a guide.\n\nIf you miss the orbs or diary page in the first room, there is no way to go back and you'll have to start a new game if you want the completist achievements. There is also a bug that happens sometimes where Violett will get stuck for no reason and you'll have to exit and load game to fix it. As far as I can tell from internet searches and guides I collected all the diary pages needed for the achievement, yet I did not get it.\n\nThe voiceacting. I don't mind gibberish-language games, but some of the voices in this game is just plain annoying. And ofcourse the one you'll hear the most, Violett, is the most annoying of them all. The sound Violett makes when she tells you she can't do whatever action you tried to make her do, is one of the most annoying sounds ever and you feel severely punished for not clicking everything perfectly. Add to this that it's impossible to turn off the sound effects; you can only turn it down to level 1/10. All of this makes it 100% necessary to use a guide at all times, which always makes the game less fun.\n\nViolett collects pages from her uncle's diary throughout the game, but nothing is told by the game of who the uncle is, how and why he was in the same world Violett discovered.\n\nI bought this on 85% off and suffered 10 hours of frustration as I didn't want it to drag down my achievement collection % and always hoping that the game would improve. Turns out I still can't complete everything. Not worth.","June 3, 2015","false","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
