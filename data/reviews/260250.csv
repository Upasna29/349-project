(100% would be very hard to rush)\n- Damage boosting by projectiles or even enemies themselves is possible and can be manipulated to progress a little faster.\n- Collectable hidden upgrades\n- Multiple attacks available, which are each upgradeable.\n- Play as a human and a werewolf\n- Character and enemy bios/info.\n- Minimal bugs. I ran into one, once, where the camera stopped following me after a transition.\n- Low RNG, non-existant if you can speedrun the stage flawlessly.\n- Very fast load times on death (~1 second)\n- Fast and accurate platforming. If you think otherwise, you probably don't understand the collision boxes for the character. (If you barely miss a ledge, the character will get caught on it for just a moment, almost like it's a mini slope. You can use this to your advantage sometimes)\n- The game saves currently collected items within a checkpoint if you earned an achievement(for Signets%), or got a hidden upgrade.\n- Reentering a stage to collect a missed item, then collecting said item, then proceeding to the next checkpoint will save the progress and let you exit the stage with it counting toward your total progression for that stage. (You don't need to finish the whole stage, just make it to the next checkpoint after obtaining the missed items)\n- Can probably run on very low end PCs if you lower resolution.\n- Quick and responsive menus\n- Most boss attack orders are random (in my experience) I'm not yet sure if you can bait for specific attacks.\n\nCons:\n- Mouse Acceleration that cannot yet be disabled, use a gamepad. (Mouse Acceleration is never useful and greatly hinders mouse speed and accuracy)\n- The art is pretty good, but could use a little more detail in the environment.\n- When the camera zooms in/out, or moves areas at all, it really throws off your aiming if you're using a mouse. Gamepad is unaffected by this. (maybe they should zoom the cursor with the camera?)\n- Music 7/10, Some tracks are kind of obnoxious.\n- Dying on the first checkpoint does not reset the timer. (There is a little unique stage entrance, but they could just queue it again you die on the first checkpoint)\n- Dying to a boss doesn't reset the timer, though it doesn't matter because for some reason there isn't leaderboards for boss kill times, even though they have a timer. (I understand that due to RNG boss patterns, they probably shouldn't have leaderboards anyway. It would just be a battle for good RNG on the leaderboards)\n- You're allowed to play for about one and a half seconds while the stage is still fading in from black after a death loading screen. I wish it would wait until the game was at 75%+ opacity before the timer starts, input is allowed and anything in the stage starts their cycle.\n- If you are not going to hunt achievements, the game probably won't be worth $10 to you. Though if you do want to hunt them down, it certainly is worth it. I like built-in challenges.\n\nI don't think the dev team was very big, so good job!","May 11, 2014","true","8.2"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","56","67","0","2"

On one side it looks beautiful, has tight controls and is a great throwback to retro gaming with enough evolved moments to make it seem worthwhile, but every so often a full moon comes out and its got some frustratingly brutal sections that maul away at your patience. The mechanics are nothing to be snuffed at, and whilst some people have complained about hit detection and such - I havent noticed anything outrightly unjust so far. What I have noticed is some nice tight platforming brought to an abrupt stop at a steep difficulty curve - though, in all fairness, Im still playing and enjoying everything I've seen. In the end what you have is a great mix of Castlevania/Megaman with a gorgeous artstyle with some minor (forgivable) frustrations.

The art is neat, the game is very reactive, it has a Castlevania vibe, but... most of the platforming parts are horrendous. They involve rushing through a large area with flames/projectiles/compressors that all activate quickly one after another. The reason it is bad is that when you lose you do not feel like you lack skill and made a mistake, but that you did not learn by heart the precise path forced onto you by the game. So you need to start over and try again and again long and annoying parts of the level (checkpoints can be quite far in these areas).\n\nSome other areas require dodging between projectiles and opponents (that shoot projectiles or behave like projectiles) in a very precise manner, but every hit has a knockback effect, pushing the character away from her trajectory. And to make things worse, there is lava or spikes that prevent from having safe spots in between. Both of these game design decisions make the platforming parts all the more punishing. It does not feel good at all, despite me liking hardcore platformers. It's not just challenging difficulty that I like in platformers, but good design, which I did not find here.\n\nThe levels are very linear. Some people like that, some people don't.\n\nWhat I liked most in this game were the boss fights. They play well and rely more on skill than the rest of the game, even though they are thankfully not too difficult.","September 27, 2014","false","14.6"," 56 of 77 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","56","77","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/260250/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Blood of the Werewolf's biggest strength is how perfectly it manages to be a callback to the timeless monster movies of the 50's and 60's. The shaky film grain covered titles, spooky soundtrack, and voluminous collection of almost any ghoul or ghost you could think of all amount to a wonderfully nostalgic experience that feels right at home amid the dust covered classics. But this is as far as the developers managed to get with creating an enjoyable, well designed game, as taken as a whole BotW just doesn't cut it.\n\nTaking control of Selena, a mother on a mission to get her stolen son back, gameplay shuffles you between her human and werewolf form. In the former you run through level wielding a crossbow, flipping switches and fending off the imposing baddies. When the moon comes into view you burst forth as the towering werewolf, who's sections feature more combat and little if any puzzle solving.\n\nIt's a cool mechanic and one that could have allowed for some interesting back and forth between the two forms, but the developer uses it in such a boring and uninspired way that it just feels like you are playing as a different character when you switch from one form to the other. There was no connection to me between the two, and it seemed like a hugely wasted opportunity. Playing a game presumably based around being a werewolf mostly as a human, feels oddly misplaced, but it's actually a relief as taking control of Selena's beastly side is wholly underwhelming.\n\nIt controls sloppily and feels far too underpowered, barely doing any more damage than your puny arrows but without the added benefit of firing at range (your only attack is ripping at enemies with your claws). The only benefit is you are able to double jump, but even then platforms are placed farther apart so it becomes a moot point amid the many annoyances you encounter while trying to maneuver the hulking mass of fur and claws.\n\nAfter the first several levels the frustration begins to extend to the other portions of the game. The difficulty spikes rabidly with more enemies, precariously placed traps, fewer checkpoints, and one hit kills entering the mix, and continues to do so for the rest of the game. I repeatedly had to fight off the urge to snap my controller and walk away over a plethora of absurd sections, but this is certainly against your best interest as there are no in level save points and quitting will result in starting over from scratch.\n\nI could go on about how terribly exploitable the enemies are, the weak boss fights, or the agonizingly inconsistent tonality shifts presented by the story, but the fact remains the same that Blood of the Werewolf is a one trick pony that can't finish the race. The presentation is top notch (though I much prefer the 2D art from the story sequences to the 3D models during play) with unexpectedly smooth animations, and the overall look does a fantastic job of emulating the films it so heavily draws inspiration from. Voice acting is so-so and the dialog gets progressively worse, but even that I could handle if the gameplay was fun.\n\nIt's a shame it turned out the way it did because there are some really neat segments amidst the mediocrity, but I simply cannot recommend purchasing it when the good parts are so heavily outweighed by the sloppy last 2/3 of the game. I hope to see developer Scientifically Proven do something again, but I would advise looking at other mediums as they clearly have a much better grasp on animation and style than game design.","January 4, 2014","false","3.8"," 54 of 79 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","54","79","0","0"

When it comes to platformers, the design ought to own whether or not it will be a twitchy, high-precision affair (e.g. Super Meat Boy), or more of a fluid, graceful romp (e.g. Dust: An Elysian Tail). Blood of the Werewolf can't quite figure out which of the two it wants to be, and the gameplay suffers for it. You're expected to make jumps and battle monsters with careful timing and accuracy, but the controls aren't responsive enough to support you in those respects. Your character's movement is too slow, her turns and leaps too fuzzy, and the hitboxes of player, obstacles, and monsters too vague for the kind of pixel-perfect action the game seems to be trying for.\n\nIt could be that I simply sucked at this game, and if I were more awesome a player, I'd have enjoyed it. But other difficult games I've played in the genre were fun enough to encourage me through failure and frustration; this one, not so much.","June 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

As advertised the art is very appealing, with it's own very distinct style not often seen. It's title screens and characters (with the exception of our heroine) are all classic monsters with classic tropes. The opening of stages even have titles reminiscent to classic horror movies. I found this stuff goofy and appealing.\nThe plot is pretty straightforward and predictable, and the background info (that you can find in the extras menu) can make the whole story seem a little bit too serious for it's own good. I can respect Scientifically Proven's want to build up an epic tale about a clash between horror creatures, but it can take away from the whole story (especially since the big bad monsters go down way too easy.)\nNow the gameplay... I would be lying to you if I told you I was expecting this game to play the way it did. Please note I was using a controller the whole time.\nThe game sets you up nicely, with interesting transitions between human and werewolf as you platform through a couple of hard jumps here and there and some pretty straightforward combat between weak enemies. After the first couple of levels the game shifts from gear one to five. The jumps become perilous, the enemies become obsticals and there are a million ways to die. And while the game is punishing, it sets up checkpoints nicely and only penalizes you for time when you die (and you will die.) The camerawork can be a bit of a problem, especially when transforming, when the camera will zoom in on your giant wolf body as you jump again into a pit of spikes.\nWhen I finished the game, I was just about ready to close up shop for this game, but forlaughs I decided to try get S-rank on level one. This is where the game truly shines. The replaying of the game (giving you level select and letting you keep your collectables) is a lot of fun. While still very diffucult, you begin to see the game differently, you realize how fair it was being to you, and how to clean up your mistakes. Next thing I knew I wanted to see my name climb higher and higher on the leaderboards. The game hooked me in for another playthrough.\nAt seven dollars you can get a lot out of this game. If you don't want to get frustrated at a game I wouldn't recommed it, but if you put some time in it you may find yourself enjoying this game quite a bit. A great game for an indie developer, I am looking forward to their next project.","August 31, 2014","true","41.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

I reminisce about the days when a game really and truly challenged me to be a better gamer. I look to the offerings on Steam and while there are some that challenge you in just such a way, they aren't quite the same.\n\nThey have some of the challenge, some of the awe, some of the frustration, some of the sense of accomplishment; but there is still just that little something extra missing to really make it a knuckle-biting, jaw-clenching, controller-throwing challenge-fest that I remember as a kid.\n\nThat's where we came from when we made Blood of the Werewolf.\n\nIt's all about returning to your roots, making YOU beat the game instead of letting the game beat itself while you just press a button every now and then. It's about that practice-makes-perfect feeling that lets you go from taking an hour to beat a single level to just a couple of minutes. It's about knowing a game so intimately that you could, if you wanted to, play it with your eyes closed and not miss a beat.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Hell yes I do.\n\nIf you want a challenging platformer, then this is for you.

The game assumes your an achievment hunter - if you take your time the stages seem pretty easy. The story and RPG elements are perfunctory but passable for this type of game, it's well written and the atmosphere is good but you wont care about the characters. Graphics are good, nothin artsy but it gets the job done. The gameplay is what you would expect - jumpy, jumpy, shoot, shoot, bite, claw, and deal with different obstacles, which are varied and work pretty well but nothing that new or creative. The controls are solid, not floaty at all (I used a gamepad exclusivly). The werewolf thing is interesting and adds some variety, it changes you automatically at certain points along the levels and it mostly feels like your playing two different characters.\n\nIn short, if you like platformers and a nice challenge with some frustrating bits - and you like to complete achievments and get highscores - buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/260250/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","I wasn't really expecting much of Blood of the Werewolf since I barely heard anything about it and it's release on Steam kinda went unnoticed for me. Well, I actually first installed it for the cards drop but while I was playing it I realized that this was not just another indie platformer to come out, this was something more. The more I played it the more I would compare it to Volgarr The Viking because from what I saw on the Steam store screenshots it looked nothing like that. Blood of the Werewolf puts you in control of a woman, which is also a werewolf, during her quest to save her child that was captured by monsters of the old world having killed her husband in the process and now she seeks revenge while a great soundtrack is played on the background to keep you just in the right "spot". The game is played both in form of werewolf which takes place when you are exposed to the moonlight and when you play as the woman which is usually indoors. When playing as the woman your weapon is a crossbow which you can fire a single arrow or two arrows at the same time depending on your "spells" and upgrades that you've unlocked and most of the levels where you play as her is basicly using the crossbow to shoot key points to activate certain levers and platforms so that you can proceed to the next phase of the level. Now the parts where you play as a werewolf I find to be the strong part of the game, the werewolf has the ability to double jump and use a dash attack, which when airborne performs a dash downwards, along with other abilities which you can unlock such as using blood to heal yourself, blood works as the "mana" of this game since you use it to activate your abilities and as the werewolf you have a melee attack which can have a "charged" attack everytime you use it for the first time. Other things I really liked about Blood of the Werewolf was the voice over for the main character along with a certain wind mechanic which takes place during certain sections of the game which make you faster or slower depending on the direction of the wind and the direction where you're going. The graphicstyle along with the boring combat (atleast for me) are probably the weakest points of the game, while the game doesn't look bad it also doesn't look great, the graphics get the job done... and the combat while it's simple and efficient I'd like to see more variety to it like combos. The game is divided in various levels, some of which are exclusively boss fights which I thought that that they were really well made and designed focusing mainly on attack patterns which you need to avoid. The levels are made around various sections, some rely on tight jumping and precision platforming and timing while others rely on combat. At the end of each level you're awarded a rank (A, B, C ...) based on the time you took to beat the level (counting deaths) along with how many collectible shards you've picked up throughout that level. In the end, Blood of the Werewolf turned out to be a great surprise for me because it was alot better than what I was expecting and because it's actually a great game, very well put together and for that I recommend it to you if you're looking for a high precision platformer with some combat mixed into it. You can't go wrong with Blood of the Werewolf.","December 23, 2013","true","7.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/recommended/260250/","rancourt","Dusty Rancourt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/","2088 products in account","I really wanted to like this one, and there was a lot to like about it, to be sure. The premise wasn't bad. The unlockable path of upgrades looked like it would have had promise, had I reached the point of further upgrades. The werewolf model was attractive, even if I found the protagonist's human model wedge hair and violently colorful outfit for a Gothic horror action adventure game a bit startling to the eyes. I was interested enough to buy it, to play it, to want to see how the story unfolded. I don't tend to talk much about games I dislike, but this one...well, it had promise, but didn't deliver, and that saddened me.\n\nThe controls just aren't smooth. Jump physics are strange, both in timing and in propulsion style -- holding down the jump button for a longer or higher jump feels 'floaty.' Aiming the crossbow might work well on a desktop with a proper mouse, but I find it much harder to do on a laptop with a touchpad. Yes, I certainly understand that laptop gaming is not the primary concern of the developers, but I'd call into question the entire aim-and-fire system by mouse in a game like this. In werewolf mode, it's strange to keep a hand on the mouse just to slash-attack, when there's no aiming involved. And yes, sure, I can remap the werewolf's attack to a key...but then, I'm switching between mouse and keyboard when I change forms, my hand off the controls for a moment.\n\nThe early enemies have slow, blobby, floating "attack clouds" that are easy to dodge, but huge. As I climb a ladder or jump around to avoid being hit, the enemy's position changes, relative to my mouse crosshairs. Unless you have exceptional digit isolation, handling the WASD directionals plus thumb on SPACE for jumping, while precision-gripping the mouse and tapping to loose an arrow, is pretty annoying. I'm going to want to use my right hand to jump for the platform elements, and to aim and fire my weapon, and switching back and forth between two-hands-on-keys and one-hand-on-mouse just isn't viable.\n\nCombine poorly thought out control mapping issues with weird game physics, and you end up with a game that just isn't smooth and natural to play, and that introduces frustration regularly.\n\nThe game calls itself a "love letter" to classic horror/monster movies, but I don't think this game has really decided to whom to address that love letter. One moment we have flickery lights and black and white titles ("THE SEWERS!"), the next we're back to our cartoonishly anachronistic protagonist in a Castlevania-like setting with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-style glowing green slime as a miss-a-jump toxic hazard. Levers gleam with rich F-stop-enhanced wooden handles. Above ground in the intro, we have a burning house, a vivid transformation, and slash attacks at scarecrows. I see elements of Karloff, of Chaney...of Castlevania, of Troma films, and a strange sort of pastel art style with our strangely-attired lead character that doesn't fit in with any of it. I think the developers would have been wiser to pick one, or at least two, key visual themes, instead of throwing in everything they thought might potentially fit into a werewolf game. This game could have been gorgeous with hyper-realistic visuals, with flickery-candlelit sepia tones and a brush-illustration or woodcut-like decor, or even the shadows of early silvered cinema. There are too many thematic elements, and they clash visually. Too much color, too much saturation, too loud and bright and intense a gamescape for the sort of Gothic horror vibe at hand. The Castlevania series managed to blend rich colors with a Gothic horror story, but then, it also went for painterly, stylized tableaus. The sparse, dark backgrounds of this game don't support the rich, saturated pools of color of the objects and ledges.\n\nThe music tries to be Gothic and atmospheric, and clearly borrows a page from Castlevania. I would have liked to hear a more compelling soundtrack, but I haven't progressed far enough in the game to hear much of it. Perhaps it gets better; for now, it's a step in the right direction, but the journey's far from over.\n\nThis could have been an amazing game. It had promise, and it's clear that its creators put a lot of thought into it, and had a real vision for what they were hoping to create. I see so much to like about this game that it just...doesn't deliver, when push comes to shove. The saddest part, for me, is that it feels like poor technical and executive choices are to blame. The controls could have been tighter and smoother. Jumps could have felt organic and natural, and not physics-defyingly floaty. The weapons system could have been designed for easier, less switchy-swappy hand positioning. The game could have been limited to one or two thematic and visual tropes. Real estate could have been used more wisely onscreen, leading to a less sparse-and-empty level vibe. The visual rendering might have sepiatoned the game, added brushstroke-like quality to the key outlines, and given the shapes in game weight, eye-magnet quality without cranking the saturation -- or, if the saturation remains, lush and lavish painterly backgrounds could have been added, making the rooms beautiful and striking.\n\nThis feels like a pre-alpha rushed to release. It had the makings of a great platformer, and it just didn't deliver one, due to several little "just not quite there" limitations. I'm not sad because it's a disappointing game -- there are many of those out there. I'm sad because I can see the solidly good game it could have been, and wasn't quite.

It's challenging. But, it stops just short of unreasonable difficulty. It has those sections and those moments where you feel like you have been presented an impossible task. But, then you pass that part and it leaves you high on elation and a little bit of relief.\n\nIt has a  good number of cutscences and transitional screens. But, none of it feels intrusive. The narration make me care about the action. But, doesn't slow anything down or feel intrusive. The story is just interesting enough to make me really want to get to the next cut scene. So, that I get that tid-bit more of the over arching tale. The art style, music, and sound affects fuel the play. The auto save/checkpoints are placed perfectly apart. And, it has a significant amount of charecter improvement along the way without feeling flooded with power ups.\n\nIt absolutely nails perfection through repetition. where you can feel yourself geting better in chunks, and stringing things you figured out together into a flow. It foreshadows itself a lot. Each new problem is preping you for more complex things to come. It is just balanced so well...All the right things, in all the right places.

With a bit of Castlevania both the level's themes and the ideas behind the level design.  However, everything in the levels just feels wrong.

You can clearly see the love and craftmanship that went into creating these CG's, levels and sprites.\nLevel design is also well done.  The platforming sections can be challenging without feeling cheap or unfair.  The checkpoint system is very generous in my opinion, which mitigates the frustration of failing an important jump.\nThe basic enemies seem to mainly be there to hinder you as you try and progress through the platforming rather than being the threat themselves.  Most die in a couple of hits.\nThe bosses themselves, while again have great at design, I found to be a bit lacking.  The patterns so far are easy to pick out and avoid, making them rather lackluster.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and challenging action platformer, or anyone looking for a game that the developers obviously cared for.  Just don't expect the challenge to come from the enemies in this game.  I give it 8 Pineapples out of 10\n\nPS: I couldn't speak to music/voice quality in this game as I typically have the sound off/low and have something else playing in the background.

The level design early on is pretty boring and tame but picks up over the second half, incorporating elements found in games like Super Meat Boy and They Bleed Pixels. The checkpoint system is quite friendly for the most part, auto-saving often over the course of each level. The controls are mostly alright but there are times where controlling the character's werewolf form feels imprecise and inaccurate (especially true when trying to double-jump). The handful of bosses you encounter along the way are well-designed from a model standpoint, but the fights themselves tend to be more tedious than anything and often involve learning a couple basic patterns and reacting accordingly.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem with the game is the ending, one that's far too unsatisfying given the effort required to reach it. It clearly sets up a sequel which may or may not even come to fruition and simply left a bad taste in my mouth. I would've laughed at it had I not been so disappointed.\n\nBlood of the Werewolf has some impressive late-game level design and a nice art style (specifically the various backdrops), but the at-times frustrating controls and terrible ending are hard to overlook. Mostly a mediocre platformer that doesn't drag on too long and has a couple interesting mechanics going for it. If you're easily frustrated by these kind of platformers then I'd recommend skipping it; otherwise, I think it does enough things well to warrant a discounted purchase.","December 19, 2013","true","4.1"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Given that my favorite genres are beatm 'em ups and action platformers, I had to give this a try. Plus, gothic settings that don't have you playing as a vampire or fighting hordes of zombies interest me greatly. I'm tired of that ♥♥♥♥. Where's my Frankenstein game, damnit!\n\nThis game is...good. It's not great, it's not fantastic, but it's not bad either. The gothic setting with all of your favorite classic movie monsters such as Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon all appear and the control is very tight on this platformer. The mechanic of switching between wolf and human form, each with their own strengths and abilities leads to fun, and clever platforming challenges...for the most part. More on that later. The music is really good, but not very memorable unfortunately and the graphics are great solely because it's not "RETRO PIXELS!!!11!!!111!!" These developers actually took the time to make models. The only negatives about the art design I can say are the little between level cutscenes. The headshots of the characters, particularly the main one are...poorly drawn to say the least.\n\nNow for the bad. This game boasts a return to NES style challenging platforming. NES games were difficult because of poor design choice, hardware limitations, and developers not entirely sure of what they were doing at the time. Thus, this game suffers because of choices to make bad level design. This is very prevalent in the Skyrail level. Poor enemy placement making otherwise easy jumps next to impossible, wind mechanics pushing against you at seemingly random intervals, and auto scrolling segments. Not to mention a lot of trial and error gameplay and occasional leaps of faith. While the game has its highs as far as level design and platforming goes, it has a fair share of lows as well. You have infinite lives and checkpoints are everywhere, but it gets tedious after a while. That said, I will gladly admit that the boss fights are very well done and very fair. Easily the high point of the game for me.\n\nThe only other real problem I have with this game is that when in wolf form there seems to be some hitbox issues. The attack is deceiving and doesn't reach out nearly as much as it would appear. This never becomes too glaring, but it can lead to taking some unfair hits.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game if you're a fan of action platformers. The settings and levels are very well done and memorable enough to come back to. The game will be frustrating at times but it has enough going for it that I can see myself playing through it again, especially because I know what to expect now. Still not looking forward to Skyrail again though.\n\nI would give this game a 7.5/10 easily.","May 25, 2014","true","5.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

BotW is a spirital successor to action platformers of the NES/SNES era, especially Castlevania 1/3/4. I played through Castlevania 1/3/4 about 5 years ago for the first time and loved the brutally hard gameplay and the creative boss fights and lamented that there really aren't many more games in that genre to take on. While BotW isn't a straight clone of Castlevania--you're using arrow and melee attacks instead of a whip, there's quite a bit more platforming and pits than I remember in Castlevania, and there's (thank God) a checkpoint save system--the design and glorously difficult (but fair) gameplay means BotW scratches an itch I've had since I finished Super Castlevania IV. The cut scenes and voice acting are amateurish, sure, but that's not why I'd play a game like this. If you're under 25, and never lived through the era when games didn't have 20+ hours of content and so had to make up for it with challenging gameplay, you might hate this, but for those of us missing the masochistic thrill of playing levels in Castlevania and Mega Man games over and over again until your muscle memory can play it for you, this is a gem of a find, and is well worth 5x the asking price.\n\nNotes: I played with a gamepad on a 50" TV. Also, while I've ended up really liking the game, it took a couple hours for it to grow on me (especially the art style), so if you're feeling shaky on the game in the beginning, give it an hour or two of gameplay to get going.","July 19, 2015","true","9.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's interesting and well done. The game has nice visuals too. And despite not being incredibly original, I like how you play some sections as a human and others as a wolf, and both have slightly different controls and you can upgrade them separately.

But the level design is just not fun. Have you ever played Ninja Gaiden on the nes? remember those tiny platforms with almost impossible to beat enemies? Yeah, this whole game is that. If you need to jump expect something flying your way as soon as you're halfway through the jump. Trial and error games are difficult to make, the line separating unfun frustration and rewarding challenge is very fine. To me blood of the werewolf stands on the wrong side that line.\n\nI'm also not a huge fan of the hit detection either. The wolf attacks look enormous on screen but have very little range in reality.

Her husband was brutally murdered and her son Nickolai was kidnapped by someone. Your mission is to guide Selena through the stages to get clues where her son is being held.\n\nDuring the stages you can collect Sigils that will increase your HP and also upgrades, that increase ammunition and power of the attacks. When you are in a closed place, you control Selena in her human form with a crossbow. If you are in a place where the full moon is visible, you control her in her werewolf form.

If you finish the second level... good work, time to complete the other 8 levels and 5 bosses :)\n\nThe game is considered hard in its core... but the main game isn't hard at all (ok.. maybe a little bit). If you want a real challenge... try beating every stage with an S rank, what means that you have to finish the level as fast as possible. You can try to reach a huge amount of points in Score Rush mode as well... where you have a multiplier that goes up by 1 every 100 points (yellow gem), by 5 every 500 points (enemy killed) or by 10 every 1000 points (blue gem). But be careful, Rush Score has a time limit to complete the level but you can increase by reaching one of the various thresholds of points. If you manage to get everything, try beating at least 100 rooms in Endless mode.

The art is stylized and painted with broad stroaks and textures, which lends itself very well to this game. It feels like a part of the American Monster Movie genre with cameos by Frankenstein, Dracula, the Mummy and others.

Blood of the Werewolf is a mix of Dark Souls and Mario, for the reason that it is a 2D platformer and will kill you more times than days in a year. It combines the aspects of classic platformers with their unforgiving demeanor, and the looks of a modern medieval-styled game. In Blood of the Werewolf the player takes on the role of Selena, a mother and wife seeking revenge on the various creatures of the night that killed her husband and kidnapped her son. All the events go on throughout one night, so when Selena comes in contact with moonlight she turns into her true form as a werewolf. Numerous cut scenes portray the story of her struggle to retrieve her son from famously known villains of old. Multiple stages allow the player to traverse unique levels and collect power-ups and sigils. In this game sigils, are similar to gold coins except that they reward with health increases and score boosts. There are a number of upgrades for both of\nSelena’s forms that improve the crossbow or add more focus attacks for the werewolf.  Overall the game poses a challenge and is nostalgic for those gamers that have been playing for twenty plus years and remember the original platformers. For anyone looking for a classic styled game that challenges the player to replay for completion, Blood of the Werewolf is definitely fits that description. At the price of $9.99, Blood of the Werewolf is available on the Steam Marketplace along with the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.\n","February 11, 2014","true","7.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

Many games offer "Old school platforming" but so few of them really deliver that feel. BotW actually feels like playing the original "Prince of Persia" on my old A500 back in the '90s, while still being a modern production. The graphics aren't horribly retro, but carefully crafted, everything feels like it belongs together. Most important platforms look like they should while spikes look nasty and dangerous, so none of your inevitable deaths are caused by not knowing where you can land.\nSound is atmospheric, with a minimum of voice acting, which is well done, and the professional quality helps keep you in the game.\nThe difficulty level is tough, but fair. experienced platform players will feel comfortable, while new guys will hopefully learn to watch for clues early on.\nIf you have even a passing interest in platform games, or you're just curious about how we used to game back in the day, this is the one to look at.\nIt's a great game at the price, and if you see it at a discount, get it for sure.","June 18, 2014","true","51.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This game makes me rage. This game makes me look at things it does and roll my eyes and say "yeah okay, whatever." And then I learn.\n\nIt's so easy to make a game really hard and kick your ♥♥♥ and that's all there is to it. There's no art in that. But the way this game brings difficulty to the player is an art, because this game is all about learning, practicing, and perfecting. There's no luck of the draw, what item am I going to randomly get, which enemy is going to randomly spawn, I hope the RNG is nice to me crap. Nope, this game wants you to experience a horrible death over and over again until you learn from it, and it's then that you can surpass the challenge and move on... to an even harder one.\n\nThis isn't a platformer that will particularly test your combat skills. This is a platformer that will require the utmost perfection in your timing. It will want you to do double jump to a ledge while going through rows of moving fireballs. It will want you to navigate through a gauntlet of smashing pistons while being blown one direction or another by a fan. It will want you to shoot a bat in midair while trying to make it to a ladder so you won't land in the poison swamp. And not everything kills you in one hit; there's a health bar that you can replenish in various ways throughout the level as well as lengthen permanently. This game is not afraid to give you that kind of luxury, because it knows it can kill you anyway. And it will, over and over again, until you really master it.\n\nNot everybody is up for that kind of challenge. But if you are, Blood of the Werewolf delivers it with polish. Proceed having been warned, but step up to the challenge.","May 18, 2014","true","12.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Sweaty, exciting, fun times a-plenty. However, this game will try to break you. It will keep pushing you closer and closer to the edge. At first, it's fun, and teasing, you chuckle and shake your head at how silly this game is for pretending like it wants to kill you. Then the bruises start to form. You'll have to lie to your friends and family, tell them that the controller broke because you walked into a door while carrying it. You were only crying because of allergies, not due to frustration. You lie to protect your relationship with this game, because they don't understand just how good it makes you feel on those good days, when you manage to endure the barbs and spikes and blood vomitted up by ghosts and goblins. They'll never understand until they play it themselves.\n\nBlood of the Werewolf is a loving return to the day of unforgiving platformers, where death was more commonplace than life, and each room completed brought joy at your success followed by the sudden realization that it only gets harder from there on. In a game like this it's important that you are allowed to get right back onto the horse, and thankfully BotW does that well, immediately throwing you back to the latest checkpoint (typically at the start of a room) so you can dust yourself off and try again.\n\nThe game tells the story of Selena, one of the few remaining werewolves in the world, who is on a quest to retrieve her stolen child. On the way, she must do battle with classic monsters, including Dracula and the Mummy. Between each boss are a few levels of various locations, ranging from the sewers, to the city, to the woods and graveyard, each one testing just how willing you are to endure and see the game through to the end.\n\nAlong the way, you'll either do single-jumps and fire your crossbow as Selena in her human form whenever you're inside or the moon is eclipsed somehow. Once you step outside, under the light of the full moon, Selena turns into a werewolf, limiting the range of her attacks but allowing her to double jump and manuever in-air briefly to better secure those light landings. The game always feels much easier as the werewolf just for the fact that jumping is easier - and even though your range is limited to close-quarters, the wolf is so strong that most enemies will die in one hit if you time your attacks well. Upgrades are hidden throughout the game, each one requiring that you explore the level for secrets in order to find them. You could easily make it to the end of the game without gathering any upgrades save for the two you are given during the tutorial. This can make some boss fights harder than they need to be, so feel free to revisit a level and sniff out some secret rooms if a boss is giving you too much trouble (every boss can be defeated without upgrades, however, but they do make them easier to fell if you have them).\n\nGraphically the game is very pleasing to the eye, with a wonderful job on the art style to be accented by the effects. You never forget just what the overall location is (i.e. city, graveyard, docks, etc.) just by the aesthetics all around you. Rooms don't feel like they repeat themselves in background or layout (except in the few occurances where they do, but only to gradually step up the difficulty of a continuing puzzle).\n\nThe game is hard, pure and simple. You start off slow, and you probably wont die more than a handful of times on the first few levels and the first boss, so long as you're not completely new to the platforming scene. After awhile, however, things start to really turn against you, demanding percision jumping and quick reflexes. What keeps this game from feeling unfair is that each challenge never seems impossible. Every time you die, you can immediately see what you did wrong, and it's clear what you need to do right in order to pass - it's just executing this new plan is easier said than done. Still, the hurdles presented never feel so daunting that you give up on the game entirely. You might put the controller down and play something a little more relaxing, or just go outside and scream, but you'll come back again and again because the game just works so well. When a game requires as much percision and timing as this game does (especially on the last 2-3 locations), the mechanics of movement are vital. Everything else can work perfectly, but if the movement controls don't work just right then the whole thing falls apart. Thankfully, BotW's jump mechanics are fluid and tight, and you never feel like the game was being unresponsive to your input and that's why you fell to your horrible death.\n\nIn short, BotW is a brutal game that never lets on that it's impossible. Every failure is just another stepping stone on the road to success. The controls are percise, tight, and reponsive. The visuals look crisp and clean and pleasent to look at. If you're a fan of old school action-platformers like Ghost 'n' Goblins, this is a must have for you.","June 30, 2014","true","5.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You play as Serena, the crossbow-wielding mother who becomes a howling werewolf by the touch of the full moon, in a quest to save her son, Nikoli from the evil clutches of doctor Frankenstein. In this game you technically play two characters, Serena the human, and Serena the werewolf, each with their own perks and specialty. Unfortunately, when you play them is dictated by the stages of the levels.\n\nI will put this bluntly, you will die a lot. My personal high score is 100 deaths in the Skyway, but that's because that one level is evil. However, the levels in general are challenging and not overly punishing. There are checkpoints well-placed throughout the level that saves you the heartache of redoing most of the parts you've already past, as well as power ups that will you help in the future. There are online scoreboards in this game if you're feeling competetive and if you get an S rank on Skyway, I salute you. Though just finishing any level is already satisfying in this game (especially Skyway, screw that level) and you are rewarded with pretty decent cutscenes. Ultimately, the feeling of wanting to see what happens next will drive you through the game.\n\nHowever, the boss fights are somewhat lacking. They are well designed from an aesthetic standpoint (I really liked the staging for the Dracula fight) but it mostly boils down to memorizing the attack patterns the bosses do over and over again. The game also drops health in the middle of the fights, reducing the risk and reward factor especially because, if done well, you won't be injured in the first place. I would prefer to swear at the levels, as well as the bosses, and I think they should be as difficult as the presence they demand. But just a reminder, this is a platformer game and not an action game so it's forgiven.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like old school platformer games and are a fan of the old western monster movies, I definitely recommend Blood of the Werewolf.","May 28, 2014","true","7.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedkopc/recommended/260250/","thedkopc","TheDKOPC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedkopc/","17 products in account","Blood of the Werewolf is a difficult game to say the least. Being an action platformer the majority of the game will be compromised of mostly jumping on platforms and either shooting your crossbow as Selena or using your werewolf form to cut through enemies. Now you might be looking at the mixed reviews that the game is getting and wondering why this is occurring. This is mostly due to the fact that Blood of the Werewolf is an extremely hard game and requires a lot of patience and timing to get through the difficult levels. It’s the type game that you will either love as a fan of the action platform genre or hate due to its level design.\nGameplay mostly consists of switching between Selena who wields a crossbow that can aim that is great for long distance combat and her werewolf form which gets a double jump and uses a claw swipe for its primary melee attack. The player will mostly play Selena in the indoor sections of the game and the werewolf in the outdoor portions due to the werewolf only coming out in the full moon. This can be seen as either as a negative or positive as some players would like the ability to switch freely between the two characters Upgrades can be found throughout the different levels which can either upgrade Selena’s crossbow, giving her different arrow types, increase the amount of arrows she can carry and increase the firing speed of the arrows, or upgrade the werewolf’s abilities, giving it a forward dash attack, ability to shoot projectiles from its body and the ability to regain health. Selena’s crossbow is powered through arrow drops and the Werewolf powers are obtained through the dropped hearts of dead enemies. Overall the combat system is pretty good for this type of game as it doesn’t need to be too complicated and is simple enough to which power ups can be switched with ease. The game does feature an upgrade tree for the three types of arrows that Selena has and that the three powers of the Werewolf. The only way to reach full power is to find all the upgrades. Aiming is a bit of a challenge when on controller as Selena aims using the analog sticks and this is especially prevalent in areas where platforms can only move if the switch is shoot at. I recommended switching to mouse in areas that require shooting and using the controller for the rest of the game. Life in the game can be increased by collecting sigils which are scattered throughout the levels and can really test the player’s platforming skills.\nThe platforming ranges from easy to extremely difficult. Veterans of the action platform genre might not find the platforming to be that big of a challenge but for newcomers, it will most likely get really frustrating. There are many call backs to older platformers and the game is a love letter to those old school hard platformers. The checkpoints in the game help relieve some of the stress that the platformers give you and there is no life system so when you die, you go right back to your previous checkpoint. The tight controls of the game mean that jumping and landing on platforms is super smooth and easy which means that the challenge comes from the actual design of the levels. The enemies in the game can be killed pretty easily and they are mainly used as a hindrance when it comes to the platforming. The combat is not the most advance but it’s really great for this type of game as the shooting of the crossbow can take out enemies from a far while the werewolf can have a variety of attacks depending on the upgrades the player finds. Killing enemies really depends on the level design as it can either important to kill the enemies before progressing or just simply ignore them and avoid their attacks. The enemies are varied in appearance but the majority of them will be melee or long range types. There are boss fights which can either be really easy or require upgrades to defeat.\nThe best parts of Blood of the Werewolf are in its tight controls and platforming which allows the player to plan ahead to finish levels of the game and the checkpoint system is fair and allows to take multiple deaths. The game is designed for the player to die a lot in the beginning but it allows replay ability by giving scores at the end based on time and amount of deaths received in the game. There are also two other modes in the game which are Score Run in which the you are trying to get the highest score and Endless Runner which times how long can the player survive. I personally do not have that much experience in these modes since the majority of my time is spent in the story mode but the story mode does make great practice for the other two modes. There is a leader boards for all three modes for the really experienced players looking for that extra bit of challenge. The story mode is great call back to the old B movie monster movies and the soundtrack helps compliment the overall aesthetic and mood of the game. The story revolves around Selena trying to get her baby back and it really gives a feeling a satisfaction in completing each level as Selena gets closer to saving her baby boy. The ending can be seen as sequel baiting which is both disappointing and great since I really want a sequel to this game. There is defiantly a ton of love poured into this game from the art design, level design, music and just the overall experience of the game. The sigh of relief you get from completing the levels already makes up for its really low asking price. This game is a definite recommendation and for only $2.00, it’s a steal especially when it goes on sale since I bought the game for a dollar. I think I can live without a dollar menu item for one of the finest examples of indie platforming right now on Steam and I look forward to their next project.\n","August 8, 2015","true","20.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has just enough modern influence to help you from tearing your hair out although you still may throw a controller.

She breathes so much life into Selena and it really connected me to the character.  I really hope there's a sequel as the game hints at it.\n\nSure some of the sections are frustrating, but few platformers will make you feel as good as this one.  Remember the days when you had to earn things in a game instead of having your hand held the whole time?  That feeling of accomplishment when you got past a section that's kicked your ♥♥♥ for the last 20 deaths? No?

It has hitboxes as fat and unpredictable as your mom, and areas of the games that felt needed touching up on. The voice acting is hit or miss badly, and the story is... blech. That being said, this game is very well polished, with great art style and visuals. The levels are well designed, with good pacing and rising challenge. Yes, it gets frustrating at times, especially near the end, but it doesn't feel unfair. There are certain sections that you WILL get stuck on, but it feels good to complete it, and very few platformers nowadays can give you this challenge.\n\nIn the end, I liked it. Nothing new or exciting, but just a really fun, experience with well polished graphics and levels, and a tribute to old platformers.","May 25, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xeros720/recommended/260250/","xeros720","Jamo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xeros720/","252 products in account","This game is amazingly bad.\n\nI know it doesn't look it, but that's part of why it's so bad. The basic ideas are there. There's health to upgrade, secrets to find, platforms and spikes to jump on and around. The problem is how badly put together and generic the whole thing is.\n\nThis game constantly reuses hazards and platforms from area to area with small changes at best that artificially lengthens stages. Every single enemy takes multiple hits. Especially the small guys. They take 6 hits in later stages. You also have to use this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crossbow too. Most of the "combat" is spent waiting in a single spot for your arrows to bore your enemy and yourself to death. The big bosses are exactly the same with occasional jumping thrown in.\n\nEven worse is when you're playing as the titular werewolf. Your hitbox is massive. It makes it very difficult to dodge projectiles, which luckily, you only have to do against the first boss really. Any combat is hand waved away with focus attack that one hit kills everything. Combat is either a monumental chore or completely inconsequential. This leaves platforming.\n\nAs I said before, it's mostly the same hazards repeated 3 or 4 times over the course of one stage. As the stages become longer, this becomes more apparent as your soul starts bleeding out your eyes and ears. Your lifebar is laughably big. It makes most hazards easily ignorable too. That is until instant death traps start popping up. It's really surprising because the two things are completely counter productive. Why would you want to collect all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t strewn about the level if the hardest parts are just littered in spikes? It doesn't make sense.\n\nEverything about the game is boring bland dreck. Backgrounds are often two colored and simple to look at it. The environments follow by being uninspired and boring. There's nothing pushing you forward to finish this game and there's nothing waiting for you. The story?  It's just listening to the main character monologue then you fight a terribly designed boss for way too long because your weapon sucks, he has too much health, and the pattern is frustratingly basic. Even the music all blends together as the same slightly gothic orchestral crap. Even worse is that it's all open source from Kevin Macleod. He has better music available than this complete garbage selection.\n\nJust don't buy this game. You could teach classes on why this game is horrible. There's a lot to dig through. On the other hand, if you want to know how to improve your own game or what ruins others, feel free to play this. I can't believe anyone actually likes this. There's so many better platformers on steam. Even Akane the Kunoichi is a superior platformer.","July 21, 2014","false","3.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

It clearly has a very old school vibe to it and for that I believe a lot of retro fans will adore this game. The game isn't overly punishing, but provides a challenge that will leave you with a satisfied feeling upon finishing levels and defeating bosses. From the art style to the levels it is clear that this is a well designed game. You can tell the team really put a lot of TLC into this one. I've noticed this game has been on sale a few different times which is great and they've been putting in free updates that includes even more content. It's good to see them improving the game even after the games been out for a while. I've played this title both on the PC and Xbox 360 and I believe it's worth the buy.\n\nWould I recommend it?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiocfaidh/recommended/260250/","tiocfaidh","Arkard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiocfaidh/","373 products in account","I recommend it only if you can get it for a dollar or so. At full price, this game is absolutely not worth it.\n\nFirst of all, it's one of those platformers that recommend you play it with a controller. Fair enough. I've played Guacamelee, Mark of the Ninja and Dust: An Elysian Tail all completely with a controller from start to finish, so I'm a big fan of well-implemented controller schemes in PC games. Well, except for the fact that it's not well implemented in this one.\n\nMy recommendation is to ignore the game's suggestion to use a controller, as aiming Selena's crossbow with the right analog stick is considerably difficult. Most games with analog aiming systems, such as FPSes, have some sort of compensation mechanic, where your controller will aim to the thing it thinks you're trying to shoot. With this game you have to be very, very ♥♥♥♥ing precise, and there are whole sections of the game where you're under a time restraint to make your shots.\n\nA couple of boss fights also require that you aim precisely at something, otherwise you either deal no damage or the damage gets healed back. Do yourself a favor, if you have to use a controller for the other parts of the game, switch to mouse and keyboard for these sections. Another problem with the controller scheme is the right shoulder button. That ♥♥♥♥er's gotten me killed as a werewolf more times than I can remember. I like to rest my fingers on the trigger, but sometimes when I'm not fighting, I grab the controller a little closer to the shoulder buttons. If you accidentally press RB during a jump as a werewolf, you will immediately plummet into the nearest spike and die. Just another reason to use a keyboard and mouse, I guess.\n\nNow on to the level design: it feels a bit uninspired. The werewolf/human parts do not blend seamlessly and instead feels like you're switching back and forth between two different games. The enemies you fight as a werewolf are often stronger, so your more damaging wind-up attack is pretty pointless, and the platforms you have to reach are spaced further from each other, so your double jump is a requirement. This begs the question: what was the god damn point? Your double jump does not help you reach otherwise inaccessible areas as a human, and your ability to crouch into tiny spaces as a human is only used in the first level. I forgot I could even crouch after the second stage.  It's like the developers did not properly understand how powers are supposed to work in a platformer.\n\nThis could be solved if you could switch to your werewolf form on demand. You'd have to actually plan when you need the double jump and when you don't, when it's better to be a tiny human to fit into smaller spaces or flip switches. You know, kinda like Guacamelee did with the whole dead/alive world switch. That ♥♥♥♥ was genius. Instead the game automatically does that ♥♥♥♥ for you, and there's no point to any of it because obviously, when you get turned into a werewolf, you need your double jump, and when you're a human you need your crossbow.\n\nAs frustrating as some of the platforming sequences were, they were the least of my complaints. Okay, so maybe making you do ten ♥♥♥♥ing different mine cart sequences was a bit ridiculous. Maybe jumping from breaking platform to breaking platform, dodging bats, fireballs, and aiming your jumps over spikes or pits of lava gave you the feeling that the designer only did it to extend the gameplay, not because it added anything meaningful to it. The beginning of this paragraph made it sound like there would be a 'but' somewhere in here, but, honestly, I can't think of one. There's no reason to test my platforming skills on such an alternatingly annoying level. Sometimes you have to do the same boring sequence ten times in a row, with gradually increasing amounts of enemies and fireballs. Sometimes the game just drops you into a super hard sequence that can only be overcome through trial and error; some of the things that you face are impossible to predict or be prepared for. So which is it, game? Are you giving me a chance to gradually overcome more difficult obstacles or just dropping me in the middle of danger and expecting me to figure that ♥♥♥♥ out by dying twenty times? Make up your mind.\n\nIf you're able to get another platformer for 3 bucks while this one's on sale, I recommend you get that one instead. Especially if it's Guacamelee, or Mark of the Ninja, or Dust, or Battleblock Theater, or literally anything else. If, however, you're a fan of platformers and it's on sale while nothing else is, and you can't think of anything else to do at the time, AND you've already played all the great NES/SNES/Genesis platformers and don't feel like playing them right now, you could give this game a shot.","May 21, 2014","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a fun game, but it's hard, hard for the wrong reasons though. Think Mega Man or Battletoads It requires you to die several times to learn the pattern of the level. Another problem I have is that one of the last levels has TWO NOTES! in the music and you die a ton of times learning how to navigate the level. After about 10 minutes I had to mute the music or I'd have gone crazy.","April 15, 2014","true","14.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I promised myself during the Summer Sale that I would gift this to anyone who said they liked challenging platformers. Although there is no sale, that did not deter me. 3 friends gifted and counting!\n\nDo you love challenging levels that require twitch reflexes, smart platforming, exploration, intelligent use of skills, and a sense of accomplishment once you mastered a level? Look no further friends.\n\nBlood of the Warewolf is a game I had gotten through a bundle a in 2014 but never got around to playing it until a few months ago on a whim. At first it was an alright game that has you completing levels both as a human woman and as a warewolf, both who control differently and each have "a particular set of skills." Oh yes, there's more to that reference than you care to know!\n\nYou play as Selena, a warewolf who is hell bent on revenge when your husband is murdered and your child is kidnapped. Oh yes, she will find those responsible, and she will kill them. Your foes? Classic monsters such as Dracula, The Mummy, among others.\n\nAs mentioned before the platforming is amazing, no matter what form you are in. Levels are arranged so intellegently and challengingly that whenever you die, it's because YOU made a mistake, not because the level was being unfair. The things these devs created to kill you as the game gets harder is just amazing.\n\nSadly, the only gripe I have with the game are in fact the bosses. That sense of accomplishment, the skill, the sigh of relief once you make it to a check point, the high you feel once you make it to the end...none of that is present during and after a boss battle. These are easy and kinda kill the moment of the game. However, there is more platforming that boss battles, and in a sense it's good that bosses come and go fairly easy so you can get back to the fun parts of the game.\n\nNow I've only gone through the main game once and have not tried any other game modes or difficulty, so this review is only based on one play through on normal, just like any person would do when playing for the first time. Based on this, I can definitely recommend Blood of the Warewolf with great excitement. The main game alone is worth the amazingly low price of $2. Don't wait on a sale. Buy it. It's amazing.

The levels are fairly bitesize - about 20 minutes, and that was with me dying a strenuous amount of times and getting the lowest rank the game offers. If you're good at the game (I'm not) the levels are much swifter.\n\nThe game offers a story mode, a score rush mode, and a randomly generated Endless Mode, for plenty of high score getting and speedrunning fun. Not something that I'd want to grind on, at least not for this game specifically. Sprinkled through levels are also upgrades for the character in both human and werewolf form, as well as a vast number of Sigils to collect that raise your maximum health.\n\nSeveral reviews complain about the controls being stiff, but I never experienced that at all. (I read there was a 2.0 patch - I never played the "old version" of the game, so it's possible they were worse, but now they're very responsive.) The game is incredibly responsive in its movements, giving you perfect control over character momentum, on ground and in mid air, even when double jumping in werewolf form.\n\nAs I type this, the game is $1.99. I f you enjoy platformers and can handle the occasional amount of rage some of the more frustrating level design is going to give up (or just enjoy that sort of thing), the game is an absolute steal, especially if you intend to do the score attack stuff or try to get B/A/S ranks on all the stages.","April 18","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly, even on my high-end computer the game itself slows down on high settings even though I'm equipped to handle much, much more than this game has to offer. However, even on low settings it looks nice.\n\nOne warning: prepare for a LOT of instant death early on as there are many, many instant death traps in a few early levels and areas where you can get stuck because of annoying bat enemies, missing things.

The enemies are pretty easy to deal with, while the trap areas are horrible to go through and are way too easy to fail in and are too long compared to any other part, reducing the game to just repeating one part in every level dozens of times, making every level a lot longer than it should be.\nI think there is a lot of polish this game could benefiet from (for example, you can see the character still moves after you die and is just invisible, or that a few times I died without a proper explanation), but overall it's pretty nice, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game to play for a few hours, most likely if it's on sale (I bought it during 90% off sale for $1).","May 23, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art is beautiful and the overall style is gorgeous. The controls are pretty good overall.\n\nWhat's terrible though is the level design and the level layouts. It's a hard game, I get it, I was raised on the NES but this game was made in 2013, there are ways to make a game crazy hard and still enjoyable. When I say this, I'm thinking of games like Super Meat Boy which is both crazy hard and crazy awesome. I'm not mad at the difficulty level of Blood of the Werewolf, I'm mad at the fact that sometimes, checkpoints are few and far between. At least respawns are fast, but if you're looking at a solid 15-30 seconds of precise platforming to hit the next checkpoint, that's just playing with people's patience.\n\nI don't regret buying Blood of the Werewolf because I got it on special, but I would have been pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I had paid full retail price.\n","March 2, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Maybe.\n\nTL;DR: Blood of the Werewolf has the impression of a Metroidvania or Shank style action platformer, but the game is clearly a semi-torture platformer more like Super Meat Boy. The action segments in the game are mostly obstacles and combat boils down to killing enemies to get rid of them as obstacles or platforming challenges. The combat is it's best at boss battles or platforming segments where you must properly time your jumps and attacks, but don't let the art style, inspirations♥♥♥♥♥♥ences, and upgrade system fool you into thinking this is truly an action RPG.\n\nI think it makes for a pretty decent torture platformer. Perhaps the controls and level design are not as tight as Super Meat Boy, but it's close, and I think somebody who spends the time to learn the levels and controls may find themselves enjoying the game. However, I feel the game leans slightly to trial and error if you are wanting to S Rank the level (speed running and/or taking no hits). You play as a werewolf mother trying to get her kidnapped son back, Selena. Selena in human form can run, jump, shoot a semi-auto crossbow, and limited multiple arrows from pickups. When you enter an area where the full moon is in view, she transforms into a werewolf that can double jump, bite enemies, claw enemies after not attacking for 1.5 seconds (dealing higher damage), and do a smash attack in air. Also, the werewolf form is "wider" (in terms of size/hitbox) than the human form. The level design is based around this mechanic, so some enemies are place at range, throwing projecticles, requiring you to kill them to stop the project tiles. Portions of levels transform you into the wolf where double jumping and timing your attacks are critical to progression and survival. Level segments often reference classic video games like Super Mario Bros, especially one level that has segments like the Castle levels. Like Guacamelee, there are direct references to classic games on graffitti and billboards including River City Ransom, Castlevania, and Megaman.\n\nSummary: Even though the game did annoy me at times, I think the gameplay is mostly fair, granted, you may have to play a level multiple times to get your rhythm right, especially since the timer on the level doesn't reset when you die. The control and level design may annoy many gamers, so I can only recommend this to gamers that love platformers that challenge your platforming skills. While there is combat, that combat is also part of the platforming so kills are only satisfying when you successfully time you attacks and make it through with little to no damage, and not how you fought the enemy. I think I got about halfway through the game (or the presented map) to learn that this game isn't for me. Though, if I had alot more time and a lot less games to interested me, I'd probably consider spending more time getting better at the game.\n","October 3, 2014","true","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I thought Dracula was pretty cool looking, especially when he turned into his shadow form. The Vampires that looked like Nosferatu in the City level were also pretty rad.\n\nCons:\nThe charged up claw attack felt overpowered, and made combat too easy.\n\nThe wolf/crossbow powers should have been given to you AFTER you cleared the bosses, not as secrets.\n\nThe Wolf powers felt lacking, as I hardly needed to use them (besides the free heal, which felt very cheap). Instead, I think it would've been much cooler to see the powers given after killing the bosses and then utilized in making the platforming more challenging. For example, the dash ability could have been used to speed through areas/destroy stones that you couldn't have done otherwise.\n\nThe Crossbow powers could have also benefited from doing something much cooler with platforming. For example, perhaps puzzles where you had to use multi-shot to shoot two targets at once to open a door? Or maybe have a rope-bolt ability that allows you to swing over big gaps that you couldn't get past otherwise? The powers in general just felt like a missed opportunity.\n\nI was using a controller, and I kept getting frustrated that I had to move with the left analog, aim with the right analog, hold the trigger to shoot, AND jump to avoid obstacles/projectiles. I kept thinking of how much easier it would have been to just having the crossbow shoot tied to just the right analog alone without holding the right trigger, as the system felt a little clunky. I didn't want to use my mouse/keyboard, but it felt like the MUCH better control setup if I used it, as I would've been able to do it all. This really came into play during the last platforming stage where you had to jump quickly, as the ghost summoning guys kept knocking me off if I didn't take care of them. I know the reason is because of the special crossbow abilities, but perhaps tie the abilities to the face buttons, or make the right bumper button toggle on/off the ability, so when you hold the right analog, it uses it instead of a normal attack? You could have gone with making it how Super Metroid's control setup is, and ignore the right analog altogether? Perhaps its just my opinion, but it definitely felt a little slow to me.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nI think the game was a ton of fun and I'm looking forward to the sequel, even if the changes I suggested don't make it.

It gets harder.\n\nThis is not a casual game, it will demand prefection from you often, but if you are up to the challenge the game has a rewarding cycle of tension and release, and the controls are tight enough to make most deaths feel like they were your fault and not some cheap shot the game threw at you. But be warned, the game /will/ give you some cheap deaths and there are sections of the game you will have to memorize to get through. I want to continue to reiterate that this is a game that will demand you get good or get out. If that is not your thing, don't buy. But if you have the spirit of a werewolf in you to perservere, then I wish you luck. It's not an easy journey, but your accomplishments will have weight, and I promise you'll feel like a true badass werewolf by the end of it all.\n\nNow get out there scrub, your baby's counting on you!","December 27, 2015","true","14.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

We have mermen and mermaids, vampires and vampiresses, warlocks and witches but no feminine werewolf noun. I have thought about this for far too long and I propose they should be called “were♥♥♥♥♥es”, because it sounds totally badass. Right. Glad that’s sorted.\n\nBlood of the Werewolf is a 2D action platformer from indie developer Scientifically Proven, part Castlevania and part Super Meat Boy, smothered by an overly dramatic narrative that attempts to pay homage to the classic monster movies of the 30s and 40s. It sounds good on paper, but fails to achieve any one aspect particularly well. It just about manages to pass with solid gameplay and decent level design, but neither are anything to shout about.\n\nYou play as Selena, a Were♥♥♥♥♥, on the hunt for her kidnapped baby after an attack left her severely wounded and her husband dead. But if movies, TV and games have taught us anything, it’s that you don’t mess with a mama’s baby (or a baby mama for that matter) so armed with her crossbow and the ability to go full beast mode, she takes on the other classic ghouls including Dracula, the Mummy and Hyde (of “Jekyll and” fame). I’m not sure why the other monsters are such a pain, though; you’d think being feared and hated by all of humankind would bring them together to form a sort of Munsters-type commune, but apparently not. They hate you and they hate your baby. After a few of them feel the sharp, bloody claws of female empowerment, you find out Dr. Frankenstein is the main culprit and plans to make an army of werewolves from your child’s blood. You are understandably upset by this.\n\nIt’s not the worst excuse for a plot ever seen, but it does take itself very seriously. The writing is over the top most of time and doesn’t allow the solid voice acting to do itself justice. If it opted for a lighter tone, maybe one a little more playful, it might be much more charming. Sadly, it demands to be taken seriously, even with such antiquated and tired subject matter.\n\nThe influence of classic horror movies is obviously apparent, but poorly incorporated. The grainy, vintage title cards announcing boss fights and new locations are about the only thing that capture the vibe it was aiming for. The atmosphere they were trying to create is slightly at odds with the choice of art style, as Scientifically Proven attempt to merge the monochrome menace of Universal Pictures’ pioneering monster flicks with crisp, colourful cartoons. It just doesn’t work. However, if they had opted for a less serious approach then it could well have suited.\n\nThe game plays like any Castlevania clone but with one minor difference: Were♥♥♥♥♥ powers. In human form, you’re armed with a crossbow; while channeling your inner wolf, you rely on melee attacks but have the added “double-jump” ability. Both have their merits and uses but you don’t get a say in when you transform. At various points in each of the 10 levels, you change from one form to another, but it would be far more enjoyable if you were allowed to choose for yourself. Upgrades are available for each form but, they are well-hidden.\n\nThe levels themselves are well-designed, and variation keeps things fresh – there are some clever platform moments that really stand out. Of course, there are also a share of rage-inducing, controller-tossing, hyper-difficult moments that will make you swear like a dock-worker with tourettes. The Super Meat Boy comparison is justified, but where that game made you feel like it was your fault, Blood of the Werewolf feels less fair at times, with certain jumps or sequences that are too unforgiving.\n\nVERDICT: Blood of the Werewolf is a short ride and, ultimately, a forgettable one. There’s little to bring you back around for another pass unless online leaderboards are your thing, and although it’s selling for a bargain on Steam it just doesn’t come highly recommended. There are some brief moments where it shines, but it’s mostly flat, uninspiring and lacking any real innovation. But the most important thing is that we finally answered the age old question of what to call female werewolves.\n\n5/10\n\nAVERAGE. The epitome of a 50/50 game, this title will be unspectacular but inoffensive, charmless but amiable. Im not condemning a game by scoring it a 5, but I am certainly not championing it, either.","May 16","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/singasam/recommended/260250/","singasam","Baihu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/singasam/","111 products in account","Blood of the Werewolf feels a little schizophrenic, or at least, aiming for gameplay that its mechanics can't support IMO.\n\nIt has levels and stats meant to encourage speed running and trying to 100% clear a level with the quickest time, but with the stiff controls between either human or werewolf form, you do not feel encouraged to do that because you cannot perform at your best.\n\nThe werewolf form in particular, has a very awkward hitbox for both platforming and its attacks. The problem is the same assets being used in level construction for either a 'Serena' level or a werewolf level. The spacing and size of each platform gives adequate space for Serena's human form, but not for the werewolf form, leaving you overhanging or clipping into walls and platforms constantly. What's more, the animation for the attacks, particular the focus attack, makes it look huge, but really only makes contact at the edge of the visual.\n\nThere is also a lot of 'cheap' and gamey design choices, very early-on in the first level even, that were added to give the levels more spice but comes off as cheap annoyances. The 'bats' are the Medusa-heads from Castlevania, except they appear right in the first level. In an outdoor werewolf level, you get 'birds' instead. There's a big dissonance here, because you are BIG as a werewolf, but these teeny sparrows, not even hawks, can push you out of a jump animation constantly. These aren't monster birds, thematically, there's no reason they should be there, but the devs needed to add challenge and some obstacle that wasn't a mob or the level design itself.\n\nSpeaking on theme, I know what they're going for here, an old-school monster movie theme, from the Hammer movie heydays, but somehow it's just not coming across all that well. The title crawl comes out in black-and-white, then lumps you into a technicolor saturated level. None of the monster designs I saw invokes the Hammer movie days, but it could be they would improve further on. As it is though, I do not enjoy the gameplay enough to encourage me to continue playing this.\n\nThat said, it's $2.50. At that price-point, it's one of the best on Steam. But with the stiff controls (especially after having played both Guacamelee and Rogue Legacy, both with controllers) and incoherent theme, I just don't feel motivated to complete the game at all.","January 10","false","0.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

She was incredibly controlling and demanding. I just had no idea why every little thing had to be perfect or what right she had to be so judgey (I mean she wasn’t the best looking thing around and she was a bit of a bore). As demanding as she was, she was also really unresponsive. Being around her felt like a chore. It’s not like I didn’t like a challenge, I just want to feel rewarded too. Yeah, it was great that she liked old Castlevania games (pre- Symphony of the Night) and horror movies, but she really seemed to lack a personality of her own.\n\nI think one of her big problems is she spreads herself too thin all the time. It’s like she wants to be an acrobat and a boxer, but she doesn’t do either particularly well. I mean, I don’t think she would be a terrible at jumping around or fighting people, I just think she needs to focus on being great at one thing at a time. She also doesn’t know how to tell a story really, she lacks focus and doesn’t know how to make it engaging. Between you and me, almost every time she started to tell me a story about something, I felt pressed to act interested and I often forgot everything she told me the second I looked away.\n\nShe had these little habits that irked me. She would try to cook up “new” things to try to spice up our relationship but the problem was she never actually came up with anything refreshing. Selena just didn’t know when to stop either: whether we were talking or just trying to spend time together, she would just drag things on and on and being around her just felt repetitive. I managed to feel both bored and frustrated with our relationship pretty quickly. I felt like I was caught in a routine: fighting all the time over little things, feeling rushed around everywhere, jumping through hoops, and it was exhausting. I felt like I couldn’t win with her, and even when I did I still felt like I was losing in a larger sense.\n\nIt’s a shame. I think we had some things in common, I mean she seems like my type, but I think in the end I couldn’t keep pretending that I liked being around her. She’s not awful, she is just average with flaws that I can’t handle. Life’s too short to spend time with someone you can’t enjoy being around, and that’s why I had to leave her.\n\nAlso she got me a copy of Blood of the Werewolf. I am not going to put up with that ♥♥♥♥.\n","December 20, 2015","false","4.5"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","51","18","35","24","1"

Yes you're going to die alot, and yes you're going to have to keep trying certain areas over and over and over before getting it right, but that's part of the fun of this genre, and given that you can just pick right back up from where you left off means that it's far from "impossibly difficult".... I haven't beaten the game yet, but I am thoroughly enjoying the challenge.\n\nAnother common complaint I am seeing in the negative reviews for this game is "the story is weak" or "beating the game isn't very rewarding", or "I don't feel any connection to the characters".... really guys.... just really?!?!?! This is a 2D platformer with a B horror movie theme, you were really expecting a strong story and characters you can relate with? I guess running through pipes, eating mushrooms and stomping on turtles is worthy of a friggen Oscar, because as Platformers go, you're not going to find a more well recieved series.... and as for characters you can connect with..... a short fat Italian plumber is really how you guys picture yourself? As for beating the game not being very rewarding..... one end game scene comes to mind from one of the greatest video game classics in history....... a futuristic armored warrior floating in space whose armor comes removed, revealing that this seemingly masculine cannon armed warrior was infact a blond female..... OH SNAP o.O, endings just don't get any better than that! Just sooooo cerebral.... it blew my mind!!!\n\nAt $1.99, I highly recommend this game to anyone who's into classic B horror and moderately difficult side scrolling platformers, don't even look back..... and I highly recommend that anyone else keep their $1.99 in their pocket, because you're probably going to judge the game unfairly.....

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/260250/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The platforming is good and the levels are well designed and varied. The boss fights are fun, and probably the best part of the game. It is fun getting new powers, although the game hides most of them for some reason, and since they do a terrible job trying to help you with secrets, you won't find a power or two, and you will miss many upgrades, a mistake to hide away in almost impossible to find spots. The story isn't bad, and it's nice seeing all of the old classic monsters from literature. It is fun playing in two different forms, both of which act differently. Then there are the problems. People are right that aiming with selena is finnicky and annoying, especially since so many parts emphasize it. The two biggest problems are collision detection and damage reaction. The collision is terrible. I got hit many times by projectiles that were over me or past me. This is annoying when you have to fight as the wolf and you are standing next to a boss to hit him, as is your only way of damage, and you get hit for standing too close. Most games would just limit you from going forward, but here it lets you and you get hurt because its hard to find the spot close enough to damage but not get hit. The other problem as people mention is when you get hit you go flying back. This overreaction is annoying, unnecessary, and why you die basically every time. The game says you become invulnerable after being hit for a bit, but that's not actually true. You can get repeatedly hit and juggled, even in the air. If you get hit back and immediately jump forward you aren't invulnerable, you immediately get hit again. Getting juggled and auto killed when you can't do anything is annoying. It also makes it dumb because there will be a single platform you need to jump to a guy on there, so you can attack them by jumping toward them. The game seems to use this annoying area to place guys in spots where u repeatedly can't get past and keep getting kocked back or off. Also guys will throw things where you are going to jump to, which makes no sense. One other problem is sometimes checkpoints are scattered too far, and you have to do a bunch of hard precise parts in a row and you think "really guys.....". The game length is also quite good and I had fun almost the entire time. Both collision and the stupid damage response hamper this game and make it more frustrating than it should be and make parts annoying and inclined to continually repeat. People spoke of difficulty but I thought it was tough but no stupid or unfair, like a Super Meat Boy. Pick this game up, excited if there's a sequel. 7.5/10.","March 2, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's a retro-styled platformer, but instead of slapping pixelart graphics on an otherwise pedestrian game and calling it a day like so many other "retro" games these days, Blood of the Werewolf eschews pixelated graphical styles entirely and subscribes to a retro-styled design theory that is much more evocative of the classics. In many ways, playing it took me back to my childhood of playing games on the NES that were great fun despite often being brutally unforgiving.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the problems of the golden era of platformers have come along for the ride too, such as occasional sections that require perfect (and I mean PERFECT) timing of jumps to avoid instant death on spike-covered obstacles. While none of them were terribly bad, thanks in large part to fairly generously spaced checkpoints, they do exist, and if you're the sort of person who gets frustrated easily, you might want to avoid this game in order to save your controller from a premature death.\n\nOne final criticism that has nothing to do with the game's throwback feel: while the platforming was satisfyingly difficult throughout most of the game, the boss fights were very easy. That may not be a problem per se, but it seemed incongruous with the rest of the level designs.\n\nOverall, though, with the exception of a couple of (minor, in my opinion) flaws, this was a thoroughly enjoyable game that should appeal to retro gamers, leaderboard chasers, and speed runners the most.","July 13, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game mechanics themselves are easy to get the hang of and loads of fun, with the dual nature of the protagonist being balanced well.

There are many I could give recommendations too but absolutely can not consciously do so because Valve + Devs are charging 5 x's the value I feel the games actually have.\n\nIn the instance of Blood of the Werewolf I feel it's a true $6 game.\nAfter taking notice of it selling for only $2 on Steam I can whole-heartedly recommend.\n\nI liked that the developer has placed a lot of secrets in the game and items found in those hubbies are extremely useful upgrades and new abliites. However the only secret tactic used throughout the game is the fake wall  gimmick.\n\nThere's been a lot of time spent on graphics and the art style is very similar to that used in the old Fox network Batman cartoons from the 90's. The gameplay is interesting enough to want to finish it however what murdered this game down to it's current asking price is that many of the challenges, presented by various areas, incredibley hinder the otherwise smooth progression through the levels.\n\nWhile some of the traps you need to progress through are clever and involve pattern memorization that can be mastered some are just ...to put it bluntly....incredibley stupid.\n\nFor instance your first game-stopper will eventually be on the second or third level when you find your self pitted against a desecending tunnel of slamming wall traps that you need to meticulously guide yourself past while free falling.\n\nOther inane hurdles toss in entire sections of game featuring patience traps seeing you wait for a ceiling gun of sorts to quit spewing before proceeding forward into a medusa-head-like (Castlevania) enemy that knocks you back under it again.\n\nOverall I appreciated the title enough that I would've paid six for it and not felt ripped off. Any more than six and it's a waste of money. You can currently get it for $2 - so grab it.","September 23, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is linear, you go through the stage and collect sigilis to gain more health and find the powerups hidden along the way. Selena's human and wolf form have 3 different special skills that get upgraded twice as well as two other upgrades for attack power. At the end of each sigil collecting stage is a boss battle. Also, if you miss any hidden sigils or powerups, and you will, you can replay the levels to get the ones you missed. The graphics aren't high-end but I'm assuming it's a stylistic choice because I find them absolutly charming. The voice acting of the narrorator is amaing.\n\nThe only con I have is that there's knockback damage - no one in gamer history has ever asked for this!\n\nIf you're in the mood for old school action platformer then give this game a shot.

Enemies are sparse and take far too many hits to kill, your powerful-looking werewolf form is actually just as fragile and prone to knockback and instant death as your human form, and the level design has a bizarre love affair with instant death traps.  Like, seriously.  Blood of the Werewolf loves one hit kill spikes and vanishing platforms and crushing pistons more than any man loves his wife.  You know the trope 'that one level?'  In this game, every level is that one level.  There is a basic powerup acquisition system, but since most of your deaths will be from falling into traps, getting a new attack spell doesn't really help.\n\nThe boss fights are, by contrast, not bad.  The story is also pretty enjoyable, with pleasant voice acting and presentation.  The use of bold contrasting colors helps with visual clarity and keeps the scenes visually engaging.  It's a shame that so much of the game is devoted to other things that make it a struggle to enjoy these high points.\n\nI'm a Castlevania fan, but this is a Castlevania homage that takes the genre's most frustrating aspects and amps them up to eleven, while begrudgingly offering only an appetizer course of the good stuff.  Only worth a look if you really, really like the genre and have a boundless supply of patience.","July 12, 2015","false","24.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It stands head and shoulders above other platformers and can almost wedge itself into top tier, first party games for consoles, if only it had a map and animals to ride. Its a game that dares to be fun before it turns into a challenge. The only major flaw is from time to time certain sections of the game are in slow motion even with my top tier computer, but what’s odd is when you alt+tab to a different program and go back in, that fixes the slow.\n\nYou play as a Lycan named Selina whose husband was murdered and child was kidnapped. Armed with a crossbow, you alone must save your son and the variety comes in the form of sections that smoothly turn you into a werewolf. In human form, you can high jump, but it seems like if you’re at the edge of a platform, your long jump only goes a short distance. So leap before you get to the edge. I think its designed so you can jump off, collect an item over a pit and still land where you started. There are plenty of tall platforms and narrow gaps, so a jump this high is by design rather than more traditional low jumps built for distance.\n\nIts a game for a controller, but there are still keyboard controls. The left thumbstick or directional pad moves you while the right gives you aim with your crossbow. The left trigger is to crouch, which makes it more precise than if you had to use the analog stick. The right trigger fires a bolt and there is also a selectable secondary weapon that uses mana.\n\nTo diversify things, outdoor segments let you play as a giant werewolf with a high jump and a double jump. This beast has to be one of the widest playable characters in any platformer, but the game is designed so well that controlling something the size of a car is never an issue. You attack with your teeth and claws. The claws are far more powerful and can only be used if you stop attacking for a few seconds. There are also secondary abilities, but I found them less useful. A dash that can double as a ground pound if you do it in the air and others.\n\nEverything can be upgraded; your health, your attack power, your secondary abilities and so on. There are plenty of gold and uncommon blue medallions that lead to an upgrade to give you incentive to collect them all. Secrets can be found by pushing up against the correct walls or taking a direction off the beaten path. While the game does offer some exploration these are straight forward areas.\n\nYou have plenty of health and you can have some restored along with your mana. Checkpoints are frequent, but the further into the game the longer between them. There is a blend of calmer sections with enemies and combat for every crazy section with death traps that requires speed. As the game progresses, it tilts from one end of the spectrum to the other. It starts off easy and ramps up the challenge on a nice incline that keeps it enjoyable.\n\nWhen you get hit, you’re knocked back and even with all the platforming, its always forgiving. There are pits full of water, ooze or even lava that hurt you, but you’re still alive. All of these liquids also add a layer of depth, because when you’re covered, you move slower. So if you’re hit with toxic green vomit, you’re slow until the effect wears off. Its much better than just getting hit.\n\nThe game does a lot to mix up the challenges. You go from light platforming and shooting enemies, to dodging projectiles. Then its dodging crushers that telegraph when they’ll slam shut. After that its fire walls that damage rather than cause a gooey death like the crushers. There are sections on convener belts where you’ll have to sneak past red lights, because if they see you when you’re green, they launch a projectile that homes in on you.\n\nEvery three levels, you’ll get to fight a monstrous boss. Up first is a giant mutant whale, then its Mr. Hyde himself that uses an energy chamber to hide. The bosses are a lot of fun and a good break from typical levels. They have attack patterns that get randomized, so you need to be on your toes, but its nothing too difficult.\n\nDeath sends you back to the last checkpoint after a brief death screen with hints and nostalgic phrases such as “Its dangerous to go alone” and “oh what a horrible night to have a curse.” The game summons a lot of nostalgia here from classic games and twists it to meet its own standards. There are references to the Belmonts in rooftop billboards. River City is spray painted on brick walls. There is a section similar to Quick Man’s stage from Mega Man 2 where you need to plunge down while avoiding the game’s crushers. It feels like there’s a homage to the mansion from Ghosts and Goblins complete with ladders. Between the levels, you get to see a map scroll charting your progress like Ghouls and Ghosts or the original Castlevania.\n\nHere you have a serious game with blood, violence and a kidnapping with a lot of references to classic games from the mid 80s to keep anyone amused. Its something that I can imagine may turn people off with the mismatch of a serious tone and a lighthearted one, but I loved it. Your character is never part of the amusement, her son has been kidnapped.\n\nAt the end of each level you’re graded based on your time and how many medallions you’ve collected. A lot of the blue medallions I’d find after I as able to get them. Its a reason to play again and with the clock always on the screen, its a game with speed runners in mind.\n\nThe art style is very enjoyable. Areas look different and there are nice cut scenes here and there. The water and projectiles glow effectively. There is lighting and and other enjoyable details in the background.\n\nIn terms of enemies, there are only a few types in each area, but they’re used effective. Projectile shooting fish men, ground stomping men of fire. One type of enemy hurls things at you which makes him perfect to hide behind cover. Wolves seem to be the basic fodder enemies, which is like you or I having to shoot a chimp. The variety is less of a focus and there are far more crushers than enemies.\n\nWith all of the good covered, I can talk about the bad and I’ve already told you about the worst sin and that’s the slowdown. It only happens with a few sections of the game and while its an issue, it makes the game easier. The other issue is how soft the volume is on the voice acting. I had to crank it up just to hear any of it.

The art style is quite nice and the boss levels I played (Creature and Hyde) seemed quite nice even if simple. However as far as the general levels design goes I find it a bit weak. They might seem hard but in truth I found myself dying over and over due to silly enemies combos that are pretty hard to avoid without any previous knowledge. The way I see it a perfect level design for platformers should be hard, engaging and fluid. Blood of the Werewolf fails in the last two. Music and voice acting sounded ok.\n\nYou're given some powers however from what I played they're barely used/integrated with the level design. They're all pretty much just things to kill quite resistant sack of meat. Which is quite sad since I enjoyed the way they worked, even though most of the time they were useless... And once again we go back to bad level design or at least identity. There's a timer and yet you're given a long range bow that takes forever to kill anything...\n\nAs for the story, I tried checking a quick cutscenes video on youtube but there's none (guess I should find a playthrough). Also the videos on the gamefolder only show the animated sequences and lack the text part which seem to contain most of the story. From what I gathered the setting is pretty straighforward: You're a baddass mother (which I really liked!) looking to find who kidnaped your son. From the Trial version you know it's Dr. Frakenstein and he's responsible for sending out the monster bosses to delay you for his experiments with your son.  from what I gathered the story doesn't end here and looks like it was made with a sequel in mind.\n\n\nIn conclusion, gameplay is generally weak. Boss fights are nice although simple. Music and voice acting sounded ok. The setting seems reasonable but the story seems short and weak (but it is a short game)  with an endind that doesn't really seem to reward you barely manages to pull you for the sequel(?). So if you're looking into buying this game I guess I wouldn't recommend it. Sure I grabbed it for cheap and if you're curious might as well try it out. However there's not enough good thing on it to recommend it over other titles. Even though the art style looks nice and the setting is pretty cool :)","December 13, 2014","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A decent premise, but poor story and voice acting.  Where revisiting areas require replaying levels, this just ends up being a Metroidvania wannabe that is poorly designed around levels instead of a sequence of places.  On top of this the visuals look like they were done more than a decade ago.

It's a very difficult platformer (due to the poor controls and hit boxes) that has a few main features that make the game frustrating and a chore to play. The biggest of these is the checkpoint system. Checkpoints are too few and far between. If we compare this to Super Meat Boy, it would be like playing through 3-5 levels without a place to continue from. This problem further persists into the Boss fights. A boss fight can take upwards of 8-10 minutes, and one boss fight has multiple stages with no checkpoints in between these stages/new health bars.\n\nCoupled with the knockback, and repetitive platforming sections (some sections are an actual copy paste, but with more fireballs, more fireball directions, or spikes which instantly kill you). It doesn't feel good to complete these sections, it feels like a chore since they're usually way too long. There are also issues where the foreground hides objects that you need to dodge or be aware of, which is just frustrating. There are a lot of good platformers out there, but with levels that take upwards of 20 minutes to complete, a poor checkpoint system, and frankly tedious boss fights (seriously, NO ONE wants to fight a boss for over 8 minutes, that's worse than some MMOs!) I can't recommend Blood of the Werewolf even though I love platformers. I bought it on sale, and I feel like I got my moneys worth in play time, but it wasn't enjoyable and I would glady have my time back, they can keep my money. I kept hoping it would get better, and it didn't.","December 19, 2014","false","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamdrain/recommended/260250/","steamdrain","Drain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steamdrain/","175 products in account","Blood of the Werewolf seems promising at first, then you realize that it has one serious problem, one problem so big that it ruins the entire game and you wonder why it was allowed to release this way. When you get hit, you BOUNCE BACK and die. This seems normal in platformers, but here, you're playing what is supposed to be a giant werewolf...\n\nYou have a generous life bar and can normally take a lot of hits, but it means little when a tiny mouse sized bat can make you, a huge werewolf, bounce back midair, fall into spikes, then die. It will seriously pi$$ you off to no end how things so small can make a big powerful werewolf die like this. You don't feel powerful as you should, and naturally, when you hit enemies, they have no reaction to it until they die. So anything that hurts you bounces you(regardless of size), but you can't do the same to anything else, even when they are MUCH smaller. This is not how you should do a large werewolf. They got it backwards. This game really should have been done without bounce back because you are supposed to be a powerful werewolf! You should be knocking back enemies! They could at least have it be this way in Human form, but not Wolf form. No no no, it's like this in either. You think you're actually tougher as a Werewolf? You're not. Not really. And that's a bloody shame, totally wasting the potential of the game.\n\nThat's not to say the penalties for death are severe... you just respawn some ways back, however many times it takes to survive. There are no "Game Over"s. I'm glad they at least got that right, but the respawn points sometimes baffle me. Sometimes you have to go painfully long sequences to get the next one, struggling through many deaths, only to see another respawn point a few feet after the last one(?) They are either spaced too far apart, or are almost within spitting distance of each other for no apparent reason because that small gap offered no real threats. Many times you will die so much that you will just try to suicide run to the next respawn point because there's no real incentive to do well... As long as you GET there, you'll be able to continune. While this is a form of exploiting, it'll be done mainly because the player will be so sick of repeating the same area so many times, which is because you constantly bounce them into shít and kill them. We should die because our health runs out, not because you sent a barrage of tiny bats our way until 1 finally hit us then slung us into spikes. The word is "cheap death", and this game is LOADED with it.\n\nWhile I liked the graphics, scenery, and classic gothic characters in the game... the story and how it's presented really bothers me. You're a werewolf mother on her way to rescue her kidnapped child. Is that the best they could come up with? All these gothic horror characters and they made a Super Mario plot? You may as well have just "not" had a story if you couldn't do better than that. It's comparable with Mario's "rescue the princess!" epic story lines. It's a small complaint. What's really stupid here is that inbetween levels she narrates to her child. She is constantly talking to her child(not the audience), which clearly can't hear anything she is saying. Imagine if Mario was constantly narrating between levels as if he had an active conversation with Peach and she could somehow hear him. She isn't talking to you, she's talking to someone far away that can't possibly hear her, just out in the open air. I've no idea why she's doing it or why this is in the game. Narration to the open air should be done to the audience! The voice acting in this game is good enough, especially the main woman, who does the pointless narrating as if she's trying to win the next oscar, but that doesn't change the fact that it's pointless. She's very good at voicing this werewolf woman, but there's still no reason for it to be there! They could have just saved themselves the trouble and "not" had any of it. Unless you like listening to this insane woman dribble on to her child(that can't hear her), you're just going to skip all of it, which kind of defeats the point of it being there, doesn't it?\n\nUltimately, this is not a game I can recommend.  If you want my recommendation, go get yourself Rogue Legacy instead. I beat that game, start to finish, and had a lot more fun with it, even though I died 500,000 times. This... I didn't even play to the end. After I write this, I'll be uninstalling and the time you see for me on it will be it. It's so frustrating once you get as far as I did, not really having fun anymore, and for no real reward except another pointless narration. The only real fun I had on this were the boss fights, which are good, I admit, quite fun, but they are far and few between. After a while, they alone weren't incentive enough for me to suffer through the rest of the game. Steam is not at a shortage for platformers these days, and I think you are simply better off with something else.","June 9, 2014","false","2.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The platforming is challenging but only because of annoyances like a repeating bird or bat the will knock you off into death if it hits you (think Castlevania) and trust me, you will get frustrated. It tried very hard to be something special but fell short. The extra abilities of both the main female protaganist and her alter ego are not used for any purpose other than to give you some extra abilites. I barely used them if at all. There are card drops and a whopping 125 achievements but unless you are a diehard hunter, you won't feel the need to try and get them. When you have better platformers out there like the Rayman series or Guacamelee, it's leave me to not recommend this game when you'd have a much better time elsewhere. Gameplay 4/10.

Blood of the Werewolf starts off weak during the very first cut scene. A picture to picture scrolling text with the most stillted narrative that I have ever witnessed. It's as if the game authors couldn't decide if they were doing an aside or an exposition into the games plot. The voice actors are terrible to boot. Cheesy cliche accents with even cheesier dialogue.\n\nAll of that aside, the gameplay is solid. The controls are responsive, and there isn't any annoying jumping bugs that populate some other platformers. The aiming with the bow is a little annoying at times when you're trying to make that precise shot after dying a thousand times. The transformations between werewolf and human give you an interesting variety of gameplay elements but overall, leaving you wanting to be the werewolf all the time because of the double jump and ability to kill things. The enemies are way too tanky. Whenever you play in your human form, it takes upward of 5 arrows to kill anything in late game. That's not to bad but when you're stuck on a falling platform, there is no way you can kill the enemy. The enemies break the flow of the game and only seem to serve as nuisances.\n\nWhat makes me despise this game the most though is that it is a horrible rehash of old Nintendo games that did it better. The entire game feels like Castlevania mixed in with a bit of Mario. Not to mention that they use cheap knock-off versions of monsters made famous by Bela Lugosi. Dracula, Frankenstein, and the like. Overall, the game feels cheap, stale, and unorigianl to a tee.

Levels start with a black and white title card reminiscent of an old movie, complete with film grain, and each zone culminates in a battle with a famed movie monster (Dracula, The Mummy, Frankenstein..).\n\nMechanically it's quite straightforward. The chief novelty is that Selena's capabilities change depending on whether or not she is in the light of the full moon (e.g., outside): if so, she turns into an enormous double-jumping werewolf with a devastating claw attack. If not, she is a human with a crossbow.\n\nThe lack of novelty in the actual platforming mechanisms makes it harder for the designers to come up with something we haven't seen a thousand times before, and generally they don't. Some interesting levels do arrive late in the game, such as those which involve repeatedly shooting switches with the crossbow (as a human) and platforming in the face of changing winds (as a wolf).\n\nThat is more or less where I run out of nice things to say.\n\nIf Blood of the Werewolf was "retro-inspired", I can only assume it was inspired by the legion of forgettable also-ran platformers of the 80s and 90s: less "Castlevania" and more "Michael Jackson's Moonwalker". It feels like a game designed by committee. Graphically it's a mess, with ugly 3D sprites that don't fit with the hand-painted backgrounds and other 2D assets (obstacles, etc.).\n\nParticularly annoying to me is the middle-ground the game walks between "hack-and-slash platformer" -- i.e., where the hero can take a certain number of hits before dying -- and "one-hit wonder". Hits from enemies and projectiles have a strong knockback effect, so while it is unlikely that a player will ever actually die from enemy damage, a majority of late-game deaths come from being knocked back off a platform or into instant-kill spikes. Why bother having hit points at all?\n\nThe controls are fairly responsive, but movement doesn't feel quite right. Maybe it's just that so many platformers these days have genuine physics engines; either way, Selena's jumps in particular feel extremely unnatural. The knockback too feels so unnatural that it breaks immersion.\n\nAll of this would be forgivable if not for the dull, by-the-numbers level design. Everything is dragged on just a little too long to stay engaging: if a section of jumps was fun once, it must be fun three times in a row, right? Compounding this problem is that checkpoints are frequent but not frequent enough -- expect the typical complaint of repeatedly fighting past the same boring segment to reach the challenging portion. This even carries through to the boss battles, which look impressive but require dodging the same simple attacks over and over again, long past the point of engagement.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it's just not a great one. And there are so many great games out there that, for me, mediocrity equals "do not recommend".\n\n5.5/10\n\n[Completed but missed a lot of collectibles, no intention of ever playing again.]","February 15, 2014","false","3.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

However, between the boring story, tedious gameplay, and sometimes laughable voice acting it's hard to believe this one will be worthwhile in the end.\n\nThe story is of a werewolf who is searching for her kidnapped son after their family is attacked and her husband killed. That's about as intereting as it ever gets. There's very little development past that with you just running from place to place looking for him without any clear reason why.\n\nThe voice of the main character is actually pretty well done, but the dialogue is often cheesy and uninspired. The other voices in the game however are laughable at best and cringe-inducing at worst. It's as a middle school drama club was attempting to replicate campy horror movies. (Maybe that's the intention as the setting and artstyle feel very campy at times)\n\nThe gameplay is overwhelmingly, the weakest part of the game. It's a side-scrolling combat-platformer of which there are a countless number of on Steam. The game alternates at predetermined points between playing as a werewolf or as Selene in human form with a crossbow. Neither is any more fun than the other and combat has very little variety. Just mash attack until the enemy is dead. There are also frustrating boss battles with bosses that have undodgeable attacks and plenty of cheap kills. The platforming sections don't fare much better and are perhaps even worse. They can be very difficult at times and checkpoints between platforming sections are too scarce. Unlike something like  Super Meat Boy where the challenge is satisfying there's no skill involved in Blood of the Werewolf's platforming mechanics, just rote memorization. So you're forced to replay a platforming section over and over until you memorize every trap and even then one wrong move will send you back to the beginning as the design revolves around traps that kill you and require exact timing without a second of leeway.\n\nI would not recommend Blood of the Werewolf. It lacks a compelling story, enjoyable gameplay, or really any reason to play it rather than any of the thousands of games like it.","March 25, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Despite being eager for the premise of the title, all I found was a frustratingly unpolished title that aims to be like titles such as Super Meat Boy and classic Metroidvania but instead comes across as using difficulty as an excuse for sloppy copy-pasted level sections and a general feeling of being unfinished. If this was Early Access, I could understand some aspects of the game, but instead ended up wasting my money on a game I couldn't stand to finish.\n\nI write this not as someone who can't handle any game without a "Follow" beacon, but as someone who loves hardcore titles, such as the above mentioned Super Meat Boy, in addition to Dark Souls and Sir, You Are Being Hunted. I am perfectly happy when a game is challenging and lets me fail by my own mistakes. This isn't me failing to understand the mechanics, this is masochistic design built without remembering that games are supposed to be fun. So much of the game's core idea of a female protagonist in a gothic fantasy realm with two different styles of play and traversal sound amazing, and the screenshots above do the game far greater justice than the actual in-game levels look when in motion.\n\nI truly wish the developers the best, but cannot recommend this title to anyone other than the those who enjoy pure masochism for it's own sake. If you enjoy to rage at failures for even when you do a sequence right but are off by a milisecond, then maybe you can get something out of this. Anyone else is better off trying something like Dustforce, Dark Souls 2, or Eldritch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/recommended/260250/","Spencicles","Trip Fisk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spencicles/","338 products in account","The biggest problem Blood of the Werewolf has is a remarkably inconsistent sense of difficulty. It swings wildly from insultingly basic and easy run and gun platforming to unforgiving hair pulling insta-death obstacle courses. Its clear Blood is intended to pay homage to popular old NES platformers, but it ultimately fails to capture that magic. It never seems to find a proper balance in what its trying to do. As I said, playing the game is a yawnfest until you run into a maddeningly difficult section exactly like the move-down-the-screen-as-fast-as-possible-to-avoid-the-insta-death-lasers part in Mega Man 2. Then it goes back to being easy and dull again. As a result, Blood manages to lack the enjoyment found in the games its trying to imitate.\n\nGraphically, the game tends to be repetitive and uniteresting. Each stage is populated with mostly the same type of enemy; there's very little variation. Plus the stages themselves visually rely in one basic background design repeated ad nauseam producing a generic look and feel. This oddly contrasts with the short cut scenes which are the most polished and competent parts of Blood of the Werewolf.\n\nThe story itself is a fiarly generic vengeance plot sprinkled with common popular halloween fodder/famous literary monsters.\n\nIt also doesn't help your Werewolf form looks like a bald lion with a dog's tail.\n\nThe other distressing thing about Blood of the Werewolf is its an example of the indie industry's habit to inject retraded crap like gender politics into gaming. Nobody gives a flying F about the gender of what you play as. It has no factor in determining the quality of a game unless you've got a complete and obsessive fixation on gender or race politics that it psychologically prevents you from enjoying anything due to your warped perception of equality. Attempts to appease that demographic typically result in equally warped and out of touch characters because they've been converted from the original stereotype to suit that taste.\n\nBlood of the Werewolf's protagonist is a perfect example; she's a man redrawn as a woman. I'm not saying that to insult or troll. She really is as agressive and angry as any cliched macho man manly male video game stereotype driven to kill a nearly never ending supply of people and critters on her mindless journey generally from the left to right side of the screen.\n\nBut then I realized something. Werewolf? Those involve full moons. Which happen.... Roughly once a month?\n\nwow\n\nand this... period... involves change, irritibility, irrational anger, and BLOOD...\n\nWOW!\n\nok. I get it now. nevermind then! The main character's characterization actually is spot on and makes total 100000% sense now. Thanks\n\nThe $5 asking price isn't too bad. I can honestly say I've played games that cost the same but are much much worse. I can also say I've played better for the same price. I'd only recommend Blood of the Werewolf if its on sale.","November 5, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Without the moon you shoot crossbow bolts that seem to have the appearance of arrows and with the moon you are a powerful meele fighter capable of dealing mass damage up close.\n\nI can't help but feel that I'm just slogging through this game, though.  Not only that but it also feels so incredibly compact into small halls with implements that instantly kill you.  Granted, dying is only a minor setback in this game where you return to the checkpoint but it also makes you have to recollect everything to the point where you died.\n\nADDITION: After playing a few more levels I have realized that a few of these levels obsess about the number of crushers in the game.  There is a difference between innovative and obsessive, adding something to what is overused doesn't make it any better.\n\nThis game is also one huge collect-a-thon.  Want to max out your health?  You have to collect all the McGuffin's lying around and hidden behind things because those are what you need to upgrade your health.\n\nThere's also the fact that the game reccomends the controller.  Absurd.  The mouse and keyboard functions better in a game of this situation.\n\nLastly, this game is all about the horror creatures.  No humans, just monsters trying to stop you from your objective.  When I watched the intro I had imagined that it was the humans that attacked them, which is incorrect.\n\nEDIT: I just can't reccomend this to people unless they love having to start over and over again after being crushed or insta'd.","April 3, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

It's not a bad game, it's just not very good either. Its greatest crime is that it's mediocre in all respects.\n\nThe art style is decent, the premise is passable. It's basically a Bleed clone that occasionally switches flavors. The game itself doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.\nBasic gameplay is a platform shooter with mouse aim. Sometimes the level will switch you up and let you play in Selena's wolf form, which is significantly more powerful but still rather clunky. In between levels you get some narration, Selena talking to her son as she's on her way to rescue him. It would have been a chance for good character exposition, but after level 2 the writers seem to have run out of ideas and begun rehashing "Selena is mad because her husband was murdered and her son was kidnapped." Which is fine if you're into that sort of thing. The level and boss title cards are clearly designed to evoke classic 1950s horror film. That would be great if any other part of the game had the same visual style, which they don't.\n\nLevel design is the bland "Stick obstacles in the player's way" variety. The werewolf is supposed to have a double-jump, but the heights and distances between platforms are stretched out so that you need that just to get around, which pretty much negates the mechanic. Level designs themselves aren't much of an obstacle once you get used to them, so the designers apparently decided to supplant challenging gameplay by punishing the player for making any kind of mistake. In other words, expect to breeze along through a level until you reach one portion, where you will die a dozen times in a row, then resume breezing along on autopilot.\n\nIt's not that the game is bad, per-se, especially not for the price. It just isn't good either. It's certainly interesting, it just needed some refinement... everywhere.\n\nI would like to bring up performance issues. My machine is older, but by no means underpowered, and it's perfectly capable of playing games like Borderlands, Starcraft 2, Warframe, and even some newer games like Mechwarrior Online if I bottom out the graphics.(Why on would actually want to play Mechwarrior Online is another question entirely, and MWO is not on trial for this review) Blood of the Werewolf was prone to slowdown even at the minimum graphics setting. For a 2D game, even a game which uses 3D characters and models to represent 2D gameplay, this is unacceptable.","October 6, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It is certainly playable, and attempts to offer the challenge of Castlevania 1 with a modern twist. However, the game suffers from unforgiving level design poor pacing within levels.\n\nBlood of the Werewolf works best when platforming isn't necessarily difficult. Going through simpler parts of each level, switching between werewolf form and human form, is fun and has a good feel. Werewolf combat, in the early game, is incredibly satisfying, as you can often take down enemies in one hit (with a "focus attack") that would take many shots of the crossbow in human form.\n\nHowever, every level of the game has a section where the difficulty skyrockets. Checkpointing becomes sparse, one-shot kills plentiful, and deaths common. These segments would be certainly appealing to people skilled in platformers if they didn't feel so unfair. Many of the deaths you end up with feel cheap, like the game is trying to kill you for no reason other than to kill you (rather than providing a challenge). Instead of having clear-cut rules and mistakes that feel like your fault, the game is out to get you. Progress comes to a crashing halt every time this occurs, and it happens in every level except the first.\n\nBosses are sprinkled in here and there, and to me felt like they were challenging enough to be fun, but not so easy as to be boring (with one exception, Dracula, who felt easy and weak).\n\nSecrets are there for the taking, and are all over the game, but rather than giving you the Doom style "how do I get there?" feeling, they more often than not simply make you feel like you missed something important no matter where you go. Did I mention that all character upgrades, some of which are incredibly important to get, are hidden? Including new powers that make the game much more manageable? Yeah, I wasn't a fan of that. Progression should be in sight or not there at all, or all I have to see is a row of empty upgrades that I think I missed earlier on.\n\nBut hey, the art's good. Except for the fire animation, which is comically bad. And the 2d animated cutscenes are great.","May 22, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

In game Blood of the Werewolf has the 2D matched with horrible 3D. The games doesn't look good because of it. I don't get why they didn't make it all in 2D art style.\n\nThe game starts of with a tedious tutorial with a lot of annoying text pop ups. And after that a really long but easy level. I almost stopped playing the game right there. After that the difficulty was turned up old school style and the game finally gets interesting. I don't get why it's structured like that. Why not make the first level where you learn as you play like in for example Megaman X.\n\nThe old school platforming they tried to made would be a lot of fun weren't it for the controls and the bad hitboxes. Most of the difficulty of this game is because of the hitboxes being horrible. Fireballs that clearly go over you but you still get it. Also the controls are a bit off or something. It just doesn't feel right.\n\nWith more polishing this would be a great game. It has a lot of potential. Now I would only recommend it if you really like those old school platformers.","January 5, 2014","false","1.9"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

The most problematic is the damage knockback from old Castlevania titles (with flying enemies coming towards you in wave pattern, even!). By itself it's a welcome challenge but when added to the pile of unexplained, poorly tutored level features and instant death traps the game becomes an exercise in frustration. Levels are compeletely filled with obstacles, with new hazards and dangers being introduced mere seconds before you already get hit or even die by them. There's no rhyme or reason to how levels are designed, rather it just seems as much as possible has been stuck together to create as much challenge as possible, without any thought brought to how all these challenges are presented to the player.\n\n","February 14, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/260250/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","First off, play with a controller or don't bother, trust me.\nOne of the most frustrating games I have ever played, if not the absolute most frustrating. The way you progress in the game is, no exaggeration, pure memorization and trial and error and not so much skill. Skill comes in to play way after you have memorized what happens and have replayed from a checkpoint a dozen times or more to get it right. Then the only skill you need is twitch gaming because you don't even have a fraction of a second to hesitate. It started off and I loved it but by the first boss I could quickly see where the game was going on its quest to deserve its 65/100 metascore. I am surprised it is even that high but then again metascores are sometimes way off from what a score should be. I beat the first boss after a few tries and was on to the next area. After a couple stages my rage was boiling so hard I couldn't take anymore and pretty much do not want to see any more of this game ever again. It has the most frustrating platforming jumps I have ever seen. One fatal flaw of this game that I have not seen since Castlevania or Ninja Gaiden and makes it just as frustrating is that you get knocked back when you get hit, EXACTLY the same way as in those two games. So you can get hit once and get knocked back and get hit four more times unavoidably. In my opinion, that knockback killed Ninja Gaiden and it kills this game too. Everything is done fairly competantly and it has decent production value, it is just riddled with astronomical levels of frustration.\n\nI made it to the stage where you are trying to avoid the red/blue lights so that they don't send a lighting ball after you that you have to run a mile from but can't because you will hit another laser or enemy and just end up being bounced around like a ♥♥♥♥ing pinball and lose all your health. Some jumps in the game are just ridiculous. They expect way too much from the player from some of the jumps meaning that you are going to be retrying from a checkpoint over, and over, and over again, dozens of times. And that is the other fatal flaw with this game: bad checkpointing. It is so easy to die because of the games BS frustration based mechanics and only really advance-able through sheer perseverance that combined with the crap checkpointing will have you tearing your own face off.\n\nOne example is when I had to run against a conveyor belt moving at me while avoiding a security light that summons a ball of lightning that chases you a long ♥♥♥ way and does a ton of dmg if it hits. There are guys in between throwing green poison bottles in an arc making the jump extra hard to time right. I get through it and the last guy has a wall in front of him so I can't shoot him. I time it right to jump past the security laser and over the wall behind him (after about 15 tries). The NEXT security light, which is by now about the tenth one in a row so far since the last checkpoint and was very hard to get to, sees me and hits me with a lightning ball. It bounces me back into the guy's green bottle that he throws in a perfect arc to match your jumps, bounces me back over the wall into the other security light into a lightning ball, then into the security light before it into another lightning ball, and I am dead. I hung my head and laughed to myself for a good minute before I said enough frustration and that is it. I tried that part probably 20 times and that was enough. I stuck it out against my better judgement and made it past that and a little later in the level there is a part where you have to descend screens while the walls slam in on you line by line, similar to the imfamous level in Megaman on NES. ♥♥♥♥ man, it is just not fun at all. If you hesitate even a fraction of a second you will get squashed. With practice I could beat the game after hundreds of retries from checkpoints but that is the main problem. I want to play a game, not play through it from checkpoints for the vast majority of the game. When I pay for a game I want to see all of it and not feel like I am at work having to do work to get there rather than be able to just enjoy a game. This game = frustration at its highest level.\n\nI am not even easily frustrated. Just frustrated by games that are falsely difficult where the challenge is pure memorization and trial and error and not skill. And knockback that is literally the same knockback as Ninja Gaiden, which ♥♥♥♥ing sucks ♥♥♥ getting knocked into something else or into a pit of lava. And I mean ♥♥♥♥ing constantly, every inch of every level. And I would consider myself very capable with hard games. I can breeze through Hotline Miami and I think it is not as brutally hard as people say. Hard in a fun rewarding way, where this game is just frustrating hard.\n\n7/10 if you have a very high tolerance and never get frustrated and don't mind a false challenge, 4/10 otherwise.","May 20, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"
