CMR 2 was/is an AMAZING game, a benchmark for rally games at its time that has aged exceptionally well. How hard could it possibly be? Take that game, port it to a modern engine, maybe nix a car or two and replace decals if you can't get hold of the same licensing deals, and you've got a great game, done!\n\nBut no...\nThis game manages to be so basic, so stripped down, that it barely even qualifies as a racing game, let alone something that should be mentioned in the same breath as CMR 2.\n\nCars: CMR 2 had over 20 different cars. This game has 4. Yes, four.\n\nCourses: CMR 2 had 8 countries/courses. This game has 3. Yes, three... To make things worse, the Australia and Greece courses are basically the same gravel track. The Corsica Course is 100% tarmac. That's it. All races are in daylight, no rain. Compare that to CMR 2, where you had rain stages, night stages, snow courses, mud courses, hardpack and loose gravel courses, etc...\n\nControls/physics: Pretty much any jump will send you into a barrel roll. There's a glitch that appears pretty often where while climbing, the car will suddenly "snag" onto the track like it's a piece of fabric, and lose all momentum. Wonder how many hours has been put into playtesting...\n\nMore problems:\n- The cockpit view. MY GOD. You'll have to see this one for yourself... I'm dead serious, the Sega Daytona USA arcade machines had more detailed cockpit graphics! CMR 2 for PC came out in 2000 and it had a fully detailed cockpit for each car, what the hell happened here?\n- If you look at actual PC (not console) screenshots of CMR 2, this game does not look better in any regard, it actually looks worse... much worse. Much worse than a game from 2000...\n- Absolutely no pre-race tuning, which was a major part of CMR 2 and was pretty much obligatory to get good times at courses. But I guess it wouldn't be neccessary in a game like this anyway, where the courses are as varied as peas in a can.\n- At this point mentioning the lack of replays, additional game modes etc is pointless. This game would still be a steaming turd, with or without more content.\n\nMultiplayer: nope.\n\nController support: if you have anything more exotic than a 360 pad, you're out of luck as there are no remapping options.\n\nPlease, DON'T repeat my mistake and buy this.","July 31, 2014","false","2.3"," 605 of 650 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","605","650","2","10"

They've removed Finland, New Zealand and UK/Wales.\n\nThey have the original CMR 2.0 on PC already running on DX6-ish, why is it so much of a task for them to update to DX11 or lower and improve the textures/resolution?

Well, I have to recognize that has been achieved. You can play it... at least the parts you can...\n\nMegabazillion tracks... errr nope: The original game brings us 9 countries, (Kenia, Finland, UK, Sweden, Australia, Japan, Corsica, Greece and Italy) each with twelve stages. This rip only brings Australia, Corsica and Italy. By now, The game duration's been cut to a third.\n\nMegabazillion rally cars... errr neither: The original game places us behind the wheel of 24 rally cars, counting WRC, B group and various paint schemes. Here there are ONLY FOUR STINKY CARS. Content reduced to a fifth.\n\nThen, the controls. I'll agree Colin McRae wasn't the most realistic rally game in history (we have RBR for that), but at least you can figure out what is driving a WRC. Here, the controls are almost random. The car cuts gas in the middle of a straight without any reason at all, and the turns are divided into two: you did it or you didn't (There's no way to negotiate a drift)... Basically, I found out that I can't drive the car as I want (as in the original), but instead I have to learn how the game wants me to drive it.\n\nAnd then, the graphics... well, even worse than the original (the internal view is worth a shot, don't miss it), plus the scenary has been cut to a size that looks more like you're playing Gran Turismo 1.\n\nIn a nutshell, don't set your hopes any high: It's an awful port, ripped everywhere, and almost unplayable.\n\n(Traducción al español)\n\nComo desgraciar un buen juego:\n\nTeniendo el Colin McRae Rally 2.0 original de la época, lo que esperaba era poder jugarlo completo en el PC que tengo ahora sin tener que andar haciendo experimentos. Bueno, hay que reconocer que eso si se ha logrado, Jugarse, se puede jugar. Lo que se puede jugar...\n\nPistas a go-go... pues nó: El juego original nos permitía correr por Kenia, Finlandia, UK, Suecia, Australia, Japón, Corcega, Grecia e italia. Este rip no trae mas que Australia, Corcega y Grecia. De momento, la duración del juego se ha reducido una tercera parte.\n\nCoches de rally a go-go... pues tampoco: El juego original nos pone a los mandos de 24 coches, entre WRC, Grupo B y esquemas de pintura variados. Aquí no hay mas que CUATRO APESTOSOS COCHES. El contenido se reduce a una quinta parte.\n\nLuego ya está la cosa de los controles. De acuerdo que Colin McRae no era el juego de rallies mas realista de la historia (para eso está el RBR), pero por lo menos te podías hacer una idea. Aquí los controles son prácticamente aleatorios. El coche deja de acelerar de forma incomprensible en medio de una recta, los giros son una de dos: o entras o no entras (no hay posibilidad de negociar un derrape)... En resumen: me he encontrado con que, en lugar de conducir como yo quiero, tengo que aprender a conducir como el juego quiere.\n\nY los gráficos... pues muy justitos. Comparados con el original son incluso peores (la vista interna del coche es digna de ver), y encima han restado profundidad al escenario de una manera que parece que estés jugando en gran turismo 1.\n\nEn resumidas cuentas, no te hagas ilusiones: Es un port horroroso, recortado por todas partes, y prácticamente injugable.","July 31, 2014","false","10.8"," 139 of 153 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","139","153","0","1"

Harsh terrain, realistic and believable damage to your car as you make stupid mistakes, and a fairly competitive AI that makes it a nice challenge all-in-all.\n\nThat isn't this game. This game is a mobile port. It isn't (at all) what it tries to advertise itself as. Handling is simplified, damage is merely cosmetic at best, the terrain looks horrible. Remastered is a term many low-resolution games use these days to try and bring these experiences to the modern PC, but Colin McRae Rally doesn't manage to do any of it.\n\nIt lacks features that previous games in the series. You can't customize your car's behavior before a stage. Repairs are fairly unneeded as they don't impact gameplay, and fixing the "engine" costs the same amount of time as fixing the "suspension" or "wheels".\n\nThere isn't much else to say. This game was trading on good memories of the Colin McRae series and it's just a cash grab. It's lame, it doesn't feel like a rally game, and overall it's a perfect example of what is happening to Steam's storefront where publishers and developers have no shame about what they try to do with their advertising.","August 1, 2014","false","0.1"," 122 of 141 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","122","141","0","3"

This is not that game.\n\nWhat we have instead is a stripped-down version with less cars, fewer stages and fewer set-up/repair options which was previously released for mobile devices. Between purchase and writing this review the store description has been updated to reflect this, but it still leaves a faint glimmer of hope that this might be something better. Don't be under any illusions  - you're paying to play the mobile version with better controls on a bigger screen.\n\nIn fairness to Codemasters, this is at least a competent driving game. The cars handle at least as well as in the original, with noticeable changes between surfaces. Car damage does affect performance, but the scaled-back repair interface takes away most of the decisions in choosing what to fix between stages. There are only four cars available to drive (three of which must be unlocked by completing events), but they recreated as well as possible in the engine.\n\nUltimately though, I can't recommend this. It may only be £4.99, but that still feels expensive for a cut-down version of a ten-year-old game.

I start the career mode, struggling to figure out how to increase the difficulty, no you can't the "championship" is split up into several championships, where the AI starts off super easy in the first and then gets progressively harder towards the last championships. To add even more insult the first three championships are just based on their respective countries, i.e. Australia is the first championship and Greece is the second. Then they will "Mix" it up a bit and add a championship with all three countries stating "it’s time to test your skill on more difficult changing terrains!" no all they did was make the AI slightly more difficult to beat. Where the AI is concerned it is clear that for each championship they just have a set time to beat which obviously gets harder as you move onto the next championship. Secondly they start the race at 40MPH (so during the later championships you are just playing catch-up) and clearly do not suffer from car damage and hairpin turns, because from start to finish their progress bar moves at the same speed. Next is the damage system! I crash into a tree full on and my car is fully repaired for the next set of races, I cut a few corners and I have no time to repair my car properly resulting into the next two races being a challenge to stop the car from blowing up. Last the sound is ♥♥♥♥! I constantly hear screeching as if I’m sliding on tarmac even if I am playing on a DIRT road, when wearing a headset it will give you a right bloody headache. Codemasters, can you just tell us what the AI target time is on the last championship? If I know then I won’t need to keep on this repetitive ride of going through the same championship over and over and over again, I can just do a time trial. It’s a good thing that this was marketed as "based on" and not a remake, otherwise I would of had a refund, the only way this would be worth the money is if Codemasters threw in the original CMR 2.0 and give us the rest of the game! Where the funk are the other countries? Only three!. The game does have its plus points though, it works well with an Xbox 360 pad and if you handbrake around a bend you get the satisfying sound of the handbrake clicking!","July 31, 2014","false","6.9"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","33","40","0","0"

It's clear the game has seen little to no effort put into it by Codemasters, and there are just too many games better than this to waste your time with it. Even once I'd adjusted the setup of controls to make it more playable, I found I just coudn't be bothered. It's uninspiring and dull, and the menus are about as slick as a car stuck in mud.\nPlay one of the Dirt series or even Xpand Rally before this. Don't give Codemasters the idea that their ports of mobile titles are acceptable.\nNew score: 3, and game deleted, even if it doesn't take up much space.\n\n[original review]\nI've gone for a tentative Yes here, despite me kind of only half liking it. If you buy it and try it, you're getting a useful insight into mobile gaming ported to PC. You're also getting one of a few sparse rally games available for PC these days, and for that, it does hold some value. Just make sure you buy it cheap!\nI had already bought this on Android and it didn't last long before I deleted it. In hindsight I do wonder if I'd merely missed a config screen allowing you to adjust sensitivity, and in the case of PC, dead zone too.  For my first couple of goes on PC, it was horrible with a 50% deadzone meter and maximum sensitivity. The car would barely turn for most of the stick's travel, then suddeny lurch, makign it twitchy an unresponsive at the same time. Wholly unpleasant. However, step the deadzone down to a few notches off minimum, and reduce the sensitivity to about 35% and it's a different animal; it feels to control much better.\nThere are still issues mind... such as the controller being useless in some menu screens so that you can't actually select the Proceed button; or when up becomes down and vice versa.\nOnce or twice too when driving what appeared to be a rock and incident free stretch of track, the car would flip like it'd hit a big rock, causing confusion and delay as you roll the car and often end up facing the wrong way.\nIf I was to rate this game out of 10, I'd go for a 6. Which kind of puts it just above average and worth a go.

I suppose I should mention before anything that this is purely a mobile port taken straight off the app store and shoved into Steam for what I can only assume is a quick bit of money making. The price itself isn't all that bad and if you don't have an iPhone/iPod etc. and you want to play this then fine, but go into it with the certainty that it is a mobile port, the feel and style of the original seemingly lost to the pages of gaming history.\n\nTo get the full experience you'll need to play through championships to unlock other cars/rally's etc. Not a bad mechanic in itself but this game makes it feel like such a chore. First the AI is humorously slow, on my very first attempt i beat them by a minute and a half (and while I may be mistaken I couldn't for the life of me find any option to up the difficulty). Secondly there is no sense of speed while driving, I remember the original leaving me on the edge of my seat, sweating trying to work out what just happened. This just left me feeling like I was stuck in traffic during a long drive home after an exhaustingly long day of work. Now it is perhaps worth noting that my experience and therefore memory of the original may have been skewed by a 6 year olds sense of wonder and far too many Smarties, but I am not quite yet senile so I doubt it is that skewed.\n\nIt has some positives, like the version I played on an iPod I was impressed by the audio, each time I passed some fans I got a little kick out of the cheers and sounds of horns but alas this kick fades way before I reach the next cluster of my adoring groupies. The handling is average for a mobile so as far as you approach the game expecting that it’s not too much of an issue, though I still feel like I have more chance of power sliding driving at 40 KM/H in that traffic I mentioned (I feel like the game has assists enabled but no way to turn them off…).\n\nAnd that I feel is as good as any point to leave this review on, what is a pretty good mobile game somewhat unsurprisingly makes an entirely dull PC game.

Graphics might have been decent in early 2000s. Sadly it came out in 2014, meaning that it is not somewhat acceptable nor decent.\n\nThis is NOT a remake of original Colin McRae Rally, no matter what the game's store page implies. Instead it is a mobile game by the same name ported to PC. It looks like a mobile game, it sounds like a mobile game, it definitely feels like a mobile game, and it has the complexity and realism of a mobile game. So it is a mobile  game. And not a very good one either.\n\nI especially "like" how the game engine has trouble handling jumps. Weird things often happen when your car becomes airborne. Like your car attempting to do an aileron roll for no apparent reason, or being stopped by an invisible obstacle when landing. Though I would say that the game engine has trouble not just with jumps, but with pretty much everything related to driving. Controls are unresponsive and most of the time playing feels like you are driving a brick around. A somewhat weirdly behaving brick.\n\nAnd I absolutely "love" the fact that most of the objects you see on the road are completely static, which means that either they are sprites and you go through them without any physical reaction from either the car or the object, or they seem to weigh couple of metric tons regardless of size or material, stopping the car instantly. That is so 1990s. I guess you could call that retro.\n\nAlso the amount of content is minimal with just few different rallies, and there is no replay value at all. Really.\n\nVery much NOT recommended.","November 16, 2014","false","4.9"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

First of all, despite all the buzzwords you are fed about it being a "HD Reboot" and "Based on Colin McRae Rally 2.0", DO NOT BE FOOLED. It is not the original, nor is it 2.0. It is simply a port of the mobile version, generously referred to as a "Reboot".\n\nExpect: Bare-bones graphics, dismal damage engine that is somehow worse than the orignal CMR on PS1, forward-facing sprites, indestructible shrubbery (Robert the Shrubber would be proud), a draw distance that gives the impression that somebody is physically drawing the terrain slowly with a blunt pencil, handling that makes you think that you are in fact driving on retextured damp tarmac, A bad taste in your mouth as the money leaves your account, Nicky Grist.\n\nDO NOT EXPECT: Fun, a wide variety of cars/locales (FOUR, that's right FOUR cars and FOUR countries...), HD Graphics, a game worthy of the name, a feeling of accomplishment, willingness to continue playing past ten minutes.\n\nDo not treat this title as a true PC release, as the description and media samples on the store page try so hard to portray, but as what it is; a port of a mobile game that wasn't even that spectacular as a mobile game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/campingbanana/recommended/287340/","campingbanana","CaMpInG BaNaNa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/campingbanana/","46 products in account","Before you buy this game you need to realise that this is not a full HD remake of Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 but a port of the mobile phone version, which contains far less content. 3 different rally zones, Australia, Greece and Corsica. It also only has 4 drivable cars, the Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and the Lanica Stratos. Whether more tracks and cars will become available later down the line, I don’t know.\n\nThe menu design is rather clunky and is clearly designed for a touch screen device and there is no tuning section for your car and no replays after each race. There is however a section for repairing your car after 2 rally stages although as far as I can see the damage on your car does little to how you perform during a race.\n\nAs for the racing the controls are okay, the graphics are also okay however some of the textures such as the walls can look very ugly, alot of the sprites also look fairly blend eg. Crowd members and trees. To get round this there is quite a bit of motion blur which does make the game look smoother at times.\n\nThe pyhsics of the game are also okay but not great. There is some visual damage to your car when you hit objects, but this could be improved massively. There are also inconsistences in the track I found myself getting caught on flat bits of land and getting flung up into the air with no real reason.\n\nFinally the speed, when I first started the game I thought I hadn't set my car up correct because it seemed so slow. In many rally cars you find yourself in constant battle to keep the car under control, however here you can hold down the gas/acceleration button for the majority of the time without having many issues.\n\nSo my thoughts this game is okay at best, but it could of been more, should of been more. It should have brought back the old school Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 memories. But this game simply doesn't live up to that title and that’s a shame.\n","August 2, 2014","false","4.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

However, in a rally game with Colin McRae in the title it’s a bit hard to not see the true potential that has gone to waste. The description of the origin of the game tell no lies, it’s a port of a mobile game so we are aware of what we can expect in terms of visuals and weather effects, sound, and so on. However, there is some information that not only I do not agree but I also find it to be a bit misleading.\n\nThe description of the game mentions different types of surfaces. While this may be true, aside of road and off-road I didn’t see any other variations. There is no mud, no heavy dust, no snow or wet tracks giving you a very limited window when it comes to variety. Speaking of variety, the number of cars you can drive is really small, only four are available. This is a very low number for a rally game and to make it worst you need to unlock them if you want to race with them in the championship. The four cars are the Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, the classic Lancia Stratos and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI. The sound is as important for me as the visuals and if you are a racing fan you will want to have those crazy sound engines screaming for the next shift but once again you can’t expect such thing in this game, which is fine for a mobile port but insufficient for a PC game.\n\nIn the end I played the game and got most of it, however there is not much to see and do which makes you search for better alternatives. The final line from the Store description ends with a bang but I’m afraid to be a really misleading sentence. It says “The Classic Rally Experience Races on PC and Mac” and I couldn’t agree less. This is not true at all no matter how big or small you are into racing games.\n","December 8, 2015","false","5.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

I see particulary the icon wirh the Focus and the colin|mcrae|Rally, i hold my breath and think, "damn, is that a sort of remix of CMR2.0, the best rally game i ever played, the one which sometimes i play with my PS3?".\n\nI look at the description, based on CMR2.0, 30 levels, 130km, i was like "finally, i will be able to play to a proper rally game on my pc", a real one not like all the recent rally game in which you have gymkhana, a caravan, sponsors every where, thousands of different races, a "story" in which you have to become the best, drive like ken block (even if i like some of his videos) doing circle and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on a parking lot and drive on a real rally stage 5 minutes every hour. There's some other rally games, but they're never good.\n\nSo, the price should have been a little warning, but for a (very good) PS1 game HD remake i thought it wasn't so much. So i bought it, launch it and first "shock", the soundtrack in the menu, not the one i know, whatever, i'm not here for that, i want to play, less menu, no car settings, ok, ok, if they keep the essence of CMR i'm ready to lose a few things...\n\nI start to drive, gearbox in manual, like the good old times, and few minutes after i thought, maybe it's me, or the Xbox one controller, i haven't the same feeling than before. I continue to drive, in order to be sure, and finally the conclusion arrive. The cars seems to never manage to accelerate properly, i never goes further than the fourth gear and 120km/h, in fact you can but only in straight lines, the handbrake isn't very present, the physics of the games seems clearly far of CMR2.0, i was able to take corners sideways on the old game and the cars really gives the impression that you were doing it (the camera was helping too), here you can slide but, it seems to be difficult fot the car to slide when in place, when you turn, the cars slow down too much, you can't really make it slide very long.\n\nSo if you consider buying this game while thinking to CMR2.0, forget it, clearly codemaster shouldn't have evoke CMR2.0 in the description, that's miles away (in the wrong direction) of it. It's a disappointement to see that the name of a good rally games, is used to promote a cheap one.","August 2, 2014","false","5.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

A lot of the assets seem to be taken straight from the old CMR games.\n- The audio is decent. Most of the audio seems to be from the old CMR games as well.\n- The physics are extremely arcadey. The cars are pretty slippery but in a fun way.\n- The AI drivers (Colin McRae specifically) seem to be immune to car damage. Always going full speed while you're car is chugging along. This is more noticeable towards the end of the game because there are more endurance events. It is all about damage management while going as fast as possible.\n\nI really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to arcade race fans and rally fans. I had no idea this was a mobile port until I was halfway through.

Looks like CMR2.0 with modern processing effects applied.\n- Quite an accurate car models of real vehicles\n- Decent physical model with unique behaviour for each vehicle\n- Each car seems to have it's own specific durability level of each system and tends to receive specific damage depending on your driving style\n\nIn comparions with CMR2.0 some content is removed:\n- less cars avaliable\n- no tuning\n- simplified repairs\n- less rallies (no Finland, Sweden, Kenya and England)\n- no duel stages at the end of each rally\n- no weather and night stages\n- rallies are shorter (6 stages per rally max)\n- less camera modes\n- no arcade mode\n- much less unlockable content\nI used to be very found of CMR series and especially of 2.0, but still I can make some mistakes in my comparison cause it was long ago when I used to play it.\n\nSummary:\nDon't take it as one of CMR istallments, but consider it to be separate game of more arcade style.\nWould siut casual players, those who llooks for CMR2.0 nostalgie sessions, people infamiliar with CMR series and looking for arcade with real vehicles with more or less realistic behavior.\nWill fail to meet your expectations if you are looking for something in line with established CMR experience.\n\nAnyway I'd still recommend this game as a good fun.","January 5","true","4.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Now, I compare all racing games to Gran Turismo 2, which is in my humble opinion, the best racing sim I have ever played. It reminds me of the arcade play of Gran Turismo 2, where you could drive cars like the Lancer Evo on dirt tracks, against a second player or versus computer drivers; However, with Colin McRae Rally, you are going up against computer players times, rather than the actual cars on the track. I think this takes away from the realism of the game, because you don't have other drivers as obstacles to conquer and overcome, it's all about time instead. Visually, the game is so-so, but the cars are pretty detailed. There doesn't appear to be a lot of customization. In all, I wasn't overly impressed with the game, though it isn't exactly a dumpster fire either. It skates by, but there are other racing games out there which would be better.","November 28, 2015","true","2.1"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Well, this is not.\nI have all of them and, even though I never liked their handling model, this is even worse and the only things in common are the name and some assets.\nIt can't have the same gameplay anyway, since this one uses a different engine, Unity, which is also partly what makes this game so bad.\n\nThe performance of this game, compared to the graphics, are terrible. It runs just fine in my system, but DiRT2 and 3 at Ultra runs even better here, reaching solid 60fps at 1080p, while this one has worse graphics than CMR 2.0 and runs as badly as the last Batman game.\n\nThen there's the "physics", if so can be called, that are so unrealistic that gives the game a much higher difficulty level than what's supposed to have. They could have opted for the arcade handling model of the CMR series, but instead tried to make something just too big for this terrible engine, and it ended up becoming one of the worst racing games of all times, on par with Team6 titles.\n\nControls? People, again, believes this supports gamepads and so "you can control it better than on the smartphone": nope.\nAlthough it does support gamepads, the controls are not analog, meaning that the analog sticks will act as digital sticks, which adds problems to the already terrible handling.\nThat's at least what happens to me with the 2 different gamepads I own, and to many other people that can actually understand how analog handling feels like. If it only works for some specific gamepad model is beyond my knowledge, but since Unity has many problems with input devices, it might as well be.\n\nThere's a load of other little and big problems with this game, such as a terrible menu, terrible configuration screen, basically no graphics options, static tracks and backgrounds, no replays, bland and dated graphics, recycled music from CMR 3 (from what I remember)...\n\nI can't really find a single positive thing to say about this game. I got it from the Codemasters bundle and I thank myself for not having spent even 1 euro on this title alone, because it doesn't matter how cheap you can buy it at, it's not worth the time it will make you waste.\n\nIf you think this could be a nice time waster or a little arcade racer to spend some time on between more serious games, well that's a mistake: the terrible handling and bad pad support makes racing artificially too hard to be enjoyable, and I'd like to see how many of the positive reviewers actually could, or wanted to, complete the game.","December 27, 2015","false","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't think it's *as* bad as I originally wrote but it just doesn't stand up all that well next to more modern PC titles. Probably because it was intended as a mobile game.\n\nIt's totally playable and kind of addictive once you get into it. For the price, I think it's OK but just don't expect anything amazing. You can expect arcade rally .. closer to Sega Rally than Colin McRae .. I just wish it didn't have McRae's name on, because I think we all expected a modern remake closer to something like CM3 based on the original content. Honestly, if this was released in 1999 it'd be awesome, but as a modern PC racing title by a major development company like Codemasters it seems like an odd decision to release something for PC that clearly wasn't meant to be.\n\nThe graphics are nice enough.. no problems there. Not great, but nice enough.\n\nUI is ugly and very basic. I can see what they tried to do (to try to recreate the old minimalist CMR2 interface) but it's clumsy and there's no polish to make it all feel nice like the original. It just feels like they took some screengrabs from the original and slapped them onto the screen.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's hard to judge this as a PC game. This is a mobile game converted to PC .. as in, they opened up the source files in Unity, changed the target build to PC from iOS, hit publish and went to lunch.. at least, that's what it seems like. Sure, they turned on the bloom filter and enabled soft shadows but come on, that's about 10 minutes work .. it's the mobile version with the least amount of effort to convert to PC.\n\nIf I clear my mind of Colin McRae Rally completely, I can enjoy this game for what it is - a pretty simplistic arcade style rally game. Problem is that Dirt1,2,3 and Dirt Rally have all happened since then and this is left looking really dated.","August 4, 2014","false","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omnipresent_Enemy/recommended/287340/","Omnipresent_Enemy","Omnipresent Enemy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omnipresent_Enemy/","648 products in account","I wanted to like this game so much being a rally fan and the fact that it harkened back to the days of pure rally games before the "party" style of DiRT 2 and 3.\n\nI was willing to forgive it if it was fun to drive and I did even find myself enjoying navigating the tracks sometimes with the faster cars (of which there are only 4) but I found the game serverely lacking polish and encountered too many bugs for this to be enjoyable.\n\nSometimes after coming over a hill my car would hit an invisible wall, right in the middle of the track.\nOccasional painful audio blow outs which can last a few seconds.\nThe game would also sometimes not detect a controller or drop it meaning I would have to close the game and reopen.\nSometimes the physics would seem off also regardless of damage. The jumps in this game are 100% guaranteed to throw your car into somersaults and barrel rolls unless you slow down, I've tried many different takes on the many jumps in the game and it was always the case.\n\nThe graphics are abysmal. Something like a Nintendo 64 game with more smoothing. 2D trees and spectators follow you like items in the original Doom and the draw distance is about half a mile making everything outside this range a flat brown texture. The outside level barrier is a flat pallet of tree texture (which if you get close to, you see nothingness outside of the level) and the game often has odd shadows and light beams.\n\nThe sound itself it very basic. The cars don't sound like the real ones. Dull thuds. Car engine damage sounds like a chain being dragged along the ground. The sounds of the car on dirt didn't sound authentic, sometimes making odd noises. Also thanks for the continuing annoyance of the over-enthusiastic vuvuzela spectators Codemasters!\n\nAs I said before there are only 4 cars and 3 environments to race in. The 4 cars are fan favorites, but all seem to handle the same besides the Lancia's speed and I don't see why they wouldn't include other models and change the handling between them to give them some identity. The 3 environments have more stages to them, but they are all too familiar due to the use of the same textures everywhere. You can use the base car (the Ford Focus, of which the game lovingly shoves the "sponsored by Ford" logo everywhere) to clear most of the game easily and by the time the game gets "challenging", you have the Lancia Stratos which just blitzes everything the game throws at you.\n\nI was one of the few who knew this was a mobile port coming in, as I almost bought it on itunes to give a bash a while ago but decided not to due to wanting to play the game with physical controls. I had hoped from the screens and the video that they had improved on it in addition to adding controller support, but sadly they have not improved upon a single thing. It's a straight port of a mobile game feining superiority using CMR 2.0 metacritic stats. It has also gone up from $3.99 to $6.99 coming over to Steam, which is a ridiculous price for what it is.\n\nI whole heartedly do not recommend this game.\n\nCodemasters, if this was your love letter to rally fans who have been crying out for a pure rally game since you turned the series all dude-bro and went with all the facebook/ youtube throat shoving, you basically just spat in their faces.

I had a lot of great memories playing the original 2 Colin McRae rally games as a kid. When I saw this pop up on Steam I didn't hesitate to buy it.\nThat was huge mistake. I thought I would play it through before reviewing it in the hope it would redeem itself, but it just got worse. Firstly this is not a remake, rather its a re release of a mobile verion of the game. the controls are evidence of this. No matter how hard I try I cannot get this to work with either my controller or steering wheel. The inputs seem to change everytime you play the game or just flat out refuse to work.\nThere were 16 cars in the original Colin McRae 2.0 game, this has 4!\nThe menus are awful, the resolution keeps changing between menus and racing, the physics are completely broken, and due to the control issues I cant finish the game. also whenever you touch the steering controls it seems to cut the power to the car, making it basically impossible to complete.\nCodemasters have majorly dropped the ball with this one, which is such a shame, because they have done so well with DiRT Rally.","April 15","false","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a simple damage model system, a couple championships with each a fair amount of stages. And only after a couple stages you're allowed to repair some of the major damage to your car, so be careful. The navigator is voiced by none other than Nicky Grist, Colin McRae's navigator at the time.\n\nThe game seems to support racing wheel and gamepad. I've tried none and played it with keyboard.\n\nWhether it's worth the full price is up to your decision. I'd recommend to wait and put it on wishlist to see whether it will get in a sale and pick it up then. However if you're more serious into racing and want a simulator experience, then I'd recommend you to leave this page and search for DiRT Rally instead.\n\nSo very simple entry rally game, but nothing for a serious (rally) racer.","November 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I'm using quotation marks since, astonishingly, the game is actually not based on the original CMR, but Colin McRae Rally 2.0 instead. But it's not a conversion of CMR2 either, it's only using some of the cars and some of the assets of the original. The garage options have been stripped down, the number of cars have been cut and difficulty level generally made easier.\n\nFor some bizarre reason the championship requires you to complete two consecutive six-leg rallies in one location before moving to the next, which I don't remember being a feature in the original. Didn't see any nighttime special stages either, and the damage model feels more forgiving.\n\nThe end result is a game that kinda feels like the CMR games of yesteryear, but then again kinda doesn't and will just aggravate you more based on how well you remember the first few Colin games. They should've just straight up ported CMR1 and be done with it. This game, while serviceable, definitely will not satisfy the fans of the originals.","August 16, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game will also make you totally wash your hands of this now terrible studio. For, it's the ultimate screw you and troll a developer could give you. But hey, I made a Ford Focus do a barrel roll after going up a gentle hill...\n\nThe Reality:\nThe game is bad but it's amazing HOW bad it is. Not just in everything that makes a game but they manage to make it even more obnoxious by having the people on the sidelines blare what I assume is supposed to be an airhorn sound or Vuvuzelas. Then the idiot narrating your course turns is just terrible and annoying. Combine that with obnoxious game "music", sound effects and everything, yeah. Screw you too, Codemasters. It's not even fair to say this game is terrible because it is a Mobile title. There are perfectly fine racing games on mobile that would play just as fine on PC. There is no excuse for this trash.\n\nThis game isn't so bad it's good, it's just so bad that it toally reaffirms your hate for Codemasters and how they do business these days. If ever you needed a reason to hate a developer for legitimate reasons, it's right here. Play it and join the Rage and then never give Codemasters your business again.

Sure it has some flaws but for the price it is one of the best rally games you can buy.  The graphics are good, the cars and the stages look good.  The cars feel good on the terrain and sort of remind me of the feel of Forza Horizon rally.  The handling is good once you adjust the controls in options to your preference and works great with my xbox controller.  The damage and repair system isn't the best, but that's the aspect of championship mode that adds the challenge factor.  I recommend this game if you are a die hard racing fan or someone who knows how to enjoy a racing game.","June 22, 2015","true","6.3"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","1"

I don't understand the whining. Yeah, the game is not worth 7 euros if we realize that there are only 4 cars, a few tracks, no car customizability (actually it's OK with me, cuz I don't like the deep fine-tune ♥♥♥♥♥; that's why I didn't like NFSU2 - even that customizability was too much for me, I'm a driver, not a mechanic, but some base things, like the tuning concept in the 2005's NFS: MW would be welcome), no multiplayer mode and yeah, it's technically outdated for PC standards (which is not a problem for me, cuz I gladly play classic games as well as newer ones and I'm not bothered by the older graphics at all), BUT IT IS A GOOD LI'L ARCADE RALLY GAME. And I love arcade driving. The whole game feels like the Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (15 yrs old game and it still rocks, chills my bones - I love this episode so much), but less than that. I read in other comments that the game is unplayable, it has bad or worst controls, controller is useless, blah-blah-blah. Bull-shiat! I have an 11 years old Saitek Impact X6-38V joypad (so not a "shiny" and overpriced XBox360 controller) and the driving goes like a charm (don't check my screenshots, they're just for fun).

And the direction arrows that show on screen sometimes obsruct your driving.\n3) Cars handle like rubbish. If you slow down too much, you lose all momentum, and if you try to keep your speed up, you'll likely still lose a lot of momentum, or slide as though you are riding a road bike going around corners on gravel - sliding uncontrollably off the road. Someone else said "a brick with butter for wheels". I'd agree.\n4) Graphics are forgettable. Car sounds, especially when moderately damaged, are rather annoying. All feels like a mobile port, and not a properly developed PC game.\n5) Probably forgotten something...\n\nIf you like rally games, get any of the DiRT games. If you're not a fan of rally but wanted a casual arcadey game, don't buy this - I'm sure you can find a better game to spend a few bucks on.","October 23, 2015","false","4.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Don't get me wrong. It's not a BAD game, but it isn't stellar.  There are much better racing games you can get at this price (or even lower)  (such as Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed, Blur, Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010, Need for Speed the Run, and the Dirt series.\n\nLONGER VERSION:\nThe entire game is pretty much time trials by yourself. Unfortunately you don't see your oponnents' cars. Each stage offers a different layout, but to advance to a different area, you have to play stages in the same area like 10 times. I got bored looking at the same environment and playing alone without AI cars.\n\n\nControls feel just like the cars in the DiRT series, which is good. Your car becomes damaged if you bump into debris and trees. After like 2 races, you're given an option to make a limited number of repairs. With the limited "repair time" you must strategically choose which parts of the car you want to repair.\n\nBecause of the slow progression through the game (it takes forever to see the different environments), and innability to see opponent cars or race alongside opponents, I cannot recommend this game at this price point.\n\nThere are far better and fully fleshed-out games that can be purchased for about $5 which are much more fun.","December 4, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/indigojam/recommended/287340/","indigojam","IndigoJam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/indigojam/","160 products in account","I've seen a bunch of negative reviews for this game...\n\nI do not know if you have VERY poorly running PCs, a version of Windows that runs this badly, or got a snagged file or three in your downloads, but this game looks pretty awesome for what it is, has zero popup, & zero drawin EVER... (something those retro games the negative reviews say this game is not like, but this is far superior to in all the ways that I care about)\n\nDo yourself a favor, & set the launchers' graphics to low, but the highest rez possible, high has so much blurring that it not only eats framerate, it looks awful, & I got the feeling that I needed glasses all of the sudden on high, yeah it's THAT blurry, on low the textures look okay enough, & as I said there's no visual artifacts like stuff suddenly popping into the distant view, or texture drawins...\n\nAs for the handling? Well if you fancy yourself as a hip Rallycross player, turn sensitivity down (unless it's too low straight off, Mine defaulted max), & turn the deadzone ALL the way down... this even makes the cars pull to the side a tiny bit when they shift gears, JUST like cars do on real loose surfaces like gravel/sand.\n\nIf you fancy yourself as a casual rally player leave sensitivity maxed, & put deadzone 1, or 2 from the lowest setting, this negates the cars pulling to the side when they shift (except in the VERY odd circulstance when you're shifting, & jumping/cresting in 1st-3rd gears, & when that does happen don't hit a tree)\n\nIf you aren't quite sure exactly what the meaning of the word fancy is... go play NFS yah Yankee! No seriously then you can turn deadzone up really high, which makes the game play/run so smoooth, it almost looks like it's getting a better framerate (the camera is just jerking about less).\n\nThe tracks in the game all play/look JUST like real rally tracks should (yes up very close SOME of the many kinds of trees, & about 1/2 of the bushes seem to have fuzzy textures (on low, I don't play on high it gave Me motion sickness!), but you spend 99% of your time near the middle of the road, & in high rez that looks pretty darn good, & no popins (Marry?), the turns/hills/etc. are done VERY well (the 1st Championship is VERY easy, straight, & even bland looking tracks, keep playing m'kaaaaaay)\n\nThe physics in the game? I dunno if peoples Phys-X/Active-X is flarmed up, or they have other issues, but they're dead on except for the fact that the car pivots on an axis like a top, but devs do this because they may look odd from a 3rd person view, from inside the car [more on that...] it "feels" more like a car traversing a loosly surfaced plane. so if you use 2 of the 3 views you'll prob have zero objections to the physics, from the follow the car view it looks pretty artificial turning, drifting etc. {*note to devs* A tighter tail camera clears this up a bit}\n\nThe game has 3 views... the follow the car view, which is like any other game has, the hood view (bonnet) which lots of even modern games don't bother drawing the dang hood on, this does, & it damages in real time, & the inside car view (cockpit), which is like other games except this oddly has the body of the driver, & steering wheel gone, so it feels a little wierd at 1st, but works well, & once you start focusing on the road/navigator... Myself as with almost all racing games am very happy with this games hood view\n\nI haven't beaten the game yet, so I cannot speak to bugs/glitches in later cars/tracks, but with like 28% unlocked (2 cars, & bunch'a tracks/variations) I haven't experienced any launch/play/control glitches Myself.\n\nI also think those people surely must not have actually spent much time playing 1st gen Rally games, or even PS1 Colin McRae, because everything in this game is superior to that game for sure. No splitscreen, no multiplayer, boo hooooooo! Then you hotseat with your friends, taking turns, & noting the times... That's how We did it on LOTS of older games that lacked even splitscreen, so the store claiming this to be retro goodness is 100% correct! (No sorry no demo derby, tag, soccer, or any of the other goofy modes you guys are spoiled with now in other recent rally games)\n\nIf you have tons of cash, a monster PC, & want the worlds bestest rally experience, then Steam has about 5 better ones, BUT if you're stuck using a slow/cruddy PC like I am (for awhile *sigh*), & Like rally games, or racing in general... $7 bucks ain't to much to ask, & if it's on sale? (I just got Mine for like $1.60 I think) then it's well worth it!\n\nNote I'm using Windows 8.1 which has trouble running some stuff, AND a very slow, cheap laptop... if My PC will run this game, yours should too!

You get 3 rallys worth of courses to race through (30 tracks in total I think?) stretched over various tournaments which admittedly go on for far too long and a selection of 4 cars in total (which feel like they take aaaaaaaaaages to unlock). I played it for about 3 hours when I first installed it and it was pretty fun, quite reminiscent of the early Playstation Colin Mcrae games. Can't comment on if it's a good port or not because I don't play iOS or Android games. But the controls seem ok, my only minor gripe is the very irritating menu music and the AI is really easy. Playing against the AI feels like racing against your Nan, if she had no hands.\n\nTo summarise though - there's a reason it's only priced at £4.99 so don't get upset and cry when you don't have mountains and mountains of content to storm through, it's fine to pick up for a couple of hours after you first purchase it and boot it up but I can't see myself wanting to play it again at any point soon and also yeah, atleast it doesn't have Gymkhana.","August 10, 2014","true","3.1"," 19 of 52 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","19","52","2","0"

But the experience from this game is more of a reason to buy it.\n\nEssentially it feels like the rally games from 10 years ago (partly because it is) but the touch-ups in the remake allow it to feel and look how it does in your memory. This game does what it sets out to perfectly, it lets you relive the old games, without too many of the hassles involved in installing and setting up to work with controllers.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, the difficulty level is fairly easy and all the competitors times are pre-determined. The stage progress bar up the top (straight from the old rally games) bears no reference to whats happening on the track for your competitors, and only shows average speed of the lead CPU (Colin Mcrae in every race).\n\nWhen driving, you get the familar pace notes, although they are mostly accurate, relying on them too heavily will cause an accident. Things like sudden hairpins, jumps immediately before corners, and the pace notes only being 30-70m ahead of you make for some very reaction oriented driving (especially in Australia...).\n\nDamage is taken fairly easily in the cars, with even crash free stages short causing quite severe damage by the time you get in for repairs, making the 30 minutes for repairs quite strategic. When you crash (you will), the damage to power and suspension is the most noticeable, followed by the wheels, making you have to dynamically change driving styles mid-race (momentum is key with a ruined engine.)\n\nIf you're expecting a fully fledged game, that will give you an engaging storyline, or even a new experience, don't buy this game. If you're after a relaxed drive down memory lane, and this game is on sale, I highly recommend it.\n\nPros -\nTakes you back to the rally games of ten years ago.\nWorks flawlessly with Xbox 360 Controller.\nMore emphasis on better driving, rather than speed.\nDamage and repairs is a nice change.\n\nCons -\nInvisible walls just of the edge of the track in some places.\nPace notes not always accurate or timely.\nI crashed in the middle of the road, into the road at one point.\nRolling the car doesn't result in immediate car reset.\nNot much variety in rally stages.\n\n","November 15, 2014","true","4.4"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","0"

Except it's more of a pure arcade racer. There's no confusing car customization or tuning. You just pick a car and drive. The visual/audio navigator directions are lower quality then other rally games but they server the purpose of simulating a navigator and are good enough to help the driver run faster. The handling characteristics are super simple and dumbed down. Hardly any need to use the brakes or accelerator with any modicum of finesse. Just barrel into a corner and, voila!, the car drifts itself.\n\nI would reccomend this game to someone who wants to have an arcade-style and very simple rally racing experience. I would NOT reccomend this game to someone looking for flashy graphics, or a "driving simulator" type experience because really this game doesnt have a lot to offer beyond "vroom vroom" but it's only $7 so what do you want?\n\nAs for the "HD remake fraud" comments on a lot of reviews: Check the screen caps, check the trailers.

It certainly feels similar to playing the old game, and I feel like I recognise the tracks from my days spent on CM1 and 2.0. I would hesitantly recommend this as I have enjoyed my first few runs on it. However, there are a few issues. I have struggled to get my controller to behave as I would like. I can select keys or buttons but cannot change the analogue stick. Consequently I have to push left to accelerate and right to brake. I had a few hairpins where I "whacked on the brake" and actually accelerated into a crash. Also crests appear to cause my car to roll over several times. The next issue is the "difficulty". While getting used to the controller I decided to do the first Championship consisting of six tracks. Despite my crashes and rolls I won with a total of just under 19 minutes with the second place getting just under 26 minutes. I really ought to have to at least get good before winning, and never by that much!\nHowever, I enjoyed playing and it felt nostalgic. I certainly like the idea of some old classics being "remastered" for modern computers, and at a good price too. I look forward to a remastered Cannon Fodder...

Seriously who dont know this game at 2000, and played it a LOT :)\n- The graphics are the same and new, jeez, i like it!! Well, the Unity engine does the job pretty well!\n- Worth every penny, if you are an addict to this type of game!\n- The Co-Pilot Sound is almost the same, but in a good way\n- I like achievements\n\nCons:\n\n- No replay, at the end of the stage.\n- No fine tuning option, best part of the game at the CMR2.0 imo.\n- Controls are horrible... well not that much but its not good as the CMR2.0 have\n- It's like you pushing the gas pedal to the limit but the car feels moving very slowly.\n- It's too easy\n- Lack of cars, and stages.. More than the half content are missing fromt he original CMR2.0.\n- MIssing the inside camera option (It does have but not like CMR2.0) :(\n- Am I missing the MPH/KMH option at the menus?\n\nSumm:\n\nTheres an IPhone version of this game. I dont have an iPhone, but the videos and the controls, and the engine whispers to me we have a port of a mobile game. Sad or not, thats you decide.\nFor myself i can easily say worth every penny, because, what i sad before, its part of my childhood :)\nAnyway respect for Codemasters, for renewing this title and hopefully in a small update will cure the problems (physics, camera, fine tuning)\n\nBut for the nostalgia i'll give a 6/10.","July 31, 2014","true","4.6"," 8 of 41 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","8","41","0","0"

That being said, the game still delivers a lot of satisfaction.\n\nI recently bought the Android version. I had mixed feelings about it; especially the touch screen controls - they suck period.\nI imagined how much better the game will play with a gamepad controller like the xbox 360. And here it is!!\n\nI've only played the Australian Rally so far, but the game is solid. So much better with a gamepad.\n\nWhat it is: If you love rally games you will like this game. It has good control mechamism and the graphics are fairly good for the size of the game. You don't need a high end pc to play this. It's not too difficult or too easy. Damage your car and you'll notice the difference. You have steam achievements and trading cards. You  get the old school rally sound and commentary without drift and annoying commentary found in the latest codemasters games.\nThe price is right for what you get.\n\nWhat it's not: You can't compare this to the Dirt series or Grid series. This was initially developed for mobile so the standards are not there. Original Colin Mcrae - you will never have that again in my opinion.\n\nPros: Highly enjoyable, fun and nostalgic game\nCons: Not able to modify the cars and some bugs in the sound and commentary (same in the mobile game)\n\nIf you support this game, perhaps codemasters will realise we still and always will love original rally games and they will release a top quality product again in the coming years.....","July 31, 2014","true","3.9"," 10 of 46 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","10","46","0","0"

The newer rally games don't really hit the spot for me as they sadly aren't focused on the pure rally modes anymore. If you want a back to basics rally experience then this is the game for you.","September 6, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The real original rally  on pc  is so much better. Being a pc gamer iam spoiled with quality from Codemasters and Milestone S.r.l.  (Milestone is responsible for WRC 1-2-3-4.)\n\nSome short brief, first the good stuff:\nOriginal voice actor.\nCars look ok and gives me some short flashes from the old days. ;)\n\nAnd now the bad stuff:\nCars seems to be really low on horsepowers. Giving full throttle should give more juice on those wheels.\nCars seems to glide on ice on all surfaces.\nCars fly or roll on jumps like crazy.\nCar damage is as simple as 1999. Just see for yourself if you get it.\nThe scenery of the tracks are boring and simple.\nMusic is repeative and boring after 2hrs\n\nPlease Codemasters dont ruin such a famous gem as Colin MCRae Rally with these low cost ports from phones. Next time add alot more for it being worth to get on pc. Yes we want more because we know you can deliver.\n\nIf you enjoy simple arcade racers with not so hard achivements and steamcards give it a go on sale.

By the time it was on sale it was apparent that this was in fact a PC port of the mobile game based upon Colin McRae Rally 2.0 and it had loads of negative reviews. In the end I still bought it because even if it is a cut down version I still wanted to play it to relive the fond memories of the original game.\n\nMy first thought when I started the game was isn't this supposed to have updated graphics? After a look at screen shots of the original I could see the graphics have been updated but it still doesn't look great. I realised at this point that this game does not just need to measure up to the original but to the idealised version in my head coloured by years of nostalgia.\n\nTo be fair it did have some aspects that lived up to my expectations. The overall driving mechanics are excellent fun (apart from the occasional collision detection glitch that just stops your car). It also has the great damage management aspects of the original what has been lacking from many of more recent dirt games.\n\nI am however still going to give this a thumbs down because they have cut so much out in comparison to the original it is not worth it. Most of the cars are gone, most of the tracks are gone, there are no different liveries, no different weather conditions, the car set up is gone and the detailed in car view is gone.","November 15, 2015","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The real original rally  on pc  is so much better. Being a pc gamer iam spoiled with quality from Codemasters and Milestone S.r.l.

Giving full throttle should give more juice on those wheels.\nCars seems to glide on ice on all surfaces.\nCars fly or roll on jumps like crazy.\nCar damage is as simple as 1999. Just see for yourself if you get it.\nThe scenery of the tracks are boring and simple.\nMusic is repeative and boring after 2hrs\n\nPlease Codemasters dont ruin such a famous gem as Colin MCRae Rally with these low cost ports from phones. Next time add alot more for it being worth to get on pc. Yes we want more because we know you can deliver.\n\nIf you enjoy simple arcade racers with not so hard achivements and steamcards give it a go on sale.

While playing i was allways thinking how great was the old game, and this one falls out short but when you finish the campaign you get a little light of hope in a message that codemasters thinks in adding more content later.\nThis game has 3 countries you play in, Australia, Greece and France ( Corsica), the first two are mostly gravel and the last one is all tarmac and you can somehow feel the difference between them.\nYou can choose between four cars Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer and a RWD Lancia Delta which didnt feel like it and was also the best car in the game since it was the only one with good acceleration. The Subaru and Mitsubishi felt like they had autobreak on, im quite sure the suspencion was made out of rubber because the cars were jumping all over the road.\nI recommend it because is play and drive and close to the game base but there is a lot of content missing.","November 29, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By the time it was on sale it was apparent that this was in fact a PC port of the mobile game based upon Colin McRae Rally 2.0 and it had loads of negative reviews. In the end I still bought it because even if it is a cut down version I still wanted to play it to relive the fond memories of the original game.\n\nMy first thought when I started the game was isn't this supposed to have updated graphics? After a look at screen shots of the original I could see the graphics have been updated but it still doesn't look great. I realised at this point that this game does not just need to measure up to the original but to the idealised version in my head coloured by years of nostalgia.\n\nTo be fair it did have some aspects that lived up to my expectations. The overall driving mechanics are excellent fun (apart from the occasional collision detection glitch that just stops your car). It also has the great damage management aspects of the original what has been lacking from many of more recent dirt games.\n\nI am however still going to give this a thumbs down because they have cut so much out in comparison to the original it is not worth it. Most of the cars are gone, most of the tracks are gone, there are no different liveries, no different weather conditions, the car set up is gone and the detailed in car view is gone.","November 15, 2015","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a remaster of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (still don't understand why is it called just Colin McRae Rally instead of Colin McRae Rally 2.0 Remastered), but it lacks more than half of the content from the original game. You get to choose from only 4 cars (Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer and Lancia Stratos), 3 of them you have to unlock. There's only 3 countries (Australia, Greece and Corsica, originaly called France), so you get to race only on three types of surfaces - sand, tarmac and gravel. No mud, no snow, no ice. All the races happen during sunny day, which is the only weather condition in the entire game. No night, no rain, no storm, no snowing, no clouds etc. The game is an arcade just like the original, but the driving model is kinda weird. Almost any bigger jump is almost impossible to land in a higher speed, instead you always crash and roll, because the car behaves like if it was made out of rubber. Besides all that the game is also missing the Arcade mode, there's no multiplayer at all, you can't setup the car and you can repair only four things. The game is a port of a mobile version, so the menus look really simple and as for the graphics (since this is a remaster) it's basically just a resolution upscale with few added effects. And yes, I spent 9.6 hrs on this game, because that's approximately how much it will take you to finish all championships, after that there's no reason to play the game any more.","August 11, 2015","false","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're also invincible and suffer no damage/speed penalties at all.\n- Unity -> damn, a rich dev/publisher like Codemasters can't afford a better engine? Why didn't they use any from their older CMR's or Dirt games? Oh right, that would mean they'd need to do something more than just recompiling the ARM mobile version to x86.\n- a lot more, but the game just isn't worth enough for writing it down\n\nIf you want the real CMR experience, get anything from 1 to 2005 or any Dirt and stay away from this; if you still want it because of the price - forget it and get Xpand Rally. It's 11 years old, looks better, got more tracks, better handling and got more in common with our well-known CMR franchise than this disappointment of a game.","August 17, 2015","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The real original rally  on pc  is so much better. Being a pc gamer iam spoiled with quality from Codemasters and Milestone S.r.l.  (Milestone is responsible for WRC 1-2-3-4.)\n\nSome short brief, first the good stuff:\nOriginal voice actor.\nCars look ok and gives me some short flashes from the old days. ;)\n\nAnd now the bad stuff:\nCars seems to be really low on horsepowers. Giving full throttle should give more juice on those wheels.\nCars seems to glide on ice on all surfaces.\nCars fly or roll on jumps like crazy.\nCar damage is as simple as 1999. Just see for yourself if you get it.\nThe scenery of the tracks are boring and simple.\nMusic is repeative and boring after 2hrs\n\nPlease Codemasters dont ruin such a famous gem as Colin MCRae Rally with these low cost ports from phones. Next time add alot more for it being worth to get on pc. Yes we want more because we know you can deliver.\n\nIf you enjoy simple arcade racers with not so hard achivements and steamcards give it a go on sale. I gave it a go and can enjoy it for short bursts but thats all. Its not super bad but not good either.","October 26, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A strange combination of marketing tech-demo (this game was heavily sponsored by Ford) and racing simulation, you may be at first puzzled by the simplistic graphics and dumbed down controls, but it does warrant a look, especially if yiou're looking to have a little bit of mindless fun.\n\nNo controller or multplayer support, limited graphics gratification and ... where's the music? reduce this to a game best acquired in a bundle, as part of a sale, but not at full price. For a superior experience that caters to casual drivers, buy any of the Dirt or Grid franchise. In a market of superior Free-to-Play options there's no reason to pay for an inferior experience, all round.\n\nThis is a good game, doing what it does, but don't set your expectations too high.","January 15","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks like these old Colin McRae games from the first half of 2000's but there is nothing special AT ALL. There is no special content, no multiplayer (even local) and even the main menu looks lame. I would recommend it if it was made a lot earlier but it was made pretty recently and there are a lot better racing games out there in the Internet and Steam right now.\nRATING: 4/10 "Got bored after 1 hour of straight playing!"","June 30, 2015","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THIS IS A PORT OF A MOBILE GAME. DO NOT BUY!\n\nso, the game sucks in almost every aspect, here's why:\n\nGraphic: probably the only good thing in this game. the nostalgia feeling is there, the game looks really like the old one, althought it has been rewritten in Unity. It uses most of the original assets and adds some realtime shadows, motion blur and sligthly better car models\n\nSound: awful. the car's sound is flat and boring. co-pilot voice has just few lines and also has bad timing causing them to be played too late or overlap each other\n\nTracks: 6 rallies in 3 countries (Australia, Greece, France) spanning over 12 stages each (althought some of them are reversed). the tracks come from from the original game (so they're good) but they have been slightly modified to adapt to a mobile game: moslty, the road has been widen, but also, all the surface react the same way, there's no difference between tarmac and grass.\n\nCars: only 4 cars. Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza '99, Lancer Evolution VI, Lancia Delta. the first tree handle the same way, while the fourth outperform each of the other in every way speed, accelleration and handling (which is completly unrealistic)\n\nControls: bad. since is a mobile port, the game is not designed to take analogic input, so wether you're using a keyboard or a gamepad the experience is the same. the game also supports steering wheels, mine didn't work and i found complains on the forum that the steering feels digital even with the wheel. it's also very difficult to assign buttons.\n\nPhysics: bad, very bad. you can clearly feel that the game was designed for mobile devices, the handling is very simple and braking is un-necessary. impacts are broken wheter you impact perpendicularly or just scracth something the result is the same: the car stops. it also happens to crash into invisible walls in the middle of the track or your car start to bounce around for no reason (especially the Stratos)\n\nDamage: broken. the car get damage even if you drive safely and slowly on a tarmac road. I would not be surpirsed if in the mobile version you have to wait for the car to get repaired or pay to repair it.\n\nGame modes: you can race on a single stage, a whole rally or a championship. the career is made of various championship, the first 6 just made of the 6 available rallies, the others mix the rallies in various ways but not the stages, so you'll have to do the same stages in the same order over and over again. the original game was similar but with different car classes and over 12 countries.\n\nAI: one of the worst example of the rubber-band effect ever seen in a game, and it's also way too easy completly lacking any challenge.\n\n\nthis game it's a scam, they tried to make money on the nostalgia of the players with a very bad port of a very bad mobile game. AVOID even if it's free","June 3","false","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
