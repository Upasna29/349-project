Specifically, while a few characters join you as you progress through the game, you mostly acquire new characters through in-game lottery machine, and later you can also combine characters with each other or “item” cards to create characters not available otherwise.\n\nBattle are turn-based with both characters acting simultaneously, though different kinds of actions take place in different order, often resulting in one of characters acting before other.  Aside from RPG stats, effectiveness of characters’ attacks is also affected by Rock-Paper-Scissors advantage/disadvantage system – characters and attacks are even marked accordingly!\n\nThe main story is short, but fun in a humorous way. And if you enjoy collecting, earning money to “Catch ‘Em All” will add quite the few hours to the gameplay! 200% Mixed Juice also has competitive multiplayer that would put your best characters to the test, and depending on how much you enjoy it, it will give you from several to many hours of fun!","October 28, 2015","true","44.8"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","53","59","0","0"

Be it from 100% Orange Juice or any of the other games they made.\n\nRegardless, it's a solid Pokemon-esque battle game with silly dialogue.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genestarwind/recommended/335190/","genestarwind","Mantis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genestarwind/","2116 products in account","Indie GAGA Review\nThis is a short review. To view the full review including many more details, a video and screenshots, please follow this link[www.indiegaga.com].\n\n\nOverview\n\nI must mention first of all that this game primarily serves as a fan service to people who have played other OrangeJuice titles. This is a JRPG with strong visual novel elements. Our first introduction to the characters in this was from 100% Orange Juice (a virtual board game) which was a little confusing if you think of it like playing Mario Party alone. You see, the Japanese were introduced to the characters through OrangeJuice's bullet hell games, so they already knew who many of the characters were. You might think of this as unimportant, but really, you will be lost when playing this if you haven't played any of the other OrangeJuice titles.\n\nDialogue is childish, and so is the humour, so don't expect anything serious. Battles are fought with a perspective highly similar to Pokémon. Like 100% Orange Juice, you work with cards. You can collect an endless number of cards, but you can choose three to fight with. Each card is a character with its own attacks. (There are item cards, but these come into gameplay later on.) You can choose from rock, paper and scissors, and these will determine your strength and defence. If you find yourself at a disadvantage you can switch cards. Attacks have different SP costs, which you gain through dice rolls at the start of turns. Battles are fun, but grinding isn't.\n\nHonestly, the story is a bit half-♥♥♥♥♥ and corny, but when you consider the game as fan service and not taking itself seriously, it's forgivable. I wouldn't recommend it to those unfamiliar with the franchises. The developers tried hard to give the game a retro look, similar to 16-bit games, and they did a good job. In my experience it screws the screen up in full-screen mode, so I played windowed. I hope the devs fix this. Music is mostly sub-par, with some nice tracks. I can't judge the online mode yet, but I'll update the review when I can.\n\n\nRatings\n\nCategoryScoreExplanationGameplay7/10It's easy to learn, perhaps too easy though. Those familiar with Pokémon should like the battle system. Sadly, you'll have to grind a lot. Card collection is fun, but cards are unbalanced. You can skip through cutscenes. Online play is a nice addition that I'll add to the review.Story4.5/10The script might be annoying to those who prefer serious JRPGs. However, the humour is light-hearted with memes included every so often and fourth wall breaking.Graphics4.5/10Art is of good quality, but all frames are static. The game is a cheap purchase, though. Backgrounds are a little too pixelated. Full-screen problems need fixing.Sound6/10Along with the graphics, the music has a retro quality, being chiptune. Most of the music is very average, but some of the boss themes are great.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\n6/10","October 23, 2015","true","13.6"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","38","57","2","0"

Starting your adventure off as the "Protagonist" you will venture across lands and realms meeting an assortment of recognizable characters form the Orange Juice universe. The game itself is simple but does have some complexities. The combat is based off a rock-paper-scissors type of combat with adorable and flashy animations. One thing that 200% Mixed Juice does boast is variety, with 80 characters that all feel unique and have the attacks and personality that come with it. You collect cards through the story or by purchasing them from the stores many card shops. What I look forward to most in games from Orange Juice is the personality and its over the top nature and for the most part it follows suit. Where things feel off are areas like the menu which are black and lifeless, almost reminding me of old DOS games. This is a minor gripe but it's noticeable. The sprites, animations, music, and writing all scream the developers wacky sense of humor. This is a good thing to focus on as the backgrounds of the game are okay at best. These minor gripes are hardly going to keep you from enjoying the game, I just wanted it to be more like 100% Orange Juice in style. Fans of the developer will love this addition to the series, for good reason. So prepare for big helping of vitamin C!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/LfltQWv7pVI\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wellyade/recommended/335190/","Wellyade","Questionable Lemonade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wellyade/","133 products in account","So what do we have here?Well, as most reviews will tell you, we have the 10 years anniversary game for the Orange_Jucie Devs, where they have (somewhat) stepped out of their comfort zone of bullet hell arcade shooters into the work of an RPG game with battle mechanics that resemble Pokemon crossed in with Rock, Paper Sciciors, the real question would be, did it work?\n\nDid it work?Yes and no, The game is simple and seems not too in depth. The mechanics work and get the job done but are not too well highlighted (Speed seems to increase dodge chance, while who hits first is on a tiered system of Close Combat<Multi Shot<Single shot) that, if explained was missed by my dumb face. Obtaining characters is total RNG and fusing characters is very select and late game pretty much before the final boss.\n\nHow long is it?200% Mixed Juice is a short game, you should have the main plot done in around 4 hours or less, and with a guide, be able to get all the achievements in around 5. It has some replayability with multiplayer, and a final challenge of facing the last boss again but harder. So in all, the game is short, which is not always a bad thing, not outstaying it's welcome.\n\nIs it FUN?!?This is perhaps the most important question, is the game fun? I will say that I personally found it enjoyable, mucking around a little in multi player, the characters are silly and so is the game. Everything about this game was designed to be silly from the ground up. It's no epic plot from Final Fantasy, and nor should it be it's a quick little game with heart and solid mechanics.\n\nGripesNot everything about this game is perfect, and as of writing this, mouse support would be nice, while keyboard functions. Getting characters is VERY RNG for those who wish to 'catch em all'. And, It would be nice to be able to speed up battles when grinding (Which is needed for the final boss). The Artwork on characters is not the best, and at times, plain ugly and lazy,\n\nDo I suggest it?Do you like RPG's? Silly characters and/or Orange_Juice Titles? Then yes, yes I would. If you're looking for an in depth world, filled with deep story, heartfelt connections and something to sink a huge amount of time in? No, this is not your game.\nBut at $8.59(NZD) You can do worse, so for a fun afternoon when you have some time to kill, playing 200% Mixed Juice might just scratch that RPG itch, and perhaps give you a smile.","October 25, 2015","true","6.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

The game has you recruit characters gachapon-style in which you farm battles for exp then go to the store to try and pick-up a character to use. Game is very easy to pick-up but the difficulty doesn't spike until the last boss. Similar to 100% OJ the game relies heavily on the die system to dictate what you can do; leaving an aspect of luck to win some battles. My biggest gripe is that there is no way to skip cutscenes/dialogue whether it is to grind for points, or fight a boss again after receiving a Game Over. The game isn't very long, you can definitely beat it in one sitting so you aren't exactly getting your money's worth if you consider the length of a game to be a factor. This game is very fun with all the character cameos, but can lose its charm very quickly if you don't like how the game plays, so again I would recommend it to those who enjoy RPG, Pokemon & QP/OJ Games.","October 27, 2015","true","5.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

The game is bad, just look at the videos and images. That's about all you get.

I really like it.\nMusic loops, but is good. I actually like it. Also RNG dice don't cheat you. Just roll high please.\nAttacks look decent, but they feel lazily done or were done on short time constraint. But more than 80 unique characters does take work, so meh.\nBut, (and here come the cons..)\n\nThe artwork/sprites is worse than 100% OJ and looks like they didn't put much effort in. (80 uniques, more than 100%)\n(Might be intended, but still poor graphically. They had to fix resolution multiple times...still bad)\nGameplay is shallow, almost no depth beside R-P-S, just mash attack and win/lose. Don't argue, Alte has 1 attack.\nNo overworld, just fight preset narrative battles that are interestingly (not good) written.\nMultiplayer works alright, but just isn't fun. And that's a major problem for a game based around that!\n\nAll in all, it's just Personamon with nothing worthwhile to stand on. The only unique thing is combo cards. Polymerization!\nI knew it wasn't going to be 100% OJ,but this is a very basic grind game. You just grind for the boss.\nIf you love the characters and silly story, get it. If not, don't.\nNot worth 7 dollars at all. Buy it in a humble bundle.\nDespite all I've said, I still love the franchise, but come on.. this does not live up to it's prequel at all.

Aside from RPG stats, the order and effectiveness of the character attacks are decided by an advantage/disadvantage system based in "Rock-Paper-Scissors", a game mechanic pretty simple to assimilate.\n\nThis game was developed by Orange Juice and contains a mix of the main characters of all their games. That being said, for a better enjoyment of the game, I recommend you to play at least one Orange Juice game before this one, so you can get familiarized with the Orange Juice universe. In that sense, 100% Orange Juice is your best shot since it contains a mix of characters from Orange Juice universe as well.\n\nThe main story is short, but very funny in a humorous way. 200% Mixed Juice also has competitive multiplayer mode, that is - sadly - kind of underused. But to compensate that, the forums community is always creating online championships/tournaments of the game.\n\nIf I could, I would rename the game to "200% Pokémon Juice!" for obvious reasons.

Then again, if you have played 100% Orange Juice then this is something you should be used to by now.\n\nIn short: Each turn you roll a dice to decide how many SP (Super Points? Special Points?) you get, and then use those points to perform various attacks and buffs. There is no walking around, and you just jump from fight to fight. You can also buy, sell and mix together various cards.\n\nThis game feels like a "less good" version of Pokemon, but I still enjoyed it while it lasted. However, I'm sure the game can get boring pretty fast for a lot of people.\n\nTo summarize, I recommend this game if you:\n- Enjoy 100% Orange Juice, or any of the other Fruitbat Factory games, since it's fun to see all the different characters interact with each other.\n- Like Pokemon, and just want a "worse" version for the PC.\n- Don't mind losing because of bad rng.","May 19","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soicanchangethis/recommended/335190/","soicanchangethis","Lord Ruby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soicanchangethis/","6 products in account","This is a light-hearted RPG with fun battles, while there are a few flaws, I would definitely recommend it. The battles might seems random at first, with SP, which is the game's equivalent of energy which is used for using moves, being rolled at the start of the turn, but after that damage rolls are rather consistent outside of critical hits, and the odds are against people using strategies which inflict nasty statuses such as immobilization. There are only three 'elements' in the game, which work like rock-paper-scisssors, however, most of your cards are in no way restricted to only their own element when attacking.\n\nThe story is light-hearted and somewhat similar to the stories you might find in most bullet hell games in that most of the time you fight with the people you meet but then you become friends. The game does occasionally break the fourth wall but it never does so too much. The game is loaded with references to other Orange_Juice games but the story should be enjoyable even for people who haven't played any other Orange_Juice game. The story is clever in that it does hint towards what will end up happening, which is especially prominent when going through the story a second time.\n\nUnlike 100% Orange Juice you can't really just go into multiplayer from the start since your cards do have levels and need to be leveled up in the story even though the game features ways of restricting which cards are pickable in a match. To get through the story mode you do need to do a little grinding, but that is to be expected from an old school RPG. Sadly the multiplayer isn't flourishing at the moment, and the game lacks a way of spectating a match, this is definitely something the developers could expand upon, by for example adding spectating and mayhap introducing double battles, like in pokémon.\n\nIn the end the game is definitely worth it for the low price.","November 1, 2015","true","35.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The game was made as a 10th aniversary (much like 100% orange juice was the 5th) celeration of the various orangejuice releases, it is STILL enjoyable without having played any of them but its highly reccomended that you played and enjoyed them prior. For example, I LOVE the suguri series. Encountering the characters from that series was fun and enjoyable. I am familiar with the QP series but haven't played it myself, still enjoyable. I havent touched or looked at anything to do with Flying Red Barrel, so the characters from that game just were unfamiliar and just didnt give me the same feel as the other 2 game's series\n\nThe game itself is a visual novel mixed with a pokemon like battle system with a online multiplayer options where you and your friends can face off with your collected orange juice characters (80+).\n\nI Personally enjoyed this both in the story and battling my friends with all my favorite orange juice characters.\n\nYou will often find yourself NEEDING to repeat a few battles to level up characters but there is the beauty of the ctrl button which skips dialog and coming from someone who hates having games be a grind. this was actually enjoyable, i still had fun fighting the same characters over and over.\n\nFollow Protagonist and the fairy navi as you travel through the mixed worlds of over 10 years of orange juice games.","October 25, 2015","true","30.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sterlander/recommended/335190/","sterlander","Sterlander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sterlander/","168 products in account","I was so desperate to buy this game the second it came out, I sold one my precious cosmetics in TF2. Was it worth the sacrifice? Short answer is yes.\nOne of the things that worried me about the game was RNG. I thought that the dice mechanic would lead to people winning just because of pure RNG. Fortunatlely, the dice rolling doesn't matter too much, giving players a fair chance at winning.\nSo, what's the game like?\nThe Combat SystemWhile some parts in the combat system have flaws, it's mostly perfect. The thing I never liked about games like Pokemon was how you had to memorize what type was weak to what. But in this game, the weakness and strength system is very easy to understand. If you know how to play rock paper scissors, then you will have no problems. If your attack is "rock" and the enemies weakness is "scissors", then you're good to go.\n\nCharactersThis game has a total of 80 diffrent characters, each one being unique with their attacks, and stats. I like the characters a lot, because with enough training, your favorite orange juice character can absoultely dominate.  #kyousuke&soradreamteam\n\nDialogueJust check the screenshots I posted earlier today, I screenshoted a bunch of the funniest / coolest dialogue moments. The dialogue is mostly just funny, and revolves around jokes based off the character talking. For example, Krila compares red bean paste to dark energy of the devil.\n\nPoppo~\n\nArtworkWhile some people say that the artwork in this game is poorly made, I found it quite charming. If the characters in 100% OJ weren't chibi enough for you, just take a look at some artwork in this game. Also, the attack animations look okay, certaintly not the best though.\n\nSoundtrackWhile a lot of soundtracks loop very often, they are still quite charming, and nice to listen to. Also, the soundtrack is really 8 bit, which I dig. Although I like 100% OJ's soundtrack better to be honest.\n\nHowever, no game is perfect. This game has flaws, some of which most RPGs suffer.\nFor example, some characters are unbalanced. Scientist for example, was much better than my level 4 QP. I feel like if the devs balanced a bit (the game has only been out for a day, bug fixes are sure to come), the game would seem a lot more fair, and balanced.\nAlso, I had some screen related issues. It took me like 30 minutes to configure the screen resolultion properly.\n\nBut yeah, this game is pretty solid for its price. Now for the question that's most Important:\nIs this game better than 100% OJ?\nTo answer that question, you have to know what kind of games you're into. Are you into board games? Then 100% will be a much better choice. Are you a big RPG fan? Get this game instead. Or get both. Actually, just do that.\n\n9/10, so far it seems promising.\n(ONCE I GET FURTHER INTO THE GAME, I WILL UPDATE THE REVIEW)\n\n","October 23, 2015","true","9.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Please just take a moment to read this.\n\nNow, I love 100% Orange Juice the minute my friend introduced it to me and our group of friends. It was a phenomenal mix of anime and Mario Party, which is a major hit with me. I loved all the characters, their hypers, themes, etc. Just everything about that game I enjoyed playing with friends and causing massive chaos; and to this day I'd still play it with friends.\n\nNow comes 200% Mixed Juice, which is OrangeJuice's 10th anniversary game. Now you'd probably expected some kind of sequel or something around the lines of 100% Orange Juice. Well, I'll jump straight to the point and tell you that you won't expect that kind of board game-ness feel here. But in truth, that's all right. This game's mechanics is sorta bit round the game feel of Pokemon mixed with Rock Paper Scissors. Which is a nice calmer change of pace from 100%OJ. The game itself seems pretty straight forward and simple; the music's pretty entertaining for more of the chiptune genre; and the massive amounts of characters in this is pretty nice as well.\n\nOverall, as much as this does look like some kind of a letdown and a rather simpler game; Consider this factor that 100% OJ was Orange_Juice's 5th anniversary game. you gotta think about other game series and their anniversary games. some game series had amazing games released on their XXth anniversary but might have had a not so good game out on their YYth anniversary.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that, even though it's not the amazingness of 100% Orange Juice, I don't think people should judge too harshly about 200% Mixed Juice. I think frankly this is a nice change of gameplay as I mentioned before. Plus, the game itself just came out as of the posting of this review, so there's still chances of this game recieiving updates and probably polishing this game more just like OJ. So please, just give this game a chance? If you're dead set opposed on this, then fine. I can't stop you. You wanted 200% MJ to be a board game? Well I'm sorry, you'd be better off playing 100% OJ","October 24, 2015","true","13.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This DOES mean that there are a lot of references to other games, but I still think it works as a standalone game nonetheless.\n\nThe gameplay works in a rock/paper/scissors fashion, but it also has another rock/paper/scissors mechanic within this that people don't seem to get. So each character has an attribute, be it rock paper or scissors. Each attack also has an attribute. The ORDER of attack is based on the attributes of the ATTACKS, not the characters. So if I were to use a rock attack and you were to use a paper attack, you would have priority regardless of the attribute of our respective characters. This adds a decent amount of depth into the gameplay, since the choice between doing more damage and priority can be difficult. The fact that there is no real tutorial for this mechanic is met with criticism, but meh, I figured it out eventually.\n\nThe main game has over 50 character cards, so it's fair to say that there's a LOT of choice, and therefore replayability value. I think of it akin to the likes of Pokemon, each time you play through it's different each time, since your choices are extremely varied.\n\nThe graphics are an issue met with a lot of debate for this game. They're meant with a old school RPG theme in mind, so we can't judge them on being 'too pixelated' etc. To me they actually suit the game pretty well, I never thought that an area looked particularly ugly or unsightly. Either way I never think we should judge a game by graphics alone but hey, each to their own I guess.\n\nThe music though... It is very impressive. They use a chiptune style, fitting in with the old school RPG idea and it works very well for the game as a whole. Each track is a joy to listen to and there are a few boss tracks that particularly stand out to me at least.\n\nThe story is about 5-6 hrs long, so not an extremely lengthy game. There seems to be a lot of going back and forth between humour and seriousness, but I like that about it. There is a sense of urgency but no real stress due to the interactions between characters, you get groped at one point... Which for some reason I find particularly funny. (Help, I'm a terrible person)\n\nThere's a multiplayer arena also for PvP which is pretty fun when you have a team set up. You'll always meet people with a team full of OP characters but to be fair I've beat them with ease... They often use the same attributes and have no idea of game mechanics, so you'll be fine if you have a decent coverage of types.\n\nIn conclusion, 200% Mixed Juice is a very quirky RPG which is a must have for anyone who has played the OJ games, and still a very good game for those who haven't. It has a very good style and sticks to it, which I can appreciate. The gameplay is simple yet complex depending on how deep you want to go, and all in all is just a very solid game, especially for the low price it's selling for","October 24, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoyalVictim/recommended/335190/","RoyalVictim","Chi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RoyalVictim/","40 products in account","I am making this an honest review, from someone who is  a mix between a casual and hard-core gamer.\n\nI was excited for this game since it was announced even after seeing the screenshots but was worried I would find it hard due to the mighty RNG of 100% Orange Juice but he doesn't seem to be in this game so lucky us.\n\nIt didn't take me long to complete the game's story, it is only hard if you forgot what type the enemy is if you know what type they are then you know who to bring out to make it a cake-walk. You can easily win the game using the three character's you befriend within the game.\nThis game needs a little bit of grinding but once you know which path you can keep re-visiting and beating with ease, grinding to defeat the current world boss should not take no longer than 10-30 minutes.\n\n\nIt has a nice fusion gimmick but getting some of the items to fuse some characters is a chore sad to say even if you are grinding your extra cards to max card level you can still struggle to find certain items making it a chore than fun.\n\nMy only frustration with this game would be the card-collecting and the lack of guidence to which cards you are missing and the massive chance of getting duplicates.\nThe post-game is pretty much for collectors, those wanting every single card combination there is and there is no guidence in which cards you need or what fusions you can get.\n\n--------------------------\nPros\n\n- Simple fighting mechanic (easy for anyone to pick up)\n- Funny story\n- Lots of familiar characters to collect\n- Simple story to follow\n- Chibi characters\n\nCons\n\n- Too much grinding after-game to get all the cards\n- Too many chances to get duplicate cards\n- Multiplayer is boring and plain\n- Without a guide you are guessing card-fusions\n- No guide to which cards you are missing\n\n----------------------\nNitpicks\n- Menu screens have terrible graphics when when the chibi characters pop out, after a while it becomes a pain to look at\n- Only 1-2 songs in the game which get boring real fast\n- Not much of post-game reward but more cards to grind for\n- You will die in 1-2 turns unless you grind, making "boost" attacks worthless\n- Many characters share the same attack\n- Evade never seems to work making it useless\n\n\n\nIf you are a fan of Orange Juice, get the game you do learn something new about the characters or if you are a casual gamer wanting a simple RPG pass-time which is not too long and easy to remember.\nOtherwise I would stay away from this. Unless you want to collect all the cards, there is no reason to return to this game because nothing is exciting about the fighting.\n\nThe game can easily be completed within 4-5 hours, but the card collecting can take you way over 10 hours without even getting one of every card or even close.","October 24, 2015","true","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then you came to the wrong place. I hit multiplayer each time I've opened this game and there is always 0 games going.\n\nWhat of the game I have played has always been grindy and repeating the same battles for Card EXP and Money. Money can buy 1 new card each time you get 50. And this game really likes giving you cards you already own.\n\nIf you already own a card and battle it to level say 3 and then buy a copy. That copy starts level 1. Selling that card gives you just 5 money.\n\nGraphics are Bad, moreso the backgrounds. If your expecting characters to look as good as they do in 100% you are in for  disappointment a lot of the time, but not always.\n\nMusic is forgetable\n\nDialog parts can be super boring or interesting.\n\nGrind to win\n\nThe game is pretty obviously made in some visual novel engine or something. Such as the keys you press, the character limit on your name (I can make my name in 100% but not in mixed). It also does not look like much money was spent making it, but thats common with some orange games. Better when a cheap games flops instead of try to make a AAA game and go bankrupt when it doesn't sell enough.\n\n\nThe main reasons to get this are\n\n1. Mixed Poppo in 100% . She is a fun character in that game and that game has active multiplayer.\n2. You got to get everything Orange has put out\n3. You got to know more about the characters\n4. You just love to mindlessly grind\n5. Your bad at bullet hells like I am\n\nI'd give a MAYBE if your a fan, but steam only allows thumbs up or down.","January 28","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game also lacks an open world and the way to move is by using a menu and select things like "Go here" and "Go there".\n\nThe games feels kind of rushed, to be honest is what kind of game I would expect years ago, but for a game in these days it's just way too simple and feels like it can be done in a really short amount of time, making games is hard, but this really feels too simple.\n\nAs I said, get the game if you want a simple anime-based game with no complex mechanics or you're a fan of Orange Juice games, however, if you are really looking for an RPG then you're looking in the wrong place.","October 27, 2015","false","5.5"," 26 of 56 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","26","56","0","0"

I found myself wanting to push on not because I found the game fun, but because I wanted to just get it over with already. That's not a good feeling for a game to have.\n\nThere's also not any real difficulty other than RNG and forced grinding. The campaign is pretty short, and would be even shorter if it didn't force you to level grind -a lot- before bosses (the final boss in particular).\n\nStatus effects, unlike Pokemon, can't really be dealt with in any way. If you're paralyzed, you can't even switch out - you basically have to watch as the opponent beats up on your character for several turns. On top of that, there's only one type - immobilization/paralysis. And it's boring.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I love Orange Juice. They made Sora, one of my favorite video games of all time. This may actually be the first bad game they've produced.\n\nIf you buy this game expecting the fun and longevity of 100% Orange Juice, or the genius game design of Sora, you will be sorely disappointed. Keep in mind - this is OJ's first venture into the RPG genre, so you can't expect perfection, but... It lacks the things that make RPGs good. The only real reasons to get this game are the 100%OJ character that comes with it and the opportunity to learn a little bit more about OJ's characters.","October 24, 2015","false","5.7"," 17 of 38 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","17","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/recommended/335190/","Illius19616","Illius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/","88 products in account","This game is a Pokemon-esque RPG featuring characters from the games produced by Orange Juice, including Sora, Suguri, Flying Red Barrel and QP Shooting. You pick a team of 3 characters then pit them against whatever opponents you may face throughout the various worlds that you come across. The combat features (literally) a Rock Paper Scissors battle system that decides how effective attacks are, and the order they come in (Scissors goes first, then Paper, Then rock). You get to join various of your favorite Orange Juice characters while going through this game's main campaign.\n\nIn terms of dialogue, the characters really shine here. Some characters interacting can get pretty hilarious, such as QP's and Sora's banter versus how ridiculous Sora should act. I found myself in tears laughing at some of the dialogue over the course of the game.\n\nAlso, there is a decent amount of room for personalization in gameplay, where you can choose from numerous characters then upgrade/mix them with other characters.\n\nYou also get "Mixed Poppo" for 100% Orange Juice by getting this game, which is also a pretty nice plus (Especially since how fun to annoy people she is).\n\nThe soundtrack, while not spectacular, is pretty nice.\n\n\nThat said, there are more than a handful of issues with this game, unfortunately. For one, the combat system feels inherently broken. Ignoring the RPS type combat, because of how it's setup, if you're a Scissors defense then you have a huge advantage because no matter what to do even decent damage the person HAS to go last (And given anything in an RPG like this, going last is basically guaranteed death).\n\nThe story is also what feels mostly like a poorly written fan-fiction of the Orange Juice cast, which is depressing since the dialogue itself is pretty amazing. However, when the whole story is one big evil character is trying to destroy everything, and the cast is apparently the only one who can stop it. There are so many problems in the plot it basically feels like it doesn't have a place in the game.\n\nAnd for an RPG there is literally 0 exploration. None. All you do from is use text-boxes from place to place, then when you get to a place you battle, and then you leave. And that is that. They also make it mandatory to go to every place at elast once, so you don't get any choice to discover, so you get an extremely on-rails RPG (2 things that shouldn't ever mix).\n\nThen there is the ending sequence... basically you get to it and hit a roadblock for no reason other than they decided to spike up the difficulty more than a fair amount, so you are FORCED to grind XP (And then they take what was the most entertaining part of battles: the dialogue). Grinding XP is fine if I feel a sense of progression, but it is almost non-existant here.\n\nAlso it may just be me but I felt like boss battles relied more on pure RNG than actual skill and move-planning. Use a powerful move that trumps their defense and hope they don't either instakill you first or just dodge it for no real reason.\n\n\nOverall a pretty poor RPG. Definitely get it on a discount if you REALLY want it. I would call this more of a "Mixed Poppo" DLC for 100% OJ with a game as a small bonus because of this.","December 20, 2015","false","3.6"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

The things that differentiate this game from pokemon are all huge negatives. There is no overworld, simply "go here, go there" menus. The story is mildly interesting, but hard to progress though because of points where you have to grind to get through. Grinding is hilariously awful because it means literally replaying the same scripted battles over and over and over again. Fighting works a lot like pokemon but with a smaller diversity of elements and more RNG.\n\nGraphically, this game is dog ♥♥♥♥. If you like a "half ♥♥♥♥♥ indie game" aesthetic, look no further. Character sprites are low-res, which really shows when they're placed into the foreground. It feels like you're playing with a bunch of 64x64 .png files. Most of the problem with the graphical style is you're dealing with various sprites that vary widely in resolution/zoom level, so you'll see character portraits that look to be around 64x64 displayed at scale over a background that looks to be around 64x64 that's blown up to fit the whole window. It looks atrocious and is exactly what I mean by "half-♥♥♥♥♥ indie game aesthetic". On top of that, the art looks like pretty low-effort drawings, for the cherry on your "looks like ♥♥♥" sundae, but that's just my personal preferences speaking.\n\nThe extra character in 100% OJ is worth about as much as this game itself. It looks and feels extremely low effort, and if this game took any longer than a month to slap together(a week if they worked full-time on it), everyone involved should realize that they will never top 100% OJ and just give up.\n\nGet it on sale for 50% or more off if you're a fan of OJ, otherwise pass completely.","October 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 7 of 29 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","7","29","0","2"

People who've played Pokemon (almost everyone) will likely feel right at home with the mechanics, which focus around choosing three cards to represent characters in your party, and which attacks they use, all of which have one of three primary elements and a sub-element. An simple, Rock-Paper-Scissor kind of attack trinagle makes up the crux of this game's combat system, so it's pretty easy to get into. The sub-elements and support/de-buff abilities, along with a handful of characters who have passive abilities, keep things from being so simple that it gets old fast. Combat is also pretty quick; most battles will be over in anywhere from 20 seconds to 2 minutes, with even the longest boss fights only being around 5 minutes. This works in the game's favor, as it's a little bit grind-y, so being able to get in and out of battles fast keeps grinding from taking too long or being too boring.\n\nThe story takes itself about as seriously as Saints Row The Third. It's pretty much all silly and quirky fun until the final boss shows up. I really enjoyed the humor of this game a lot, and it was varied enough that it didn't get old. Its use of meta humor/4th wall-breaking was done just right, too: sparingly, with the self-awareness not getting too insulting or in-your-face about it. The lighthearted, silly tone of the game is truly one of its greatest qualities.\n\nI adored the music in this game. The aesthetic for this game in a lot of areas is to go for a "retraux" feel, and the music is the most true to that aesthetic. It sounded authentic enough that I felt like these songs could have actually been from a GameBoy Color game, and I mean that in a good way. If you're using chiptune music and want it to feel nostalgic instead of going out of your way to make melodies that could never have been in a game in the 80s (or on a portable system in the 90s), this is how you do it.\n\nIronically, despite being a sequel to 100% Orange Juice, this game's multilayer is its weakest aspect. It's very bare-bones, only allowing you to battle other players one-on-one. There's also no trading, which is odd considering this is technically a card game. Being able to trade cards with other players would be nice, especially with how luck-based getting cards can be.\n\nOh, and it's pretty short. I beat the whole game's story in one sitting, about 7 or 8 hours. And there's no post-game content or New Game+, leaving the game with very little replay value.\n\nUltimately, it's a good, if modest, game that I felt was worth its price. If you're looking to have a short, fun experience and don't mind that you'll probably never come back to it again, this game is worth your time.","December 14, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of the attacks are flashy and colorful, but the art style is very inconsistent and graphically it looks extremely poor and lazy. Everything is entirely menu based, including navigating between locations. This means you get no overworld to traverse or explore. Actually, forget exploration, the game's story progression never advances beyond "go to each of these options at least once to proceed". The music is decent enough, though it doesn't properly loop, which is pretty annoying. There are no side missions or secondary objectives other than collecting more animes for your card list.\n\nSpeaking of which, the collection aspect entirely equates to pouring the currency you earn after battles into a machine which will dispense a random character. As you advance further in the game, more characters are added to your potential shopping pool, so if you're goal is to collect everything, your only option is to keep buying more cards until you get lucky and it pops out what you need. There is no method of getting specific cards outside of the vendor.\n\nSo why should you get this game?\n\nWell, if you're into the competitive aspect, there's a lot of fun to be had in the multiplayer. The combat system isn't super deep, but there's more to it than you would initially assume. Victory isn't as simple as just mashing through menus; there's plenty to consider when making plays. There is some RNG involved, but generally if you outplay your opponent, you can expect to win.\n\nIf you're looking to scratch that Pokémon itch, this probably isn't the game for you. If you'll buy anything filled with colorful lolis, chances are you already own this, so you wasted your time with this review.","October 25, 2015","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is, to put it simpaly a 'mix' of all of Orange_Juice's characters (Hence the name) it is rather comedic all most with out even trying. But it has a few glitches and problems... by a few I mean one. The only glitch I've found is if you Alt+Tab out during a battle the game will crash. *Dog jumps on lap during final boss fight, presses windows button by mestake... game crashes.* And the problem with the game is mainly to get some jokes or references you need to of played 100% orange juice or other Orange_Juice games (I may as well add that this was the first Orange_Juice game I played) but after playing QP Shooting I got some of the references but not all of them.\nStill back to this game.\nThe battles are fun and sought of remind me of playing Pokemon among other things, other people have said it reminds them of playing other JRPG's but for some reason Pokemon stood out for me... odd thing to say I know.\nThe game is rather short (It took me about 6 hours including grinding) after words I tried to speed run the game with my level cap characters and skipping all the text between fights and I got through most of the game in about 50 min... short a'int it. THe game has a seamingly empty multiplayer feature. (Still havn't worked out how to get a ramdom battle)\nThe system of buying cards eventually gets kinda bull. (While looking for a certain item I got the rarest item in the game... twice... and the item I was looking for was only labeled 'Rare')\nThere is a system of mixing characters is quite funny when it's first introduced. (The machine that mixes charactors is described as a giant juicer) but eventually becomes an essential game element as some charactors, even at level cap are kinda... ♥♥♥♥.\nSo. Let's talk story.\n'Awaken sleeping princess'\n'Wake up sleepy head princess or I will die of boredom' (Oh really?)\nApart from the braketed part these are lines from the fist few lines of the game.\nYou are told that the person who woke you 'Navi' has gone and made a 'small' world... that seems to consist of three seperate worlds... okay. you are given a name 'Protagionest' (I don't know if I spelt that right) oh and I'm not kidding about the name either. you are told that from being asleep for so long your social skills have degraded completely. Probably why for most of the game you're mute. At least the reason you're mute is explained. Anyway.\nAt the second last fight in the game you fight yourself... WTF. characters constantly break the forth wall one character even goes as far to admit to this fact.\nSo let's quickly recap before I lose my mind.\nGreat game, short but in a good way, (Portal one style) story that seems to be rather generic at first glance but when you delve into it the game become a unique jewel full of non-standered humour and lots of forth wall breaking. The odd glitch and dog caused crash and a need to know other games to get some joke/refencences.\nThe game ends on the cliff hanger from hell and after finishing it four or five times I still know nothing of it. I guess I'll do some searching of the interwebs to find out atleast something... probably be the best way to spend the rest of my weekend.\nIt's quite cheap so if you are in for a stupidly comedic adventure or for a good RPG give this game a try.\nOh and the charactors look quite cute... so yeah give it a go.","June 4","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
