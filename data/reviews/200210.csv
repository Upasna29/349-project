Was probably the best perma-death RPG game you could find. Didn't have demanding PC requirements, cool and clean pixelated visuals, easy-to-pick up hard-to-master bullet hell-style gameplay. Overall, it was great fun and I enjoyed my time with it.\n\nSo I thought this game had died out a while ago (some time since I had played it regularly), but it turns out the game is still going strong...really strong actually. I was pretty excited and saw that this game has the VERY POSITIVE rating on Steam. As I was strolling down to read some of the top reviews, I noticed a new publisher called Kabam in the game's description area. Interesting. So I finally make it to the reviews and what I see is a bunch of negative reviews about how pay-2-win this game is after Kabam took over.\n\nI couldn't believe it was THAT bad so I tried it out myself a few weeks ago. Downloaded it through Steam, loaded it up.....Wow. Another example of an amazing game ruined by greedy companies tainting the free-2-play model. No one wonder people are hating on free-2-play games when we got so much greedy companies these days.\n\nBut Kabam really butchered this game. Everything good requires money. Skill is irrevelant. I can't believe they actually managed to take the skill factor out of a bullet-hell game. What's the world coming to....\n\nI.Rather.Have.Perfect.World.Own.This.....Hell.I.Rather.Have.Nexon.Own.This.Than.Kabam\n\nNever again Kabam...never again.","October 30, 2014","false","3.7"," 841 of 945 people (89%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","89","841","945","50","19"

The core of this game is to create a character, level it up and collect better gear, while at the same time maxing your stats, gaining fame, and levelling up your pet. Death is permanent, which means that once you die, you will not be able to get your character or anything equipped/used on it back (except pets and fame).\n\nAlthough I would recomment the above game to anyone, what has happened to this is truly disappointing. The original creator of the game, WildShadow, was bought out by Kabam after a loss in revenue. WS was a fair company, didn't monetize the game much, however that lead to its downfall.\nWhen Kabam bought the game, things looked pretty promising. New content was released, specifically pets. Pets had monetized the game to a whole new level, while many players were upset by it, we eventually got used to it and moved on.\nFast forward to 2015. This is when most of the productive RotMG team members (KoalaP, SirRacha, ZBORNOX, etc) left and we had little communication with the company. RFSwitch was hired, who accomplished nothing, and we were left with NullBot. He wasn't very good at communicating with the playerbase. In fact, we had no communication at all with Kabam for about 8 months. In late 2015, they hired a new GM called OryxHand who claimed that he would help the game, and he did, for about a week. New cursors and HP bars were added, and an almost useless friends list as well.\n\n\n2016? There have been no content updates for over a year. Cheaters roam free. Multiboxers are everywhere. There is no way to enjoy the game as a high level player on a populated server without paying for keys. Sure, STs were bad, replacing high status UTs with P2W versions, and pets breaking Knights, turning them into something capable of permanently stunning enemies. But I'd take all of that any day over the lies Kabam has told us and how they completely ignore the game.\n\nTLDR:\n-Pets broke the roles of many classes. Priests are mostly obsolete because of high-levelled Pets.\n-Cheaters and multiboxers are driving out any last legit players.\n-Do NOT spend money on this game until Kabam pays attention to it.\n-You may think this game is fun when you're starting out, but your mid to endgame experience will be ruined.\n\nAnything I forgot? Say so in the comments. Thanks for reading, if you did.","October 31, 2014","false","059.9"," 436 of 481 people (91%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","91","436","481","26","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/recommended/200210/","lordofwatermelons","Twitchy Nemesis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordofwatermelons/","23 products in account","I used to play this game a far long time ago, back on Kongregate. It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal.\n\nBut that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past.\n\nSo, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam. I went into the reviews, and noticed...a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours. I thought to myself, Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right? People love to use hyperbole to make a point. In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again...\n\nI regretted said decision.\n\n[GETTING STARTED]\n\nSo I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds. Flash games, gotta love'em. I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap. That's not a good sign...\n\nI start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior. The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account. For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem.\n\n[MY EXPERIENCE]\n\nWhen I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me. I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas. Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order.\n\nNow, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to love the Nexus! It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there.\n\nBut on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:\n\nBots! Bots everywhere! I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out. I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically. In real life. I was that angry.\n\nAside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items. Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item. Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value! And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now 51, meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin! Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified.\n\nEnough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though. I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring. Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle. I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did. Congratulations, RotMD, you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees...\n\nSecond go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things. I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment. Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped. Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment. Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed. I thought to myself, Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me.\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nFirst off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man. I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death. Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall...and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him. Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows. And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors. The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in "#rekt" about 7 times. Fun times were had..\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\n\nNow, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional. The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago. Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much. You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God.\n\nYou have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot. Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons.\n\nRemember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead. Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground.\n\n[SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]\n\nIn all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues. Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face. You get your first slap when you boot up the game, and you're being asked to buy crap you don't even need; you get the second slap going to the Nexus, once a sanctum for player cooperation, now a den of botting inequity and a broken economy; and the final slap, rounding this merry-go-♥♥♥♥-yourself out quite nicely, is the afore-mentioned hackers, honing their trolling skills to a weaponized level in the goal of wanting you dead.\n\nI could go on about how Kabam doesn't care, and how they potentially ruined a good game. But, instead, I'll give them a break, and say this: at least Road-Squared didn't get their hands on this game.","May 24, 2015","false","0.6"," 646 of 745 people (87%) found this review helpful 178 people found this review funny","87","646","745","178","31"

Though the game is still filled with potential, I just cant recommend it to anyone. Anyone like me who has clocked over 500+ hours into this game, will know that its near impossible to play without more than one character slot, which I'll add cost 10 dollars just to get one. Yes, it is possible to play Realm without more than one, but it makes the game far less enjoyable. This is because Realm is a game where you get loot and "potions" to boost your stats. Well, if you've maxed all of your stats on one character, then the obvious thing to do is to start getting potions for another character, which you can't have unless you buy one. This was much easier in the past through making tons of extra accounts to stash potions on, for when your character dies, but Kabam of course remained vigilant and banned almost all "Mule" (as we call them in the Realm) accounts.","October 15, 2014","false","524.8"," 283 of 325 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","283","325","9","4"

Things were going well for a while, but then I noticed something about the game, something that was changing fast. There as a huge ♥♥♥ increase in the amount of hackers in the game. They no clipped through walls and on some rare occasions used invincibility hacks. This made it difficult to get loot from any bosses. The worst part is, the owners of the game weren't doing ♥♥♥♥ about it, and to this day, they still aren't doing anything about it. Along with an increase in hackers, there was also a major increase in just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in general. There was an increase of scammers, draggers, and just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I left the game in February of 2015 because all that Kabam cares about is money. I just recently paid a visit to the game again, and nothing has changed.

It was great fun, and I suppose it still is, but after a while of not playing it and coming back to see so many changes, It has definitely taken a turn for the worst.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is pretty much a multiplayer 'bullet hell' style game, most of the action (PvE) takes place on a randomly generated continent which is really big and possesses many diverse environments. This means that there's not a shortage of bosses and mooks to kill, and temples  and castles to raid for loot. The item system is pretty easy to understand, with gear being divided on tiers, a higher tier meaning rarer and more powerful items.\n\nInitially, you are made to choose a class and dropped off in a tutorial with only a basic weapon and a skill item. The game itself is pretty fun, and you can play for hours without it getting boring or repetitive. Here's where the game starts falling apart. Most of the action that happens later is just plain old grinding. Even for the hardest monsters getting item drops is really hard, as the item drop rate is extremely tiny.\n\nThe worst thing that's happened to this game was the developers being bought by Kabam. It has pretty much become a pay-to-win affair. Before, you could buy cosmetic items and pets with real money to support the developers. Now you can get the rarest armours and weapons with a few bucks. Like I said before, the item drop rates are ridiculous, so selling weapons and items for real money feels kind of cheap.\n\nAll in all, a good game ruined by 'freemium'. If you play it, expect to grind a lot, or pay up.","March 6, 2014","false","12.2"," 181 of 212 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","181","212","0","3"

Ever since Kabam took it over it has transformed the game from an awesome fantasy rogue like bullet hell, to a generic pay to win mmo. Everytime I play it I feel like it's missing a purpose, and that all I'm doing is running around with underpowered gear attempting to kill bosses, and often failing in doing so because of the way Kabam has remade the game. It is only really fun if you play it with friends, or if you play it for about 10-20 minutes, which really breaks my heart because it used to be one of my all time favorite mmo's back before I ahd a nice computer. 3/10","October 10, 2014","false","170.2"," 162 of 187 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","162","187","5","0"

Generally speaking in a neutral point to review, this game will most likely pull you in once you put some time into it and you will grow to hate the game when you die, and then find it creeping back on your a few weeks/months later and have a sudden desire to play again. Once you die there is no way to recover your character or any of the items, which is the most frustrating part of the game. However, you can pay real money (which I'm not a fan of, but in no way would I consider this a pay-to-win game) to get more characters slots so that you can still have the other guys when you die.

Having the game focused around the age group of  little kids and their parents credit card details. With $20 USD you can purchase 2600 gold coins for in game. However these coins majority of the time will not last more than 2 days if not 1. If you wanted the best items from the beginning of the game (Yes you can buy the best 'tradable' items right away!) for a warrior for example, that'd cost 2360 gold. Once you have purchased anything you are more than likely going to die due to a lagspike.\n\nThrough my 3 years of playing Realm I've had my fair share of seeing the occasional hacker, however occasional is a bit of an understatement. After contacting Kabam staff multiple times about hackers, I was told to video my gameplay. Staff replied with and I quote, "Thank you for writing in with your concern. Do you have any video of these Players? If so, please send it my way. As for reporting Players, this is the best way to do it; just get some video of them violating ToS and send it our way!" - Synistrr.\n\nTake time from our gameplay to catch hackers?

You can also trade with other players but this is hard to do, since the trading system is very basic and flawed.\n\n-Boring (see above for reason) Really it feels like a chore to play it at all. And that's not good for the 'fun' factor. Grind, grind, grind, grind, death. Repeat.\n\n-Little back-story/lore. Why are you getting fed to monsters? Why are you even fighting the 'Gods' at all? Really tho there is just about no story at all.\n\n-'permanent death'  (when you die you die for good, with no way to reclame your item's. Unlike in other "hard" death based games Dark souls etc.) Also i would be fine with perma death. Games like The binding of Isaac do it very well. But when you ask real money for items for your avatar, then throw in perma death things get a little bad for wallet players. The items in the shop also cost lots of the gold coins (money) so you spend a bunch of money on your guy then he is dead with all that money just gone.

It has been around for a few years as a Flash game. You start the game easy enough, by selecting from unlocked classes such as rogue, warrior, priest, archer and so on. Each class plays the same, you fire projectiles. Have a sword? You shoot projectiles. The only difference between the classes are the stats and the equipment they can use. You can unlock more classes when you reach certain levels with the base classes. Each enemy gives you some minimal experience and leveling up will only improve your stats. There are no new spells and no choice of improvement. It all feels very dull and too simple for a MMO.\n\nThe controls are like every other mouse aim shooter, arrows to move with mouse aim and click to shoot. You have a special ability and potions too, but for the most part you can just use your normal attacks. Speaking of the mouse aim, it feels very inaccurate. I can stand still, fire the projectile and the projectile will miss even when I shouldn't. Maybe there is an accuracy stat or something. It feels odd when enemies very accurate. Luckily you are quick enough to dodge projectiles. Again, maybe its a stat and I need to have better gear, but there is nothing on the equipment that shows accuracy, just range and attack power.\n\nThere are a lot of enemies, each with different stats and attack patterns. For the most part they have enemies simply shoot at you. Most have single shots, others have double and triple spreading shots. Still some fire a sort of 360 degree bullet shield preventing anything from getting close. The bosses aren't that different from normal enemies. They just have larger sprites with other creatures swarmed around them.\n\nThere are quests in the game, but I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. All quests seem to be kill the big monster. No one tells you to. You just do it. The game points out the direction of the big monster when you enter the location.\n\nThe maps feel a bit jumbled randomly with trees and foliage with a path drawn through the map. It just feels like lazy or quick map design and not 'randomly generated.' Some enemies will drop portals to different areas which is a fun feature, but since the areas look just thrown together its always just another randomly thrown together area. You have a mini map that will reveal more as you explore, but if you leave an area and return, you need to explore it again to show it on your mini map. At any time out in the wilderness, you can instantly warp back to the town / nexus with the click of a button.\n\nThe locations might look like a jumbled mess, but the town / nexus looks great, but its all just a big store to sell you stuff. All of the stores have items visibly showing you everything so you need to walk over them instead of having an easy to use menu. Another problem is to see the stats of the item you need to hover your mouse over the 'buy it' button. Don't accidentally click that button though. You cannot sell equipment, so you're forced to drop it or trade it with other players, but for the most part the equipment feels useless when enemies drop it all. Plus players are kind enough to just give stuff for free since everything is so abundant.\n\nNormal games would have you kill enemies for gold, but in Realm of the Mad God, you need to buy gold with real money of course. Everything is right there in town / nexus for you to buy after a brief tutorial area. What do you buy with gold? Name changes, more characters, armor, weapons, rings, boxes with random items, keys, pets, extra storage, building materials and everything. Did I mention that when you die you lose all progress and items? So if you spend real life money into a free game and you die, you've just lost everything. Do you need gold to have fun? No. The town / nexus has plenty of people selling gold via their website for real money and it floods the chat for some servers drowning out any real discussion.\n\nThis feels like a really dull game that is out for your money. Not just that, but it seems hastily thrown together. The quick simple art style, the slow grind for experience, the awful map design, no real quests, the laggy input, and the inaccurate aiming, all makes me not want to be in the game let alone buy anything in the game with real money.","September 1, 2014","false","112.5"," 255 of 385 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","255","385","2","4"

After about a year without playing the game I saw that it was on steam and since it was free I downloaded it. Like I said earlier it's pretty much the same game I used to love, but it has **** wiped all over it. In the main lobby there are a dozen spam bots all screaming for you to buy high level items from them. You walk past rows of stores with items that can only be purchased with bought in game currency (with real money of course). If you want more storage you have to pay for it, it you want extra character slots you have to pay for those as well. This wouldn't be as big a deal, but $5 will only buy you 500 gold, which will not get you very far at all. Each character slot costs 1000 gold, and the vault chests cost 1000 gold as well. On the server there are quite a few hackers.\n\nTo conclude this game is P2W, but you absolutely do not have to do so, everything that can be bought can also be achieved through hard work.","January 6","true","86.2"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","36","40","17","0"

It was so much more fun with non soulbounded items, no insanely high tier items in the store, and no stupid pets.\n\n\n----EDIT---- Updated Review as of 5/9/16 12:53 AM\nSo I decided to go ahead and play the game once again since I flew back home for my 1.5 weeklong summer vacation after college.\n\nTL;DR: The game is fun, but holy sh*t, the gold spammers got worse and there are minimal amounts of effort to update the game.  So yeah, it's fun, go ahead and play it for a bit if your internet doesnt' suck.  However, I still can't recommend this game because Kabaam continues to demonstrate a classic example of a company that buys out another company, providing a minimal amount of effort to make any improvements to the game (because, "why make improvements when you can do nothing at all and still make money off of the 12 year olds that fall for this pay2win scheme?").\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe game has gone through a laughably minimal amount of updates since I had last played this game, over a year ago.  For a 2D MMO with a lot of potential for interesting, frequent updates, I thought that perhaps some unique new gamemodes, some cool improvements to the hub world, and new classes would be released.\n\nDid I see any of those changes in the game:\nno, not really\n\nWhat I discovered in my +25 hours of playing (while on vacation):-USWest3 Server is still just as cancerous as before.  Chat comments fill up half of your screen and text from the advertising bots just spam it so hard that comments whiz by at the speed of f*cking light.  Fortunately there is the handy star requirement filter you can apply to chat (2* seems to do the trick), but it is still incredibly annoying that some bots still manage to whisper me.\n\n-Trading still sucks a-hole...  Like honestly, how has trading not been somehow improved in this game?  We have RealmEye which is great and all, but it is still such a hastle to try and arrange trades with other players, especially when you are playing and someone pms you and you go back to the nexus and forget the username of a player that pm'd you.  Every time you go to the nexus, an annoying bot will pm you, making it impossible to reply to the person who had just pm'd you since you can only reply to the last person who sent a pm to you (so the bot overrides the last pm).  Then you get to play the fun waiting game to try and find out if the person who had pm'd you will try and pm you again or not.\n\n-Chat....   Related to the first two points I made above.   Why is there no option to add a custom filter to the chat?  If players could filter out the "WWW" or ".COM" sh*t, the issue with chat going bonkers would be solved.  The star requirement filter is nice and all, but I realy don't want to force the req over 2* to filter out the annoying bot that whispers "Visit blah blah blah.com" (I am unsure if the star req even affects private messages).  Putting any star requirement is hiding away potential people who might be selling something that I need or players who are trying to negotiate with me.  Hell, just enforce the restriction to post WWW, W W W, COM, C0M, and all other variations by default to stop these annoying bots from ruining the game.\n\n-Daily Tasks.  This is a nice addition to the game that is actually pretty cool.  You can get skins and also loot potions which last 30 minutes.  My only complaint would be how long it takes to farm for some of these low tier weapons (T7 usually) which is honestly more difficult for me to find compared to t6 and +t8 weapons.  I am yet to complete the second stage of the daily quest.\n\n-A few new dungeons.  OK, at least something was added...  Like most dungeons in the game, these new dungeons don't feel very different from any of the old ones.  Moving along then...\n\n-New weapons, armors, items.  Most of the new weapons are situational, but it's still nice to see a variety of UT's added to the game in the last year and a half.\n\n-Armor sets.  Pretty interesting idea.  Of course you can try your luck getting these by either running a sh*t ton of dungeons (which I have no problem with) or just paying a couple bucks with a lucky box thing that can make your character completely OP at the cost of your wallet and RNG (I have a problem with this).\n\n-T13.  I don't believe this was added before, but I do like the idea of T13 items since they don't appear to be sold anywhere in the cash shop.  This is sort of meaningless though, since the armor sets sold in the cash shop have the potential to include some weapons that are on par -if not better- than t13 weapons.\n\n-Ressurection Amulets are gone.  Those things were pretty OP anyways (they had a chance to let your character be ressurected after death.  Players would have characters live indefinitely).\n\n-Custom Cursors. Finally :D\n\n\nAnd that honestly wraps up almost all the major changes I have seen in game.  I'll still play it till the end of my vacation.  A game worth trying, but this company is reminiscent of EA.","January 1, 2014","false","218.2"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","0"

I have never seen a game that is similiar to this one. All the items are really cool, all the misc. items are unique, all the dungeons are insane fun. Overall, It is a well-done RPG but I have some things that I do not like in it. Even though the game is Free-to-play, it is also "Pay-to-win" if you know what I mean. You can still play and enjoy the game without giving any money, but if you want to play seriously and become a "pro" you will have to spend some money. For example, when you start off, you can have only one vault chest, which isn't enough for anything. It holds only 8 items. You need more storage than that. So you have buy more chest, each of which costs 500 gold coins, which are worth about 2.7 Euro. That is cheap, right? Considering you need at least 10-15 chests to store all of your UT's (Ultra Tiers) and all of your Stat Potions, there is no way of that being cheap. You also need more than one character. Each character slot costs 1200 gold coins. You can color your character, which of course also costs gold coins.\nDispite the fact that the game is "Pay-to-win", I still had an absolute HUGE ammount of fun with this game with my friends. Leveling up, killing gods, completing dungeons etc. The game is insane fun even if you do not pay any money.\nI also have one more thing that annoys me. Server-side lag. My internet is really fast and I have no lag on other multiplayer games. But in RotMG sometimes because of the server-side lag I die, losing my character and all my hard-earned gear.

That's not even CLOSE to how much I've played since it came out on kongregate.  I've played probably 100+ something hours on that account, and easily over 1000 hours on the website.  I have made multiple maxed out characters, and lost just as many.  I think I'm qualified to give a review, so here goes.\n\nPros:\nDays upon days of enjoyment.\nHardcore gameplay (permadeath)\nAmazing pixel art\nRandom dungeon generation\nSuper high skill cap\nFast leveling\nYou don't need to buy anything\nliterally the most addictive game I've played in a while\n\nCons:\nKabam\n\nThere truly is really only one con at this point, and that would be the people that own this game.  They haven't released an update in months, not even a patch or bugfix to control the massive amount of hackers, exploiters, and spam bots that now populate the realm due to their negligence.  Nor do they ever post anything on the forums saying "hey sorry, we're pretty busy working on stuff." Complete silence.  About 5-6 months ago, they released a post saying the majority of their team was pulled off to work on a higher profiting game.  I'm not kidding, they openly admitted to it.  If Kabam decides to sell their game to a less money hungry company, I will absolutely change my review to "positive."  And let me get one thing straight, this is the first game I ever fell completely in love with.  The pixel art brought me back to my days of Super Mario 2, and Legend of Zelda.  The hardcore aspect caused me to undergo many 48 hour play sessions because I just had to get that god damn Doom Bow ("ok, last undead lair I swear" as I proceed to run it 25 more times).  However, I cannot recommend this game to anyone in the state that it is in.  If you want some quick enjoyment, absolutely try it, but don't expect anything amazing anymore.","November 15, 2015","false","5.7"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

You won't see that on my profile, because I played on the browser, until I recently went to check it out again. Big mistake.\n\nAll this game does is ♥♥♥♥ me off anymore, and not because I die over and over, that's part of the fun. What pisses me off is seeing a game I used to love being ruined and turned pay-to-win by Kabam. Kabam has done nothing but ♥♥♥♥ this game over completely since they bought it out. It's focused on how much money you can dump in the game, rather than how good you are, and how much time and effort you put in to FINDING your gear.\n\nYou used to have to hunt forever to get a good set, now you can just slap a few bucks down, and walk out of the nexus like hot ♥♥♥♥. Not to mention how they completely screwed the loot system. Not only did they add ninja, which would be a good idea, if it weren't for the fact that they added a new weapon type, instead of using one of the ones already in the game, but I swear they also lowered the drop rate on gear.\n\nFor those who don't know about the game, the ninja's unique weapon means that about 75% of weapons that drop are completely useless. Before ninjas were in the game, 66% couldn't be used by your class. This is because ninja weapons drop as commonly as the other 4 types, even though the other 4 have 2-3 classes using them.\n\nAs for the lower drop rate, I can only assume that's so that they can sell more gear to people.\n\nI really wish I could still like this game. I used to play all the time, and I had 3 8/8 characters, full tops/UT, including alt weapons and abilities, and tons of ♥♥♥♥ in my vault. The sad thing is that I can't in good conscience tell anyone to play this game, because it's evolved into what I can only describe as a Facebook game.\n\nPlease, Kabam, I know you must have a heart. Please give control back to WildShadowStudios, they knew how to run this game better than you guys ever will. You are ruining what used to be my favorite game.","February 26, 2014","false","2.2"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"

People would band together in very large groups to help level each other and take down bosses. A fun concept but due to the simplistic nature of the game, hardly something you want to dole out money for, especially considering the game is built largely from graphics that are open source. Cash shop perks however created the rise of the "cashing loner" who could do alone what 50 or so players could accomplish. That also created these loners to corner anyone getting good equipment, creating a large rift in the player base, this essentially leads to 3 options in the game: 1) hack your way to the gear. 2) be forced to cash. 3) spend ages fighting for any progression.\n\nNow these 3 routes are actually pretty typical of a free to play. Except Mad god has one more aspect that makes the taste even more sour, permadeath. Again with original concept of the game, permadeath wasn't so bad. The game was very pick up and play again, you didn't mind starting over because you never really had a lot of content to chew through so you never got too invested into any one character and there was other classes to try the game over from a new perspective. Now there is a lot more content to the game so dying for a free player even if they do as much planning as humanly possible, is a major setback, cash players can buy additional storage and even have soul bound items so they aren't exactly starting over every single time, adding to the gap between the players.\n\nIn all this game was a fun concept that was bled dry for every cent they could get and it shows plain as day.","February 28, 2012","false","17.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

I'm finally able to solo this abyss and get some decent loot without putting money into it! *server lags, gets stuck into wall and gets gang banged by 6 demons, then dies and loses absolutely everything*\n\nTo be more detailed, this game is fun if you survive the constant server lag and other stupid bugs. Other wise your ♥♥♥♥♥ against a wall by demons. Also, the community is almost ♥♥♥♥. It's full of children (yes this is basically a childs game) who cry to their mommy to put money into it otherwise they'll cut themselves for having a unfair life. I have picked a few out of it who are nice people and want to dungeon, but the game itself makes it impossible to give a good dungeon experience, unless you somehow  manage to what the community calls "8/8" which is basically playing non-stop until you finally achieve being a god yourself. But halfway through this you'll probably die from a wall. Even then, you've gone through the hell of having to rely off yourself since this games mostly Solo until your the best of the best (without dying by a wall halfway to 8/8)  you basically will be put in a guild with either children or adults who have also gone through the hell of ROTMG. So this game is addicting and a waste of time unless your like me and have nothing better to do but die by a damn wall. Also, if you have something for stronghold kingdoms, strongholds and this game share the "Dying is apart of the game" concept. So if your reading this and are getting ready to install, you'll regret it.\n-----------------------------------------------EDITED---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo realm is the same after playing again for 3 more weeks, but i finally got a 6/8. What i found more disturbing is the community. Either kids who still say noob just to go jerk for the first time, or grown men who spend money on the game because why not. The real challenge realm has, is trying to ignore the community even though alot of the game is in the trade system, which btw is always changing and full of scammers.I think I'm officially done, leaving my character as a cruddy priest who actually has some decent gear, but even then, a garry's mod rp server has a better community than this game.

Put your self in the shoes of a new person who has never seen ROTMG before and doesnt know how to explain it, try to keep that viewpoint in your mind. Now with the words I have said, lets get to the review.\n=======================\nRealm of the Mad God\n=======================\nSome people cant really explain all of this at one slice in a good-meaningful way. so Ill start off with the basics.\nThe game has a art style reminiscent of arcade games/NES graphics but with more of a damaku way of attacks. The gameplay can be easy to hard at certain points but is hard to master at any skill level. The main bad "Oryx the Mad God" constantly throws taunts and insults at the player base in the realm "server" much like the french-men in the south of great britian, its up to the players to defeat Oryx's army and take back the realms from the wrath of the Mad God. The story is extremely shallow but not all games need to have a good story.\n\n++++++++\nGAMEPLAY\n++++++++\n\nThe game play acts much like a more dynamic version of Smash TV, the enemies start of easy but as you journey into the center of the realm, the enemies start to get more tougher until the player called "Godlands" the area is filled with black stone and thick snow and the enemies are the toughest they are at. The Mad God's armies also drop loot which is contained in little colorful bags, with the color becoming brighter and brighter as the strength in the bag increases. once you reach level 20 the goal for now is to "Max your Stats" you can accomplish this by drinking the "Potion of Life/Mana/Attack/Wisdom/Defense/Dexterity/Vitality" which are from the deep blue bags you can get from the gods or the dungeon bosses scattered in the game. You also get a bunch of classes, Ill just state the 5 "basic" classes from here\n\nThe Wizard\nUses staffs and wears robe's to protect himself while dealing heavy damage with his staff and spell\n\nThe Priest\nUses wands and robes much like the wizard but instead of focusing on damage he has a tome that can heal him and his allies within a certain area\n\nThe Archer\nUses the bow and quiver to deal average damage and to hinder movement of enemies with his quiver, also wears leather armor to protect himself\n\nThe Rogue\nUses the dagger to deal damage at a safe distance by using his cloak to give him invisibility allowing him to lose aggro and get the damage in on important enemies also wears leather armor\n\nThe Warrior\nUses the sword and helm to deal out insane close range damage while buffing his allies with his war-cry, since because he is a close combat character he has to wear the heavy armor in order to mend his high risk status\n\nThere are many more characters to unlock but I wont go anyfurther. The game is simple yet challenging and rewarding to those who do well.\n\nPROS\n-unique characters\n-unique combat system\n-great teamwork aspect\n-challenging yet rewarding gameplay\nCONS\n-bad internet can heavily impair a players ability to excel\n-gets boring after a while\n-bad if you have no friends\n\n****************\nVerdict\n****************\nThe game is good once in a while but will get stale rather quickly if you dont have many friends to play with, there are some flaws with the community and how its being run but I cant speak all of that right now. So my score of "Realm of the Mad God" is.....\n\n5/10\n\nThe game is fun for some players but some see it as a mindless game, I cant say its good or bad but i dont recomend it for the casual player\n\n\nSo thats my review of "Realm of the Mad God" I wish you all a good day\n\n~Duke Zun","June 7, 2015","false","151.4"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","19","28","2","0"

(atleast I do)\nIf losing all your "Precious" items will be too much for your heart to bear, this is not the game for you. (Permadeath)\nAll of the classes are worth playing, maybe except for a few.\nAs for the community, its up and down. Mostly filled with children. Rare to see anyone over the age 18, so you can imagine what the chat is like. Not saying the community is bad, people will sometimes help you out, and you can make friends via guild system. But most guilds will only invite you if you are actually good at the game, which is cruel, but w.e.\nGetting loot is so satisfying, especially those yummy white bags.\n\nCons:\nEvent notifier\nAmount of bots (inevitable in a f2p game, but bearable with the new feature that can auto- hide the chat from low ranked players)\n\nI always have a my chat filtered so I only see ranked 10stars or above basically since I hate seeing my chat flooded from either children talking/spamming, or trolls.\n\nI don't know if this is still out there but there was this thing that was out that would notify you via realm if there is a special quest of your interest that spawned in. This-was-the-breaking point for me... The times where I would be chilling in my home realm and see (Sphinx/Hermit) I'd be so hyped, nowadays when the event spews out "A sphinx entered the realm" atleast 60 people from from other servers drop in to get the chance to get some awesome loot.\n\nSo onto the hate for the company Kabam...They started up pets which helped alot of new players, but made veteren players very upset. It was a new system that tries to get you to spend your real money on "feed" to feed your pets to make them heal you more or make other abilities better. If you have the bank account, you can make this game so easy, that the only way you die is by being extremely dumb, or getting armor broken, or doing very very hard dungeons.\nNow I do understand the company has to make money to keep the game running so im not upset about what Kabam is doing. There are packs they release that are understandable and pretty tempting to purchase but of course you dont have to. Now If you understand how the game works this game can be played without using your precious money but the most tempting deals would be chests/character slots. Everything else can be avoided, unless you are really bad and need to get the best items to be able to play the game. (I exploit this and load up on pots to buy top items from kids who use parents credit cards to buy items)\n\nIN MY HONEST OPINION, Kabam is not a bad company...they need to make money somehow right? If they weren't releasing these items/keys/deals how would this game still be alive?\n\nOverall this game is for me was great when it didn't have the event notifiers, but since they are out, the game has been getting worse and worse.\n\nThere are probably many more cons than the ones I listed but those are the two main ones that upset me.\nRate: 5/10\n\nAnyone with questions can ask here, im open to all feedback good/bad.","March 5, 2015","false","037.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Sure, skill is still involved, but you HAVE TO PAY $$$$ to be good.\n\nIt is literally impossible to be good at this game unless you spend some money. You cannot be nearly decent at this game until you have a few character slots(you start off with one!!!!), a few vault chests(again, you start off with on!!!!), a good pet, and EXPENSIVE items that upgrade that pet.\n\nAs someone who has let their wallet vomit a bit too much( >100$ spent in game), please for the love of not supporting this disgusting Pay To Win Freemium game model, don't get this game.

I've been given serious reason.\nThis game, as it is right now, is playable and there are quite a few fun aspects of it. However, since Kabam bought RotMG, they bought crappy servers so we would die to lag, causing us to do the following:They made the game HEAVILY based on p2w, as you can buy bonus packages containing a ton of crap, the ability to buy ALL OF THE TOPS(for ridiculous amounts of money, and people do it), and then there are also the people illegally selling earned items and accounts within the game. Plus, someone came up with the brilliant idea of an event notifier so there are a ton of people around EVERY boss like the Hermit or Sphinx. They focused on adding more content instead of polishing the content that they have already put out. They added pets into the game, and if you fully level them at legendary(heal and magic heal), you become almsot invincible. Hackers are everywhere, and i havn't seen Kabam do ANYTHING to fix this problem. This game went from a real gem, to THIS. I still play it because, again, there are definitely fun aspects to the game itself. But, if I had 3 wishes to spend on games, I would use one to give Wildshadow back RotMG.","February 7, 2015","false","261.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","1"

This game kinda brings me a sense of nostalgia... This nostalgia brings on a lot of mixed feelings; I've had some of my best laughs, met new mates and plain and simple, had something to come back to when I was bored.\n\nHowever, I also have bad experiences with this game such as the permanent death feature - don't get me wrong this doesn't make the game it's self bad, it's just not for me personally - which has made some of the angriest and most regretful moments of my gaming life.\n\nThere's also the pay to win path that I followed for a short while before realising, "WAIT! I'm ♥♥♥♥ and keep dying, why am I spending money on crap I'm gonna lose in 2 days?". To be fair I DID know that you could get all these items playing legit, but my low level newbie self didn't know how damned easy it was! Like seriously, $12 or something to get a dagger that one, I'm never going to use and two, would take about 1/2 hour of farming to obtain. So yeah, if you are going to play this game, avoid all the equipment shops in the nexus at all costs ;c;\n\nHeres one that I've never really seen anyone but myself complain about; the classes are extremely unbalanced. People only ever play knight, warrior, wizard and possibly a dbow archer, with higher level players - unlike myself - having maxed every class, and still choosing to play these characters. Why? WELL, let me explain...\nNow, I'm pretty sure the original devs of RotMG, Wild Shadow Studios, never intended the game to be like WoW with full on raids and ♥♥♥♥. However, I'm pretty sure they wanted a teamwork element. These teamwork elements do not exist for multiple reasons:\n\n-The two classes that have the highest defence in the game, also have some of the highest dps... WTF?!\n-Kabam added pets which attack enemies, but most importantly; heal, rendering the weaker defence healing classes USELESS!\n-Private loot. In other words, the classes with the highest dps - which again apart from wizard, have the HIGHEST defence in the game!? - are the only ones to get drops.\n-Some of the classes are utterly usless to the player, let alone a whole team.\n\nIt's because of these reasons that people only play high dps classes which are practically invincible, destroying the whole concept of teamwork.\n\nFinally, there's the player base. I remember when I was a newb I had a 3/8 come up to me and give me some hydra skin armor. I didn't know what it was worth at the time and i was playing knight, so I couldn't wear it anyway, and my friend offered me a crossbow - a ♥♥♥♥♥ item - for this hydra skin - a legendary item to a newb - and being the newbie I was I accepted - the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ XD. Despite looking back fondly on stories like these, people who create stories and friendships in this game no longer exist. Ever since a RotMG YouTuber by the name of Kalle quit the game - the first real major game figure to leave - the whole veteran community left. By that time I was a mid level player, stranded in a waste land of guildless people keeping to themselves and not talking to anyone. As a result, me and my mates slowley started to quit the game.\nIn other words - the friendly community is practically dead ;c;\n\nOverall, I did enjoy and make memories on this game, but that was back in the golden days of early 2013. It's the 3/1/2016 as I am writing this - happy late new year everyone! - and I jumped into the game a few weeks ago to see if any of my guildies still played. To my (sarcastic) surprise, the guild was disbanded. I was left a PM on the RotMG forum:\n\n"G'day Eoghann how've you been? How's school been or whatever?\n\nYou know what, I'll cut to it. We've disbanded as a guild due to the sheer lack of enjoyable community. Most of us are moving onto WoW and we were wonding if you'd like to join us? If so, contact me here: *nopenopenopenopenopenope*\n\n~Regards, *nopenopenope*"\n\n3.5/10","January 3","false","3.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Even if left for hours, the game will never actually load. I initially contacted support about this back in February, and I've had to make multiple tickets due to previous ones automatically closing.\n\nTo this day, the issue is still unresolved for me. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'll probably leave it as a negative because of what a joke the support team is.\n\nGet your ♥♥♥♥ together, Kabam, you're only harming yourself through losing potential customers.","May 15, 2015","false","3.3"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","1"

Im not going to talk about kabam like everyone else.\nHere is why I like the game, And why many others still do.\nYes, It is heavily wallet grabbing and if you so much as want to change your name you need 10$ however, what many players dont mention or dont want to mention is that the very BEST items in the game, arent bought, These are UT'S and while some will claim some weapons or gear are better than some UT's most of them are still much much better (I.E Dbow vs Covert) Now on to the second part, Yes you die due to lag. You cant expect not to. It even makes the game all that more challenging, and annoying. What I find so fun in this game is the constent fear of death that you just dont get with any other game. Back to the money grabbing, Just because some dim-witted charlie begged his mum for 50$ to dump into the game and buy a full set, Why the ♥♥♥♥ should you care? Let the people who pay money do their thing and you do yours. On to pros and Cons.\nPros :\n+ Nice soundtrack\n+ Drop system based on most DPS done (No one leeches for loot, you need to do good DPS)\n+ Variety of dungeons\n+ Somewhat decent playerbase\n+ A lot of fun to play with others\n+ Most hacks arent gonna effect you. (They mostly involve going into dungeons after leaving and tp'ing etc)\n+ Skill based game (Don't know how to play, you die.)\n+ Most good loot is very hard to get (Which is fun, For example the very sought after A.S.S Ancient Stone Sword)\n+ Dedicated player base, despite all the ♥♥♥♥ that was hurrled at us.\nCons :\n- Spam bots everywhere (But to be fair all games have that)\n- As many scammers as there are hairs on my ♥♥♥♥\n- Death on a good chr will make you break your keyboard\n- A good share of money grabbing\n- Lag spikes\n- A lot of ♥♥♥♥ing lag spikes\n- So many hackers, You'll actully see more of them than actual players.\n- A lot of disconnections solely kabams crap servers.\n- Some amount of accounts being stolen by hackers and kabam giving 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.\n- Most guilds died due to kabam.\n- Dying due to other peoples mistakes.\nThank you all for reading this and feel free to comment.","June 2, 2015","true","201.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It has great coop gameplay which relies on skill to stay alive, and staying alive is very important because it is a PERMADEATH game. It runs in Flash, so its compatible with almost all systems. The graphics are a retro pixelated masterpiece and will definitely bring on the nostalgia. The game has no ending, making it very addictive. This game is still being updated regularly and new content is being added all the time. There are 14 classes to unlock, loads of items to be found, dungeons for all skill levels, and a guild system to help encourage cooperation.\n\nThis game is also full of bugs that are difficult to fix, given the nature of the coding. The bugs aren't game-breaking but can get annoying at times. There is an unsolvable issue with memory leaks that will force you to restart the game every hour or so. Spambots advertise for websites that sell items illegally. Do not buy anything from them. The items they sell can be farmed in the game without spending any money. There is a trading system which you can use to buy, sell, trade, or gift items with other players. Do not spend money on items, it is a waste!\n\nSome people, including myself, experience a bit of lag when playing the Steam version of this game. If you have issues such as input delay, I encourage you to give it another shot by playing it at its home, www.realmofthemadgod.com.\n\nWith all that in mind, I still thoroughly enjoy this game and support its development by buying extra vault space and character slots. I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill based shooters and MMORPGs. Did I mention its FREE?!\n\nUpdate: Since I quit playing RotMG regularly, a lot has changed. The old management is out and new people have taken their place and seem to be doing much better. They seem to make much better use of their resources and have their priorities in a much better order. The game and owners/developers are making much needed progress and deserve a little recognition.","May 1, 2013","true","136.8"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","24","43","0","0"

I've played over 700 hours by the way.\n\nFirstly, it's not pay to win or whatever to win, all the stuff you see in the nexus is overpriced garbage. For example, take an egg, it costs several hundred gold whereas you can get one from trading or monster drops really, really easily. I could literally afford several hundred eggs myself because they're that cheap. There are dyes and dungeon keys being sold but certain dyes are available from drops and all dungeons are available in the realm.\n\nSecondly, Kabam is more of a victim here rather than the enemy. They bought the game from the developers who were dying from a shrinking wallet and thus saved this game for us all to play! Of course, there have been some bad things that have happened to the game in their hands but who's to say it wouldn't have happened in the developers' hands? It's equally likely. These include duping, haxors and game being hacked etc. The decision to take away amulets of resurrection and soulbound all UTs was a most terrible decision since these kept the economy booming but the duping incident demanded it and they saw no other choice -_-\n\nDespite the lack of recent updates, hackers and everything else, the game is still very playable, perhaps Kabam isn't getting enough money for the game which is why they stuffed everything into the nexus so noobs could buy it ignorantly. Of course, if the game was in our hands, we'd do some things differently like an alternative solution to soulbouding UTs but let's just be happy/sad that we even have the game to be addicted to and waste our life on?\n\nI have a good store of knowledge about this game and I'm willing to bust whatever negative con you emphasise this game to be about! Add me or please post something below if you disagre or would like to know more about this time-waste of a fun game. Any game is a time-waste, but this is one of the most - being one of the most addictive, if you're into it.","December 11, 2014","true","0.3"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","55","28","51","8","1"

They really need to have "meh" as an option. After playing this game for 6 hours I still have no strong feelings or opinions one way or the other.\n\nOn the bright side this game is fast and frantic, you're not held down by all the tedious things that most games will bog you down with. There's pvp, co-op, all that stuff as well.\n\nThe down side? 200% pay2win. Most games will have two forms of curreny: An in-game system and a "special" currency you have to buy with real-world money. There's absolutely no way of earning any money in this game, none, no monsters will ever drop so much as a single coin for you. Buy, buy, buy. That is the ONLY way of making any money in this game.\n\nOh and just to make things more "fun" (for the game devs) it's perma-death pay2win. Let's say you spent $500 on your character and then die? Sucks to be you, everything is gone, buy it all over again. Whatever fun I may have by playing this is balanced out by my unwillingness to invest any real money into this game. The end result is me being perfectly neutral towards this game. I can easily just give this game a thumbs down right now, but I'm feeling generous.\n\nBy the way this game has nothing to do with Legends Of Yore or Hack Slash Loot, I made that mistake too. The graphics are just public domain or something. (Probably a game making engine.)","December 22, 2013","true","17.4"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","7"

I have to admit, I have spent money into the game. No, I didn't regret my purchase for a single second.\n\nI've played the game long before it was on Steam, before the Avatar of the Forgotten King and many, many updates before that (too many to remember).\n\nRealm of the Mad God is the type of game where you try to quit, but can't. As some people say, you can never quit Realm, it only quits you.\n\nRealm of the Mad God is a free-to-play, MMORPG, bullet hell, rogue-like (the first of it's kind!).\n\nGetting into the game is kind of tricky. It's a "The hell is this?! The hell is that?!" type of game to get into. But as you progress through the game, you learn your way around the game. Yes, you will die lots and lots of times on your way to the almighty level 20, and many will quit before ever reaching there. But getting to level 20 at last feels like you were destined to get there.\n\nPros of Realm of the Mad God:\nPlay your way\nMassively Multiplayer\nNew experience every playthrough\nGuilds\n\nCons of Realm of the Mad God:\nHackers/Multiboters\nEvent Notifiers\nSpammers\nInfrequent updates (Only one person working on Realm?!)\n\n\nIn conclusion, Realm of the Mad God is a game you must play, whether you buy Realm Gold or not, Realm of the Mad God is a great game overall.\n8.6/10\n\nEnjoy my review?

I got nothing but wrong and worse pets.\n\nIt is also almost impossible to reach something w/o buying gold, because the relevant things like character slots and vault chests are not buyable with ingame obtainable money.","June 6","false","914.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The graphics are very well done; so well done, my eyes were baptized upon seeing the amazing quality this game has provided. Along with graphics, the definite story-line was amazing. The final boss was so well designed using his amazing powers such as shooting rectangular and circular pixels. The difference between the bosses and normal monsters is that bosses shoot more and do more damage. I thought this was a well-thought and creative attribute, providing originality. The characters produced were also fantastic, not being the most generic characters at all. Characters such as "mage" and "knight" were concepts I wish other games would use. The characters were 100% unique and never before seen in any other game. Overall a very creative game.  5/5 stars for sure, without a doubt.","October 26, 2013","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, since late 2013 when Kabam came to ownership the game became extremly P2P.  If you want to ever get anywhere in the game you have to buy multiple character and vault chests so that you have backup characters and loot. Vault chests only hold 8 items and cost 5 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars a piece. Aswell as making most legendery loot hard as ♥♥♥♥ to obtain, they took out trading of UT items, So once you get the legendary loot if its not for your class you're SOL.  My reccomendation is to avoid playing this until Kabam lifts their P2P hammer.","January 19, 2015","false","135.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Too many micro-transactions and a lot of focus on paying to win basically. Pets are the key to survival which are insanely hard to get up to speed without farming trench's or etc. for a long time without paying money. And all new dungeons, and items, and in general game updates are focused around spending money for top tier gear whether it be the mystery box with a low chance for an extreme payout, or buying "tops" straight up. 8 "8/8's" no longer feels like I earned it since anyone can buy tops and farm fairly easily (but most likely die and give me a good laugh), UT's drop frequently and the game just feels like a massive, overpowering player base with no challenge any longer (especially with pets) and is just a waste of time to farm.\n\n{Summary}\nLarge changes such as UT's being non-tradeable or the disappearance of amulets is not what ruined the game, it's the most recent p2w schemes, aka mystery box of profit that tear away from the core point of farming and finally having the RNG in your favor for that moment when you've achieved a great set after good work, not having exclusive items in the mystery box that won't be in a dungeon for 3 months...\n\n{Suggestion}\nI love Warframe and League of Legends, for some reason a LOT of RoTMG players left for league, not sure why but I was hooked also so check them out, realm is just not worth the time any longer. And Warframe gives a perfect feel for the payout for time you put in farming, very Face of Mankind esque but updated constantly and very satisfying to play unlike another great games downfall.\n\n\n(The Big Lebowski)\nHas the world gone crazy?\nSeen too many games go to ♥♥♥♥....","August 16, 2014","false","675.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

But yeah, this is a REALLY, REALLY addicting game. It's gonna be very hard NOT to spend money on it, but it's worth it if you like the game enough.\n\n(edit: a year after i wrote this)\n\ni still die every day, my characters literally do not last for more than 5 days. my mind practically revolves around this game and i've spent around $300 on it. i've invested around 700+ hours on this piece of rainbow ♥♥♥♥ and my deaths actually do frustrate me now because i'm actually maxed.\n\nbut anyway, this game is better when playing with friends, or if you have a guild. when it's late and you're the only one up, you can just relax and farm in the godlands. even if you're rich as hell, npe's with friends will help ease the boredom.\nthis game also has its own economy, not like cs:go, tf2, or dota where you could trade via steam and steam chat, but in the game itself, and the company that owns the game will help you with all your problems but they do not care about trading itself, only bug fixes and blah blah. trading in this game isn't as profitable as godlands farming though, due to the amount of time it takes although you could always go on realmeye which is similar to tf2outpost or cs:go lounge to post trades and wait for someone to PM you while youre actually playing the game.\n\nthe main goal in this game is probably to max. 6/8 is a start to new players. for players who already have all 12 characters 8/8 maxed with all the gear they want, they usually make another set of backup characters or start a collection - like all the ut's in the game or all the treasures or all the tops.\n\ni see nothing wrong with the community besides (i say nothing and besides in the same sentence ironicly) some chat spammers who could easily be ignored, and even notifers seem to be a problem but i don't mind them. the people are fine though, except for the leechers, but can you blame them?\n-\nupdate 8 months after i wrote the second update:\ni like how they fixed the notifers. i didn't understand it at first, since i thought any time you entered a realm you'd have to wait 2 minutes but it makes sense on how you could just nexus in case you almost die or store some pots in your inventory and re-enter the realm without having to wait.\n\nanyway, realm lag. it's not your internet, it's realm, it always has been realm. i haven't played in months (though i have around 1,300 hours on it including my hours on steam) and i can see that the lag is slightly better, but not all the way better. there's still only around 3-4 lucky hours of the day where there's no noticable lag. i'm sure with the hella loads of updates they did a month or two ago this summer that they tried fixing it, still i don't see why they can't add more ram to the servers with the amount of money people spend in a month of just playing the game.\n\ni think that's one of the main reasons people stop playing realm. the first reason is that realm is the gamer's heroin and you should probably only play under an hour a day, 3 days a week or you'll get sucked into the vortex of neverending gameplay and the financially broke life.","July 16, 2013","true","353.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, since late 2013 when Kabam came to ownership the game became extremly P2P.  If you want to ever get anywhere in the game you have to buy multiple character and vault chests so that you have backup characters and loot. Vault chests only hold 8 items and cost 5 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars a piece. Aswell as making most legendery loot hard as ♥♥♥♥ to obtain, they took out trading of UT items, So once you get the legendary loot if its not for your class you're SOL.  My reccomendation is to avoid playing this until Kabam lifts their P2P hammer.","January 19, 2015","false","135.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First ever truly FREE game, where supporting the creators doesn't give you an unfair advantage. Very good game!\n\n2016:\nSo yea.. that was awhile go wasn't it? Alot has changed.... for the worse.\nThe game is not truly 'free' anymore, there are numerous pay2win factors in the game. The game is still good and fun at times but it has some serious issues.\n\n\nI pretty much quit, I come online now and then to run a couple dungeons and then I'm off. Sometimes I go for longer when I decide to stream abit.\nI feel like this game does not deserve any players and should just die off already. What kabam is doing to the players and the game is horrible.\nFrom reading the forums you see alot of people that are done with the game. They either want to quit or ask questions about the longevity of this game. And there's certain people that keeps feeding the community this idea that as long as you support the game (buy gold) it will not shut down.\nNow maybe this is correct, but I dont think we should promote and feed such a company.\nThey have literally done nothing for the past like year?\nNo new content or adaptations of dungeons, no promised changes. And dont even bring up the 'that was another team'. If they trash ideas, communicate this.\nIt's ridiculous how infested with cheaters this game is. I bet over 50% of the players are cheaters or have cheated at one point to build up their accounts.\nNot to mention the game being overrun with multiboxers.\n\nI think people go easy on kabam because of their love for this game.\nThe game is good and enjoyable. But it is also an MMO, and such games require maintenance and regular updates to keep stuff fresh and exciting.\nI'm getting the same vibes when hacking first became visible widely and people just basically ignored it because it did not hurt them. And look where we are now.\nYes they have put on some sort of fix for event notifiers. But not after ALOT of complaints, we can wake them up if we really want them to.\n\nI'm truly amazed at the people that can still religiously play this game every day. How do you not become bored after an hour?\nIs it because you are addicted? Have nothing else to play? Because trust me, there are ALOT of great games out there with developers that DO care.\n\nOf course we do not KNOW what is up with kabam, maybe they are rewriting the entire game?\nBut the fact remains, there is no communication whatsoever. And they've basically let the game run on autopilot.\n\nSo if you want to play a bullet hell, permadeath mmo then by all means play this game. The game is still good and you can do fine without buying gold. But I will also tell you to not get invested in this game, it honestly does not deserve your time. Once you've reached the endgame stuff will become stale rapidly. If you can endure the cheaters and multiboxers and lack of communcation/updates from the developers that is.","February 28, 2012","true","140.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game used to be amazing, fun, interactive and enjoyable. You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus.

But the only way to get gold is to buy it with actual money from your account. And no, there isn't anyway to earn gold in the actual game. If you aren't the kind that's willing to spend money to get the good items, then chances are you won't enjoy this game (or at least not as much as you should).","September 22, 2014","false","51.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, both problems make the game virtually unplayable.\n1. Too much Pay 2 Win. Seriously. This is the WORST pay 2 win I have seen in ANY game. EVER! Even EA is shocked by the excessive Pay 2 Win (Fun Fact: I actually like EA.). Half the game's content needs the coins, which it's hyper hard to get any unless you're shelling out money for them. Without coins, you have a half-♥♥♥♥♥ game with very little content available.\n2. The controls are UN-RE-FREAKING-SPONSIVE! I disabled shadows, I set the game to windowed, I disabled text bubbles, and I even closed everything off except for this game, and the controls are still barely managable! My character, for no reason, decides to go left when I want him to go right. sometimes, he doesen't even move at all! Literally ALL of my deaths recently was because of the ♥♥♥♥-poor controls.\nThis game isn't a bad concept.

Holy ♥♥♥♥ I hate it.\n\nAll you do is going through Grinding Hell by shooting things until finally battling the final boss of sort, Oryx, all while praying that the enemies just don't drain all of your life in one second (which happened to me a lot), because if you die, you lose your "oh-so-many" days character, and you have to start everything from scratch.  Geez, who the ♥♥♥♥ likes to lose so much (non-)progress?  I mourned more over my dead 10 hours character than on my grandma, knowing that I have to bore myself to death again.\n\nThe game doesn't really help you either, such as certain quests being on the opposite side of the map, 300km away, which when you get there, other players have already dealt with the target or there's too much crap to risk it, and the equipment that the enemies drop, more often than not, is always stuff that you can't wear anyway.  I swear, I grinded for hours, yet my equipment was still too crap to deal with the quest monsters, and I got ♥♥♥♥ed up hard.  I'm completely clueless as to what I'm doing wrong, unless I have to cough up some dollars to get better crap that I assume I'd lose anyway if I would inevitably die.  I guess the grinding could be said for a lot of RPGs, but there isn't ANYTHING else to do, you're at the game's mercy, and it mostly comes out as unrewarding.  This is by far one of the worst cases of grinding I've ever seen.\n\nAlso features a very annoying, sole music that makes you want to mute it, and, as briefly mentionned, there are microstransactions, the pay-to-win and in-your-face kind, of course silly.  Heck, you can even ACCIDENTLY BUY a potion if you had none left, with real money, in the middle of the action while you're too nervous to notice, and I read that the dyes for your character that you also buy with $CAD will be lost upon death.\n\nUtter ♥♥♥♥ing garbage, tabarnak.  I'm pretty sure even before it was bought by Kabam, I've read, the core gameplay was still and remains as bad; it's mindnumblingly tedious and the permadeath rule don't work at all and is pretty unfair, making things even worse than they already are.  I want this game to die, horribly.  Don't ever waste your time on this crap, you could have a more fun experience throwing rocks in the lake.","May 15","false","22.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

This game offers so much, but it's rather difficult to get into, while being incredibly easy to get in to. Starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one, at first glance it's a fun game, but nothing you'd spent much time on. Now If you look past that, there is actually so much. The leveling system isn't what determines a character. Maxed stats are. In game "potions" are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy, along with gear and other items. These potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons.  To problem is, getting this far takes practice, detrmination and grit. Death is inevitable, dont let it set you back. Learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful. Even the most powerful characters who have all 8 stats maxed are prone to quick deaths, the game in unforgiving, and requires skill, but offers much in return for those who deliver.","June 19, 2014","true","70.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

You need to keep on the move and in-game and not browsing the internet while on this game, if you should and die you will need to start a character over. There are only 20 levels, it's really easy to level, just find a "train group" (they run on the roadd killing all monsters that come thier way). There are many achievments, some that are easy to get like obtaining diffrent classes, and a few that are quite hard to obtain like killing 100+ gods on a single character. The graphics of the game are very simple and colorful to look at, and pretty cute. Their are many diffrent types of monsters, big and small, easy and hard. Now about content of the game, there still is not much, there is a store that you can buy in-game gold, there is a storage system ( you have one chest).","March 11, 2012","true","104.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

Well they are loot that are in a specific bag color. The colors ranges from\nPurple , Cyan and white. White Bags Are the hardest to get but has good stuff inside and you have pets too who has alot of\nabilities which can aid you in battle. the places you should avoid unless you have better equips and at least lvl 20 which are Godlands(glands).You can die Pretty much instantly by some gods like Medusa(Snake Head Lady),Leviatan(Blue Creature) and Djinns(blue creature that shoots snowballs) and more.Whenever you feel your screen shaking, its time to meet Oryx.Oh and expect death whenever that happens because he is the hardest boss in the game and alot of players die by him.so i recommend you to nexus or die a brave person.Whenever you die, dont be sad just think about what your next character is gonna be and start over again.Remember Guys, EXPECT DEATH!!\n\n-StxofDark(RotMG Username0","December 5, 2013","true","557.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

It was when I maxed my first chars def spd and dex that I got hooked. My addiction only grew as i played and my pet started literally eating my bank account. My friends and coworkers mocked me for how much I played the game so i started playing on offline mode so steam would stop counting how much time I play this game. I started getting mad when I would die on a good char and I would take that anger out on my friends and famly. My girlfriend started feeling neglected and abused because of how much time I spent on this game. So one day she left me and I didn't even care because my happiness and care had been replaced with ROTMG. By then I stopped showing up to work because I was farming tombs. I eventually lost my job and later my house. I moved in with my parents and contunue to play the game and spend what money I have left. Now 1265 usd and counting later I have 2 divine pets, a yellow star, 16 char slots most of them 8/8 maxed and a vault full of life. Lost my girlfriend, job, and friends because of this game.

The combat doesn't even feel like a shooter, as it often rewards just staying away from enemies rather than skillfully dodging and weaving through enemy attacks.\n\nLike all MMO's it supposedly gets better, but even people who have stuck with it tell me that it's ultimately more of a WoW style loot farming game than a true action experience.

However, it definitely falls into the love it or hate it category. It is accurate to describe it as a bullet hell RPG. Some people can't get past the art style alone, but again that's something I love about it. There are 14 character classes, which gives quite a bit of variety. You can play the game absolutely free, but you can also support the game and go the easy way by doing micro transactions within the game itself for items or customization. Part of this game is dying, especially by being a little too greedy or picking a bad teleport to some random person on the map. However, the max character level is 20 and it is easy to get back up there from level 1 in an hour. There are different levels of items and each class has its own special ability item as well. There are also pets that you can find or buy to give you in game bonuses. I don't like all the changes they've made since I first started playing it, but I still love the game. It's a rare game that you can have a lot of fun with by yourself or with a group of friends or even with random strangers.","August 30, 2013","true","173.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't agree with this at all. I've played this game quite a bit, not only through steam but through the website itself as well. I think the reason people believe it's pay to win is because of the starting area, where the new developer put the option, right where you spawn, to purchase very high tiered gear with coins, which can only be bought with real money. I don't think this is the best idea, because it imbalances the economy some and also encourages people who don't know what their doing to spend money on this equipment, only to lose it soon after by dying in this PERMADEATH game. That said though, this DOES NOT make the game pay to win. All of this equipment is obtainable through looting or trading with other players for other loot. There aren't many things that can ONLY be bought with real money, and these things are mostly clothing dyes, alt skins, food items to grow your pet faster then normal, and things like character slots or inventory space. Not having these things won't really detract from your experience playing this game, and it is definitely not pay to win. Maybe pay to get ahead slightly faster, but not pay to win.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can definitely recommend this game.

The combat doesn't even feel like a shooter, as it often rewards just staying away from enemies rather than skillfully dodging and weaving through enemy attacks.\n\nLike all MMO's it supposedly gets better, but even people who have stuck with it tell me that it's ultimately more of a WoW style loot farming game than a true action experience. So if the "shmup mmo hybrid" got you excited, you might want to check your enthusiasm in my oppinion.","May 6, 2013","false","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The first time I logged on was when the entire server was being ported to Oryx's castle, and, needless to say, i died instantly. I just laughed at myself a bit afterwards, and stopped playing for a while, but picked it back up anyways, when a friend I had introduced to the game wanted me to. It still held that first aspect, but my friend opened my eyes to the more, i will say "MLG" side of it, for lack of a better adjective.

However, I also would like to point out that there's quite a bit going south with the game, which I'll get on later.\n\nI've played this game for quite a long time (the 20 hours it says I have does no justice as I played it for probably around 200 hours or so in a browser before I came to Steam) and I can safely say that I had a fun with it for most of the time playing, outside of the fits of rage from death. So, to get into the review:\n\nRealm of the Mad God is a game on a randomly generated piece of land where you and your fellow adventurers kill monsters and find items (which scale in tiers. The higher the tier, the better it is) to fight off the minions of Oryx, the mad god, to eventually take him down yourselves. The fact that it is randomly generated allows you to have a different encounter with bosses, enemies, and find loot in other areas, so the map can't just be memorized.\n\nPros:\n-It has a nice art style\n-Good music, which doesn't really get too old that fast, though it does after the 100th hour or so\n-Challenging and fun to play, as well as pretty addictive.\n\nCons:\n-Permadeath, which will be a bigger topic in a moment\n-Almost completely pay to win at this point, and what once made it challenging has been erased by this\n-Drop rates for items\n\nPermadeath:\nThis is a feature that has made the game very fun, but also really annoying over the years. If you don't know what it is, it means as it sounds. When you die, you're dead, and you have to restart. This is fun in the sense that it makes the game more serious, in that you won't want to just charge head first into every situation, as you could risk all your items you have. This also makes it very annoying, because if you look away for one second, scratch your face, take a drink, whatever it may be, it can kill you, and if it causes you to die, thats the end of the story, and you're done for good. I can say that from my honest point of view as a very impatient person and one who's quick to anger, this isn't TOO terrible, because, while you will likely get really angry and possibly hit things (I did), it still draws you back to it, and you can forget the wrongs its done to you.\n\nNow, that was before the big thing with pay to win. So, for the pay to win bit, that's almost completely ruined the game for me, as with a lot of other people, I think. What items you had to grind for before, you can just buy for real money, now. It really drains the feel from the game when you die with all your items you worked for, then just buy them again like it never happened. It really ♥♥♥♥ing sucked when you lost all your items, but it wasn't too big of a deal, you could get them, or something better, again. Well now that's kinda tossed out the window, because if you come into the game with a couple bucks you can get the highest tier weapons and stuff, so it loses the fun in it. From what I understand, the pay to win factor was brought in heavily due to some other company getting ahold of the game. Regardless of what brought it on, it was brought on, and I don't really think the game is anything compared to what it once was, due to this. It is also very grindy, grinding being basically all it is, though not in a harsh and boring way until you get into the late game, where the items are few and hard to come by. If you're lucky enough to be in the rare fight where an item drops, it'll probably just get snagged by someone else. That isn't too annoying at first, but after a few hours of fighting bosses, without them dropping loot, and when it does drop it gets taken by some low level passing by, the annoying factor sets in a bit. The game also tends to drop in its appeal after a while of doing it over and over to finally fight Oryx, who tends to kill quite a few players without them really even knowing what happened. The minions in his castle typically will take you out in a split second if you aren't paying complete attention to where they are and where you are, so unless you're higher in level or have good equipment or both, I don't advise going into the instance.\n\nSo, do I recommend Realm of the Mad God? I do recommend the game. However, I don't advise going into it looking for what it once was, because you won't find it. I think that it's still fun, though most of the fun elements were taken out of it, in my opinion.  I can't in 100% good faith advise you play it due to the pay to win factors and what not, however it IS free to play, and it isn't a very big game in terms of space, so I'd give advise you try it out. You CAN still get the items the old fashioned grindy way, but it's slow, as mentioned before, and can quickly become old. My final word on it is a yes, though I don't know how long you'll be able to stick with it, if you don't plan on going the pay to win route, as dying with high tier items with a couple guys only to see them be back with the same items while you start over is really annoying and gets old quick. If you're looking for a free to play game that's fun and is good for just letting time go by, but not wanting a game that takes up a lot of space, this is probably a good one for you. There's MUCH less people playing, however, and at a certain point the game will almost certainly die off due to this. Used to be several "rooms" with 80-82 people in it, but the last time I checked, which was a while back, there was only a couple rooms with a handful in each, and maybe one maxing at a good 60 or so. The bosses in the game are largely supposed to be dealt with via multiple people, so you can see the issue if the population dwindles too low. So at a point when the game becomes old or drops further in popularity, I think it will actually be unplayable, as the game isn't meant to be played by just a couple people. Basically what I'm saying is if you're questioning it, just give it a shot, because I don't think it'll be around forever.\n\nBut yeah, that's about all I have to say about the game. I recommend it, it's good, but has a lot of bad factors. If you're able to deal with those factors, then you'll probably enjoy the game. It's free (unless you're wanting to pay to make it easier), the community is actually pretty nice, although smallish, and it's a bit addictive. Give it a go, if you're okay with the cons. Good luck, and have fun putting holes in your wall  everytime you try to text someone, only to come back and play it the next day.","July 1, 2014","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

With so many characters and items to find you will no doubt enjoy this game. Dont trust my hours played. I have played the non steam version for at least 2000 hours. One key feature is Permadeath. Many ignorant players play the game for 10 seconds and rage quit after trying to kill medusa with a level 1 wizard. Eventually you will master the basics and move on to where the real fun starts.\nMy problems with the game is occasional lag and bugs. There has been at least two instances where the game was hacked and shutdown for many days. After the game was bought by Kabam, there has been many microtransactions, which nobody really likes these days but most of those are for convienince or easily found.\nOther that this game is amazing and worth your time if you give it a chance.\ni r8 8/8 Msellers free itmz pls!1!1!1","December 24, 2013","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/woodenrush/recommended/200210/","woodenrush","Swagardi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/woodenrush/","63 products in account","I see a lot of reviews not recommending this game because they say it's "pay to win". I don't agree with this at all. I've played this game quite a bit, not only through steam but through the website itself as well. I think the reason people believe it's pay to win is because of the starting area, where the new developer put the option, right where you spawn, to purchase very high tiered gear with coins, which can only be bought with real money. I don't think this is the best idea, because it imbalances the economy some and also encourages people who don't know what their doing to spend money on this equipment, only to lose it soon after by dying in this PERMADEATH game. That said though, this DOES NOT make the game pay to win. All of this equipment is obtainable through looting or trading with other players for other loot. There aren't many things that can ONLY be bought with real money, and these things are mostly clothing dyes, alt skins, food items to grow your pet faster then normal, and things like character slots or inventory space. Not having these things won't really detract from your experience playing this game, and it is definitely not pay to win. Maybe pay to get ahead slightly faster, but not pay to win.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can definitely recommend this game. Like I said above, I've put many hours into this game because, put simply, it is a lot of fun. It's a fast paced bullet-hell permadeath shooter mmo that also just happens to be free, and there's no risk in trying it out.","June 28, 2014","true","162.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This means that you must make a new character everytime you die.  That may sound tedious, but there is no character customization outside of the class you choose so you can quickly start playing.  This makes becoming a high level player a measure of a players ability to decide when to attack, when to retreat, and when to call your friends to gang up to get protected loot.\n\nFor those of you who play MMO's just for notoriety there are leaderboards for highest level in different time ranges.\n\nEDIT: This game is very freemium now, but you can totally play the game just fine without paying for anything.  Everything you buy is extra to what the game originally was.","February 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it definitely falls into the love it or hate it category. It is accurate to describe it as a bullet hell RPG. Some people can't get past the art style alone, but again that's something I love about it. There are 14 character classes, which gives quite a bit of variety. You can play the game absolutely free, but you can also support the game and go the easy way by doing micro transactions within the game itself for items or customization. Part of this game is dying, especially by being a little too greedy or picking a bad teleport to some random person on the map. However, the max character level is 20 and it is easy to get back up there from level 1 in an hour. There are different levels of items and each class has its own special ability item as well. There are also pets that you can find or buy to give you in game bonuses. I don't like all the changes they've made since I first started playing it, but I still love the game. It's a rare game that you can have a lot of fun with by yourself or with a group of friends or even with random strangers.","August 30, 2013","true","173.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/secrets12/recommended/200210/","secrets12","A FairTrade Consumer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/secrets12/","36 products in account","RotMG is a very unique MMO. It manages to combine teamwork, bullet hell, and dungeon crawling in one neat package. Hope right in and watch as you quickly level up and gain power, then suddenly be killed and lose it all, then hop in again and get it all back! Server strain is a big issue, but as long as they aren't full you should be able to manage. Maxing out your class of choice is quite a challenge, and should keep you entertained for quite a while. The aforemented Mad God is also quite satisfying when you do get to attack it. The hilarity of watching a whole server scramble through his punishing dungeon is very memorable indeed.\n\nIf I had to say what this games biggest flaw is, it would be the turn towards pay-2-win it has taken. This unfortuantely was not always a problem; realm gold (the game's premium currency) used to just be good for buying cosmetic dyes and pets, or extra storage space. Now, with all sorts of high-tier gear being offered for it, the game feels more hollow and less rewarding. The adventure is still there, but it seems redundant when you can bypass it with the wave of a credit card. This is what personally keeps me from getting back into the game (along with technical difficulties with connecting to my Kongregate account), but if you're fine with it, don't let me stop you! It's still a wonderful game, and i'd recommend at least giving it a shot. It's free, after all; what have you got to lose?","July 6, 2013","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even though you WILL die, and lose high-level stuff quite frequently, (this game has perma-death) it still has an addictiveness to it, that keeps us all coming back for more punishment. It's deceptively simple gameplay, enables a quick learning curve, while retaining difficulty, and replayability. After reaching a high level with one class, and farming the "godlands" for high-tier items, and stat potions, unlocking new classes to play as, that can use said items becomes the desired goal. The trading system in the game is also very addictive, and higher level players tend to give away high-tier items quite often. I've played over 80 hours, between my different accounts, and it's still quite enjoyable to me. That, couipled with the fact that it's free, makes this game a must-try for everyone.\n\n\n"MY MINIONS HAVE FAILED ME! BUT NOW YOU SHALL FEEL MY WRATH!

The unique gameplay and artstyle/character design is what truly holds this game together, otherwise the advertising spamming, insane micro-transactions, and on-and-off lag would ruin it all. So as you've probably figured out, this is a top down shooter, which as far as I know is pretty unique for a fantasy MMO. This game is quite challenging, it is a permadeath type game so if you die you must pick a new character and start completely over, on the other hand it isn't terribly challenging as long as you play it smart, there is also a hotkey command to bring you back to the safezone. The Perma-death can really turn you off, especially if you have good items and was close to reaching level 20, reaching level 20 will unlock a new character class or two, which is pretty much what keeps you playing. This game also has a massive amount of enemies for you to fight, many with different abilties, which is also what makes this game unique. I'd recommend everyone at least try this game, you may hate it, you may like it, and let me just say I don't play this excessively, its just something fun to play here and there. also its a very tiny download and takes a few seconds, its worth a try.","September 3, 2014","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That alone makes this one worth playing once (or if you're like me, for hours).  I've never played anything quite like this title and I doubt you have either.  It has simple MMORPG style character customization, fast and frantic arcade style shooting, and perma-death.  That's right, this is an MMO with perma-death.  And yes, you WILL die (many, many, many times.  I suggest you get used to the idea).  Death is a part of this game and should be expected.  Gear is largely transient(but still important in it's own right), and not hugely important as gear is trumped by skill.  What's this you ask?  An MMORPG where skill trumps gear?  Quite welcome if I do say so myself.  The game also has a very elegant solution to make 85 strangers want to play with one another.  This title is one of the few I've ever played that offers TRUE coop, that works, and works very well with each player rewarded equally.  The cash system is also ACTUALLY completely optional.","February 29, 2012","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Early in it can be exciting to see what new gear you can find and how high level you can climp to. Once you realize that the max level is only 20 you begin to look for the best equipment you can get without dieing and having to start over. It can take some time to get to a point where you are skilled enough to begin farming the god lands. This is where you would find the first stat increasing potions that you use to max out your characters stats in order to become strong enough to do the dungeons to get the best gear in the game. Once you are at the point where you are all maxed up and ready to take on the bigger challenges, it can be pretty hard to actually find some of the items you want. the best items in the game are soulbound, so you can't trade for them or buy them, they muct be found. on a 1/200 drop rate for some of these items it can become tedious farming the same dungeon over and over looking for it.

I love the "you only live once" style games, and the fact that this is an MMO makes it all the more epic!  Can you beat the boss and laugh as the noobs around you die?  Or will you join their pile of corpses?  Haha fear not, you can save most valuable items in your "vault" and those items carry over from character to character.  Once you become hardcore though, you will invest heavily into the stat lines of your main characters maxing out their stats so they are tougher, and fight a lot better.","March 9, 2014","true","98.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's also really fast paced and there is always a miniboss or hordes of monsters to kill in any instance of the world you hop into. It's also really nice to store some of the higher leveled items for your future characters to then use. The different dungeons are also really good and the monsters that go along with the Dungeons are very well suited to the dungeons as well, (I especially like the Forest Dungeon as it has concealed pathways for you to find).\n\nThe only problem with the game is not with the game itself, but if you have a bad line for your internet or if the internet has been severly slowed. The problem is that most monsters will stand still and then lurch forward in the direction they were heading, creating very juttery gameplay. This makes it very hard to fight multiple monsters at once or maybe a miniboss. The other thing is that the areas you explore will not load fast enough and so you will be stuck waiting at the edges for the areas to load.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game to kill some time if you don't have terrible internet speed/connection.","April 9, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Eventually you will master the basics and move on to where the real fun starts.\nMy problems with the game is occasional lag and bugs. There has been at least two instances where the game was hacked and shutdown for many days.

It manages to combine teamwork, bullet hell, and dungeon crawling in one neat package. Hope right in and watch as you quickly level up and gain power, then suddenly be killed and lose it all, then hop in again and get it all back! Server strain is a big issue, but as long as they aren't full you should be able to manage. Maxing out your class of choice is quite a challenge, and should keep you entertained for quite a while. The aforemented Mad God is also quite satisfying when you do get to attack it. The hilarity of watching a whole server scramble through his punishing dungeon is very memorable indeed.\n\nIf I had to say what this games biggest flaw is, it would be the turn towards pay-2-win it has taken. This unfortuantely was not always a problem; realm gold (the game's premium currency) used to just be good for buying cosmetic dyes and pets, or extra storage space. Now, with all sorts of high-tier gear being offered for it, the game feels more hollow and less rewarding. The adventure is still there, but it seems redundant when you can bypass it with the wave of a credit card. This is what personally keeps me from getting back into the game (along with technical difficulties with connecting to my Kongregate account), but if you're fine with it, don't let me stop you! It's still a wonderful game, and i'd recommend at least giving it a shot.

If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.\n\nRealm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.\n\nWith all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  It is simple yet elegant in design.  Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell.  Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal.  There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.\n\nThe combat is point-and-click.  You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ.  There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.\n\nYou start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time.  Then the game really begins.  The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point.  The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability.  The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events.  There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.\n\nEquipment can be found everywhere.  From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength.  Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment.  Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.\n\nOnce certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's up to you.\n\nWhen you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal.  +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet.  It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website realmofthemadgod.com (not on steam), to see if you like the game.  If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account.  Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game.  You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots.  They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you).  Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.\n\nI play this game almost exclusively(through the website).  It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush.  I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone.  Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.","June 24, 2014","true","76.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't go in expecting a lot of opportunities for interaction or anything other than the most basic features of an MMORPG. Slightly disappointing because the general concept was such a great idea, but hopefully they'll be adding new content in the future. In the meantime, it's just fun enough to warrant giving it a try, plus it's free with a cash shop that doesn't ruin the game.","February 21, 2012","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can either sit back and farm, or dive head-in and do quests leading up to higher levels. You can play with friends or alone, though it's a lot more fun with friends. I absolutely love the graphic styling, and the unique minions and bosses. I really enjoy killing miniosn to open Portals. It's actually a pretty good idea. The higher level enemies you kill, the higher level the enemies in the portal will be. And the fact that it's free to play really helped me be able to give this game a 10/10, along with very few other games.","May 26, 2014","true","69.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it is kind of pay2win since people with a lot of money can just buy realm gold and other stuff. It also sucks that you can't trade almost all the UT items. I'm 13 now; stopped playing this game on Kongregate when I was 9 and came back to try it. So many things have changed and I'm not even sure whether it was for the better or worse. If you like a game that is kind of pay2win but still fun and can put up with that, this is your game.","January 7, 2015","false","229.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
