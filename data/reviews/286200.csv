Not complicated in any way, very simple and easy to get the hang of, but it's honestly nothing special. Now on to the actual gameplay!\n\nLike I said, the game is a match three game, so the main gameplay is just swiping so you get a line of three or more, but where it is a little different is the mechanic of the battles. On one side is you, which is a building filled with your gems/runes that you need to match three in order to use as an attack. On the other side is where the enemies will slowly encroach upon your castle, and it's your job to match those gems, be it horizontal or vertical to fire a spell at the enemy. You'll slowly whittle the enemy down with your matching abilities and the battle will be over and you'll be sent back to your village.\n\nThe combat isn't overly-complicated, and you will be getting extra abilities that you can unlock to help you along the way, but it's all simply "okay." And that's how I'd describe this game in a nutshell. It's merely okay. I'm not the biggest fan of the graphics style, but I can live with that. The combat is fairly simple, but it's nothing spectacular, and the whole village gimmick kind of makes you feel like you're playing a FaceBook game as you have to wait for your buildings to give you the resources you want. If you want to sit and wait and just watch that timer slowly tick down so you can get that extra little bit of ore, then you can, but I can't admit being the biggest fan of having to wait on real time to get something a little extra in a game.\n\nI don't hate the game, but at the same time I can't say I like it either. Which is why I'm not going to be recommending it, because an "okay" game does not make it necessarily a good one.","October 15, 2014","false","2.5"," 90 of 106 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","90","106","0","3"

Basically you build and upgrade a village to provide power-ups for the Match 3 combat game.  Then you use the money from the Match 3 game to purchase upgrades for your town.\n\nOccassionally you'll get popups in town about a random event and you have a multiple choice decision you can make. Depending on your choice you may unlock other power-ups.\n\nSeveral of your buildings are for gathering resources - ore and wood that you use to build and upgrade structures. A farm to feed your people. A blacksmith to research new weapons and an armory to store them in.  You use the weapons as power-ups in the match 3 game.\n\nYou can build and upgrade an Academy for spells to use in the match 3 game, A City Hall to hire workers for your buildings or as power-ups such as an Archer or Boulder tosser to fight off the encroaching enemy. And finally a Grainery to bring in more settlers.\n\nCombat is a road map of towers on the continent. Once you win a match 3 game in one, you can advance to the next tower or redo a battle at a solved one to grind money.\n\nIn the combat sequence you have enemy forces coming at you randomly in rows. As you make matches in the match 4 game it sends out energy beams from the matched gems out into the enemy ranks of those rows. You can also use your archer/boulder tossers/loot gatherers/healers as power-ups to help defend the walls or keep your troops healed.\n\nAs you defeat enemies, they may drop piles of money that you can click on as you're  making your matches.\n\nAll in all it's an interesting twist to your standard Match 3 game. All the standard Match 3 obstacles are there - as are the power-ups. Just that now they have to be researched from your village before use, and some unique power-ups like archers and such running around shooting the approaching waves of enemies as you make matches to send out energy beams to blast them away from your ramparts.\n\nOther than that nothing terribly unique from any other Match 3 game - just its presentation.","April 16, 2014","true","3.9"," 51 of 66 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","51","66","0","0"

There is a wide variety of enemies, most of which shamble slowly towards your tower, giving you plenty of time to pick them off. Levels offer a great deal of variety, whether in the set-up of the board itself, 'corruption' that affects your runes, and other maladies that you can either hire citizens to deal with or just power through. Boss battles give you a chance to fight somebody that fires back.\n\nThe game also allows you to research spells and craft items to assist you in game, and hire the aforementioned specialized citizens to roam your tower walls and assist.\n\nIf that sounds like a lot to pick through, well, it is. Reignmaker has an overabundance of options, but the learning curve (at least on Easy or Normal) allows you plenty of time to pick out your own strategy, whether that's deploying spells as a mage, throwing bombs and blockades in your enemies' paths, or hiring a big guy to smash everybody with rocks.\n\nAs competently done as the individual battles are, they were actually the part of the game I found myself enjoying the least. On top of everything else, Reignmaker has a city/resource management side to it, where you can turn your little village into a true city. This is the hub of everything else in the game, where you upgrade buildings and research spells and items to assist you in battles. Watching the city 'grow up', and the citizens going about their day within it, is quite satisfying.\n\nLikely the best part about this game, though, is the ability to set 'policies'. After each new level you beat, you can travel back to your city and set a new policy that the populace is up in arms about. Some of them gain extra resources, some will create aesthetic changes to the city, and some of them are just for flavor, but ReignMaker's excellent sense of humor shines through here, and it's definitely something to look forward to.\n\nGraphics are bright and colorful, though nothing really stands apart from the pack here. The design of the three main city types you have to choose for are brightly distinct from one another, but while there are minor differences in city attributes, the base gameplay is still the same. It has a soundtrack. Creatures have their own unique grunts of pain and death rattles, and some of the citizens have spoken (or mumbled) lines. The music itself is about what you'd expect from a game like this, pure background. It exists, nothing really more can be said.\n\nAchievement hunters can rejoice as well, and maybe get a little glassy-eyed when they first load up the game. Reignmaker is heavily geared towards getting a whole slew of achievements right off the bat- I got 40 in one day, and didn't even play for that long. Later achievements can get quite grindy.\n\nOverall, Reignmaker offers a great deal of variety, and encourages unique strategies. If you're a fan of match-3 type games looking for something a little different, definitely give this one a try.","August 2, 2014","true","133.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","1"

What is more, that is an unnecessary lie. Yeah this game has some building in it, but it is even more shallow than Facebook games like "Hayday". Yes, this game has some policy options which does not effect gameplay in any meaningful way. These two things are not main part of the game, they are just spices to make player sure that he actually is not playing some kind of "Candy Crush".\n\nThat is also a lie. This game heavily resembles Candy Crush. Actually, if I were to sum it up, "Candy Crush with tower defense elements." That is not as bad as it sounds, since we all know about addictiveness of candy crush. Gameplay mechanics are rather solid, most of the weapons and skills has their own uses. Policy options are just there for the sake of feeling like a king, not a 3-matcher. Soldiers have their own uses as well, but Scouts (the elite ones) maybe a bit unbalanced since they are the obvious choose for almost all missions.\n\nI got this game from Humble Bundle, which also includes Paranautical Activity, Stacking and Windforge. The funny part is I got that bundle for Stacking. But this was the game I played most among those. Why? It is addicting. It gives sense of success. But if u despise mechanics of Candy Crush, you wont like this game. This is guaranteed, It has more complex mechanics when it comes to battles, but the main part is the same.\n\nI have two more complaints. One: Resource system is a bit unbalanced. You earn money by waiting, you can earn some infinitesimal money in battle as well, which has no practical uses. Every thing needs wood. Almost nothing needs ore. And you wont need food after you upgraded your town center to level 5. Yes, it should not be more complex than this since this is basically a match 3 game but if these mechanics exist I would want it to be more gamey.\n\nSecond. After all this time, (and this is actually the second game first being Tower of Elements) there are still some gamebreaking bugs. If you use some spells which alters the gameboard too much (like Landslide, Tornado etc), and dont wait it to be completed, some cells includes two different colors which is practically impossible to complete the chapter after that. If you wait after using those spells no bug is there, I guess if there is a restriction on using heavy skills one after other, the way it is restricted should not be via a bug.\n\nBut still. If you find this game cheap. Real cheap. Under 4 dollars even, I would recommend it if you like such casual games. Since it got me hooked, and I actually finished it with most of achievements unlocked, I feel obliged to recommend it. By the way, this game will be fun for achievement hunters as well since it has well defined goals. Just dont be deceived by claims of the game about being a political simulator, true successor of Sim City 3000 etc, and if you cant find a good deal, go online and search for similar games for free.","January 2, 2015","true","21.5"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","0"

Things get hectic during the match 3 based battles, and an added layer of spells, items and supporting troops with specific abilities makes it a much deeper experience. The varying board layouts and boss battles up the challenge, even for a match 3 veteran, and that's just at the Normal difficulty.\n\nThe citybuilding and RPG side are light, but a good way to break up the battles and give you options on what to unlock and upgrade. The endless tower mode keeps things going past the story and allow you to continue upgrading your city and unlock the top level spells and items.\n\nFrogDice has really upped their game with this one, and support their products well post-release. I was a Kickstarter backer on this and played quite a lot during the beta phase, so I have a bunch more hours in this game than Steam reports.","April 17, 2014","true","50.5"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","29","39","0","1"

Everyone needs a little casual in their life, right? ReignMaker is a fantastic choice if you're looking to scratch that itch.\n\nTo start, the game has some light city-building mechanics from the start. Pick a city with a passive bonus and then use resources such as wood, ore, money, population, money, and food to build and upgrade buildings that provide magic, weapons, defensive units, and extra resources to help build up your city.\n\nOnce you go into battle, you can use up to two additional troops you have trained to help fight. For example, you can use an archer and a stonethrower to help deal damage while you take care of the rest. Every battle has rows of enemies coming down the line (think Plants vs Zombies). It is up to you to match different elements to deal damage to those enemies before they deal damage to your tower. Every so often quests will pop up such as "Match 3 fire elements" that will reward additional resources. You can also use magic and items that have been researched/purchased to help get the upper hand. You will want to ensure you use EVERYTHING at your disposal. While the game starts out very easy, the boards become more complex and new mechanics get thrown in such as corrupted elements that will make it so nothing it cast once the match is made.\n\nPost battle you are presented with an event that occurred while you were at battle. These events allow you to choose a policy or a method for dealing with the particular issue at hand. While some policies have an immediate effect, others have a small or a slow growing effect that become more apparent the longer you play. So far it has served as an interesting piece of storytelling and each policy is complete with an outcome once you make a choice so you are never left with a feeling of "so what?" Some events have be humorous, and others have been tales of love lost and found (and some deal with poop because who doesn't like some good ol' fashioned toilet humor?). There is a definite variety to the policy portion of the game.\n\nRounding all of this out is a thorough Bestiary (as FrogDice games are known for) that lets you see your foes up close and personal and a pretty decent soundtrack. The voice acting isn't anything to write home about but it serves the purpose. The graphics are, again, nothing to clamor over but they are charming and the purpose is served. This is a game that is all about the gameplay and it certainly delivers in full.\n\nIf you're familiar with other FrogDice games and have enjoyed them, you can expect more of what makes a FrogDice game worth playing in ReignMaker. If you are unfamiliar with FrogDice games but enjoy a good Match 3 game, definitely pick this one up. There is a level of depth in this one that I haven't seen in a Match 3 in some time. Icing on the cake: you can sit back in your chair and just play with the mouse; no need for the keyboard (other than to put in the name of your city in the beginning). Doesn't get much better than that.","April 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","1"

The castle defense aproach, with launching spells through the air was a nice take on the genre, and the boss battles were a bit challenging.\n\nThe town building portion of the game was somewhat interesting, though I admit I didn't get too far into it to say how interesting it ultimately gets.\n\nThe policy decisions was a nice touch, and tbh I found that the most well thought out aspect of the game.\n\nAgain, if you see this game in one of the sales for a few dollars and you like match 3 games, go for it, but anything more than that seems over priced considering you can get a similar quality or significantly better game on mobile for free or a few dollars, max.","October 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"

I was playing years ago similar browser game, there you had your character and monsters - every match was causing your character move with his sword or magic, this is really nice kind of game, which I enjoyed like nothing else. Here's additionally a city which you administrate, making it bigger, inventing new spells or special attacks, gathering resources, I have to say it's pretty well thought. But it was lasting only first ~34 hours (when I played half year ago), after that "long" time, the game is getting repeatable, so it's rather not a game which you want to replay more than twice.\n\nI'm achievement hunter, since I started it, I can't imagine a situation where I won't finish it with 100% achievements done. There are a lot of nice achievements, but most of them are unlocking randomly just while playing, it's not bad... till the game forces you to play more than you would actually enjoy... some of achievements require unbelievable big amount of actions to be done... (like making 100k moves, killing 1k monsters of every kind or replaying game at least 4 freaking times! - for different politics chosen). It's not something to enjoy, after some time it's just getting repeatable and it's pain to do.\n\nI finished already this game 7th times + infinite tower (not whole but 30levels), just because I made a mistake in politics and achievements didn't pop up... twice. If there would be "Mixed" review I would definitely use it, but since there's nothing like that, I'm RECOMMENDING this game as not everyone is achievement hunter, it was still great to play once or twice.","March 3","true","92.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The lite citybuilding is fun, and I like seeing how my citizens are going to look different after I make several policy decisions for the city.

You make matches to "shoot" a variety of ranged attacks on approaching enemies.

You manage a town with automated resource gathering (a nice feature!), spending those resources on building upgrades, hiring NPCs, spell and weapon research, weapon inventory, and town population growth.

At the point the levels finally offered some real challenge, upgrading the town and dealing with the seemingly pointless decision making started to get annoying. There isn't enough stuff going on in the village to justify the fact that it's a pretty big part of the game. The village mechanics are very basic and the graphics are unappealing. It takes time for the derpy villagers to gather resources and research spells, and the only way to pass that time is to replay old levels again and again until I finally get the upgrade I need.\n\nMaybe I'm just impatient, I don't know. Life is short.\n\nSo yeah, the game's mildly amusing, but the village business slows things down. Just my two cents, though.  ReignMaker seems popular enough, so do give it a try if you can get it for a couple of dollars. (I personally don't think it's worth more than that.)\n\nEDIT: The resource system is definitely unbalanced. You can hoard all the money you want, but there's not enough wood. No matter how many lumberjacks you have roaming about your village, there's simply not enough wood. I would get that if this was a micropayment game, but there's no option to buy resources to speed things up.","October 10, 2014","false","20.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The point is, I've seen it all.  Aside from the things I have not seen, of course.  So what does ReignMaker bring to the table, that makes it good, or even gooder?  Well.\nThere is the match three, of course, which is a very clear cut genre, but yoiu see, it is also a tower defense, as your matched blocks create magical bolts that fire upon the waves of attacking, um, evil things.  You can also learn spells that bolster your ability to blast molten death upon the deserving heads of the aforementioned evil things.\nIn between bouts of match three tower defense, you can return to your village, where you as mayor, or whatever, get to improve buildings, hire workers, research items and spells, and even respond to situations by creating government policies, which can sometimes give bonus items, or cause new items to appear in your town.\nOverall, I find enough variety in ReignMaker to keep things fresh, and the only complaint I have is that lumber production is so slow it can actually slow your progress, as lumber is needed for anything you want to build.  That is fairly minor though, and the developers are actually responding to people on the forums, which is pretty amazing in this day and age where so many games are in early access, or simply released and abandoned, or abandoned in early access.\nAnyway, good game, check it out.

It's primarily a match-three game (Bejewelled etc), with the secondary game being destroying monsters that are advancing towards your grid. Each rune (jewel/fruit/whatever) you destroy by matching shoots out a bolt towards the monsters, so you [sometimes] have to focus on matching runes that are on the same line as the closest monsters.\n\nI was a bit surprised when things falling into a line of 5 does not have the special effect you get when moving things into a line of 5, but I think it's a good design decision, it makes the bonus effects more skill-based.\n\nThere's also a 'town' section for buying additional powers and tools, which further adds to the depth of the game. Unfortunately it takes a small leaf from 'social' games in having resources which build up over time in addition to resources you earn. Both kinds are needed, which means if you play the game through to the end in a few sessions you won't have accumulated enough resources to try out even half of the upgrades.\n\nMissed opportunity; a boss battle in which you have to shoot the boss with particular types of runes would have been nice. I'd say wrong runes healing him 1/4 as much as the correct rune does damage, so that shooting wrongly is harmful, and the boss changing 'shield' color to the color you must hit with a second after each hit would have been a nice more-skilled touch. (Instead most of the boss battles were just "match threes as fast as you can, near the boss row, and it'll probably work out".) There was a boss that changed shield color and seemed to deflect shots sometimes, but it wasn't clear what the color meant and just shooting *more* shots protected you against the deflected shots so you didn't really need to figure it out.","July 12, 2014","true","9.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You go to battle to get the currency resource, and the battles consist of the match-3 game inside of a tower, with baddies moving to attack your tower from one side, Plants vs Zombies style. As you make matches, bolts fly out to hit the incoming mobs, and bigger matches obviously deal bigger damage. Chaining combos together never had so much meaning in a match 3 game.\n\nTown upgrades allow you to bring clickable weapons, spells, and a couple of soldiers (of all types, from healers, to scouts who run out and grab coins, to archers etc) to battle.\n\nSo, battle helps you build the town, and upgrading the town helps you battle. In town you choose what buildings to upgrade first, what spells and weapons to research, who to hire and so forth. Often when you win a few new battles, you will return to the town and have to make a Decision. These are mayoral type decisions that are often the lesser of two evils, or some other difficult decision, but generally, the answers aren't at all punishing and simply offer one buff or another. The writeups are really fun and playful.\nThe townies are 'cute' and often catch you off guard by saying things you didnt expect. "I, FOR ONE, WELCOME OUR NEW OVERLORDS"   --freakin best Simpsons quote ever! Yeah I caught that! Sorry for the spoiler. moving on..\n\nSome of the battles are quite challenging, and you will find yourself trying different tactics and mixes of spells, weapons and units to overcome a boss. Or the "O" shaped towers. Those are the worst.\n\nOften I'll just launch and jump into a normal battle, and there I am, simply playing match 3, but at the same time I'm building up my resources and stuff.\n\n\nIf I recall correctly at the time I write this, it's a "drag the window to resize it to anything" game, so it's super easy to play in a window, which is nice if you're a multitasker like me.\n\nThere's over 100 achievements, a monster database, and other odds and ends to collect & achieve.\n\n\n\nOn a side note, the only negative I can think of is Lumber seems to be the bottleneck for resources. This is a game where some resources continue to build even when the game is closed, so many times I've launched the game just to gather the lumber even when I don't plan on playing.\nSo, the only negative I can think of is easily worked around through the natural mechanics of the game.\n\nSeriously, if you play ANY match-3 game, I can't see why this wouldn't be at the TOP of your list.

You can research spells and items, recruit Citizens that help not only in combat, but improve your resource gathering and research speeds too.\n\nYou can recruit Citizens from the town and take them into the Match-3/Defense puzzle. Each Citizen has different abilities. There are 5 types of Offensive/Battle Citizens in total, and each has 2 tiers, making 10 in total, which you unlock by upgrading the Town Hall. For example, a Tier 1 Scout will run out into the field and pick up gold and scrolls that enemies drop when killed, but a Tier 2 Scout will not only run out and collect more frequently, but leave a bomb which explodes in a few seconds, damaging/killing enemies nearby.\n\nYou can also craft items that can be used in battle. To craft them you not only need to research them in the Armory, but have the resources too. A Dagger and Sword can be used directly on enemies to damage them to varying degrees. You can drop explosive pills on groups of enemies to kill them  all. You can drop barricades, training dummies, and oil to slow down enemies, and quite a few more.\n\nAnd finally, you can research spells at the Academy and use them in battle. The effects range from destroying sections of the game board, which launches the elements at the enemies, or perhaps rearranging the board completely. There's quite a few more. You don't need resources to research or 'craft' the spells, they only need money and a bit(a lot) of time to unlock initially. Oh, and the Academy itself needs to be upgraded in order to research the various tiers of spells. So the Academy needs to be level 3 in order to research tier 3 spells. Once researched, you can cast it as many times as you want, with a cooldown of course. By cooldown, I mean '40 Matches' or '80 Matches'. And thats matches as in 'matching gems', not entire games. Matches made when gems are cascading count too.\n\nWhen you actually go into battle, you're allowed to equip a loadout that can be changed at anytime outside of battle. You can equip 6 Spells, 6 Items, and 2 Citizens. Citizens and Items are depleted when used, so you need to craft/recruit them before running out. Spells aren't depleted, but you need to wait for the cooldown. All items and spells are hotkeyed to 'QWERTY' and '123456' for easy access, the Citizens are hotkeyed to '09'. All hotkeys can be changed.\n\nThe 'Conquest Map' is where you choose your battles. On the map there are areas, each with 4 towers initially, and when you beat those, a boss battle tower is shown. Once the boss is defeated, a new area is unlocked.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Match-3 games and/or puzzle quest.","July 12, 2014","true","10.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

When you make matches, bolts of magic fly out from that row towards the oncomming enemies.  There isn't really any "pathing".  Enemies simply advance toward your city and start attacking your walls until you lose or you beat them.  You can also "build a city" that simply exists for you to unlock items, spells, and heroes to use later on.  The one downside is that you do not know how many waves of enemies remain, so it can get frustrating at times to plan out how you'll make some of your matches.\n\nThere are a LOT of acheivmements in the game, but you get many of them simply by playing.  They are more about you playing like you normally would and you'll just magically get them.  There are probably only a few that take a little bit of planning.\n\nDuring each round, you can get special missions that when completed give you a few resources.  In the end, they are often not worth the effort because you may end up losing resources when you are required to use an item.\n\nSome of the boards are very difficult to play since you have a narrow opening in which to make matches, making you rely on spells.  Spells are recharged by making matches, but don't cost any resources, at least.\n\nOverall, the game is fun and combines multiple game generes pretty well.

Here you train units to help you in your battles, create equipment and research spells. And you produce the resources with which to do all that. But more than that, you make decisions that will make the town feel unique: whenever you beat a new level, a policy decission will be presented to you, asking you to guide your town. How do you handle crop failure? Do you let that reknown berserker settle in your town? What do you say about theatrical plays that corrupt our youth?\nAll these decission will affect your town one way or another. You may get a free scholar to help your reseach.

Lots of little goals plus achievements is a great bonus. It is similar bto the Puzzle Quest series, and fans of that series should  pick this up. It it really simple but the battles can get pretty complex. It seems to have been built for a touchscreen and not a mouse though. Its overpriced at $14.99, $4.99-$9.99 seems much more reasonable. Overall though, its fun if you like puzzle/RPGs.\n\n\nWhen I first saw this released, I ignored it. It looked like a casual puzzle game that was a mobile port. And it was pricy for that style of game. Then I saw a friends review who liked it. I've been really hard up for ANY games lately due to the deluge of mobile crap, so I grabbed it. Yes, I know, counter intuitive. But hey, I can't hate on something Ive never experienced.\n\nNormally I'm not a fan of puzzle games, but I did love and play the hell out of the Puzzle Quests (the first one was better than the second and Galactrix IMHO, but all are good), and also liked Puzzle Chronicles. All of those had some sort of strange addictive quality, even though without the RPG component, puzzle games are boring as hell and pointless in my eyes.  So I grabbed ReignMaker.\n\nFor starters, the graphics are appropriate. They are bright, colorful, and cartoony 3d images. It lends the game a good feel that fits well with the game style. The music is cheerful and the sound is decent, although the doo-do-DO-DOO (the typical "charge" horn noise) that starts a battle is annoying as hell.\n\nOther than that, I laughed at the *very* badly narrated intro that starts the game. The images are cool, a stained glass style picture scrolling by and explaining the backstory. But the voice..oh god. It sounds like a wanna-be old man with a bad head cold attempting to do the stereotypical "fantasy world king" accent. And failing. I had trouble understanding some of what he was saying, and it sucked cuz there was no subtitles.\n\nSo the gameplay. Its like an *extremely* light city builder/resource manager, mixed with a match 3 puzzle that is also a tower defense game. The city builder is simple. There are places you can buy using resources and the places help you. Theres also policies, which are little events. You have 4 different choices of how to deal with the event, and the results of the choice affect your city. I have havent really explored too much of the city building aspect yet, so I will update when I do.\n\nUPDATE: Its really simple. Half the buildings generate timed resources, the other half researches itemss. You can upgrade the buildings to get better battle items, spells, and troops. I hesitate to even call it a builder. More of a resource manager.\n\nThe other aspect of the game is decently fun. Its the battle. You start, and you can earn items from buildings in your city that help you. There are many of them all with different effects.\n\nSo its a tower defense meets match 3. On the left is your tower, filled with different elemental shapes and other icons that you match. Walking in from the right are enemies, many different types. They dont move up and down, but travel in a straight line towards your tower (at least at the stages im at now, dont know if they do later). When you match 3, a bolt of the associated element spits out of your tower and travels right, hitting any enemies in its path. Thing is, the bolt travels in the row you matched it in. So if theres an enemy in the 2nd row down matching an element in the 3rd 4th and 5th row down wouldnt hit it because the elemental bolts would be flying in the 3rd 4th and 5th row. There are also many other icons, both helpful and harmful/annoying. You can collect "scrolls". Each scroll creates an entry in a book where you can see the stats of each enemy and a brief description and images.\n\nIn addition there are little challenges you can do to gain resources, such as "match 4 fire elements" "use a heal icon" ect. All of this plus a ton of achievements and other little things makes this overall a fun lgame.\n\nIts a little pricy for 14.99, but any fan of the puzzle quest type match 3s will love it. Get it on mobile if it exists there (Not sure, but judging by it it sure seems to be),","May 20, 2014","true","7.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Sadly, upon playing the game, I was quickly disappointed.\n\nThe city building aspect is lacklustre and feels more suited to a Facebook game, with only a few buildings available, no choice over which ones to build or where they are placed, and wait times to harvest the resources they produce.\n\nThe policy decisions don't feel like they have any lasting effect though I'm still at a fairly early point in the game so I could be wrong about this part.\n\nThe match-3 gameplay itself is quite fun, each match you make sends out energy bolts to attack the waves of enemies coming at your tower from the other side of the screen. You can also use the resources gathered in the town and money earned in battles to purchase spells, units and weapons to assist in destroying the enemies\n\nUnfortunatley the difficulty level increases quite suddenly from stupidly easy to frustratingly hard, usually resulting in needing to replay completed levels repeatedly to grind enough money to purchase units, upgrade the town, etc..., which gets old fairly quickly.\n\nIf you find this in a bundle, or on deep sale, then it's not a bad little game to waste an hour or so on every now and then but I really can't recommend it at the current price point.\n\n\n","August 2, 2014","false","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The mechanics here are simple and basic though, so don't expect this to be a city simulator like SimCity. The Match 3 puzzles are mixed with a Tower Defense mechanic - It basically destroys the monsters in the lane you create a match.

The meat of the game is in the battles, where you play match-3 on one side of the screen while monsters attack on the other. The matching is pretty straightforward (you get some spells you can cast to shuffle or destroy tiles, you get bonuses for matching 4 or more at once, there are locked and frozen tiles, etc) but the combat side is pretty interesting - at first I just ignored it and focused on making matches at the bottom of the screen so that matches on top would happen automatically, but it's actually worth paying attention to where monsters are and trying to line up matches in the right place, especially against later bosses when you need to keep them stunned to avoid being hurt. Also, items can be used on the battlefield side to deal with monsters, and they drop a lot of loot and collectable scrolls that are worth getting.\nThe town part of the game has good parts and bad parts. Resource production happens in real time, so you can just leave the game running and make as much ore and wood as you need (though money only comes from battles). This is where windowed mode would have been nice. After every new level you beat, your town faces a new dilemma you have to choose the outcome of. The dilemmas are well written but don't seem to have any actual gameplay consequences.\nSteam says I've played 4 hours, and I've beat almost half the levels, so I'd guess the total playtime will be 10 hours for one play-through. There are different towns you can play as but they have only minor differences so replaying with a different town wouldn't be too different of an experience.\n\nUpdate: Frogdice thoughtfully contacted me and corrected some screw-ups I made. The big one is that there IS a windowed mode, it's the last option on the options screen, and I managed to completely miss it. Another one is length: I've now done 34 levels (out of 50) with 8 hours played, so the game could end up being around 15 hours in one play through, not just 10. There's also an infinite tower after beating the game, but I can't speak to that.","April 23, 2014","true","38.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

Overall, this game is a mediocre time waster that falls way short of its promises. I'm going to copy/paste the first line of its Steam store page: "ReignMaker is a city building political strategy game with match-3 tower defense combat." Calling this game  a city builder, a political strategy game, or a tower defense game is a serious insult to those genres, and this is coming from someone who enjoys those types of games.\n\nYou technically build a city, yes, but the "city building" is little more than waiting to collect resources and upgrading buildings. The only choice you make is what order you build things in. There's no real planning, no infrastructure building, and really, nothing interesting at all about this city building parts. They only serve as a vessel to get you upgrades, and are absolutely no fun on their own. Also, resource collection is really annoying. I never had nearly enough lumber, so I had to wait for hours, checking in every 30 minutes to harvest. Another annoyance is the gold, which appears on the ground as you fight. It spawns so frequently that it's a huge distraction from the puzzle, and you won't get nearly enough if you don't pick it up. Scouts are a necessity if you want to progress since they take that element out, but that's one fewer person you can take into tough levels.\n\nThere is technically political strategy, yes, but it amounts to a series of questions, one per level, that almost never have any consequences at all. When there are, they're minor at best. It has all the depth of an Internet quiz. After making choices, you can find out your city's "culture", which matters none at all, really.\n\nWhen it says it's a "tower defense" game, though, that's completely misleading. In a tower defense game, you place towers strategically to impede and attack units that are trying to get through, and that's not what this game has. In this game, you defend towers with match-3 combat.\n\nNow, for the match-3 elements. The core match-3 gameplay is present in this game, and it does provide some challenge. The spells and the people you hire are interesting additions that shake things up. This game suffers from poor design decisions overall, though. The difficulty curve is a mess, with a huge spike at level 10 before varying wildly between really easy and very difficult. The boss battles are mostly luck; you have to attack very rapidly with matches and spells and hope that you get enough combos to win before your opponent murders you (even worse, you can defeat the boss but still lose the match and be forced to replay). Also, some of the levels are excessively long, which really sucks when you run out steam and lose 20 minutes in to a level.\n\nThis isn't the worst game I've played, not by a long shot. I still played this game to the end, probably just because the match-3 combat was enough to hold my interest for a while. This game is really heavily flawed, though, and it spectacularly fails to deliver on its promises. Sadly, this game is little more than a time waster, which isn't good enough for me. It looks like this game is still being worked on, however, so hopefully some things can be ironed out, but it will never be a "city building political strategy game" with "tower defense combat". Ultimately, this game is just a second-rate Puzzle Quest. This game's a joke at $15. I think I can only recommend this game if you can find it for $2 or less.","July 21, 2014","false","64.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The town management aspect is simplistic, perhaps a bit too simplistic for my tastes.  I do appreciate what it does however in that it gives me a sense of progression.  Earning and spending resources gives me a reason to keep playing and luckily, you can grind earlier levels should you come up against something you’re not ready for.  It would have been better (in my opinion) if the resources were gained over time automatically as opposed to prodding the process along manually every few minutes…though this is a minor complaint.  I have to give the game credit though for trying something new…”ReignMaker” is unlike anything I’ve played up to this point.  For that reason alone, you should probably give it a go.

Each time I beat a level I get presented with a decision to make as leader of the town.  Once, while I was away defending the kingdom, one of my villagers basically invented Candy Crush Saga.  It was almost the downfall of my civilization.

I'm having a lot of fun with this game and it goes beyond just enjoying a match 3. In a normal match 3 you're focused on the board so you can discover opportunities for 4s and 5s or better, but there is a lot more to this game. You've got monsters creeping up to your base so you've got to make the matches that line up with them to destroy them and they might even drop some loot. Of course, you have to click on it to get it. Do you have time? What about that special gem you just scored on the board? Click it? The monsters are wailing away at your wall so you better decide fast! It's a lot to take in all at once.\n\nThat's just the battles. In between, you need to rule your kingdom with policies and deeds, improve the city buildings, train citizens, and much more. The improvements to the city result in the ability to earn even better weapons and spells for the battlefield. What more could you ask for? Troops? Got it! Now, you can deploy troops on your wall and I must say they are smashing (people who have played will get it). When do you deploy those troops? Do you take archers? Healers? Scouts? What about your equipment? Dummies? Swords? Exploding capsules? There are tons of combinations to let you deal with the battlefield and a great "RPG Interface" for improving them. The city is an absolutely awesome addition to this and really makes it a lot of fun.\n\nJust when you think aww, man is this thing just gonna be a match 3 grin--WTF is that?! An enormous boss stomps onto the screen and the fight is on. This is no easy task and it gets harder as you progress to many different and interesting bosses. Luckily, the art is totally charming so the journey is enjoyable and it is really livened up with a solid soundtrack that sets the mood. The writing is fun and the game seems very appropriate for kids and adults alike.","July 11, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This basic mechanic is pretty good, and quite well balanced for the most part - the only problem with it being that on bigger board, clearing the bottom row mindlessly is usually enough. In addition to that there's a "home village" which you grow as you clea boards... except it grows more like a free to play town.\n\nI don't recommend it though for a few reasons:\n\n- It has little "quests" (clear 5 gems, launch 30 attacks) that mostly frustrate and are often impossible (randomly requires certain equipped items or match 5s where the board is only big enough for 4s.\n- A gold collection mechanic that means constantly having to click tiny piles of gold on the other side of the screen from the board. Very irritating.\n- Free to play style resource collection (even though there are no IAPs). The progression feels totally wrecked and resource collection is oh so bad.\n- Skilled at landing chains? Doesn't matter. Chains only count for basic damage, and if you pop a line of 3 to chain react a 5, the 5 will not count for anything. No bonus gems, doesn't count toward quests... argh. Oh, and get a "match 30 quickly" quest? Chained matches don't count. Same for "match 5 airs". This seems... well, broken.\n\nIn summary, this game is so very "below average" in every respect, that you'd be better getting some other match 3 game.","July 23, 2014","false","3.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Sign me up, right?!\n\nUnfortunately, while there are a ton of great ideas in this game, the consolidated execution falls flat. Let's start with the good:\nCity building make you feel more involved in the story. After each mission, you're given a choice which affects the destiny of your city, adding characters and benefits to it, and allowing you to choose the feeling of your city. There's a variety of research spells and items you can use during combat. There are tons of achievements.\n\nNow the bad:\nPacing: While the real-time adds to the frantic feeling of the game, a lot of the time your efforts are wasted. In many early levels, you find yourself matching for no purpose and no reward except to maneuver the board. A lot of the time you just sit there waiting for the next enemies. Boss attacks are generally too fast to counter. It's hard to maintain view of both your puzzle board and the enemies.\nCity building timers make this feel like a facebook game. Seems like they planned to go the F2P route at one point. Limited resources make you feel like abandoning the city building aspect altogether. Items are single use, and generally worthless for the resource cost. Most of the spells seem ineffectual, and not grand.\nAchievements are too easy to get: 1/3 of them shouldn't even be considered real achievements as opposed to markers of playing the game.\n\nOverall, there's no oomph to this game. It lacks the polish and urgency of a speed match-3 game. It needs more audio or visual feedback when you kill a creature. The city building, spells and equipment aren't complex enough for a strategic game. It's above average in ideas, but it's all too visible flaws make it not worth it in the long run.\n\nRecommendation: pass.","August 13, 2014","false","7.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

To click on a stone and switch it with another takes nearly 10 clicks to move it or have it even recognize your existence, the town is lame and adds nothing to the game except for a farmville feeling. The campaign was decent until you get to the Obliterator who insn't fair at all, making you hit his infinite minions who require 3 blasts to take down and there are nearly almost 10 on the field at the same time. Not including how insane the campaign gets after that. If you even focus on the town at all you will need to push through the soggy later campaign to get those little triforces to do anything in the game. The situations you get to do is so lame and even doing the right thing or finding a clever way to solve it does nothing but show a +1 for something and you get no satisfaction out of it, making it a waste of time.  Getting stuck in the campaign with no way to progress or get items because you sunk your triforces into the damn farm means your stuck having to pray you dont find yourself stuck without any combos or switch's and believe me it happens. I can't believe you cant BUY triforces for this $15 game because it reminds me of a bad Candy Crush ripoff with a new twist that makes you want to hurl. Will I play it again?

Not interacting with the game being valid seems like the design went off the rails.\n\nAlso the town choices don't feel like anything.

The game has a few points where it can get a bit grindy, but there's no penalty to playing a level more than once; and you can try for a better "score" (shown by banner color) on a previously-won level.\n","April 17, 2014","true","0.3"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

I enjoyed the early stages, but getting further along the game goes from casual fun to plain tedious. Some of that is just the usual match-3 luck of the draw where the player's actions are not necessarily related to the outcome. I may also just be terrible at this kind of game.\n\nThe "city-building" and "politics" are largely tacked on. I enjoy the politics aspect, basically after winning a board a random (?) event occurs and you are given several thematic options on how to handle the event. Some choices might just give you some flavour dialogue, other choices will add decorations to the town, some choices will give you a one-time resource boost, while other choices may give you a permanent, though minor, buff to some aspect of the game itself. If you choose enough of a particular thematic choice your town will "become" that thematic element (nature lovers, republic, militaristic, etc.) I enjoy the politics and choices though they are just a sidenote in the game.\n\nYou may often find you are unable to make matches in certain areas, which allows the enemies that are coming at you to destroy your tower unimpeded. You can hire and bring up to two different unit types into combat with you, but I often find they rarely are useful in defending the tower in the areas where the player may not have much ability to. You can also bring in spells and items, which can help at times, though the items tend to be resource intensive, which is problematic when resources in the game are gained in real time. Resources also can, and will, hit a maximum storage capacity in the resource gathering facility, making it so you have to check in often early on if you want to be able to get enough resources to upgrade buildings and research spells and items, which also happen in real time. The resource aspect of the game is off-putting to me as it feels a great deal like a pay-to-win, mobile game, despite the fact there is no premium currency in the game, which is great, I hate games doing that, but in a full game it just feels out of place and tedious.\n\nThe game isn't bad, it just isn't good. I find myself going back to play every now and then, it'll take me a long time before I 100% it, should I ever, but I just can't recommend it.

You will have enemies approaching from the side of your screen and must make matches in the same "row" as the enemy. (skeleton approaching at the next-to-top row of your screen? At least one of the element tiles in your match has to be somewhere in that next-to-top row to do any damage to the skeleton.) Matching tiles destroys the tiles, sends out an elemental bolt or fire/water/darkness/whatever ball streaking directly to the side that the enemies are approaching from. Any projectiles that hit an enemy do damage, and some enemies take more or less damage from different elements. This is an interesting change from the usual "make a match anywhere" of most match-3 games, but it can get quite frustrating on some of the boss fights where you need to deal a massive amount of damage to a relatively narrow area on the battlefield. Part of the game's charm, but also part of the frustration on harder bosses.\n\nMost of the enemies are of the "advance across the screen and beat upon the wall" variety, but the bosses have some unique mechanics (such as throwing fireballs that you can destroy if you happen to make a match and toss out a fireball in the exact right place to impact the boss's projectile). These add some definate flavor to the fights, but the relative difficulty of preplanning where the tiles are going to fall make these boss abilities more of a "counter if you can" situation and can at times turn downright deadly (if a chain match suddenly bounces a bunch of your own shots off of a boss's reflective force field).\n\nTo help with this, you can use the resources you gather in town to research/craft/hire various spells/items/defenders. As you level up certain buildings in town, you gain access to more potent enhancements.\n\nThe spells are reusable abilities with no limt to number of uses but which require you to make a certain number of matches to "charge up" the spell. The charge level for each spell carries over from match to match, so you need to make decisions whether to use a spell to help finish a battle or save it to open with on the next battle. Spells can destroy tiles (dealing damage to enemies), heal your fortress, shuffle the board, etc.\n\nCrafted items are consumeable (multiples can be stacked, but each time you use the item, your total available is reduced by 1 and you have to build/purchase more before you can use them again). Item effects range from stunning opponents to damaging them to preventing them from moving forward for a short time.\n\nDefenders are guard units that walk up and down along the top of your wall, and heal you or shoot arrows/roll bolders at enemies or run and grab dropped treasure, etc. Like items, defenders are consumed on use, and more must be hired to keep a steady supply. You can have two types of defenders active at once (and only one of each can be active at a time).\n\nAll of these enhancements are bought/researched through the town building minigame, which feels very lackluster. Gold, food, wood, and metal are used as resources for upgrading buildings or purchasing items, etc. While gold is gathered on the battlefield, the other resources have to be gathered in town, by waiting for the appropriate resource-generating building to slowly (and automatically) fill up with a resource, choosing to harvest what's available, and then slowly letting the resource fill up again. While resource building structures automatically fill up with a resource, they do not automatically harvest it, so you have to remember to manually harvest your pumpkins or ironwood or the building will just sit there useless until you empty it out. This plays more like a freemium mobile game's time-limited resource production, and can get quite frustrating later on, when battles take significantly less time than needed for your crops to grow/wood to be milled. It gets quite annoying to have to log on every so often just to gather your resources so you can eventually afford the new spell/stonethrowing guard/shiney bomb that you're waiting for to tip the scales in your favor for the next boss fight.\n\nAlso with the city building, there is no customization for placing buildings where you want, or adding buildings to enhance particular resource production. You have one place to gather wood. One place to grow food. One place to research spells. Buildings grow as you level them up, but you can't move/rotate/remove/anything. There are a few different "town themes" but you can't do any significant customization.\n\nThe one feature of the town itself that isn't terribly boring is the townsfolk, which wander around and sometimes have thought bubbles that you can click on for an amusing quip. Also, the townsfolk react to some of your victories by asking for "policy decisions" where you can pick whether to protect forested areas, anger your local druids, be lenient with thieves, send a beaten boss monster back to a far-away forested area or kill her off, etc. Most of these are humorously written, none seem to have "wrong" answers, and none have any effect on game play as far as I can tell.\n\nEven with the sometimes-frustrating fights, ReignMaker is a fun-for-a-bit casual match-3 game that's easy to pick up, put down for a few weeks, pick up again, etc., but it's not something that really grabs attention for hours on end. Between that and the lackluster town interface, resource gathering, and research/crafting system, I can't recommend paying full price for this game, especially compared to the asking price of some of the other match-3 games on Steam. If you can get it for 75% off or more (or part of a really-discounted bundle), it'll be an enjoyable game for occasional play. Just avoid buying it for full price unless you really MUST have every match-3 available.","November 28, 2014","false","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not complicated in any way, very simple and easy to get the hang of, but it's honestly nothing special. Now on to the actual gameplay!\n\nLike I said, the game is a match three game, so the main gameplay is just swiping so you get a line of three or more, but where it is a little different is the mechanic of the battles. On one side is you, which is a building filled with your gems/runes that you need to match three in order to use as an attack. On the other side is where the enemies will slowly encroach upon your castle, and it's your job to match those gems, be it horizontal or vertical to fire a spell at the enemy. You'll slowly whittle the enemy down with your matching abilities and the battle will be over and you'll be sent back to your village.\n\nThe combat isn't overly-complicated, and you will be getting extra abilities that you can unlock to help you along the way, but it's all simply "okay." And that's how I'd describe this game in a nutshell. It's merely okay. I'm not the biggest fan of the graphics style, but I can live with that. The combat is fairly simple, but it's nothing spectacular, and the whole village gimmick kind of makes you feel like you're playing a FaceBook game as you have to wait for your buildings to give you the resources you want. If you want to sit and wait and just watch that timer slowly tick down so you can get that extra little bit of ore, then you can, but I can't admit being the biggest fan of having to wait on real time to get something a little extra in a game.\n\nI don't hate the game, but at the same time I can't say I like it either. Which is why I'm not going to be recommending it, because an "okay" game does not make it necessarily a good one.","October 15, 2014","false","2.5"," 90 of 106 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","90","106","0","3"

Then you use the money from the Match 3 game to purchase upgrades for your town.\n\nOccassionally you'll get popups in town about a random event and you have a multiple choice decision you can make. Depending on your choice you may unlock other power-ups.\n\nSeveral of your buildings are for gathering resources - ore and wood that you use to build and upgrade structures. A farm to feed your people. A blacksmith to research new weapons and an armory to store them in.  You use the weapons as power-ups in the match 3 game.\n\nYou can build and upgrade an Academy for spells to use in the match 3 game, A City Hall to hire workers for your buildings or as power-ups such as an Archer or Boulder tosser to fight off the encroaching enemy.

There is a wide variety of enemies, most of which shamble slowly towards your tower, giving you plenty of time to pick them off. Levels offer a great deal of variety, whether in the set-up of the board itself, 'corruption' that affects your runes, and other maladies that you can either hire citizens to deal with or just power through. Boss battles give you a chance to fight somebody that fires back.\n\nThe game also allows you to research spells and craft items to assist you in game, and hire the aforementioned specialized citizens to roam your tower walls and assist.\n\nIf that sounds like a lot to pick through, well, it is. Reignmaker has an overabundance of options, but the learning curve (at least on Easy or Normal) allows you plenty of time to pick out your own strategy, whether that's deploying spells as a mage, throwing bombs and blockades in your enemies' paths, or hiring a big guy to smash everybody with rocks.\n\nAs competently done as the individual battles are, they were actually the part of the game I found myself enjoying the least. On top of everything else, Reignmaker has a city/resource management side to it, where you can turn your little village into a true city. This is the hub of everything else in the game, where you upgrade buildings and research spells and items to assist you in battles. Watching the city 'grow up', and the citizens going about their day within it, is quite satisfying.\n\nLikely the best part about this game, though, is the ability to set 'policies'. After each new level you beat, you can travel back to your city and set a new policy that the populace is up in arms about. Some of them gain extra resources, some will create aesthetic changes to the city, and some of them are just for flavor, but ReignMaker's excellent sense of humor shines through here, and it's definitely something to look forward to.\n\nGraphics are bright and colorful, though nothing really stands apart from the pack here. The design of the three main city types you have to choose for are brightly distinct from one another, but while there are minor differences in city attributes, the base gameplay is still the same. It has a soundtrack. Creatures have their own unique grunts of pain and death rattles, and some of the citizens have spoken (or mumbled) lines. The music itself is about what you'd expect from a game like this, pure background. It exists, nothing really more can be said.\n\nAchievement hunters can rejoice as well, and maybe get a little glassy-eyed when they first load up the game. Reignmaker is heavily geared towards getting a whole slew of achievements right off the bat- I got 40 in one day, and didn't even play for that long. Later achievements can get quite grindy.\n\nOverall, Reignmaker offers a great deal of variety, and encourages unique strategies. If you're a fan of match-3 type games looking for something a little different, definitely give this one a try.","August 2, 2014","true","133.6"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","1"

What is more, that is an unnecessary lie. Yeah this game has some building in it, but it is even more shallow than Facebook games like "Hayday". Yes, this game has some policy options which does not effect gameplay in any meaningful way. These two things are not main part of the game, they are just spices to make player sure that he actually is not playing some kind of "Candy Crush".\n\nThat is also a lie. This game heavily resembles Candy Crush. Actually, if I were to sum it up, "Candy Crush with tower defense elements." That is not as bad as it sounds, since we all know about addictiveness of candy crush. Gameplay mechanics are rather solid, most of the weapons and skills has their own uses. Policy options are just there for the sake of feeling like a king, not a 3-matcher. Soldiers have their own uses as well, but Scouts (the elite ones) maybe a bit unbalanced since they are the obvious choose for almost all missions.\n\nI got this game from Humble Bundle, which also includes Paranautical Activity, Stacking and Windforge. The funny part is I got that bundle for Stacking. But this was the game I played most among those. Why? It is addicting. It gives sense of success. But if u despise mechanics of Candy Crush, you wont like this game. This is guaranteed, It has more complex mechanics when it comes to battles, but the main part is the same.\n\nI have two more complaints. One: Resource system is a bit unbalanced. You earn money by waiting, you can earn some infinitesimal money in battle as well, which has no practical uses. Every thing needs wood. Almost nothing needs ore. And you wont need food after you upgraded your town center to level 5. Yes, it should not be more complex than this since this is basically a match 3 game but if these mechanics exist I would want it to be more gamey.\n\nSecond. After all this time, (and this is actually the second game first being Tower of Elements) there are still some gamebreaking bugs. If you use some spells which alters the gameboard too much (like Landslide, Tornado etc), and dont wait it to be completed, some cells includes two different colors which is practically impossible to complete the chapter after that. If you wait after using those spells no bug is there, I guess if there is a restriction on using heavy skills one after other, the way it is restricted should not be via a bug.\n\nBut still. If you find this game cheap. Real cheap. Under 4 dollars even, I would recommend it if you like such casual games. Since it got me hooked, and I actually finished it with most of achievements unlocked, I feel obliged to recommend it. By the way, this game will be fun for achievement hunters as well since it has well defined goals. Just dont be deceived by claims of the game about being a political simulator, true successor of Sim City 3000 etc, and if you cant find a good deal, go online and search for similar games for free.","January 2, 2015","true","21.5"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","27","35","0","0"

Everyone needs a little casual in their life, right? ReignMaker is a fantastic choice if you're looking to scratch that itch.\n\nTo start, the game has some light city-building mechanics from the start. Pick a city with a passive bonus and then use resources such as wood, ore, money, population, money, and food to build and upgrade buildings that provide magic, weapons, defensive units, and extra resources to help build up your city.\n\nOnce you go into battle, you can use up to two additional troops you have trained to help fight. For example, you can use an archer and a stonethrower to help deal damage while you take care of the rest. Every battle has rows of enemies coming down the line (think Plants vs Zombies). It is up to you to match different elements to deal damage to those enemies before they deal damage to your tower. Every so often quests will pop up such as "Match 3 fire elements" that will reward additional resources. You can also use magic and items that have been researched/purchased to help get the upper hand. You will want to ensure you use EVERYTHING at your disposal. While the game starts out very easy, the boards become more complex and new mechanics get thrown in such as corrupted elements that will make it so nothing it cast once the match is made.\n\nPost battle you are presented with an event that occurred while you were at battle. These events allow you to choose a policy or a method for dealing with the particular issue at hand. While some policies have an immediate effect, others have a small or a slow growing effect that become more apparent the longer you play. So far it has served as an interesting piece of storytelling and each policy is complete with an outcome once you make a choice so you are never left with a feeling of "so what?" Some events have be humorous, and others have been tales of love lost and found (and some deal with poop because who doesn't like some good ol' fashioned toilet humor?). There is a definite variety to the policy portion of the game.\n\nRounding all of this out is a thorough Bestiary (as FrogDice games are known for) that lets you see your foes up close and personal and a pretty decent soundtrack. The voice acting isn't anything to write home about but it serves the purpose. The graphics are, again, nothing to clamor over but they are charming and the purpose is served. This is a game that is all about the gameplay and it certainly delivers in full.\n\nIf you're familiar with other FrogDice games and have enjoyed them, you can expect more of what makes a FrogDice game worth playing in ReignMaker. If you are unfamiliar with FrogDice games but enjoy a good Match 3 game, definitely pick this one up. There is a level of depth in this one that I haven't seen in a Match 3 in some time. Icing on the cake: you can sit back in your chair and just play with the mouse; no need for the keyboard (other than to put in the name of your city in the beginning). Doesn't get much better than that.","April 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","1"

I was playing years ago similar browser game, there you had your character and monsters - every match was causing your character move with his sword or magic, this is really nice kind of game, which I enjoyed like nothing else. Here's additionally a city which you administrate, making it bigger, inventing new spells or special attacks, gathering resources, I have to say it's pretty well thought. But it was lasting only first ~34 hours (when I played half year ago), after that "long" time, the game is getting repeatable, so it's rather not a game which you want to replay more than twice.\n\nI'm achievement hunter, since I started it, I can't imagine a situation where I won't finish it with 100% achievements done. There are a lot of nice achievements, but most of them are unlocking randomly just while playing, it's not bad... till the game forces you to play more than you would actually enjoy... some of achievements require unbelievable big amount of actions to be done... (like making 100k moves, killing 1k monsters of every kind or replaying game at least 4 freaking times! - for different politics chosen). It's not something to enjoy, after some time it's just getting repeatable and it's pain to do.\n\nI finished already this game 7th times + infinite tower (not whole but 30levels), just because I made a mistake in politics and achievements didn't pop up... twice. If there would be "Mixed" review I would definitely use it, but since there's nothing like that, I'm RECOMMENDING this game as not everyone is achievement hunter, it was still great to play once or twice.","March 3","true","92.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The lite citybuilding is fun, and I like seeing how my citizens are going to look different after I make several policy decisions for the city.  And making matches to have spells shoot out and kill guys attacking my tower is a lot more interesting to me than a puzzle game where I am making matches just for score.

You make matches to "shoot" a variety of ranged attacks on approaching enemies. Some enemies are more resistent to different attacks (minor void minions are resistant to void rune attacks and I think the turtles might be resistant to water rune attacks).\n\nYou can also use spells, weapons, and NPCs to defend your tower. You manage a town with automated resource gathering (a nice feature!), spending those resources on building upgrades, hiring NPCs, spell and weapon research, weapon inventory, and town population growth. Currently it seems that the demand for wood resource far outpaces your collection rate. Each farmer/lumberjack/smelter NPC hired will increase the gather rate for that resource by 1% (currently capped at 20%).\n\nWood, food, and ore resources accumulate in real-time in each of their respective buildings. Just don't forget to click on "Collect" to move the resources out of the building because each resource building has a limited capacity and won't accumulate beyond it. Upgrade buildings to increase the cap.\n\nIf you get too serious about gathering resources, this game can be a bit of a grind as you repeat levels over and over to earn triads (game currency used for equipment and upgrades) - so just relax!

At the point the levels finally offered some real challenge, upgrading the town and dealing with the seemingly pointless decision making started to get annoying. There isn't enough stuff going on in the village to justify the fact that it's a pretty big part of the game. The village mechanics are very basic and the graphics are unappealing. It takes time for the derpy villagers to gather resources and research spells, and the only way to pass that time is to replay old levels again and again until I finally get the upgrade I need.\n\nMaybe I'm just impatient, I don't know. Life is short.\n\nSo yeah, the game's mildly amusing, but the village business slows things down. Just my two cents, though.  ReignMaker seems popular enough, so do give it a try if you can get it for a couple of dollars. (I personally don't think it's worth more than that.)\n\nEDIT: The resource system is definitely unbalanced. You can hoard all the money you want, but there's not enough wood.

The point is, I've seen it all.  Aside from the things I have not seen, of course.  So what does ReignMaker bring to the table, that makes it good, or even gooder?  Well.\nThere is the match three, of course, which is a very clear cut genre, but yoiu see, it is also a tower defense, as your matched blocks create magical bolts that fire upon the waves of attacking, um, evil things.  You can also learn spells that bolster your ability to blast molten death upon the deserving heads of the aforementioned evil things.\nIn between bouts of match three tower defense, you can return to your village, where you as mayor, or whatever, get to improve buildings, hire workers, research items and spells, and even respond to situations by creating government policies, which can sometimes give bonus items, or cause new items to appear in your town.\nOverall, I find enough variety in ReignMaker to keep things fresh, and the only complaint I have is that lumber production is so slow it can actually slow your progress, as lumber is needed for anything you want to build.  That is fairly minor though, and the developers are actually responding to people on the forums, which is pretty amazing in this day and age where so many games are in early access, or simply released and abandoned, or abandoned in early access.\nAnyway, good game, check it out.

It's primarily a match-three game (Bejewelled etc), with the secondary game being destroying monsters that are advancing towards your grid. Each rune (jewel/fruit/whatever) you destroy by matching shoots out a bolt towards the monsters, so you [sometimes] have to focus on matching runes that are on the same line as the closest monsters.\n\nI was a bit surprised when things falling into a line of 5 does not have the special effect you get when moving things into a line of 5, but I think it's a good design decision, it makes the bonus effects more skill-based.\n\nThere's also a 'town' section for buying additional powers and tools, which further adds to the depth of the game. Unfortunately it takes a small leaf from 'social' games in having resources which build up over time in addition to resources you earn. Both kinds are needed, which means if you play the game through to the end in a few sessions you won't have accumulated enough resources to try out even half of the upgrades.\n\nMissed opportunity; a boss battle in which you have to shoot the boss with particular types of runes would have been nice. I'd say wrong runes healing him 1/4 as much as the correct rune does damage, so that shooting wrongly is harmful, and the boss changing 'shield' color to the color you must hit with a second after each hit would have been a nice more-skilled touch. (Instead most of the boss battles were just "match threes as fast as you can, near the boss row, and it'll probably work out".)

You go to battle to get the currency resource, and the battles consist of the match-3 game inside of a tower, with baddies moving to attack your tower from one side, Plants vs Zombies style. As you make matches, bolts fly out to hit the incoming mobs, and bigger matches obviously deal bigger damage. Chaining combos together never had so much meaning in a match 3 game.\n\nTown upgrades allow you to bring clickable weapons, spells, and a couple of soldiers (of all types, from healers, to scouts who run out and grab coins, to archers etc) to battle.\n\nSo, battle helps you build the town, and upgrading the town helps you battle. In town you choose what buildings to upgrade first, what spells and weapons to research, who to hire and so forth. Often when you win a few new battles, you will return to the town and have to make a Decision. These are mayoral type decisions that are often the lesser of two evils, or some other difficult decision, but generally, the answers aren't at all punishing and simply offer one buff or another. The writeups are really fun and playful.\nThe townies are 'cute' and often catch you off guard by saying things you didnt expect. "I, FOR ONE, WELCOME OUR NEW OVERLORDS"   --freakin best Simpsons quote ever! Yeah I caught that! Sorry for the spoiler. moving on..\n\nSome of the battles are quite challenging, and you will find yourself trying different tactics and mixes of spells, weapons and units to overcome a boss. Or the "O" shaped towers. Those are the worst.\n\nOften I'll just launch and jump into a normal battle, and there I am, simply playing match 3, but at the same time I'm building up my resources and stuff.\n\n\nIf I recall correctly at the time I write this, it's a "drag the window to resize it to anything" game, so it's super easy to play in a window, which is nice if you're a multitasker like me.\n\nThere's over 100 achievements, a monster database, and other odds and ends to collect & achieve.\n\n\n\nOn a side note, the only negative I can think of is Lumber seems to be the bottleneck for resources. This is a game where some resources continue to build even when the game is closed, so many times I've launched the game just to gather the lumber even when I don't plan on playing.\nSo, the only negative I can think of is easily worked around through the natural mechanics of the game.\n\nSeriously, if you play ANY match-3 game, I can't see why this wouldn't be at the TOP of your list. It's great!","August 29, 2014","true","27.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

You can research spells and items, recruit Citizens that help not only in combat, but improve your resource gathering and research speeds too.\n\nYou can recruit Citizens from the town and take them into the Match-3/Defense puzzle. Each Citizen has different abilities. There are 5 types of Offensive/Battle Citizens in total, and each has 2 tiers, making 10 in total, which you unlock by upgrading the Town Hall. For example, a Tier 1 Scout will run out into the field and pick up gold and scrolls that enemies drop when killed, but a Tier 2 Scout will not only run out and collect more frequently, but leave a bomb which explodes in a few seconds, damaging/killing enemies nearby.\n\nYou can also craft items that can be used in battle. To craft them you not only need to research them in the Armory, but have the resources too. A Dagger and Sword can be used directly on enemies to damage them to varying degrees. You can drop explosive pills on groups of enemies to kill them  all. You can drop barricades, training dummies, and oil to slow down enemies, and quite a few more.\n\nAnd finally, you can research spells at the Academy and use them in battle. The effects range from destroying sections of the game board, which launches the elements at the enemies, or perhaps rearranging the board completely. There's quite a few more. You don't need resources to research or 'craft' the spells, they only need money and a bit(a lot) of time to unlock initially. Oh, and the Academy itself needs to be upgraded in order to research the various tiers of spells. So the Academy needs to be level 3 in order to research tier 3 spells. Once researched, you can cast it as many times as you want, with a cooldown of course. By cooldown, I mean '40 Matches' or '80 Matches'. And thats matches as in 'matching gems', not entire games. Matches made when gems are cascading count too.\n\nWhen you actually go into battle, you're allowed to equip a loadout that can be changed at anytime outside of battle. You can equip 6 Spells, 6 Items, and 2 Citizens. Citizens and Items are depleted when used, so you need to craft/recruit them before running out. Spells aren't depleted, but you need to wait for the cooldown. All items and spells are hotkeyed to 'QWERTY' and '123456' for easy access, the Citizens are hotkeyed to '09'. All hotkeys can be changed.\n\nThe 'Conquest Map' is where you choose your battles. On the map there are areas, each with 4 towers initially, and when you beat those, a boss battle tower is shown. Once the boss is defeated, a new area is unlocked.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Match-3 games and/or puzzle quest.","July 12, 2014","true","10.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

When you make matches, bolts of magic fly out from that row towards the oncomming enemies.  There isn't really any "pathing".  Enemies simply advance toward your city and start attacking your walls until you lose or you beat them.  You can also "build a city" that simply exists for you to unlock items, spells, and heroes to use later on.  The one downside is that you do not know how many waves of enemies remain, so it can get frustrating at times to plan out how you'll make some of your matches.\n\nThere are a LOT of acheivmements in the game, but you get many of them simply by playing.  They are more about you playing like you normally would and you'll just magically get them.  There are probably only a few that take a little bit of planning.\n\nDuring each round, you can get special missions that when completed give you a few resources.  In the end, they are often not worth the effort because you may end up losing resources when you are required to use an item.\n\nSome of the boards are very difficult to play since you have a narrow opening in which to make matches, making you rely on spells.  Spells are recharged by making matches, but don't cost any resources, at least.\n\nOverall, the game is fun and combines multiple game generes pretty well.  I recommend it! :)","July 20, 2014","true","13.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Well, ReignMaker did. Matching tiles means something: you are defending a world from hordes of evil. And not only are you defending it, you will see it grow and care for its inhabitants, as you run your own little town in this world.\nThe town is a major part of the game. Here you train units to help you in your battles, create equipment and research spells. And you produce the resources with which to do all that. But more than that, you make decisions that will make the town feel unique: whenever you beat a new level, a policy decission will be presented to you, asking you to guide your town. How do you handle crop failure? Do you let that reknown berserker settle in your town? What do you say about theatrical plays that corrupt our youth?\nAll these decission will affect your town one way or another. You may get a free scholar to help your reseach. You may end up with more rabbits around your town or piles of purple fungal mold. And your citizens may live in a republic or end up in an oppresive tyranny. It is up to you. Either way, it will be cute and humorous.\nJust don't listen to the random citizen who will want to move to Troj. There is always one person like that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/286200/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","TL:DR: A  match 3/tower defense with a *very* lightweight city builder attached. Lots of little goals plus achievements is a great bonus. It is similar bto the Puzzle Quest series, and fans of that series should  pick this up. It it really simple but the battles can get pretty complex. It seems to have been built for a touchscreen and not a mouse though. Its overpriced at $14.99, $4.99-$9.99 seems much more reasonable. Overall though, its fun if you like puzzle/RPGs.\n\n\nWhen I first saw this released, I ignored it. It looked like a casual puzzle game that was a mobile port. And it was pricy for that style of game. Then I saw a friends review who liked it. I've been really hard up for ANY games lately due to the deluge of mobile crap, so I grabbed it. Yes, I know, counter intuitive. But hey, I can't hate on something Ive never experienced.\n\nNormally I'm not a fan of puzzle games, but I did love and play the hell out of the Puzzle Quests (the first one was better than the second and Galactrix IMHO, but all are good), and also liked Puzzle Chronicles. All of those had some sort of strange addictive quality, even though without the RPG component, puzzle games are boring as hell and pointless in my eyes.  So I grabbed ReignMaker.\n\nFor starters, the graphics are appropriate. They are bright, colorful, and cartoony 3d images. It lends the game a good feel that fits well with the game style. The music is cheerful and the sound is decent, although the doo-do-DO-DOO (the typical "charge" horn noise) that starts a battle is annoying as hell.\n\nOther than that, I laughed at the *very* badly narrated intro that starts the game. The images are cool, a stained glass style picture scrolling by and explaining the backstory. But the voice..oh god. It sounds like a wanna-be old man with a bad head cold attempting to do the stereotypical "fantasy world king" accent. And failing. I had trouble understanding some of what he was saying, and it sucked cuz there was no subtitles.\n\nSo the gameplay. Its like an *extremely* light city builder/resource manager, mixed with a match 3 puzzle that is also a tower defense game. The city builder is simple. There are places you can buy using resources and the places help you. Theres also policies, which are little events. You have 4 different choices of how to deal with the event, and the results of the choice affect your city. I have havent really explored too much of the city building aspect yet, so I will update when I do.\n\nUPDATE: Its really simple. Half the buildings generate timed resources, the other half researches itemss. You can upgrade the buildings to get better battle items, spells, and troops. I hesitate to even call it a builder. More of a resource manager.\n\nThe other aspect of the game is decently fun. Its the battle. You start, and you can earn items from buildings in your city that help you. There are many of them all with different effects.\n\nSo its a tower defense meets match 3. On the left is your tower, filled with different elemental shapes and other icons that you match. Walking in from the right are enemies, many different types. They dont move up and down, but travel in a straight line towards your tower (at least at the stages im at now, dont know if they do later). When you match 3, a bolt of the associated element spits out of your tower and travels right, hitting any enemies in its path. Thing is, the bolt travels in the row you matched it in. So if theres an enemy in the 2nd row down matching an element in the 3rd 4th and 5th row down wouldnt hit it because the elemental bolts would be flying in the 3rd 4th and 5th row. There are also many other icons, both helpful and harmful/annoying. You can collect "scrolls". Each scroll creates an entry in a book where you can see the stats of each enemy and a brief description and images.\n\nIn addition there are little challenges you can do to gain resources, such as "match 4 fire elements" "use a heal icon" ect. All of this plus a ton of achievements and other little things makes this overall a fun lgame.\n\nIts a little pricy for 14.99, but any fan of the puzzle quest type match 3s will love it. Get it on mobile if it exists there (Not sure, but judging by it it sure seems to be),","May 20, 2014","true","7.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Sadly, upon playing the game, I was quickly disappointed.\n\nThe city building aspect is lacklustre and feels more suited to a Facebook game, with only a few buildings available, no choice over which ones to build or where they are placed, and wait times to harvest the resources they produce.\n\nThe policy decisions don't feel like they have any lasting effect though I'm still at a fairly early point in the game so I could be wrong about this part.\n\nThe match-3 gameplay itself is quite fun, each match you make sends out energy bolts to attack the waves of enemies coming at your tower from the other side of the screen. You can also use the resources gathered in the town and money earned in battles to purchase spells, units and weapons to assist in destroying the enemies\n\nUnfortunatley the difficulty level increases quite suddenly from stupidly easy to frustratingly hard, usually resulting in needing to replay completed levels repeatedly to grind enough money to purchase units, upgrade the town, etc..., which gets old fairly quickly.\n\nIf you find this in a bundle, or on deep sale, then it's not a bad little game to waste an hour or so on every now and then but I really can't recommend it at the current price point.\n\n\n","August 2, 2014","false","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Overall, this game is a mediocre time waster that falls way short of its promises. I'm going to copy/paste the first line of its Steam store page: "ReignMaker is a city building political strategy game with match-3 tower defense combat." Calling this game  a city builder, a political strategy game, or a tower defense game is a serious insult to those genres, and this is coming from someone who enjoys those types of games.\n\nYou technically build a city, yes, but the "city building" is little more than waiting to collect resources and upgrading buildings. The only choice you make is what order you build things in. There's no real planning, no infrastructure building, and really, nothing interesting at all about this city building parts. They only serve as a vessel to get you upgrades, and are absolutely no fun on their own. Also, resource collection is really annoying. I never had nearly enough lumber, so I had to wait for hours, checking in every 30 minutes to harvest. Another annoyance is the gold, which appears on the ground as you fight. It spawns so frequently that it's a huge distraction from the puzzle, and you won't get nearly enough if you don't pick it up. Scouts are a necessity if you want to progress since they take that element out, but that's one fewer person you can take into tough levels.\n\nThere is technically political strategy, yes, but it amounts to a series of questions, one per level, that almost never have any consequences at all. When there are, they're minor at best. It has all the depth of an Internet quiz. After making choices, you can find out your city's "culture", which matters none at all, really.\n\nWhen it says it's a "tower defense" game, though, that's completely misleading. In a tower defense game, you place towers strategically to impede and attack units that are trying to get through, and that's not what this game has. In this game, you defend towers with match-3 combat.\n\nNow, for the match-3 elements. The core match-3 gameplay is present in this game, and it does provide some challenge. The spells and the people you hire are interesting additions that shake things up. This game suffers from poor design decisions overall, though. The difficulty curve is a mess, with a huge spike at level 10 before varying wildly between really easy and very difficult. The boss battles are mostly luck; you have to attack very rapidly with matches and spells and hope that you get enough combos to win before your opponent murders you (even worse, you can defeat the boss but still lose the match and be forced to replay). Also, some of the levels are excessively long, which really sucks when you run out steam and lose 20 minutes in to a level.\n\nThis isn't the worst game I've played, not by a long shot. I still played this game to the end, probably just because the match-3 combat was enough to hold my interest for a while. This game is really heavily flawed, though, and it spectacularly fails to deliver on its promises. Sadly, this game is little more than a time waster, which isn't good enough for me. It looks like this game is still being worked on, however, so hopefully some things can be ironed out, but it will never be a "city building political strategy game" with "tower defense combat". Ultimately, this game is just a second-rate Puzzle Quest. This game's a joke at $15. I think I can only recommend this game if you can find it for $2 or less.","July 21, 2014","false","64.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The meat of the game is in the battles, where you play match-3 on one side of the screen while monsters attack on the other. The matching is pretty straightforward (you get some spells you can cast to shuffle or destroy tiles, you get bonuses for matching 4 or more at once, there are locked and frozen tiles, etc) but the combat side is pretty interesting - at first I just ignored it and focused on making matches at the bottom of the screen so that matches on top would happen automatically, but it's actually worth paying attention to where monsters are and trying to line up matches in the right place, especially against later bosses when you need to keep them stunned to avoid being hurt. Also, items can be used on the battlefield side to deal with monsters, and they drop a lot of loot and collectable scrolls that are worth getting.\nThe town part of the game has good parts and bad parts. Resource production happens in real time, so you can just leave the game running and make as much ore and wood as you need (though money only comes from battles). This is where windowed mode would have been nice. After every new level you beat, your town faces a new dilemma you have to choose the outcome of. The dilemmas are well written but don't seem to have any actual gameplay consequences.\nSteam says I've played 4 hours, and I've beat almost half the levels, so I'd guess the total playtime will be 10 hours for one play-through. There are different towns you can play as but they have only minor differences so replaying with a different town wouldn't be too different of an experience.\n\nUpdate: Frogdice thoughtfully contacted me and corrected some screw-ups I made. The big one is that there IS a windowed mode, it's the last option on the options screen, and I managed to completely miss it. Another one is length: I've now done 34 levels (out of 50) with 8 hours played, so the game could end up being around 15 hours in one play through, not just 10. There's also an infinite tower after beating the game, but I can't speak to that.","April 23, 2014","true","38.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","2"

The town management aspect is simplistic, perhaps a bit too simplistic for my tastes.  I do appreciate what it does however in that it gives me a sense of progression.  Earning and spending resources gives me a reason to keep playing and luckily, you can grind earlier levels should you come up against something you’re not ready for.  It would have been better (in my opinion) if the resources were gained over time automatically as opposed to prodding the process along manually every few minutes…though this is a minor complaint.  I have to give the game credit though for trying something new…”ReignMaker” is unlike anything I’ve played up to this point.  For that reason alone, you should probably give it a go.

You're given a board full of tiles with a wave of oncoming enemies off to the side.  All you do is make matches and watch the bolts fly.  The city building provides you with resources to build weapons, learn spells, and hire warriors to aid you in battle.  The sim part is lighter than I expected, but it hads a fun element to the game.  Each time I beat a level I get presented with a decision to make as leader of the town.  Once, while I was away defending the kingdom, one of my villagers basically invented Candy Crush Saga.  It was almost the downfall of my civilization.  Not to mention the abilities of the higher tier druid allow them to send exploding sheep straight for your enemies.\n\nIn general, I really enjoyed this game.  I do think that the resoruce gathering needs a little tweaking, as it took me a lot longer than I would have liked to build things.  So I would just find a level I liked and play it over and over to kill time and earn gold so I could buy more warriors.  Certianly a good buy if you like these types of puzzle games.

I'm having a lot of fun with this game and it goes beyond just enjoying a match 3. In a normal match 3 you're focused on the board so you can discover opportunities for 4s and 5s or better, but there is a lot more to this game. You've got monsters creeping up to your base so you've got to make the matches that line up with them to destroy them and they might even drop some loot. Of course, you have to click on it to get it. Do you have time? What about that special gem you just scored on the board? Click it? The monsters are wailing away at your wall so you better decide fast! It's a lot to take in all at once.\n\nThat's just the battles. In between, you need to rule your kingdom with policies and deeds, improve the city buildings, train citizens, and much more. The improvements to the city result in the ability to earn even better weapons and spells for the battlefield. What more could you ask for? Troops? Got it! Now, you can deploy troops on your wall and I must say they are smashing (people who have played will get it). When do you deploy those troops? Do you take archers? Healers? Scouts? What about your equipment? Dummies? Swords? Exploding capsules? There are tons of combinations to let you deal with the battlefield and a great "RPG Interface" for improving them. The city is an absolutely awesome addition to this and really makes it a lot of fun.\n\nJust when you think aww, man is this thing just gonna be a match 3 grin--WTF is that?! An enormous boss stomps onto the screen and the fight is on. This is no easy task and it gets harder as you progress to many different and interesting bosses. Luckily, the art is totally charming so the journey is enjoyable and it is really livened up with a solid soundtrack that sets the mood.

This basic mechanic is pretty good, and quite well balanced for the most part - the only problem with it being that on bigger board, clearing the bottom row mindlessly is usually enough. In addition to that there's a "home village" which you grow as you clea boards... except it grows more like a free to play town.\n\nI don't recommend it though for a few reasons:\n\n- It has little "quests" (clear 5 gems, launch 30 attacks) that mostly frustrate and are often impossible (randomly requires certain equipped items or match 5s where the board is only big enough for 4s.\n- A gold collection mechanic that means constantly having to click tiny piles of gold on the other side of the screen from the board. Very irritating.\n- Free to play style resource collection (even though there are no IAPs). The progression feels totally wrecked and resource collection is oh so bad.\n- Skilled at landing chains? Doesn't matter. Chains only count for basic damage, and if you pop a line of 3 to chain react a 5, the 5 will not count for anything. No bonus gems, doesn't count toward quests... argh. Oh, and get a "match 30 quickly" quest? Chained matches don't count. Same for "match 5 airs". This seems... well, broken.\n\nIn summary, this game is so very "below average" in every respect, that you'd be better getting some other match 3 game.","July 23, 2014","false","3.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Sign me up, right?!\n\nUnfortunately, while there are a ton of great ideas in this game, the consolidated execution falls flat. Let's start with the good:\nCity building make you feel more involved in the story. After each mission, you're given a choice which affects the destiny of your city, adding characters and benefits to it, and allowing you to choose the feeling of your city. There's a variety of research spells and items you can use during combat. There are tons of achievements.\n\nNow the bad:\nPacing: While the real-time adds to the frantic feeling of the game, a lot of the time your efforts are wasted. In many early levels, you find yourself matching for no purpose and no reward except to maneuver the board. A lot of the time you just sit there waiting for the next enemies. Boss attacks are generally too fast to counter. It's hard to maintain view of both your puzzle board and the enemies.\nCity building timers make this feel like a facebook game. Seems like they planned to go the F2P route at one point. Limited resources make you feel like abandoning the city building aspect altogether. Items are single use, and generally worthless for the resource cost. Most of the spells seem ineffectual, and not grand.\nAchievements are too easy to get: 1/3 of them shouldn't even be considered real achievements as opposed to markers of playing the game.\n\nOverall, there's no oomph to this game. It lacks the polish and urgency of a speed match-3 game. It needs more audio or visual feedback when you kill a creature. The city building, spells and equipment aren't complex enough for a strategic game. It's above average in ideas, but it's all too visible flaws make it not worth it in the long run.\n\nRecommendation: pass.","August 13, 2014","false","7.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

To click on a stone and switch it with another takes nearly 10 clicks to move it or have it even recognize your existence, the town is lame and adds nothing to the game except for a farmville feeling. The campaign was decent until you get to the Obliterator who insn't fair at all, making you hit his infinite minions who require 3 blasts to take down and there are nearly almost 10 on the field at the same time. Not including how insane the campaign gets after that. If you even focus on the town at all you will need to push through the soggy later campaign to get those little triforces to do anything in the game. The situations you get to do is so lame and even doing the right thing or finding a clever way to solve it does nothing but show a +1 for something and you get no satisfaction out of it, making it a waste of time.  Getting stuck in the campaign with no way to progress or get items because you sunk your triforces into the damn farm means your stuck having to pray you dont find yourself stuck without any combos or switch's and believe me it happens. I can't believe you cant BUY triforces for this $15 game because it reminds me of a bad Candy Crush ripoff with a new twist that makes you want to hurl. Will I play it again? Yes, because this ♥♥♥♥ is addicting like heroin, but in the bad way that makes you curl up in a ball and cry about how pathetic you are for continuing something that hurts you so internally.

The policy decisions didn't feel like they did anything at all.

Not interacting with the game being valid seems like the design went off the rails.\n\nAlso the town choices don't feel like anything.  You always get the cheapest upgrade because that is always where the most bang for the buck is.  The upgrading of buildings feels like an arbitrary slowdown.\n\nIts OK but if you want to scratch the same itch as PuzzleQuest keep looking elsewhere.

Stated earlier it's a matching game, well some of the boards are not square, or have parts missing that make it hard and sometime near impossible to make a match. While monsters are beating down your towers you're fumbling around trying to make a match to damage them but there is no way. I guess this is why the spells are in the game, they can even out the play field sometimes however they take "matches" inorder to come off cooldown.

You will have enemies approaching from the side of your screen and must make matches in the same "row" as the enemy. (skeleton approaching at the next-to-top row of your screen? At least one of the element tiles in your match has to be somewhere in that next-to-top row to do any damage to the skeleton.) Matching tiles destroys the tiles, sends out an elemental bolt or fire/water/darkness/whatever ball streaking directly to the side that the enemies are approaching from. Any projectiles that hit an enemy do damage, and some enemies take more or less damage from different elements. This is an interesting change from the usual "make a match anywhere" of most match-3 games, but it can get quite frustrating on some of the boss fights where you need to deal a massive amount of damage to a relatively narrow area on the battlefield. Part of the game's charm, but also part of the frustration on harder bosses.\n\nMost of the enemies are of the "advance across the screen and beat upon the wall" variety, but the bosses have some unique mechanics (such as throwing fireballs that you can destroy if you happen to make a match and toss out a fireball in the exact right place to impact the boss's projectile). These add some definate flavor to the fights, but the relative difficulty of preplanning where the tiles are going to fall make these boss abilities more of a "counter if you can" situation and can at times turn downright deadly (if a chain match suddenly bounces a bunch of your own shots off of a boss's reflective force field).\n\nTo help with this, you can use the resources you gather in town to research/craft/hire various spells/items/defenders. As you level up certain buildings in town, you gain access to more potent enhancements.\n\nThe spells are reusable abilities with no limt to number of uses but which require you to make a certain number of matches to "charge up" the spell. The charge level for each spell carries over from match to match, so you need to make decisions whether to use a spell to help finish a battle or save it to open with on the next battle. Spells can destroy tiles (dealing damage to enemies), heal your fortress, shuffle the board, etc.\n\nCrafted items are consumeable (multiples can be stacked, but each time you use the item, your total available is reduced by 1 and you have to build/purchase more before you can use them again). Item effects range from stunning opponents to damaging them to preventing them from moving forward for a short time.\n\nDefenders are guard units that walk up and down along the top of your wall, and heal you or shoot arrows/roll bolders at enemies or run and grab dropped treasure, etc. Like items, defenders are consumed on use, and more must be hired to keep a steady supply. You can have two types of defenders active at once (and only one of each can be active at a time).\n\nAll of these enhancements are bought/researched through the town building minigame, which feels very lackluster. Gold, food, wood, and metal are used as resources for upgrading buildings or purchasing items, etc. While gold is gathered on the battlefield, the other resources have to be gathered in town, by waiting for the appropriate resource-generating building to slowly (and automatically) fill up with a resource, choosing to harvest what's available, and then slowly letting the resource fill up again. While resource building structures automatically fill up with a resource, they do not automatically harvest it, so you have to remember to manually harvest your pumpkins or ironwood or the building will just sit there useless until you empty it out. This plays more like a freemium mobile game's time-limited resource production, and can get quite frustrating later on, when battles take significantly less time than needed for your crops to grow/wood to be milled. It gets quite annoying to have to log on every so often just to gather your resources so you can eventually afford the new spell/stonethrowing guard/shiney bomb that you're waiting for to tip the scales in your favor for the next boss fight.\n\nAlso with the city building, there is no customization for placing buildings where you want, or adding buildings to enhance particular resource production. You have one place to gather wood. One place to grow food. One place to research spells. Buildings grow as you level them up, but you can't move/rotate/remove/anything. There are a few different "town themes" but you can't do any significant customization.\n\nThe one feature of the town itself that isn't terribly boring is the townsfolk, which wander around and sometimes have thought bubbles that you can click on for an amusing quip. Also, the townsfolk react to some of your victories by asking for "policy decisions" where you can pick whether to protect forested areas, anger your local druids, be lenient with thieves, send a beaten boss monster back to a far-away forested area or kill her off, etc. Most of these are humorously written, none seem to have "wrong" answers, and none have any effect on game play as far as I can tell.\n\nEven with the sometimes-frustrating fights, ReignMaker is a fun-for-a-bit casual match-3 game that's easy to pick up, put down for a few weeks, pick up again, etc., but it's not something that really grabs attention for hours on end. Between that and the lackluster town interface, resource gathering, and research/crafting system, I can't recommend paying full price for this game, especially compared to the asking price of some of the other match-3 games on Steam. If you can get it for 75% off or more (or part of a really-discounted bundle), it'll be an enjoyable game for occasional play. Just avoid buying it for full price unless you really MUST have every match-3 available.","November 28, 2014","false","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is fine but the maps get a bit... creative, and it can be really difficult to match on certain rows. There are some maps that are diamond-shaped and the top and bottom rows literally only consist of 1-square. It makes it very difficult.

I'll qualify by saying that I don't think I would have paid $15 for it, but if you can get it on sale or in a bundle, it's a good little game.\n\nWhat you will have to do is go into it without high expectations.  The graphics aren't outstanding and it's not going to break any ground in the match-3 space, but I've found it challenging enough to keep my interest.\n\nThe short version of the gameplay is that you match symbols which then allow you to attack rows of incoming enemies.  Sounds easy, but it's more difficult than it sounds.  I died more than I thought I would, which is actually OK because the gameplay is fast-paced and doesn't feel like a chore to play a level again.\n\nThe city-building isn't spectacular but it's simple enough and gives a good little break in-between the core game.

I do like the game for the matching and spell mechanics.  However, the game can be tedious and pretty random.  Since the boards can be different than just a huge square box, there can be times where you literally can only make 3 match vertically to damage the highest and lowest lines.  If you don't have spells to kill the enemies, then you will lose pretty much all the time with no way to really deal damage to them until the board randomly allows you to match 3 vertical 5 times in a row.  You think if there are spells to deal damage that would be fine only to realize you have to wait a decent amount of time to collect resources (wood specifically) in order to upgrade your buildings to research the required spell.\n\nI've literally failed a map 31 times. Usually I couldn't get the spells necessary or the random board to do enough damage to kill all the highest / lowest mobs.  When you have a board where there are only 2 gems on the top and bottom lines and you have 5 mobs coming on that line that need to be hit 2-5 times before they die... it's going to be pretty tedious.  I'm still waiting on my wood to refill so I can upgrade and get the destroy row spell and hope that fixes the problem.\n\nThe resource gathering aspect makes it feel like an idle game that you have to babysit in order to collect your resources every 10 minutes or so in order to progress with upgrading buildings, research spells, build weapons, or high mercs.","March 28","false","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
