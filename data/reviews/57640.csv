Simply put I compared this version with the original version which is available to watch on a YouTube walkthrough, and it seems that more than half of the dialogue is cut out in the "director’s cut". Not only that but many of the interactive options throughout the game are also cut, unless they are directly involved in progressing the games story.  I guess the aim was to streamline the game or move the story along more quickly, but by cutting out much of the dialogue and gameplay they have inadvertently cut out most of the charm and humour that I experienced when playing the original game. Would definitely recommend finding the original rather than this version, I brought this as part of a trilogy so just hoping the other two games haven't been butchered as well!","January 9, 2015","false","3.4"," 89 of 105 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","89","105","2","1"

Back in 1996, the player was thrown out into a graphic noir world very much like our own, one brimming over with unique personalities who don’t think of themselves as cogs in a giant machine, but people getting suitably annoyed at the pushy American who won’t stop showing people the soiled tissue he found in the sewers and asking them if it means anything to them. Now updated, a lot of the dialogue options are cut in an attempt to streamline the adventure, making the Templar mysteries a significantly greater focus point, but in doing so, it robs the title of so much of its former wealth. Interactive hotspots are not only slashed in half, but are made instantly visible, taking away the nagging frustration of room-sweeping with your mouse to find them yourself, but also highlighting just how much the new version wants to hold your hand. Including an in-game hint system is understandable: a stuck player only needs visit numerous online walkthroughs should they decide coping with their frustration early is better than the cerebral rewards of working through a puzzle, but gone also are the numerous instances where George could make a fatal mistake. Leave an exclusive French hotel with an important and newly-discovered clue, and fail to remember the pair of Italian gangsters hanging around the entrance, and the last thing you’ll remember before being gifted a pair of concrete shoes and invited for a swim is an aggressive frisking and an insincere goodbye. Now, try and leave through the same door, and George will warn you that it’s not a good idea. Then tells you exactly why!\n\nFull review -- http://www.honestgamers.com/9033/pc/broken-sword-directors-cut/review.html","December 31, 2013","false","7.6"," 94 of 130 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","94","130","0","5"

It's one of my favorite adventure games of all time, I grew up with it. Hearing about an update to one of my favorite games made me weary but I remained optimistic. Naturally, I tried to like it. But I just can't.\n\nThis revision completely butchered the original on so many levels; it's a disgrace. I am majorly disappointed with how this was handled.\nThe new arc doesn't bring anything new or interesting to the table (especially if you never played the original before, newcomers get nothing out of this new story) and seems unnecessarily tacked on. It explores a side story that is negligible in the greater context and waters down the impact of the original story's writing and pacing immensely.\nThe new environments, icons and character models look really out of place when displayed right next to their by now 17 year old assets which in my opinion negatively impacts the immersion and cohesiveness: the clashing art styles and different asset qualities make the game feel terribly stitched together.\nThe shoddy new UI (which is optimized for touchscreen devices; use of a cursor feels awkward which is a disaster considering the original is a Point & Click classic), automatically displayed points of interaction as well as the help system make the game unbearable when you are familiar with the original.\n\nRevolution went to the extremes with the handholding which is terribly annoying: everything is pointed out to you and instantly made visible. You never feel taken seriously as a player and it's almost as if the game doesn't want or need your skills to be solved. It rather points at everything with a flashy sign as if you were near-blind.\n\nSadly, Revolution took the phrase Directors 'Cut' a bit too literally. Removed were details like waving flags, idle animations and ambient sounds but also integral parts of the game like dialogue and entire scenes. The cut narrative aspects break the game's story and writing, which was already impaired by the new sidestory.\nThe missing details destroy the charm the original used to have, the charm that made players fall in love this game. This content was removed for absolutely no logical reason and is a decision of the developer I can't understand or get behind. Who thought this was a good idea? Cutting parts of your story doesn't do the game's pacing any favors whatsoever.\n\nThe most jarring of all the omissions however is that you can't die. This is absolute nonsense.\nThe original version of Broken Sword had a ton of situations where wrong decisions could get you killed (Video Contains Spoilers). Presumably, this was done in order to save the player from losing too much or all of their progress. Removing this aspect however, eliminates incredibly much suspense and is a case of game design decisions meant to appeal to a contemporary audience causing the loss of a lot of suspense, gameplay, atmosphere and ultimately enjoyment for the player.\nIf you are curious about the extent of the changes, you can find some of them here: http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=254238\n\nRegardless whether you experienced the original or not, use ScummVM to play the original release if you can obtain it (Or purchase it via GOG where you will receive both versions with one purchase) and let this abomination rot in the store. You will get a more polished, detailed and cohesive gameplay experience out of it.\nWho knows what Charles Cecil and Revolution were thinking. But it certainly wasn't anything good.\n\n--\nEDIT: Fixed a few typos and revised wording.\n--\nPlease note that I previously purchased this version of the game outside of Steam (iOS) and completed it, the playtime recorded by Steam is not indicative of my total experience with the Director's Cut version.","August 27, 2011","false","1.8"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","33","41","0","2"

Sometimes of course you get frustrated because you trying to figure out this puzzle and in no damn way you can make it work. BUT, when you finally do get through, a sense of achievement and satisfaction comes through that gets your back into the groove again.\n\nThe story itself is one big buildup from the start to finish with interacting with interesting characters all over.\n\nThe art style is great aswell, even though its quite dated now, it still brings a classic feel towards it and really dosnt dampen the gameplay itself like other titles might.\n\nHaving the game to play through again brings back the great feeling i had when i was young.

I loved this game back in the mid-90s, and couldn't wait to play the new, updated version. But, while they flesh out the character of Nico and expand on her background and personal stake in the investigation (an unnecessary change, but fun), they also seem to have...er...forgotten scenes from the original game. Important scenes. Scenes that move the plot along, explain details of the narrative, etc. Were they omitted? Cut for time? Bugged?\n\nEG: In the original, George steps into a hidden alcove in Ireland, and discovers an important clue -- a portrait with an image and a name. But in the Director's Cut George steps into the alcove and then it suddenly cuts back to Nico in Paris; she engages in her own new bit of investigation for a while (completely tangential to the main narrative), and George reappears in Paris not 5 minutes later with only a note in his journal about what he found in the alcove. Why was this changed? What is the purpose of it? They removed a scene CRUCIAL to the main narrative just so they could shoehorn in a mildly interesting superfluous side-story. That could have made a certain narrative sense, it's true, but they didn't alter anything George says or thinks after the scene was cut; he then refers to what he apparently saw as though the player/audience should already have seen it for themselves. Problems like this abound, as do audio hiccoughs -- like when one character is supposed to be speaking, but for no reason the voice-actor of the person they're speaking to is reading their dialogue, complete with the wrong accent and gender! It's bizarre! Did I get some sort of April Fool's Day edition of the game?!?\n\nIn fact, the more I look at the art and advertising for this updated version, you'd think George was the shoehorned in side-character! All the focus is on Nico, she begins the game, her personal side-narrative takes precedence over the main investigation, and George just comes across as a bumblin' sidekick. It's surreal -- like an alternate universe version of the game I loved. Why not release a separate game or expansion featuring all this new Nico-centric material? It would have saved them the effort of cutting out the old scenes and bugging the audio and video of the game...\n\nIn any event, i cannot in good conscience recommend the Director's Cut. The Nico side-stories help pad out the game, but come at too high a cost.\n\nPS: This game also perpetuates the myth that the Templars were idol-worshipping pagans devoted to Baphomet, a legend which (like "Baphomet") was created during the waves of persecution & torture instituted by the French with papal approval in the 14th century C.E. / A.D. This detail will drive historians and even casual enthusiasts crazy, and miseducate those ignorant of the Templars' history and the Crusades, but it doesn't ruin the game itself.

It may suffer from blocky animation and dreadful voice quality, but the thrilling plot and the quality of the puzzles will always make it a true classic.\n\nLong version:Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars is Revolution Software’s best-known and probably most successful game, known for its sheer length (easily over 12 hours for a first-timer) and good puzzle balance.\n\nThe story can be described as a modern conspiracy theory thriller featuring an everyday man getting drawn deeper and deeper into the Templar myth, while trying to solve an ancient riddle and staying ahead of his murderous pursuers. To do his he travels all over the world from Ireland to the Middle East, aided by a sassy photojournalist and a bunch of stereotypical, yet cartoonishly entertaining supporting cast.\n\nThe puzzles are what you expect from a classic adventure game. They are complicated, sometimes convoluted, not too often logical, but if you get yourself in the typical adventure game mind-set, most of them can be passed with little difficulties. (Except the goat. *censored* that goat.)\n\nAlthough Broken Sword features some exceptional backgrounds and decent animation, it is not without technical difficulties. Especially when it comes to audio: most of the dialogue sounds as if it was recorded in an underground chamber, and none of the actors do a particularly good job. Also, in the Remastered Edition there is an additional prologue segment that just does not fit into the game at all.\nBut these are really minor complaints compared to the sheer amount of fun one can have with this classic adventure title that is still one of the best of its kind even to this day.","April 8, 2015","true","9.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I have tons of memories playing the original Broken Sword game on PC. So what was the Director's Cut version like? The best I can say is "It was good" It didn't really give me what I was hoping it would give.\n\nOne thing that it added from the original game which is probably my favourite addition is that it adds Nico as a playable character and she was just a major character in the original.\n\nAside from that there wasn't really much more of a reason for me to play it a second time through. I like most of the new changes that it gives this game like the hint system. But I'm thinking of one thing in particular, one change that I was annoyed about and that was the goat puzzle. This puzzle that was in the original broken sword was called as one of the hardest puzzles in a video game and it took me a week to figure out that puzzle and I felt amazing after I finally solved it. But in the Director's cut they simplified the puzzle. I'm not sure why revolution would do this. I don't think it needed to be simplified because of the newly added hint system, if players struggled with the puzzle they could just ask the hint system for help.\n\nOne other problem I have with this Director's cut is that I can tell the difference between the audio that's been taken from the original game and the audio that has been recorded just for the director's cut because the director's cut audio sounds more clear and the audio that has been put into the director's cut from the original game sounds a bit more static. This makes some of the audio sound out of place and some of the new audio is done by different voice actors.\n\nAside from that I do like the director's cut but I only recommend it to people who haven't played the original as there isn't really that much new to offer to people who played the original\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","January 11","true","0.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

I didn't play the original Adventure but I know that besides a graphic update there's a consistent section dedicated to Nico where we'll see some interesting locations and acquire some informations useful to better understand the main quest. As usual we'll be kicked straight into action: Nico has been invited for an interview with the statesman Pierre Carchon, which has just been murdered the exact moment she arrives. George is just a tourist in Paris enjoying a break just outside a local Café which is blown away by an explosion. Their investigations will make them meet and join forces for a common purpose.\nI have to say this is the chapter I've enjoyed the most (I've played the first 3, now I'm about to play the 4th) as I really liked the riddles, especially the crypted codes Nico must solve. Another very important thing are characters because most of the people you meet will make an appearence again in the following games which is something I really appreciated (no particular spoiler has been done with this statement). However everything in the game (the characters, some riddles) are not to be taken too seriously as both the protagonists (especially George) and some situations with a few characters are quite silly.\nThe story is interesting and has few interesting turning points and will make you visit various locations from the world, while the interface we'll use to move in this adventure is a classic point & click setup, with mouse controls, a classic inventory system and most importantly many choices of subjects for dialogues with other characters.\n\n+++Pros+++ NEW SIDE STORY. This director's cut adds a new Section Completely dedicated to Nico, and this alone adds a lot of depth in the story. This section will alternate with George parts giving the game what will be the classic Broken Sword structure that will become a standard in the next chapters, where we play constantly with both George and Nico in separate situations that will later join in a unique context.\nPUZZLES. There are some nice and interesting puzzles, though I've been really struck by the crypted code puzzles in nico's section. Sounds odd but I really enjoyed those puzzles.\nPLOT. Maybe the subject doesn't shine with originality but maybe that's because I've played it in 2015. Still its story is nicely structured and has some interesting plot twists.---Cons--- ACTIONS REQUIRE ACTIONS. Even some obvious actions or sections are completely locked unless you observe carefully or talk with some characters first, but maybe it's right this way anyways...","January 3","true","8.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

You play as both George Stobbart and Nico Collard, a tourist and journalist that end up interwined in a thick plot of conspiracy and adventure dealing with the rebirth of the Knights' Templar. The quest for the Broken Sword of Baphomet takes you from the calm and romantic Parisian streets to the most perilous of Syrian deserts as you trek the globe in search of clues and answers to the game's many innovative and ingenius puzzles. Each and every one of these locations are brilliantly animated, resulting in what's simply one of the most beautiful adventure games of recent memory. Broken Sword: Shadow Of the Templars is not to be missed by anyone, whether you are a veteran point and click gamer, or just looking for a thrilling experience with a great plot, fantastic graphics and a somewhat 'Indiana Jones' feel that you won't soon forget!","July 25, 2014","true","9.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You will have to use your brain, but will also have a lot of fun doing so, and there is always a feeling of satisfacion when you hear the audio cue indicating that you solved the puzzle.\n\nThe strongest thing about this game is it's story and everything related to it. You play as George Stobbart, a young American lawyer, and Nicole Collard, a French journalist, who get involved in a murder investigation that ends up leading them on  a quest to find an ancient Templar treasure. The story is pretty interesting and it did keep me hooked to the screen despite not having a shocking twist or big reveal. A nice take on the Temlpars before the Den Brown era and the time when Templars have become,in my opinion, so overused that they have become annoying. It is a simple story of mistery and adventure, but quite an enjoyable one. Mostly thanks to fantastic writing and voice acting. It is a joy to listen to all the characters and their conversations, and the game is filled with entertaining side characters.It is truely amazing how much work was put into every character that comes in contact with the protagonists, to the point that you remember each and every one of them and some of their lines. The game has a serious tone most of the time, but just enough humor to keep a smile on your face. Conversation that include both George and Nicole are especially fun, since their common dialogue is some of the best in the game, and they have quickly become one of my favourite game couples.\n\nAn excellent story, great writing, awesome and fun puzzles.

It's at a good price. It has a good story, and hours of entertainment. However, I had an issue with it that I will describe below after the spoiler alert.\n\n***Spoiler alert!\n\n\nMy issue is with this particuIar version of the game. I never played the original and I didn't know how different this game was from it. As I playing (the Director's Cut), it became obvious that the game is made of some new material mixed in with the original because the quality differences between the two versions is noticeable. I wondered what the deal was with that when the quality switched over.\n\nThe game begins with Nico, the attractive girl used on the Steam store page's cover art.  I thought to myself, "I guess she is the protagonist." Turns out that the actual protagonist is George Stobbart. Which was fine, I just found it odd that the game starts with Nico and you play her for 10 percent of the game and the rest of the game you play as George. Now I know that her small story was the added content.\n\nSome differences that I noticed when I looked up the original on YouTube was that the animated cut scenes were longer, there seemed to be more dialog, and there was none of that comic book windowing with facial close-ups.  The game starts with George at the cafe instead of with Nico. It made way more sense to me, narrative-wise, to start the game there.\n\nMy advice, if you can, play the original. If you can't, this version will do just fine.","June 18, 2015","true","12.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Top-notch voice acting doing justice to a script filled with laughs, sly wit, and over the top spoofs and in its own way is every bit as good of a narrative as the Dreamfall series.\n\nOnce you move away from the story elements Broken Sword shows itself in every way to be a superior game. The inventory system is better, the graphics have been updated, the puzzles mesh with the story, and the in-game hint system both manages to keep immersion intact while allowing the player to set their own level of difficulty, in saying that, it’s still the original content that steals the show.\n\nIt's impossible to objectively criticize the first instalment of the Broken Sword series without nit-picking. Perhaps the only fair criticism is that the puzzles are not super demanding even without the hints. However, the sad truth is the most of the challenge to the puzzles in other games comes from bad design, not intellectual sophistication. When all and said and done Broken Sword: TDC is the best adventure game because everything in it just works synergistically to keep the player to keep on playing.\n","May 18, 2014","true","34.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is of course old now, but it was still a very gripping adventure for me, and I look forward to playing the later entries in the series. In short: Pleasant artwork, wonderful music, interesting story, great voice acting, several humorous moments, and lots of puzzles. Some simple, some more challenging, which would usually be offputting to me, but the game also has a brilliant hint system for when you are really stuck. It is actually hard to fault the game at all, but there are sometimes cases where you know what you need to do, but the game decides that's not how it will be done -- so you need to find a specific person to talk to or whatever first. A small gripe, and a very common one for this type of game, although it feels like the game should have been longer as well...

A few years ago I got the game on android which first allowed me to hear the voice acting again which was fun. However I noticed something was off, I noticed it didn't have the same punch as the original, a lot of lines are cut and the scenes don't blend well with each other.\n\nI recommend watching this scene until George leaves the cafe from the original broken sword game:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xFMHIu2zKcE?t=536\n\nNow I'd like you to watch the same scene from the director's cut:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/c_Qq-wLX-xI?t=124\n\nSo my original impression of the director's cut having a little more content is kinda wrong as there are spots all over in this game that are like this. Director's cut removes dialogue and cuts scenes in a way that makes it look like it was done by a bunch of amateurs. Nico's side story is poorly done and never even talked about when it is finished and you can't die in the game. I'm sure most are disappointed by this because there is one part of the game where you die and it's kinda scary on the original because you can mess it up really easily. Now the tension is all gone and the scene itself is completely ruined.\n\nThe developers or Steam should really give the option of playing the original, because then I would say YES BUY THIS GAME NOW, but for now. Find and play the follow:\nOriginal retail PC version\nPlaystation version\nGOG Version (Even the GOG version includes the ORIGINAL VERSION)\n\nEven if the number of hours I've played isn't high, I've played this version of the game for a total of 20 hours overall and this just isn't worth it.","April 12","false","0.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I have heard a lot about this series as the years passed and now I had the opportunity to play it myself. Normally not a fan of point and click adventures I have to say that given the age and history of the game I really like it. Some cliché story elements to be sure but what really struck me was how incredibly witty this game can be. I have too many scenes to quote that if I would merely start I would quickly fill several pages worth.\nThe puzzles also stood out for me. Decoding messages and moving puzzles around in a fashion that I have, to my great disappointed realization, never encountered in any form in any modern game. The puzzles are simplistic in nature but brilliant in execution and are genuinely tricky even for a puzzle veteran like myself.\nThe hints system is a gem for people prone to getting stuck. It levels small suggestions to more direct hints to giving you the solution outright if you as for enough hints.\nThe story is nice but in this day and age it's not very original. For me it's the journey to the end that makes the fun part of this brilliant game. The side characters you encounter are most memorable in my opinion. English ladies, Spanish aristocrats, French police officers.\nI only really have two complaints about this game. The ending is a liiittle anticlimactic. but my #1 main issue is when switching areas and watching the characters walking around is sooo slooow and gets old very rapidly.\n\nI closing I would very much recommend Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars to friends of classics, puzzles and adventure.

That, and some added mini-games make the experience a little fresher for old fans returning to the series. This isn't one for the gameplay, though; it's all about the story, humourous dialogue and the many whacky characters you meet along the way.

At the end you get a Director's scene telling you how the series came about and that too was moderately interesting.\nNone of the puzzles are overly onerous.\n\nthe bad - The character development needed more.  Almost all characters in this version of the game are somewhat bland - you really feel limited to no affinity for any of them.

There's a helpful hint system, interactive objects flash with a small icon, and there are the usual visual and audio upgrades you'd expect.  You'll still run into some infuriating moments of classic adventure game puzzledom, but the hint system is fairly clear and the pixel hunting is, thankfully, kept to a minimum.  The hand-drawn graphics look sharp, but sometimes the speech seems slightly off, as though some dialogue was spliced in using different equipment.  It can be a bit jarring.  For the most part, though, this is a serviceable remake of a classic adventure game, and the story is still a fun little mystery romp.","March 3, 2014","true","0.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Great humor, probably not Monkey Island-funny, but very quirky and wry - I laughed more times than I could count.

I was quite disappointed to see, how the animated cut scenes have been crippled by the "directors cut". Even more after I heard that dialogues might have been removed from the game to streamline the gaming experience for a generation that finds it hard to keep a focus for more than 10 minutes.

The voice acting itself is outrageous with some of the most over the top accents you'll ever here - Geordie accent included!\n\nSome of the puzzles are still genuine headscratchers, but the good type - Mav, Priit and Saj attempted to help.

This game is no Syberia or Myst, but it has it's strenghts.\n\nWhat I love about the game is the story line and the hint system. The story is actually engrossing and makes sense - the two protagonists are trying to solve a mystery involving the knights templar, leading the gameplayer down a path to understand their order and mission. The hints are great - they have a tiered system and it allows you to easily pick up from where you left off, even if it has been days since you logged on (great if you are a casual gamer!).\n\nWhat I don't like is the often cumbersome animations. This is especially true if you are trying to go from one area to another but there is one short animation prior to leaving the area...you have to watch the character walk all the way across the screen, watch the animation, and then you move to the next room. When you're close to solving a puzzle, this gets rather annoying.\n\nOtherwise, this is a fun, casual game.","November 15, 2014","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is captivating, and you really feel like a character, discovering things as they do, and that adds to it feeling like an adventure. The dark-cartoon world it takes place in is done very well.

Full of mystery and danger like for example Dan Brown's stories. Good for everyone who can appreciate a game for that. The puzzles aren't frustrating at all and progress makes you feel good and smart. Director's Cut version contains additional pieces of the story from the side of the secondary character, Nico. She's a playable character now in these few added bits and we discover some more background related to her that connects to the general story. There are also some added puzzles and some new graphics like portraits of characters when they talk, but that somtimes looks a bit out of place in contrast with the graphics of such an old game. However... They removed the few time critical puzzles where you had to do the right quickly to survive some danger. You can no longer die. The main character automatically knows the right thing to do in those moments. That's just one small regret, no biggie.

I still had Broken Sword 1 & 2 to replay which were both fantastic. When I heard Broken Sword was coming back with Broken Sword 5 I had realised I really did walk away from the series as I didnt even know there was a 4th lol. Now that all 5 games have been released on Steam as an oldschool fan I will be playing through 1 & 2 again and then I will go into 3 and 4 with an open mind and look forward to the return to a 2d adventure game in 5. I have the original CD copy of 1 & 2, but when I saw they were re released as a remastered directors cut's on Steam I decided to buy them again.\n\nBroken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars – Director's Cut\nI went into the remastered version a little aprehensive, as we all know when creators go back and mess with things that were already great they can make alterations that will annoy returning fans etc.\n\nTurns out my my apprehension was unfounded. The additions they did were fairly small but a nice touch. A new part of the story has been added at the start which enhances Nicole's story and allows you to play as her in parts of the game which was not in the first version. There are also new puzzles and the addition of dialouge boxes on either side of the screen during conversations.\n\nThere are some minor issues for me. Certain parts of the game have been cut down or removed from the original and unfortunatley some of the old cutscenes were removed and the ones that remain have been toned down a little also their is now a hint system. Maybe this is to stop new players getting frustrated with some of the puzzles etc. Regardless of these, it is still a great game.\n\nI would recommend this game to Vetran Broken Sword fans to replay through this great game again. I would also strongly recommend this game to any other 2D adventure game fans (Grim Fandango, Monkey Island etc.) who may have missed the Broken Sword series.\n\nVery pleased with this as I was back in 96.\n\nI have yet to play 5 but lets hope with its success more Broken Swords will follow.","January 17","true","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/57640/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","Unfortunately this isn't a game I would want to play again anytime soon. As I have understood, a lot of original content was cut from the game and replaced to make the game more storydriven as well as helping you along the way to solve things a.k.a handholding.\n\n~ Good ~\n\nGraphics:\nI think they are beautiful for its time. The animation is extremely smooth, the characters move realistic and at times it's hard to think they are built out of simple pixels. The backgrounds are all well detailed and even the background characters have solid animation.\n\nVoice acting:\nIt's quite obvious some of the voices were re-recorded and others are still old. Sometimes it will sound like someone is sitting in an empty room, with a slight echoing sound to it. Other times you hear that the sounds are clearer. The english voiceacting is fine. Nicole has a lovely voice, but I honestly can't understand a thing she says without subtitles. She has a very thick french accent, so it isn't the fault of the game.\n\nCharacters:\nI found that the background characters bring most of the fun to the game. Some of them are very weird in a quirky way (the kebab seller) and they are the ones responsible for the funny dialogue. Between the boring story, it was fun to hang around and talk to these characters. I wish there had been more of this and less about the Templars.\n\n\n~ Bad ~\n\nStory:\nI honestly found this one boring, hence why I am reluctant to play it again. I think it was a bad thing to give the story so much focus. As you are mostly trying to find information about it, all you do is listen to people talk, talk, talk, talk, talk... ugh. The ending was also grossly dissapointing. Imagine spending hours upon hours trying to find this one final part and it's not even half of what it was hyped up to be.\n\nDialogue heavy:\nThis game relies heavily on you listening to conversations and if you don't snap up the important parts, you are going to have hell trying to solve some of the puzzles. A lot of the dialogue feels repeatetive as you are asking about the very same thing. The “oh so myserious” Templars and everyones opinion on it.\n\nSoundtrack:\nI found all the music out of place and some of the special effect sounds got on my nerve. Whenever the characters are experiencing a happy moment, the cheesiest of tunes plays in the background. The music also seems extremely loud compared to the voice acting. I keep the music at 20% and the voices at 100%, yet I still find that cheesy tune overpowering some of the conversations.\nWhenever you try to use an object on an area which you'll be able to use an item at some point, a glittering sound is played. I am guessing to help the player find clues, but it becomes extremely distracting and tedious, especially when you have 10 items to try. There's also short tunes playing anytime the characters make a conclusion to something, which also gets quite cheesy after a while. Despite these obvious hints, I found the game wasn't clear at all as to what it wanted you to do. Your only kind of help is a question mark that pretty much repeats the very same question you have, without giving any hints at how to solve the problem.\n\nLack of interactions:\nThere really doesn't happen much in the game besides dialogue. Most of the puzzles are solved by listening to dialogue or showing the right item for more dialogue. Sometimes the only way to advance the story is talking to everyone in a different order to get the information you need. And the sad things is, the dialogue about the story is the most boring part of the game. I only had fun when I was allowed to use items in the environment to solve things, or try to figure out how to get past guards without them taking an item from me. Dialogue is 90% of the game and the rest is some puzzle solving.\n\nAwful minigames:\nThe first minigame involves solving a cypted message, which contains at least 2 names which you have heard maybe once or twice throughout the gameplay. Another terrible minigames involves you having to put roman numbers in order of a message, then click a button, then order them correctly again. All in a specific order. And what happens if you mess up 7/8? The whole puzzle resets and you have to do it all over again! Ugh! And the numbers move slow.\n\nRemoved content:\nThis game has obviously been censured by removing the death scenarios. There was supposed to be a timed action scene with a deadly outcome, but instead George will automatically solve the problem for you. So much for suspense?\nIt's also dissapointing that once you solve one of the bigger mysteries, the screen just cuts and all you get is George words about what it was. Appearently he picks up an item from a room, but seeing him do so is completely removed, as is everything he does and sees in the room. And this is after solving the tedious roman puzzle! Way to go rewarding the player by removing one of the most important scenes after forcing them through the worst minigame.","February 1, 2014","false","12.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Spoilers: you're not going to find it in this game.\n\nGameplay-wise: Speaking as a person who only encountered Broken Sword recently and thus in its newest version only, I found the game passably engaging. The puzzles do make you think and offer a large range of potential combinations, although there are places where it drags because the game expects you to do something completely counter-intuitive and gives no feedback on whether you're doing it right, so you go through every single item and combination thereof, then dialogue choices, and finally click everything before you hit it. The hint system might as well not have existed, since it didn't help me and apparently annoyed previous lovers of the game. The graphics are what you might expect from a decade old game, not really updated but not too terrible.\n\n[Some spoilers] As for the characters, you play as Nico Marlet, who is a fairly decent character, drawn into the murder of her newest interviewee and subsequent meddling into her life, for about 30 minutes out of a 7 hour playthrough. The rest of the time you play as George Stubbart, whose only connection to the whole affair was he happened to be at a cafe when it blew up to kill the man inside, and decided he had to solve the crime for great justice or something. He takes center stage and then keeps it for the rest of the game while Nico sits at her apartment and waits, or seduces someone over the phone, or talks to an archaelogist friend to create a really gross doubly-oneside love triangle centered around her. Also there is a very dubious (consent-wise) scene later in the game between George and Nico, whose romance doesn't really have any substance beyond George thinking she's pretty a few times? So many things seem shoehorned in without proper support. It's both baffling and irritating.\n\nIf you want a decent head-scratcher and don't mind a host of gender issues, then pick this up. If you wanted a game which treats its women respectfully, don't do what I did. Buy another game.","June 24, 2014","false","8.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

This is, by and large, a safe bet for a great game\n\nAs a newcomer though... I'm not entirely bowled over\n\nDone right, point-and-click can be brilliant. Certainly, the start of the game is very engaging. You're exploring places for useful / hidden items and trying to work out how to piece them all together. It's not long before you're given some challenging but great puzzles to solve too (the door lock and the decryption of the letter) - The characters are also quickly likeable, and George's charm in fumbling around Paris is certainly endearing. The game also packs a lot more humour than you'd expect - And I confess I garnered probably too much amusement from showing people soiled tissues, drain-openers and desperately trying to make them shake my hand\n\nSo why the thumbs down?\n\nAfter the quick-draw of puzzles at the start, they almost seemed to dry up. The 'thinking' puzzles largely became talking to people in the correct order or showing them a certain item to trigger an event... which then required you to talk to yet more people. Whilst the reactions were fresh and entertaining to begin with, I admit I started getting impatient half way through the game and sometimes skipped through the unimportant dialogue or George telling me the item was not suitable - my heart sank a bit when I walked into a pub of about 5-6 characters... all to talk to, all with around 6-8 potential dialgues (based upon the item I show them). It started becoming a lot of sitting around and wasn't massaging my cerebral matter very much\n\nYour actions also don't really seem to amount to much. You have a few 'options' in dialogue, but where they seem to garner the same results, it felt a bit pointless. You can't exactly seem to do things "wrong", and it's sometimes just trial and error (and clicking) until you find the right one. In effect, you find you're not quite exploring the game, but just fumbling around until you can find the plot trail it ultimately had prepared for you. It basically started feeling like less of a game and more that I was slowly clicking my way through a film\n\nIt was engaging enough to see me through to the end, for sure - though a tad anti-climactic. The graphics were delightful (nicely remastered without too many elements where the old pixellated style was evident) and voice acting great... but it just didn't do it for me","December 8, 2014","false","11.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Still, i'd like to talk about this game. 'This game' being Broken Sword: Director's cut. It has been quite some time since it's release, but there isn't a single game that couldn't be brought back to life with a bit of steam and continue it's miserabre existence as an inflatable doll. But back to the point. I like Broken Sword. It's a rather good-looking (for it's age) point'n'click adventure game with occasional puzzles which i found pleasantly challenging and kind of refreshing as i would't get stuck every two minutes like I tend to do in this sort of games. It tells a story of a snob french reporter lady living in paris in her never ending quest for not living adequatly to her means and an american tourist of whom every nazi ideologist would be proud - a blonde, blue-eyed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They visit locations all over the world, or I should rather say the blonde guy does the visiting because the lady is always 'busy', what leads us to the main characters' relationship, which is kind of awkward since they istantly start behaving like a couple of old elephants sharing the same cage in a zoo for twenty years - they don't really like each other, but they will still have sex simply because there's no other option. Apart from cutscenes and logic-based puzzles we have inventory-based puzzles, which are well made - solutions resemble the ones a human in a state of being mildly high would think of. And there's talking. Here, despite visiting various countries including Spain and Syria the biggest problem concerning language is that Americans call holiday vacation. All that serves the purpose of discovering the mystery behind knights templar - a quite exploited theme nowadays, but as we established the game is a classic and what do I know. But wait, there are assassins - what a blatant AC ripoff!","December 23, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

I think it is much longer than I anticipated it to be, which is nice actually.  I haven't played the first game or any of the new Broken Sword games since, but considering the time period in which it was made, it is still not bad graphicly (granted new games are made to look like this one).  You have two characters who are out to search clues in an old manuscript they have found that have to do with the Knights Templar during the Crusade period.  There is a murderer involved and mysteries to be solved.  You get to figure out clues and follow the trail of finding "the broken sword" which isn't really mentioned until halfway through the game, by the way.  I've been playing this game for the past few months slowly at intervals and hope to finish it soon (as I type this I am 71% through the story).

Saw this one listed on a couple of top adventure game lists; thought I'd give it a try.\n\nThe game begins with our intrepid heroine Nico going to meet with some high-fallutin' Parisien media mogul only to witness his murder. First thing I noticed when I got control of the character? That blue flashing light that indicates things the character can interact with. Helpful at first, but later an annoyance when I realized I was searching the screens for the blue light instead of actually looking at what was on the screen. Really annoyed when I realized there was no way to turn it off.\n\nSo I stumbled from place to place with Nico, equally despising and yearning for that blue light, occasionally solving mildly difficult logic puzzles made even easier by the detailed instructions that left me wondering if this coupled with the blue light meant the game considered me some sort of idiot who couldn't figure things out on my own. (I'm playing Broken Sword after having just completed Black Mirror, which gave no instructions on how to solve its puzzles - and therefore left me feeling more satisfied when I did solve them.)\n\nThen suddenly I'm controlling George, an American lawyer who witnesses another murder and even though he has nothing to do with the murder or the case, he decides to get involved. I'm still unsure on his motivations for that (or why that workman didn't stop what he was doing to come help after the bombing! The dude was RIGHT THERE and never put down his shovel... Egads...)\n\nAnyway, the two characters decide to share info, even though so far as I can tell Nico's the only one who has anything invested in all this. From then on the playable character switches back and forth, often when I'm not ready for it (I thought I had more to investigate! Which I guess means I did all the stuff required to move on already...?). And sometimes the game takes me to the next location I need to go instead of letting me figure out where to go next.\n\nI saved my game after playing somewhere in the range of two hours and saw my progress was 25% through the game. That really bummed me out. This was way too fast and too easy. Again, I grew up on adventure games in a pre-internet world. Sometimes I'd get stuck and it'd take weeks or months before I or my brother would have an epiphany and discover what we had to do next. This plays like it's meant to be rushed through in an afternoon, perhaps by people who don't want to stretch their brains too much. So I did a bit of research and discovered this version - the Director's Cut - is actually quite different from the original, in which you only play George (the guy who - so far - has no reason to be involved in this story?!) and there's no blue light and you can die and, ARGH why can't I play that version?!\n\nWell, apparently I can. Now I'll just have to wait for it to go on sale on the other site. Bummer. After I finish Original Flavor, I'll come back and try this one again.\n\nThe graphics and animations are just fine. So is the voice-work, except for when suddenly someone else is voicing the main character and trying to imitate the original, or certain lines of dialogue sound like they were recorded in a wind tunnel. Also annoying is having to sit there and watch two characters have a telepathic conversation (their mouths don't move), though I have encountered that in other games I've played, and I suppose the animations would be a pain, especially considering the amount of languages this game was made for.\n\nI can't really say much about the story so far as I've barely delved into it. The whole thing is giving me a Gabriel Knight vibe (which is a good thing!) except not as dark (literally). But I love Templar history and mysteries so hopefully the story turns out to be groovy (and I can recommend this game after getting my hands on the original).\n\nOne super-annoyance that I have to point out: past tense. Past tense! Why is everything the characters narrate in the present in past tense?! 'It was a brandy bottle.' Why not: 'It IS a brandy bottle'? And then the 'show-vs-tell' sin of having the characters explicitly state how they feel about something. When faced with entering a sewer, Nico says: 'There might have been clues down there. I was relieved I didn't have a key.' Instead, have the actress 'show' how Nico feels through her line reading of: 'There might be clues down there. But thank goodness I don't have a key.' Except for the too on-the-nose recicitation of their feelings, it sounds like something Humphrey Bogart would narrate in one of his Sam Spade films. It just doesn't work for me here.","November 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What i mean is there is no "funny business" puzzles that just make you want to do something crazy, most are logical and will test your patience. Dont listen to all the negative reviews they are just people who played the original version and are upset they didnt see a painting that used to be on the wall or a couple of npcs which were only for dialogue purposes, the whole game is filled with talking, you will ask plenty of questions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychoWedge/recommended/57640/","PsychoWedge","PsychoWedge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychoWedge/","578 products in account","So, what can you say about a game that is widely regarded as one of the great classics of adventure games? A game that is often among the top five of various best-of-lists? A game that is held dear by many a gamer around the world? A game that already has been drowned in gallons of words over the decades?\n\nWell, I can say I finished it, I guess... And I can say that I'm having a hard time understanding why Broken Sword is so highly regarded by so many people nowadays. Let me clarify my history with this game though because maybe that'll illuminate my lack of enthusiasm. I did not play it back in 1996 when it was released, nor did I play it in 2009 when the Director's Cut was released for Nintendo consoles or in 2010 when it was released for PC/Mac. No, I played it in September 2013 without any prior knowledge. Now, I'm an old man and I enjoy a Werther's Original as much as the next old geezer, so I generally don't have problems with older games for pure technical or gameplay reasons, as they're the games I grew up playing. And yeah, the graphics are fine, the music is fine, the animations are fine, the sound quality is mostly decent, the controls are fine and whatever else is fine. The puzzles are mostly above average, the voice acting is quite alright and the UI doesn't make me want to vomit.\n\nThe problems, for me, are the dialogs, the story and the characters. The dialogs are just not funny. Not at all. But they're clearly meant to be funny, which makes it cringeworthy. George is amassing all his wit in every interaction and let's lose some quip that is just so out of place. It's not only not funny, it's also not tied into the conversation, so he comes across like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who constantly interrupts the people he starts to talk to with random and oftentimes even mean sentences. It's really enervating and you start to ask yourself why do these people keep talking to him...\n\nThe story on the other hand is kinda meandering from some place to the next and then in the end George literally tells us out of nowhere what it is all about and I wondered how the ♥♥♥♥ he knew that... It's really badly written, which is surprising considering that Broken Sword was always lauded for the writing.\n\nAnd lastly, at least to me, the George and Nico dynamic just isn't there yet. It gets way better in Broken Sword 2 and especially 3 but in this game they just don't really click, imho. Again, it's really weird since the characters were highly praised back in the day. According to Wikipedia and Mobygames.\n\nSo apparently the Director's Cut cuts a lot of content in dialogs, puzzles and areas that was originally in the game. I don't know, maybe the game is really, really cool with intact dialogs and story and the original version deserves its place among the greats but this here does not. Or maybe it is just one of the games that has sooooo horribly aged that nothing of its former glory is left. Like GoldenEye 007 for the N64 or WarCraft 2...\n\nIt's worth to buy in a 75% sale just to play one of the classics but you're probably better of buying it from GoG where you get the Director's Cut and the original Version together.","March 17, 2014","false","14.0"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Not much more, save for an intro sequence where you play as Nico, that has been added for a bit of extra gameplay, This isn’t bad as it sets the scene well.\nThere are however, some seriously lazy things to behold here, Perhaps the most in your face of these is the voice quality. As far as I can tell, the sound files have been ported from the original game, and are very low quality in places.\nThe Voice acting is a bit hit and miss I have to say. Some of them forget which accent they are supposed to be using for their assigned character, which is actually at times more accidentally comical than anything else.\nThe game has quite a few places to go, and things to see, and all are very well realized. The game will take you from France to South America, to The Middle East, to the UK. You will also encounter quite a large number of interesting people along the way, with some truly memorable dialogue.\nFor the bulk of the game you play as George, who is very well voice acted whereas Nico unfortunately has a voice actress who falls into the inconsistent accent category. This however is not enough to take away from how cool the character is.\nThere is one major fall that the game takes. and that is in some of its overly elaborate puzzles. Some of which are too abstract, and as a result can make the game become rather boring. I reached a point where I simply couldn’t be bothered any more.\nOver all, the game is good, well written and it has a nice colorful art direction, but should you wish to try this one, be ready for frustration and a degree of boredom","March 6, 2014","false","23.0"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I finally decided to sit down and play through the first level and see if I liked it -- and I ended up playing through about the first 3/4s in one sitting. It was surprisingly engrossing, and the puzzles were just about the right difficultly for me to have to think about them without pulling up a solutions page out of frustration.\n\nWhat's actually one of the best things about this game is that in the director's cut there's an in game hint feature for when you get completely stuck! That to me is the reason this game is a recommend. It doesn't matter if you're good and point and click adventures or not. The in game help guide doesn't spoil the solution at first but simply gives prompts to show you where you may have gone wrong.\n\nIn my play through I missed one clue and couldn't figure out why I couldn't move on, having the in game hint system helped me to realize what I had missed without spoiling the rest of the puzzle. I love that! Sometimes I miss really obvious things and with other puzzlers can end up stuck unless I want to cheat.\n\nThe story line is sincerely good. I liked the amount of real historical research I felt went into it. Everything felt to me like it was actually plausible seeming. The Knights Templar is a super interesting historical subject to begin with, and this game sets up a continuing story line about it in a very sincere and realistic way.\n\nAlso there are journalism jokes. That alone makes this game worth getting.\n\nPros\n- great voice acting\n- clever story\n- solutions to puzzles in game if you get stuck\n\nCons\n- only about 4 hours long\n- disjointed animation\n- needs more Nico","December 7, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally released in 1996, the 2009 Director's Cut is an update that adds additional content as well as change some parts of the game, the latter which will be described later.\n\nAs a note, while Nico Collard appears in most of the screenshots and in the banner on Steam, the vast majority of the game is centered around George Stobbart.  This is a heads up to those who were looking forward to playing as a female protagonist.  Having never played the original, I can only accurately comment on the Director's Cut version.  It's pretty apparent while playing where the new audio is used due to the difference in audio quality.  The newer audio sounds fuller with less static while the older ones sound a bit quieter.  Fortunately, despite the differences there's no noticeable variations between the voice acting of the same characters, which would've been jarring if there were.  Because this is not a modern remake, the artwork, while beautiful, is noticeably lower resolution, so I preferred to play it in windowed mode.  As another note, playing fullscreen on a 16:9 ratio monitor will leave the game in its original 4:3 ratio with blackbars on either side, which I prefer to a stretched image.  Also for some reason it looks like Nico Collard wasn't completely animated by hand as certain actions will replace her sprite with a 3D model.\n\nOverall the game has solid puzzles and a good comedy vibe to a rather serious plot.   There are many locations to visit and a soundtrack to match, and there is plenty of dialogue and banter between characters.  There is a hint system if you get stuck, but I highly recommend to try your hardest to solve the puzzles yourself otherwise you may spoil your enjoyment of the game.  Despite its age, the game is not dated and is recommended to all those who enjoy point-and-click adventure games.\n\nMy wish for improvements in the game would be for more consistency between the newer assets and the game.  Also having read about the differences between the original version and the Director's Cut, I wish that this version would have all of the content available in the original and any differences between the two would've been toggable in the options.  I think these changes would've satisfied those new and old to the game.\n________________________\n\nNow onto the differences between the original and Director's Cut.  Because I haven't played the original, I can only comment on the more obvious changes that I've read about.\n- It's possible to die in the original game.\n- Removal of interactions with many objects in the game. This change is probably due to the nature of the times where people have more games to play and are less likely to continue if they get stuck.  The downside is less dialogue.","December 21, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphical update is nice, but - and here's where I might be biased - I prefer how it used to look. This being said, I've not played the original in a long time, so I may be entirely wrong about that - they may look almost identical. This doesn't really matter too much - the graphics are good enough to not be a hinderance.\n\nThe UI however - and general control of the game - has been changed. As the game was developed for the wii/ds, certain click/drag puzzles (such as sliding puzzles, or puzzles that need precision clicking) don't work as well with a mouse. While you could quite quickly press the inventory button and drag the item to whatever it needs to be used on, having to move the mouse to do this feels a little clunky - and this is the reason why I can't recommend this game.\n\nIn the original, there were a number of places where your character could die, but (I assume at the request of Nintendo) they've been removed.  The story addition is nice, but nothing spectacular - just giving a little bit more information as to characters.\n\nThis version of the game is far easier (aside from death being impossible), the game will highlight usable objects around your mouse, and also includes a hint system. I personally don't have an issue with either of them, but in some sense it does remove needing to 'find' the items, which some may not like.\n\nTL;DR - I would say get the original, if you enjoy it, play this.","May 4, 2015","false","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for a more interactive game, this isn't for you.  This game is about deductive reasoning and puzzle solving.  I would say my overall experience is that it started off very strong--puzzles were difficult to solve, the next step wasn't always obvious but would take some time to figure out, and the story/dialogue was entertaining.  As the game went on, I found the game to lose some of its earlier greatness.  The actual puzzles were few and far between and it became less intuitive to figure out what you had to do.  Some of the things you had to do were downright stupid and made no sense--one puzzle essentially makes you enter a set of numbers by tediously turning a wheel and pressing a button, and if you don't get every number right you have to start over again.  If you try to go through the game without using hints, you end up using an oldschool RPG approach, procedurally asking every person about every piece of evidence you have and trying to use every piece of evidence on any interactive element in the game, which simply isn't fun.  In about the last 15 minutes of the game they force a romance on the player between the very likeable French girl and the totally unlikeable American idiot who you are forced to play as for about 3/4 of the game.  Also, the animations in the cutscenes are pretty bad.  In summation, I found this game to be enjoyable some of the time--I do enjoy puzzles in which critical thinking is required, but it fell flat as far as plot, immersion, and consistent novelty.   I'd give it about a 4/10--it had a few funny jokes in there.  Most were cringe worthy, but a few landed.","October 31, 2015","false","62.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game follows George Stobbart an american tourist who is sat outside a cafe when it blows up, he sees a clown run out and, well then you take over. Controlling George you must pick up any object you can find and figure out its use to solve puzzles, same as most point and click games.\n\nThe story is truly amazing and just gets better and better until the very end, the characters are great and the dialogue is actually quite funny at times. The graphics are hand drawn backgrounds with 2d animated almost cartonny looking characters, it has aged brilliantley.\n\nThe directos cut makes several changes, some great, and some bad. The biggest change is the inclusion of playing as Nico, a french reporter assisitng George. Actually you play as her first this time, which in my opionion ruined the incredible intro, but oh well, the parts you play as her are good, if not really needed.\nCertain things have been completely removed, such as the ability to get killed in certain segments, and random items you could examine before can no longer be looked at.\n\nGeorge travels all over the world on his first adventure, you get to see, Paris, Syria, Spain and even Ireland, and each location has its own charm, it gives the game a lot of variety.\n\nOverall a truly great entry into its genre, and would suggest it even if you haven't played one before, as it was my first time playing a game liek this it taught me well, no crazy hard puzzles, except a certain goat........\n\nPros\n-Great story\n-Great voice work\n-Great graphical style\n-Good Puzzles\n-Good way to get into Genre\n\nCons\n-Opening not as powerful as it used to be\n-Death sections removed\n\n9/10","January 1, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fe.: Certain drawings are wrong or differentiate from the dialouge popup to the actual character model. A window had a hole cut into it from the outside on a lower part of it then from the inside. Some solutions to puzzles wouldnt be solveable in reallife. at the end the main characters kill roughly 20 ppl and dont even mention it anymore.. The characters mostly act on pure coincidence rather then on common sense, making it hard to sometimes solve puzzles for no reason other then "because". One puzzle from the directors cut to mention here, you gotta solve chivered letter and one letter only accurs ones at in the entire letter, as a signitur, on its own. If you place all other characters correctly, the last one remaining is the signature which is: "X."..... but you have many letters from the alphabet left that are not used, so really the signiture could be any of 5 or 6 different letters.... Yet your character only accepts "the one true solution".\nAs in other p&c adventures your  main characters show no hesitation of just stealing useless crap (and holding on to it) for no reason at all (fe. tools from toolboxes, random cloth pieces, a toilet chain, plaster, and a towel), while being the good guys (in deponia fe you are at least a "i dont give a ♥♥♥♥" kinda person, while you are playing good people in this one). Of course most of theses items are magicly important 20% later into the story, but there is no way the character could have ever know that days beforehand.\nSimply put, the motivation of the characters is basicly non-existing. The entire premise of the main plot is based on the main character being near a crime when it happend. His thinking: I gonna solve this murder..... BECAUSE! THATS WHY! Justice... and stuff.... i guess?\nFinally: The new story elements are hidden from niko from the actual main character, for no apparent reason, just so they developers woulndt have to rewrite parts of the original game. Its rather clumsely pasted inbetween the first half of the base game.\n\nAside of this story flaws. The drawings are acceptable, yet you can clearly recognize the new content of the directors cut due to its higher resolution and as mentioned above, does sometimes display slightly different clothing etc.\nThe higher resolution options sadly dont include a 16:9, the game is locked to 4:3. But thats to excuse due to a original release date of 1996 (afaik).\n\nNow to the actual gameplay:\nThe puzzles are nice, not repetetive and sometimes very challanging. Yet some parts are just not correctly explained or hinted during the storyline. One part especially points you towards a ceratin location (both in dialouge and the diary) but actually wants you to go somewhere else entierly, without the directors cuts addition of the hint system this wouldnt be solveable at all. This situation happens about 2 or 3 times during the game, but only onces its a clear mistake of the devs (or translators maybe?).\nOther then that the directors cut adds new puzzles and doesnt just rehash older ones, as well as adding new setpieces and animations.\n\nDespite my review sounding rather negative the overall experience of the game is very good. I recommend this game, for genre lovers that is. If you dont like point and click adventures, what are you even doing here?\nIf you like them, nothing tooooooo wrong with this. Flaws? Yes. But have you played monkey island 2? Same flaws.\n\nIts good.\n'nuff said.","February 5, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What does the Director's Cut have to offer?\nFar less than you'd think.\n\nPros:\n+Nicole Collard's backstory is genuinely interesting.\n\nCons:\n-The animation of sprites is missing, exchanged for silly looking unanimated portaits that are mostly unfaithful to the original pixel glory.\n-Many of the animated cutscenes are removed altogether or even edited for minor things such as blood.\n-The soundtracks overlap each other on places they aren't supposed to be, while some of the orgiginal tracks are never playing at all.\n-The game mechanic is changed so you can skip through many parts of the scenery way too fast to be able to enjoy it properly.\n-The entire addition of Nicole Collard's story, while intriguing, is a graphics/animation mess and filled with cheap looking art.\n\nExtra personal objections:\n~The inventory and conversation topic HUD is plastered all over the screen, which is not welcome in a game where scener'y beauty takes up most of your screen.\n\nAs a big fan of Broken Sword series, I honestly can't recommend the Director's Cut of the Shadow of the Templars. In trying to add more, they basically made the game far less enjoyable than it originally was.","February 6, 2015","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This point & click classic is an excellent counterargument. With its high production values, interesting - if slightly cliched - story, fun characters and good puzzles, it's a reminder of why many of us enjoy adventure games.\n\nThe puzzles only get frustratingly difficult in one or two places, but the solutions are always logical and with not an onerous amount of try-everything-with-everything-else tedium. Sometimes solutions to later problems are hinted at elsewhere, so it really helps to pay attention. The voice acting is great for such an old game, though recorded a little unevenly. Play with subtitles so you don't miss anything.\n\nThere are a few bugs in the Linux/Steam version I played - mostly to do with skipping during cutscenes. Having now finished the game I don't feel I missed anything though.\n\nLooking forward to getting to the rest of the series.","May 17, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am a huge fan of the classic adventure game genre - always have been thanks in no small part to my father, who has fond memories even of the original Zork. Broken Sword should have been a huge part of my life years ago, and while it wasn't, I couldn't be happier that it is now. Amazing 2D art style, fantastic writing and voice acting, some of the best puzzles the genre has to offer - all of it is just... breathtaking. I finished the game in one long, sleepess night full of clicking and thinking, fully immersed in this world presented to me. The story is wholly unique and spectacular and the characters are beautifully constructed. At this point, I'm gushing, but really, this game really shocked me at just how well put together it is. I highly reccommend it, both to fans of the genre and fans of a good old fashioned story. (My one complaint is that, for the Director's Cut version, they recorded new dialogue for Nico. However, the rest of the game uses the old dialogue from the original game, and the transition between the two qualities of sound can be rather jarring.)\n\nScore: 9.5/10","February 24, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately I became bored about 1/3 of the way through and chugging through any of the remaining locations became a complete chore.\n\nA lot of people would apparently disagree with me but I feel like there must be a nostalgia factor that I'm missing out on. Objectively speaking, this game would have been fantastic to experience in 1996. Plenty of witty banter and dialogue, and fluidly animated cutscenes. It's damn impressive how much animation is provided for random interactions that don't even advance the story in any way.\n\nBut that's sort of the problem. At first it's not a big deal- there are a few characters to interact with, and a few items in your inventory. It's neat to experience the combination of interactions. Until both categories grow larger and you suddently have to start asking every single person about every single item. Some interactions are over quickly, some take minutes to complete as the NPC tells you something inane. Speeding through interactions can become clunky as you watch your character stumble around the screen with their pathfinding alorithm only to show up at their destination and shrug their shoulders, a way of telling the player 'nope, that won't work.' Fine, but you could have just said that to begin with.\n\nI was absolutely shocked to find out that apparently this Director's cut had substantial sections of dialogue missing. With each syllable of spoken dialogue I pray that the game takes mercy on me and makes it the last. And you guys wanted MORE?\n\nYou might argue that the superfluous dialogue is optional. You don't have to ask everyone about everything. Well, sometimes you do. Sometimes when the puzzle solutions are completely arbitrary you'll wander around for ages in hopes of obtaining a relevant clue, only to find that you forgot to use that one item on that one thing that gives you that one other thing. Because why wouldn't you need that one thing. Of course you need to take a tissue full of facepaint all the way to syria, to polish a statue, to sell to a tourist, to get fifty dollars, to buy a cab ride. Never mind that you've been eating, living, and travelling for days on your own budget. THE GAME HAS DECIDED THAT THIS IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN THING YOU WANT.\n\nYou might also argue that I have a short attention span. I want to know which one of you enjoyed pounding through minutes of dialogue with the shrill-voiced woman in the hotel just to get that room key.\n\nThe dialogue is not really witty. I laughed a few times because of how stupid it was.\n\nThe story is arbitrary and convoluted.\n\nI didn't think I could enjoy a game like this so little.","March 15, 2015","false","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphical update is nice, but - and here's where I might be biased - I prefer how it used to look.

This doesn't really matter too much - the graphics are good enough to not be a hinderance.\n\nThe UI however - and general control of the game - has been changed.

While you could quite quickly press the inventory button and drag the item to whatever it needs to be used on, having to move the mouse to do this feels a little clunky - and this is the reason why I can't recommend this game.\n\nIn the original, there were a number of places where your character could die, but (I assume at the request of Nintendo) they've been removed.  The story addition is nice, but nothing spectacular - just giving a little bit more information as to characters.\n\nThis version of the game is far easier (aside from death being impossible), the game will highlight usable objects around your mouse, and also includes a hint system. I personally don't have an issue with either of them, but in some sense it does remove needing to 'find' the items, which some may not like.\n\nTL;DR - I would say get the original, if you enjoy it, play this.","May 4, 2015","false","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The surfeit of items to click on and show people was a feat, but the writers struggled to make the resulting reams of dialog funny or interesting.  And the strange overwritten past-tense descriptions ("I pushed with all my might.  The mighty oak door creaked defiantly and refused to budge") felt like the makings of a memoir you'd never want to read.\n\nThe remake, to my mind, improves on the original.  It's leaner on extraneous dialog and fills out the story with events from Niko's playable POV.  I hear there are some cutscenes missing, but I can't remember them so it doesn't bug me, and I do find the story to be more cohesive than it was when I first played it.  The very optional hint system and the inability to die are a plus;  I've been playing adventures for 25 years, and I don't find banging my head on the keyboard as much fun anymore (that being said, hints are always best avoided if the puzzles are fair, and they're usually fair here).\n\nThe dialog is still a grab-bag of dumb and clever (the running gags around your inventory are top-notch) and Stobbard is still a dork, but this remains one of the better adventures out there.","October 3, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for a more interactive game, this isn't for you.  This game is about deductive reasoning and puzzle solving.  I would say my overall experience is that it started off very strong--puzzles were difficult to solve, the next step wasn't always obvious but would take some time to figure out, and the story/dialogue was entertaining.  As the game went on, I found the game to lose some of its earlier greatness.  The actual puzzles were few and far between and it became less intuitive to figure out what you had to do.  Some of the things you had to do were downright stupid and made no sense--one puzzle essentially makes you enter a set of numbers by tediously turning a wheel and pressing a button, and if you don't get every number right you have to start over again.  If you try to go through the game without using hints, you end up using an oldschool RPG approach, procedurally asking every person about every piece of evidence you have and trying to use every piece of evidence on any interactive element in the game, which simply isn't fun.  In about the last 15 minutes of the game they force a romance on the player between the very likeable French girl and the totally unlikeable American idiot who you are forced to play as for about 3/4 of the game.  Also, the animations in the cutscenes are pretty bad.  In summation, I found this game to be enjoyable some of the time--I do enjoy puzzles in which critical thinking is required, but it fell flat as far as plot, immersion, and consistent novelty.   I'd give it about a 4/10--it had a few funny jokes in there.  Most were cringe worthy, but a few landed.","October 31, 2015","false","62.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arhoolie/recommended/57640/","Arhoolie","rknight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arhoolie/","570 products in account","There's a lot of nostalgia for the original Broken Sword, and it was pretty good, but it had a lot of flaws:  A dorky protagonist in "George Stobbard from California", lots of central-casting characters, some overly long clunky and unfunny dialog, and a slightly muddy plot.  The surfeit of items to click on and show people was a feat, but the writers struggled to make the resulting reams of dialog funny or interesting.  And the strange overwritten past-tense descriptions ("I pushed with all my might.  The mighty oak door creaked defiantly and refused to budge") felt like the makings of a memoir you'd never want to read.\n\nThe remake, to my mind, improves on the original.  It's leaner on extraneous dialog and fills out the story with events from Niko's playable POV.  I hear there are some cutscenes missing, but I can't remember them so it doesn't bug me, and I do find the story to be more cohesive than it was when I first played it.  The very optional hint system and the inability to die are a plus;  I've been playing adventures for 25 years, and I don't find banging my head on the keyboard as much fun anymore (that being said, hints are always best avoided if the puzzles are fair, and they're usually fair here).\n\nThe dialog is still a grab-bag of dumb and clever (the running gags around your inventory are top-notch) and Stobbard is still a dork, but this remains one of the better adventures out there.","October 3, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was (mostly) riveting, and it helped me overpower my distaste for the gameplay, which did at points require walkthroughs.  However, this game does a decent job at helping out the player, as there's a quest log of sorts to remind you where you need to go, and occasionally you can't exit an area until you've finished everything there is to do there, which prevents tedious backtracking.  Furthermore, there are always indicators of things with which you may interact, which resolves one of the most despicable aspects of point-and-click games: figuring what you can and can't interact with.\n\nTL;DR: A good game, great story (although dialogue is occasionally weak), and clever ways of mitigating the amount of frustrating backtracking/getting lost with no idea what to do.","August 13, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The core game from the original is still good and so is the story it tells. However the Director's Cut adds elements to the game that do not enhance game at all. Nico's side story is interesting but doesn't really add anything to the overall story and is never mentioned again after it is finished. The new puzzles are more minigames than anything else and bring a screeching halt to the story where before it moved very fluidly. Figuring out what to do with the items you had to advance the story in the original was the puzzle itself so you felt rewarded when you figured out what to do. Here most of the new puzzles felt like busy work and just didn't feel rewarding and some of the controls don't work well. Moreover to make way for these new elements parts of the old game had to be cut so much of the sprite animation was simplified, dialogue removed and animation trimmed taking away a lot of the charm.\n\nConclusion\nI want to recommend this game, I really do as at its core its still great but the cut content and the mediocre new additions kills an otherwise great game. If steam gave out the original game with the DC like other places I would definitely recommend it but just the DC on its own, no, pass it up unless you are buying the trilogy pack for the other two games and even then go find a copy of the original and play that to experianse how great that game was..\n\n\ntl;dr\nPros:\n- Core game still fun\n- Good story that has held up over the years\n- Fun characters\nCon:\n- New story additions pointless to the overall story\n- New Puzzles add nothing to the game and stop the story outright\n- Bugs and poor control implementation\n- Cut content from the original to make way for new additions","August 10, 2015","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for a more interactive game, this isn't for you.  This game is about deductive reasoning and puzzle solving.  I would say my overall experience is that it started off very strong--puzzles were difficult to solve, the next step wasn't always obvious but would take some time to figure out, and the story/dialogue was entertaining.  As the game went on, I found the game to lose some of its earlier greatness.  The actual puzzles were few and far between and it became less intuitive to figure out what you had to do.  Some of the things you had to do were downright stupid and made no sense--one puzzle essentially makes you enter a set of numbers by tediously turning a wheel and pressing a button, and if you don't get every number right you have to start over again.  If you try to go through the game without using hints, you end up using an oldschool RPG approach, procedurally asking every person about every piece of evidence you have and trying to use every piece of evidence on any interactive element in the game, which simply isn't fun.  In about the last 15 minutes of the game they force a romance on the player between the very likeable French girl and the totally unlikeable American idiot who you are forced to play as for about 3/4 of the game.  Also, the animations in the cutscenes are pretty bad.  In summation, I found this game to be enjoyable some of the time--I do enjoy puzzles in which critical thinking is required, but it fell flat as far as plot, immersion, and consistent novelty.   I'd give it about a 4/10--it had a few funny jokes in there.  Most were cringe worthy, but a few landed.","October 31, 2015","false","62.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a typical inventory system with the ability to combine items to solve puzzles and modify the environment to progress through the game. The puzzles are challenging but nothing hardcore at all. I was able to get through the game only using the hint system twice and it was only to confirm I was trying to do the correct thing after feeling stuck.\n\nThe dialog is ok and read at a good pace for the different characters. The voice acting is not the best. It varies in tone and volume, sometimes from one line to the next. I can’t be too critical as this is an older game.\n\nThe story starts out as a murder mystery but quickly evolves into something bigger that you uncover. The only gripe is the pacing felt uneven and really accelerated towards the end. I was caught off guard when the game ended.\n\nPros\n+Classic click and point adventure style\n+Puzzles are not overly challenging (personal preference)\n+Lots of characters you interact with\n+Manual save system\n+Environments are drawn nicely\n\nCons\n+Uneven pacing of story\n+Abrupt end\n+Iffy voice acting and overall quality of voice\n+Almost too much hand holding\n\n7/10\n\nBroken Sword has an interesting story combined with challenging yet manageable puzzles. Solid inventory, notes system and a variety of locations you visit on your journey. The seemingly abrupt ending is a bit disheartening but doesn’t detract from an otherwise traditional click and point adventure game.\n\nIf you are a fan of point and click, grab this on a sale.","July 13, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
