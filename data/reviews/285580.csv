Consider myself a veteran. Delayed my review in order to see if the early access isn´t going to be abused. Been active in game and out of the game, spent hours on testing bugs, finding out cheats and many more.\nThroughout the whole year we got one new runner (champion/god/character for the MOBA player), there are now nine of them. They gave some of the runner new cosmetics, which are except two of them only recolours. Every time someone pins them down in the discussions, they reply with "early access". The excuse has been used so much that either the little nice community doesn´t realize that the game didn´t go anywhere the last year or they are just plain up ignorant.\nPoint is there have been patches, some of them did contain stuff u could argue got the game somewhere, there even have been balance patches after the game got played by the same 3 runners every game. There also has been a tournament with prize money. A buggy, abusable game like this shouldn´t have a prize tournament, but that´s up to the devs. The community consists of nice people, in my opinion those ♥♥♥♥er did more to keep the game alive than everyone else.\n\nTo sum it up here is my list:\n\nPros:\n- Nice community\n- Has huge potential\n- First sport game that tries to get into e-sports\n- Made a balance patch after the community has been whiny enough\n\nCons:\n- No progress\n- Last patches made the game even worse\n- Unbalanced\n- Can´t even correct simple pictures or runner info after a year\n- Abusing early access\n- Chaotic game management and development (wonder if SHG knows of half their links they posted (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11EbUQ8Xvm-oodM3Reb4lKmoLf9kelmddQUHinx3GDnI/edit#gid=1801396602))\n- Told us the release date would be early 2k16 with more runner and a better performance overall\n\nI have been waiting long enough to post a review, months ago it might have been a positive one, but right now, the game is not worth even downloading. Since I am testing it every once in a while I am going to update the review if there is something positive to talk about.","March 13","false","520.2"," 47 of 55 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","47","55","0","2"

Arena: Cyber Evolution HAD a lot of potential, it really did. BUT after those 6 months of playing I realized there was barely any progression happening with this game. The charts are just terrible. The peak of players online is 267. And that was probably back when the game was released. Well, I loved the small community here but this game is simply going no where. Developers don't listen to the community too much. They add cosmetic items when there is SO many bugs, like not being able to play with a wireless card, or everyone lagging because there is 50+ players on. The only person I see helping this community is Jethro Tull, and he's not even a developer. I REALLY loved this game, I really did but it's time to move on. And I hope all of you do because at this point, Spearhead Games is just wasting their money. Now, if any improvements happen, I'll change my mind but until further notice.

I dont think I have ever seen a better candidate for an e-sport. and while Arena cyber Evolutions sure does not pull it off now, I bet that it would if the devs got the funding to do so. It may look it but Arena Cyber Evolution is NOT a MOBA, it does not play like a MOBA and nce you get in game you will see it doesn't even look much like a MOBA either. My only issues with the game so far are that there are not many characters and the characters they have are a bit grindy to unlock. there are no servers for the game its mostly peer to peer, so rage quits are a problem at this point in time. There is also only one arena or map currently to play on.\n\nIt is lucky then all these Negative aspects described above are addressed in the stretch goals, with certain amounts of funding they will be adding more content and things like servers, and voice acting. The developers also have stated that they will be adding new characters every few weeks after launch, I dont know how this will turn out yet, but I am hopeful.\n\nI think this 3v3 Sporty action game is most definitely worth your time, and I recommend you play it if you are a fan of any genre, its got that wide of a net. The game play is addictive as well so you might just feel hooked! There are not a lot of layers in game yet, so if you like Arena Cyber Evolution be sure to spread the word. This game is a game I want to see successful.","August 22, 2014","true","8.2"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","38","48","0","0"

Some may be turned off by the aspect of early access but spearhead games has the best communication I've currently seen with an early access title. With developer streams happening every weekday and them essential using those streams as a Q&A session, it gives the community a very effective way to view the upcoming developments of this game. For example on August 18th this game was released on steam free to play, and by August 21st the development team had patched the game to include some features that the community requested via the stream. Aka bots when a person leaves a match etc...\n\nThis games has incredible potential as an esport once dedicated servers are put in place and I highly suspect this to become one of the main esport games of the future with the right support.

A question posed by the great scholars of not only our generation, but the generations that preceeded us. Up there with the likes of 'Why are we here', 'Is there a god' and 'Why do kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch?'. Up until this day, this question has never been answered. Which is why I'm here.\n\nA good game invokes emotion. A good game tells a story. A good game, is a good game.\n\nACE checks all but one of these boxes. ACE gets you to jump out of your seat, fist pumping in the air as you score that game-winning post goal. ACE gets you, head in hands, groaning at the incompotency of your goalie. ACE gets you to do all of this, and more. But what ACE doesn't do, is tell a story. What ACE does, is give the player, the oppurtunity to craft their OWN story. Their OWN legend. A game rich with replayability, a game rich with no glass ceiling, a game rich with a budding, growing e-sports scene. ACE let's you tell your own tale, your tale of bounce shots, your tale of overtime stress-fests, your tale of that one time where you scored a goal by bouncing the puck off their goalie. No other game does this, because no other game can. ACE acheives what very many dream of, but even more will never ever achieve.\n\nOutside of the game, you find the company. The team behind, and pardon the rhyme, the dream. Spearhead Games. Responsible for such successes as Tiny Brains, as Stories. As ACE. With a community manager that cares, and a team of streamers dedicated to bringing you the best content they can at hitbox.tv/spearheadgames or twitch.tv/spearheadgames ACE is constantly changing. ACE isn't just a game. Spearhead Games isn't just a company. These two things, brought together, are a fire. A fire that we, the players. We, the viewers. We, the dreamers, stoke. Fuelling that desire to reach for the stars then bring them back. Flames licking at heros. Smoke billowing into the endless sky, the endless possibilites.\n\nI can only tell you so much about ACE. I can only put into words, how great this game is, if you just give it a chance. It's up to you to decide if you like the game. But take it from someone whose not being to paid to say this, but will lose his job if he doesn't.\n\nACE, pretty ace.","January 20","true","742.7"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","16","26","7","3"

Will Arena: Cyber Evolution be the next big e-sports craze? No, there's a 99% chance it won't. MOBA-like champion logic?

What is wrong is that the controls are ponderously slow and floaty, and the puck is lost all too easily in the flashy graphical effects of special moves and players clashing at the goal. As for the community, it's currently extremely small. Prepare to play with and against a lot of bots. Despite Cyber Evolution's problems, I would recommend giving it a try.

And it's awesome.\n\nThe game's simply a blast.  Rather, it's fun in its own simplicity.  You control one of three team mates (decently effective bots or players take the other slots), and a disc-puck-thing is dropped between you and the opposing team (where it is placed, precisely, is determined by last goal scored).  The teams rush for it, and use their unique players' abilities to snatch, slow, and stop the puck-handler.  Goals can be made by either dunking/running for a touchdown (run the puck into the net), or by shooting it in.  The grab-release mechanic allows for quick execution of shots, and easy interceptions.\n\nThis is still a very young game, so as long as the core components aren't messed with and there is some major (and I mean major, as far as the magically-laggy home screen is concerned) MAJOR performance issues addressed.  Personally I feel this game should run just fine for everyone, but for some reason it hates my (more than adequate) graphics card, and pretty much any time I'm not actually in a game (where there are zero server side or client side latency issues), the graphics seem to progressively drop the framerate.  It almost feels like their fog effects don't ever fully dissipate and just stack invisible particles, or something.\n\ntl;dr Try it!

Although it's still got a bit to go before it can be considered complete (very few champions to play as right now) but if you are looking for a MOBA that is very unique, pretty much in it's own genre then try this one. The community is growing but super helpful and there are tournaments going on a lot.\n\nWhat sets this one apart is the gameplay, it is sports themed with scoring points in mind and with that comes some very exhilirating gameplay much like you would see from watching an actual sports game. This game is definitely worth a try.","July 30, 2015","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Things are still missingly, like character balance and that creepy thing I assume is going to be an announcer still currently lacks a voice, so he just stares at you.\nThe game has a fair few bugs, yet I can see the developers are just trying to make the game that -they- want to. Lots of heart is being put into this, and the actual gameplay is buckets of fun. A few games in and I was already getting stories I was willing to tell my friends with near misses and amazing goals.\n\nThe biggest thing that picks my mind, however, is the lack of players combined with the bot AI. I am yet to find a full match, and most of the time I'm lucky to even get a 1v1, and not just me versus a lot of bots for the same XP. And the bot AI is fairly against the game, they seem to be the perfect player, and the difficulty seems only limited by how accurate the shot is going to be. They constantly are better then players at keeping the enemy from having the puck, and they have perfect teamwork, most of the time.\n\nHowever, even with these little nitpicks, I still find the game enjoyable, thusly, I recommend it.","September 3, 2014","true","1.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I don't know any other way to put it. You know you are having a great time when your heart is racing during the game, and afterwards you still can't stop shaking.\n\nFor anyone downloading the game for the first time, let me start by saying that as of right now, going in at a random time and clicking play to find 5 other people is very rare. It may be discouraging and feel like a dead game, but it is very much the opposite. Instead of deleting the game or never playing it because you can't find full games, watch the streams, go to the forums, and get help from a community member. Tournaments are almost daily, and pick-up games are very often. Finding a team is usually not too hard, and you can make it easy by inviting some friends to come play.\n\nEssentially, the gameplay is just 3 on 3 hockey like matches, set in the future. There are a number of different runners designed to fill certain roles on a team, each with different speeds and abilities. Even though there is currently not a massive amount of runners, I am yet to get bored of the intense and exciting matches. There is no story/campaign mode, and the entire thing is a multiplayer game. If a player ques and finds no people or only a few (as happens often) then bots will fill in for the missing slots. Most players like to focus on a single runner to excel at, but once in the character selection nothing is holding you back from choosing any of the characters you have unlocked (all characters can be unlocked with in game currency, or real money, but please, do not get the impression that this is a pay to win game. Certain runners are stronger than others but every single one can be played well, and no runner is too far unbalanced.) The matches are a short 5 minutes long in an arena with each team trying to shoot the puck into the other teams goal.\n\nThe community for this game is awesome. Its very friendly, and alot of the members have almost the entire community on their friends list at this point. The community isn't very large at all, and alot of the players in it have been playing since the start, but you get to know everybody this way, making it really great despite the size\n\nHonestly, this game has so many flaws currently, despite so many already being fixed. Lack of players, bad bot AI, bugs, balancing issues, and various other things all pull this game back. But i think it says something that even amidst all these problems that on other games would be enough to make me quit, this game has kept me coming back for more.\n\nSeriously, check out this game, and remember, don't feel discouraged when at first you can't find anyone.","February 1, 2015","true","277.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's actually pretty deep tactically, especially when you are playing with and against other experienced players.  Unlike LoL, DOTA, etc. A:CE features relatively short matches which means you can fit a pubby session into a pretty tight window -- which is great if you're busy.  The control scheme is pretty tight: WASD + mouse is a lot more fun and intuitive than the usual MOBA clickfest.\n\nIt can only continue to get better as the devs implement new features, more runners (champions) and more players get involved.  Definitely worth checking out and getting on board.  Great community and really moving in the right direction.  FTP so there's no reason not to fire up some matches and start pwning!\n","September 13, 2014","true","59.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the controls took a little getting used to (I was complete trash), and the bot AI was sometimes even worse than I was, I managed to really enjoy the game so far! Pity there aren't many players online playing with me, so I couldn't do much else but play with bots (One bot kept hogging the ball, then trying to score when it obviously had no skill there).\n\nIn the future, I'd definitely like to see more characters, maybe even a bigger team once the number of characters has grown. 3v3 is a really small amount (although sensible now in it's state of dormance)...I really enjoyed it, and only wish it was faster to unlock heroes! :3","September 6, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even though this game is still in very early alpha and definitely has its fair share of bugs (to be expected), Arena: Cyber evolution is not only very playable, but highly addicting and a friggin blast to play. The gameplay is as intuitive as its controls. After just completing the tutorial, I immediately fell in love with this game's simple yet brilliant design. The only downside to the game is that it is very difficult to get matched up with other players as it seems that in its early stages, there are not many players online with a possible exception of primetime.\n\nA round currently plays out like a game of soccer or hockey, with three players to a team. The soccer ball or puck is replaced by a disc. There are also already a decent handful of characters to choose from, all with very unique special abilities.\n\nThe fact that this game is so easy to learn, yet presents quite the challenge when matched with well-practiced players on the opposing team makes close matches as tense as your favorite physical sport. I think this game will be one of the top eSport games out there. I hope to see it go far.\nThis game is a blast already. AND ITS FREE!!! GET ITTT!!!!

ACE really hasn't changed much since last year. The menus changed (for worse), there are some new characters and storyline stuff, and the tutorial is even less helpful, but the core game is unchanged. Network problems are undetectable, mostly because you will be placed in all bot matches within 60 seconds, and there is no one playing anymore. There's a bunch of skins and tournament stuff, but the game is pretty lifeless now.\n\nYes, the game is free, give it a shot if you are interested. Maybe you'll be one of the people that jumps in and gets hooked. I really don't expect most people to be like that. I found more players months ago, and I think server region splits really hurt. Even if you can find players, I don't feel the gameplay is satisfying enough. The arena feels huge and everything feels sluggish for a 5 minute match. Abilities will only be used a few times in a match, and it just doesn't feel fun. Those abilities are also still hard to land or identify, with particle overload making the game hard to understand as a viewer.\n\nThe developers work on growing a community, but I don't feel Early Access is being used to make the game more appealing. The old list of stretch goals has disappeared, and little issues remain. Updates have mostly been fixes and Ranked stuff, it seems like gameplay is not going to change. The tutorial uses a lot more words to teach less (it doesn't even teach passing now), and the menus are still unintuitive. Currency and progression systems are not explained clearly, and I still feel the power progression system is a mistake for a competitive game. There are only 2 supported resolution options listed, and graphics options are barren. Oh but they give away game currency and items, so usability issues disappear because free stuff. The Trello board is empty, the forums are full of "we appreciate the feedback, updates are coming", and the match lobby still doesn't have team-only chat.\n\nThe game won't be marketed until it is finished, and I expect there will be another overhaul to the menu and graphics, but the core issues won't change. It's not an engaging game for most players. With goalies, the game is a sluggish 2v2 centered around blocking everything. The VERY early alpha feeling still shows up, with even the tutorial throwing up error codes. It was interesting to see the process of development, but I can't see myself putting even dozens of hours into this game, or recommending it to friends.\n\nAlmost a year ago I felt the game wasn't ready, and hoped it would be stronger in 6 months. Dozens of small tournaments later, the game is still rightfully Early Access.","August 24, 2014","false","2.7"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","29","55","0","4"

(hence the low play time on my account) Really addicting and the matches are short enough so also great for a competitive gamer that might not have the time for a 40 min Dota 2 match or game of similiar nature.\n\nThink hockey/soccer with 3 players on a team and the current characters fill the role of striker, midfield, goalie. Success has been found staying true to your positions but also getting a big aggressive and creative. For a game only 3 months old it is in great shape and the developers are very open with the public.","April 15, 2014","true","3.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While there are some bugs, mediocre severs, and mechanics that need to be overhauled. The game is still extremely fun when you get into it. Make sure you follow the hitbox channel (or twitch, but I don't believe many people are on the twitch one) to join mini tourneys, community streams, and the e sports events.\n\nTo the devs:\n\nA few simple things that could be changed to bump up my rating:\n\nRounded posts: The square posts have to be changed. Simply rounding them would easily make the experience better, and improve the flow of gameplay.\n\n5v5 mode: Yes I know this has been suggested, and despite the small community I still believe it should be included asap. It would purely make the game better, 3v3 has limited potential in a sports setting. So I firmly believe 5v5 is needed, seeing as the full release is planned for November (last I heard) implementing a 5v5 mode should be doable by then. Just make a larger arena for it.\n\nBetter servers: If you ever want this game to get big, you'll need to have servers that can handle a lot of people at once. Also try to improve the na-eu connection, as in tournaments the server should not be a deciding factor (though having seperate na and eu esports should be a goal in the future)\n\nMore Simon: He should really be the face of ace, photoshop him onto Mr. Harrison for the intro. Have Simon skins for each runner.. I'd actually pay for that tbh.","July 4, 2015","true","323.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Why we're seeing new skins when the game is so unfinished I have no idea. The fact that they need (or want) money from in-game transactions so soon in developement just proves that they don't have the genre's best interest in mind.\n\nSo far this is my experience in ACE: The bare mechanics of hockey (pass/shoot/hold) with on average 4-5 players. This is not even enough players to fill a single match. The characters they have clearly don't serve more than one purpose each, and somewhere along the lines everyone decided that instead of more play options we needed more cosmetic options. This is unjustifiable, and ACE has already burnt out their first impression on the steam community.\n\nI'm not giving this title any of my money or time. In my honest opinon they don't have the resources or the know-how to make this game catch on. If I'm wrong and we actually see this game take off, I'll happily change my reccommendation.

The items you buy, if you decide to buy them, are completely cosmetic.  Similar to LoL, there is no fee to play this game, and no downfall against people that have.  They just look cooler.\n\nWith a small community at the moment, it gives us the ability to really shape things, and get to know other players.  This can be both a Pro or a Con, depending on the personality types.\n\nThere is a decent amount of customizations you can do at this time already.  I am sure there will be lots more to come.\n\n\nCONS\n\nBots.....  Yes, the bots.  This is quite possibly the most atrocious AI that I have ever come across.  I am sure this is just due to it being in alpha, but they are pretty much useless in any game.\n\nGame has its share of lag, mainly because its under a P2P host atm.  The dedicated servers ARE coming, so this will likely lesson the lag considerably.\n\nExploiters are and will be around for the duration of the alpha, as with most alphas, until the bugs are submitted and fixes are made to stop this.  Just bear with it, time will fix this particular problem.\n\n\nTL:DR\n\nOverall, this is a fresh new take on a genre that was almost at its death.  They have reinvented a way for people to play competitively, and it is intense.  I find that the game is fast paced, very enjoyable (frustrating at the same time) and mostly, im excited for the future of this game.\n\nHope to see you in the arena.

Fortunately ACE is free-to-play and you don't have to worry about throwing away money at something that may end up in the dumps--only time. The idea behind ACE is simple and amazing. A sports game MOBA w/ a net and a.. ba.. puck... When I first started following ACE it was supposed to play more like a 3v3 futsal/soccer MOBA. Unfortunately the devs have strayed away from this and keep trying to mold it into some sort of hockey game. It is really sad to see how much of that has been stretched and forced into this game at this point. However, this game is still fun if you are content with the following:\n\nHorrible lag (non-dedicated servers)\nLeavers\nInsanely stupid bots (that replace leavers)\nHorrific in-game chat system\nGlitchy gameplay\nCollision detection worse than pong\nOne song (literally)\n\nThis is an alpha game and I am not really complaining, and that's why I gave it a recommend as I do, in fact, recommend this game. However, the reason to play this game is not for the gameplay (although it can be very fun at times). But rather the idea of this game. With A LOT of polish or perhaps another dev team can come along and create a new game based off of this idea, this can be a new genre that could easily break into the e-sports scene. Download it, play it. Let's see what these Canadian devs can do.","August 23, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is a strange one. At first you look at it and you think, "Oh. It's a soccer game...?" But it's much more than that, it's like an addiction. It's not just an ordinary soccer game, it's set waaaayyyyyyyy in the future like probably I don't know 3086 hence the "Cyber Evolution" so there is no ball, it's a disc, but you still have to try and shoot into the goal. And I mean literally 'shoot' the disc into the goal. People with that kind of technology don't kick. They just use the force or something and shoot it. Anyway, this game gets VERY addicting after your first round. Even on the tutorial and against bots! Which is sometimes needed because there aren't a whole lot of people playing yet which is downright STUPID. EVERY person on steam should have this game in their library and there are no if's, and's or but's about it I mean it's FREE. And if you're on steam you can probably run this game. Now, let me warn you though there are bugs in the game like every other game but it is in Alpha I believe, but it's the best damn Alpha game I've ever played and this was done in 3 months.

Everything in the game (other than cosmetics) is unlockable with in-game currency that's not hard to get. Even so, at this point, there are 3 free charcters and only 2 characters you buy with soft currency. There is a hard currency, but the only thing that it can buy exclusivly are hats and costumes. The devs are great, hosting livestreams every Friday to answer our questions. The only con is that there aren't any dedicated servers yet, but they're going to be added once they raise a certain amount of money.\n\nall in all\n9/10\n","August 24, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kind of like soccer + hockey, in terms of the sport aspect. Just get the puck-thing into the goal. The trick is using the minor boosts and abilities to get the slight advantage. Clever line-of-sight lines help passing, so playing with strangers isn't a big headache.\n\nOnly issue currently would be the lack of another free character - it gets a little stale when every matchup is the same 3 characters. Even one more would add some more interesting games.\n\nOther than that, its free, and fun, and doesn't try to get you to pay for anything you dont want or need.","August 24, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not used to these kinds of controls, so for me it's really hard to get used to.\n\nThe graphics are amazing! They're sort of like Borderlands, what with A:CE having a cell-shaded look.\n\nAudio is fairly good, I just hope they get voice actors soon.\n\nGame-wise, the matches get a bit old after awhile, so I wouldn't recommend playing it for hours on end. Otherwise it's a fun, enjoyable sports-styled game.\n\nI give it a recommendation to anyone looking for something fresh to try out.","August 18, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are nicely cel-shaded and it has a rather unique style. The controls aren't perfect but the characters handle decently.\nThe line connecting you and your teammates that changes color to indicate if a pass can be done is a very good idea.\n\n\nOVERALL : Not my thing, but very nice concept and realisation.

However, this game feels pretty unique, and simple in the best ways. Assuming they get dedicated servers, and iron out all the bugs, then this game has some really awesome potential. Requires a fair amount of strategy, working as a team, and some good twitch reflexes. If you decide to hog the disc, and try to steal it from your team mate because you assume you're better, then you will lose. Especially if you aren't actually better. However, this scenario has been rare :). Go in with a fairly open mind, knowing there ARE some strange bugs still, and that you must work together, and you'll have a blast. If you're an ego maniac that wants to hold on to the disc(AKA:Ball) and rather do everything yourself, this probably isn't the game for you. Cheers.

It was fun because it was like a 3v3(or 2v2 in hockey terms) game of EASHL/Be a pro with a bit more precision with where you throw the puck.\n\nToday, I tell you to stay as far away from this thing as you can. Avoid like the plague. It is going backwards. With the patch just before the one from today as I type this, it was the first official step forward I ever saw in ACE. And by that, I mean it was the first time they took a step forward with 0 backward from the patch from yesterday 1 year ago. Today they added puck immunity for the second time. Defending is no longer possible, the play will remain at the boards, and to put it all shortly, the game is no longer playable.\n\nAvoid this like the plague... Unfortunately. It had a good raw concept but they retired from actually developing the concept 1.5 years ago and went into fixing bugs to no avail. Play Rocket League or the next "eSports" sports game that will come out whenever that is instead.\n\nGood community though, whatever's left of it!","July 8, 2015","false","517.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","2"

Lets start with that. This is the first sports game I have every liked. Its a refreshing new idea, with what sounds like, some very dedicated people behind this.

I played 2 matches, but unfortunately can't stand to play any more of this game until they fix it.

Just here me out. This game has issues from the get go. After my first of the game, I had no desire to play further. For starters, the AI is the worst I have ever seen. My goalie started with the puck, turned around and shot it in our own goal. 4 times. same thing from the other team. Their goalie either just handed it to my team or just turned around and shot it in his own goal. On top of that, i had no issues with framerate, but it is slow. The movement speed is simply slow and not engaging. A game about space hockey should be fun, energetic and exciting! However it just doesnt feel that way. In a game centered on sport action, the last thing you want is boredom as the player is running across the field to score a goal. I understand that this is early access, but if you're going to release a game to the public you need to make sure that it works. The bugs in this game can range from annoying to "are you ♥♥♥♥ing serious?". I'm sure these will all be fixed in the future but when you want to get some fans early on, the last thing you want is to drive them away with a game that infuriates them. As many others say, it's a good premise. However as it stands, it's a boring game that needs improvement.\n\nI would reccomend for starters, to make the game faster paced. This way new players can look past some of the bugs and feel the rush of scoring a goal or intercepting a pass. Fast paced action in a game like this is key. Next, fix the bugs. I'm sure that they will, but making a game public access with bugs like this is not smart if you want people to buy your "adopter" packs and such. Nobody wants to put money into a game that has bugs like these.\n\nI want this game to succeed I really do, I wouldn't have written this otherwise (I'm sure my gramatical errors show that I'm in a rush to type this). But it needs improvement. Early Acces is becoming more and more of a grey area as more and more games accept the practice, and if you want to compete, you cannot make a game like this public. It needs time is all, just give it some time.","August 31, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

It is better optimized, looks better, plays better, and I'm not having the same issues I was having before. I still have trouble finding matches, still want to like it, I don't know if it is there yet but I am excited to see how far it has come and if this keeps up I will defintily have tochange from a thumbs down to a thumbs up.\n\n\n\nI want to like this game, I really do, but I haven't even been able to play a match with real people, I can never seem to find anyone to play with which leaves me stuck practicing against bots. Your AI by the way are a bunch of morons.  Who spend most of the game either shooting it directly at the goalie, or passing the disk to the other team.\nThe game it self has lots of bugs. My favorites so far are steals from behind you, shooting the puck backwars? (it makes the noise) and a person behind you steals it or gets passed it cause they were close.. I don't know how, I wasn't even pointing that way, powers not going off when you activate them, but your cooldown starts.\nI personally feel the controls are really sloppy, and I'll chock that one up to the game being in alpha. I don't like the control scheme they chose for the game, it is slow, impossible to make quick reactions to enemy actions with. In a sports game I want to be able to be agile and nimble especially when I'm playing a character who is suppossed to be like that.\nI really like the visual for the game, but I have a pretty big complaint that may inolve them. Why does this game require a 3Ghz processor? The graphics are not that good to require that much processing power. The game itself shouldn't be that demanding, it's 6 players. My computer can run games that look twice as nice, have a lot more people, and are much more complex than this. I have major lag issues at the menu screen, not in game, but at the menu screen.\nI can not reccomend this game at all in its current form, I will continue to keep my eye on it, to see if gets better, which I hope it will, because I can see the potential, but potential is not enough.  If they create a solid experiance with tight, responsive controls and little to no bugs, It would be highly reccomended.","September 15, 2014","false","1.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","1"

It's very intuitive to control, and very rewarding when you are able to outmaneuver the opposing team(when they are putting up a good fight). That being said, there is a strange depth to the game- no match plays the same, and every day people are learning new things to play better and evolve the experience. Different team roles, different passing opportunities, juking, blocking, zoning.. I feel that this game has tremendous legs if it gets the chance to stretch them and run, and I would love to see it go far, as I would love to be able to keep playing it. The playerbase is still relatively small, but it is only growing. Please support the devs, play the game, and spread it around to your friends.\n\nalmost forgot, the cons:\nit's pre-alpha. there are bugs. occasionally a host will drop. sometimes you cant get in the game with your buddies. There are little things here and there, stuttery animations, lag spikes.. usual growing pains. The devs are being very open about what they are doing and what their priorities are- to be honest, even in the current state its more fun than I've recently had playing anything else.\n","August 27, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After you have that moment you have to expand upon it until it's something that people not only love, but will cherish for years".\n\nI know that it's entirely pre-emptive to say that A:CE will be around for years to come; but I hope it does, I really do. The controls are smooth, the matches are fast-paced and involving, and the art is amazing. The developers have done an excellent job of making everyone on the team feel important also.\n\nSlower PC ? Don't have the fine-tuned twitch reflexes of someone who's been playing NHL games for a decade ? Doesn't matter. You can be a lumbering goalie and STILL play an exceedingly rewarding (and more importantly; necessary) role for your team. A:CE strays from other MOBA games in that "tanking" or "support" is FUN! You might not be as fast as a forward, but there's nothing like freezing the enemy team solid on your side of the court, passing a rink-long pass, and watching your forward breeze by the goalie. It's teamwork personified; and it's FUN.\n\nGive this game a try guys. I never-ever write reviews, but I just had brag on this diamond-in-a-very-rough stone that are other MOBA-type games.","August 19, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There have been numerous times where my team has been up by a few points and the host (supposedly on the losing team) will leave the match. All the stats from that match go right out the window as the game ends abruptly which really sucks. Maybe a possible solution could be switching the host to one of the other remaining players instead of the match ending. Otherwise, I've enjoyed my time so far with Arena: Cyber Evolution.","August 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is fun, hold left mouse button down to hold the disk, and release to shoot. The cut-scene and runner artwork is very well done, the "runners" look cool and the heavily outlined style (similar to Borderlands) gives the game a cool comic book feel. The biggest downfall of this game has to be the home screen UI. It is bloated, outdated, and makes you feel like you're playing a pay-to-play game on facebook. All-in-all, the gameplay of Arena: Cyber Evolution is genuinely fun, though they need to focus on sharpening their UI, Increasing their player base, and balancing the runners. I'm going to give it a 2 stars (out of 5) with definite potential.\n\nPros:\n-Gameplay is very fun. Moving with WASD and shooting the disk with the mouse feels good and fluid.\n-Intro stage is well done. The "Entry Test" is a good way to immerse the player while also teaching them to play.\n-Lines come off of your character to show where your allies and current aim are, giving the game a very cool geometric feel.\n-A lot of the artwork is really good, though the UI work is absolutely abhorrent.\n-The leveling system is clear and easy to understand\n\nCons:\n-Players move very slow. A small speed bost would help the flow of the game.\n-General character balance. There is a goalie ability that can pull the disk to them (even if the disk is already inside the goal) way too frequently. I suggest replacing this with a dive move or increasing the cooldown time to somewhere around a minute.\n-Bloated home screen UI. This is the first impression of the game and what people have to stare at while waiting for matches. Put some effort in to it.\n\nThings that need to happen before this game is good:\n-Update the awful UI. It looks bloated like a facebook game.\n-ENFORCE THE GOAL LINE. If the disk goes past the goal line it should be a point.\n-Show a quick replay of the goal after it is made.","March 2","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Plus, I can never seem to catch the puck. Banging the left mouse button to steal and then having to _hold_ that same button to keep the puck (and then _release_ the button to shoot) is immensely counter-intuitive.\n\nThe whole time I felt like I was fighitng the controls. The WASD thing just seems like a terrible design choice- something more akin to a space simulator movement system seems like a better fit- where you have a "thrust" button, with directionality based on the mouse facing. I can see what they are trying to do, akin to an old double-joystick shooter, but it just doesn't feel "right". I would much rather see it "catch" the puck without much input, and reserve holding down the button to "power up", then release to shoot if they are going to do it that way (something like the old NHL hockey games from my youth). At least then you'd have a little variability on how you were shooting, rather than every shot going at the same speed (unless you manage to hit it with your special move, that is).\n\n"Events" are massively annoying with how counter-intuitive the controls already are- they need to be something that can be turned off, especially when first learning the game.\n\nAnd the game seems to memory leak something fierce- after two or three bouts everything lags and I have to shut it down and reload. The graphics settings don't seem to work right- the game looked fine until I went to look at the resolution options, and then, not changing resolution at all, it suddenly went all stretched out like the aspect ratio is wrong. I didn't select anything, I just opened up the drop-down and left it right where it was. And full screen versus windowed mode should stick between sessions. Also, it seems that some of the time when you check "full screen" it actually remains in windowed mode and vice-versa.\n\nAll in all a really rocky start for what sounds like a fairly interesting concept. But I can't stomach the controls or the other issues after playing for nearly an hour. Uninstalled.

The self-proclaimed MOBA that is ACE - Arena styles itself as a mix between Borderlands and Speedball, with gameplay mechanics to match the latter, and a visual style closer to that of the former.\n\nPresently, the game suffers from a very minimal amount of graphical customisation (that I could find easily) - and as such the framerate really suffered - and sadly the servers were devoid of human players to interact with. I played a single game after the tutorial against bots, and thoroughly had my rear kicked. That said, the game shows promise - if it's able to overcome its graphical issues, and perk up the controls (which are very 'heavy' feeling, and sticky!) - then I feel this game will warrant a return, but in the meantime I simply cannot recommend this to anyone but the most devoted enthusiast or those with monstrous machines!\n\nI've recorded my gameplay for those who may be interested:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i81rIZ0sbSk","July 16, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

Let me start off by saying that the controls can feel off at times, like you think you grabbed the puck, but the server says no. The servers were the worst part of this game. I couldn't get a stable connection to save my life. Even on NA, where I live.\n\nThe UI in this newest patch, doesn't even have the text on it. Are you serious? How difficult is it to add text to a box? Not very, I've done it many times.\n\nAll I can say is, the game had potential, now I don't think so.

Futuristic 'ice hockey' sort of game but with a super tiny community. (I couldnt enter a match at all though the requirements was 3v3)\nSimple cartoonish graphics for those who appreciate it like 'Viewtiful Joe'. It does have potential to be a very big game.

Easy game mechanics.\n2) Nice SFX, gives the futuristic feel\n3) Still in early access! This means that more improvements will be made.\n4) Free to play!\n5) Experience game. What I mean is that you'll get better through experience. I personally like this aspect many much unlike some games (*Stanley Parable* where you dont need experience to play)\n\nCons:\n1) No one is playing. Game needs more promotion and popularity\n2) No Practice. There is a tutorial at the start, but there's no practice with bots mode for times when I cannot find a matchmake\n3) No sensitivity control. One thing about this game that was considered difficult for me is aiming.

Unfortunately, there are a number of things that make me suspect this game will not be what the world will choose.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are simple, but the scale of the game itself, as well as the magnitude of that simplicity, hinder it. I just don't feel like there is enough variation possible in the gameplay, Sure, with 6 players on the field things can get intense for a few seconds at a time, but since it takes very little to deduce what works and what doesn't, there really isn't a whole lot going on at any given moment. It is arcade-y in its simplicity, and whilst that does make it easy to learn and easy to play, it ultimately limits the complexity of the end result.\n\nThe controls feel very sluggish; nothing close to the tight, precise, responsiveness you would want from a highly competetive game. There also seems to be a lot of pushing towards the microtransactions, which is understandable for a free game, but the way it is presented is not flattering.\n\nFor all the hype, this is merely 6-player ice hockey with a garishly stylised presentation.","March 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game has bright colours and an art-style that looks like most futuristic movies and games (meaning games with shiny futuristic objects, not to be confused with dystopian future.).\n\n\nSound: 7/10\nThe music in ACE is quite good, and is futuristic techno nonsense (which is not a bad thing.). Besides the music there is not alot of sound effects that get noticed. There is a crowd that cheers when you score a goal but that's just about it. There's not more to say really.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nThe game has a hero system like League of Legends or Dota, but it's a futuristic sports game instead of being a 3-lane 5v5 game. Each character has two different abilities that can change the game drastically, such as the teleport ability or the ability to place a wall on the map. Besides the superpowers the game is basically a football game (I'm from Europe, so I guess it's soccer for the Americans reading this.). The game would've been rated higher if it weren't for the fact that it's basically dead.\n\n\nFree To Play: 9/10\nThe game is entirely free to play, but you can purchase the heroes and skins for real money. This would normally be an issue for me but there are only 8 characters to play ( of which 4 are owned to begin with.).\n\n","May 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Unfortunately, there are a number of things that make me suspect this game will not be what the world will choose.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are simple, but the scale of the game itself, as well as the magnitude of that simplicity, hinder it. I just don't feel like there is enough variation possible in the gameplay, Sure, with 6 players on the field things can get intense for a few seconds at a time, but since it takes very little to deduce what works and what doesn't, there really isn't a whole lot going on at any given moment. It is arcade-y in its simplicity, and whilst that does make it easy to learn and easy to play, it ultimately limits the complexity of the end result.\n\nThe controls feel very sluggish; nothing close to the tight, precise, responsiveness you would want from a highly competetive game. There also seems to be a lot of pushing towards the microtransactions, which is understandable for a free game, but the way it is presented is not flattering.\n\nFor all the hype, this is merely 6-player ice hockey with a garishly stylised presentation.","March 12, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Lost all 10.\n\nThe idea is cool and the game HAS potential but controls never feel allright. You move your champ into a soccer-like camp, it's a 3vs3 game where 1 is the "goalkeeper". As I said, the idea is cool, but you use WASD for moving and the mouse to point the direction you're holding the "ball". The problem is that!\nYou can't be reactive enough spinning around your champ the mouse while moving, you don't know when your team mate wants to pass it to you so you don't know when to turn and activate your holding ability.\nBot players hves an evident advantage because they react perfectly and know where to go, while you are always less reative and can't cooperate with your team mates.\n\nThe game has a short (and useless) tutorial which explains nothing: it doesn't explain your abilities, when to use them, any basic strategy, roles.\nIt also has a Pay2Win system. You can buy skins but also movement and ability boosters althogh they give like 6% boost to them.\n\nMaybe if you were using a controller things would be better. Maybe if you were matched with real players and using skype or teamspeak things would be better. Maybe if it had a true tutorial with challenges and control trining it would be better. Maybe if it was less frenetic things would be better. Maybe.... Maybe...\n\n5/10","May 8, 2015","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls aren't that innovative as they say. The movement is incredibly slow and painful. There are no explanations of each of the characters powers besides a video. The gameplay feels like a slowed down barebones version of hockey with various stage events that add very little to the experience. You can even steal the disc from your teammates, which is a terrible design choice. The only decent thing about this game (In my opinion) are the cartoony graphics and models and interesting characters. I can see a lot of potential for this game but, right now, it's not quite there yet.","August 20, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Let’s begin.\n\nTLDR: Not Recommended\n\nThe Good\n\nACE – Arena: Cyber Evolution is like futuristic air hockey, only it’s played at a life-size scale. You can select from a few characters to play as (others you have to unlock through in-game currency). Each character has special abilities he or she can use to aid you and your team on the path to victory. I’m sure most of us (if not all of us) have played air hockey before.

Sad day.\n\nThe only other real complaint I had had to do with the controls. Well, one specific control. Holding down the left mouse button allows you to grab and hold onto the disc (puck). Releasing the left mouse button (in theory) allows you to shoot the disc in the direction your cursor is facing. 70% of the time when I tried to shoot the disc, it floated in front of me in a pathetic manner and this often resulted in the enemy team taking control of it.\n\nThe Meh\n\nInitially, I thought the artwork for the game looked like it was going to be my kind of thing. It has a sort of Borderlands-esque feel to it, right? Not so much. Actual in game graphics didn’t really do it for me. They just seemed lacking.\n\nThis game is very much an online game. However, I played for a good long while and only ever had matches with bots. the community is, for all intents and purposes, much like a cemetery. You don’t need other players to play, luckily. As I said, you can play with bots.\n\nVerdict: Nay\n\nWhile part of me feels this is a bit harsh for a free-to-play game, I just can’t bring myself to recommend it as it is now. Maybe once it hits it’s final release I will revisit it and give it another go. Until then, I think I’ll stick to real air hockey and I would advise all of you to do the same.

And hold it to keep hold of the disk. Your opponent can immediately grab it back, leading to a series of back and forth snatches until one of you screws up or magically rotates your player. Timing needs to be perfect or close to it to actually catch the disc. Opponents can magically scoop the disc from behind you, even if this is how the tutorial tells you to avoid getting it stolen.\n\nHolding the disc drains stamina, which is a nearly-invisible circle that appears in front of you. LITERALLY UNDER THE DISC if you're holding it. Basically the worst possible visual choice the game could have made for a necessary mechanic.\n\nThis is a pre-release review, so it's entirely possible that some of these things get worked out, particularly the visual issue. However, I would be extremely surprised if the controls are fixed, since I think that's the whole design concept, so this game may as well be radioactive. Great idea, among the worst execution I've seen.","September 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Three big reasons.\n\n1) Game is Pay-To-Win.  Sure it's a free-to-play game, but just look at some of the features and powerful abilities you get if you "buy" into the game.  Players who pay real world money get experience boosters for one, which means with even playing time, they will have higher level, more advanced players against yours.  Not only that, but with real money, they can go "invisible"??  o.O.  Come on. I hate P2W games, period.\n\n2) Another major gripe from me is that this game is super sluggish and slow.  There's no reason for a game with graphics this simple to feel so sluggish and molasses slow, period.  It's supposed to be a sports game, which would tend to make you believe fast paced action.  Instead, it feels too slow, there are RPG games that move faster then this!  Ugh. Zzzzz.\n\n3) No dedicated servers for online connections.  Privately hosted servers mean that this game will most certainly be flooded with hackers and cheaters when you play online, just a matter of time.\n\nIf you want to play a really good game like this, and you own either a Playstation 1, a Playstation 2, or a Playstation 3... then look on Ebay or at your used video game store and grab a game called 'Dead Ball Zone".  It shouldn't cost you more then $5 USD.  That game, made in 1998, is very much like this one, but done correctly.  It moves fluid and fast.  It allows you to punch, smash, and assault the other players to try and steal the ball.  And it is at least ten times better then this, even though it was made on a PS1 and made sixteen years ago.","August 28, 2014","false","0.1"," 18 of 39 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","18","39","3","0"

The genre had been done to death by the late 80's/early 90's, but this game has online multiplayer which sounded like fun.\n\nUnfortunately, there is rarely anyone online. The most it's ever shown is one person online as it spent 3 minutes trying to connect a game unsucessfully. For all I know, that one person was just me. In short, MP is pretty much a no-go depending on which time zone you are in. I'm yet to find anyone else to play with.\n\nThis leaves you to play against the bots, which would be fine if you had any control over your own team. Unfortunately, you only control one player or  at least try to with the slow and clunky controls, but that doesn't matter as your team rarely pass to you anyway. You are left running around on your own as one hogs the disk while your goalie usually ends up as the highest scorer... for the other team.  Lots of own goals.\n\nFirst rule of team sports games -  The player controls whoever has the "ball" or at least has the ability to pass to and from bots. Otherwise its just BORING.\n\nWithout the inability to switch players on your team or even find anyone online, it's just not fun at all and there's really nothing new here.\n\nI wanted to like this game, and as it's still in early development, there's lots of room for improvement. As it is though, it's still pretty buggy, low on content, lacks any depth and has microtransactions for useless gear.\n\nI can't recommend this to anyone.","October 29, 2014","false","1.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

First of all, when you launch the game for the first time you get an introduction scene and then you get put in a tutorial which makes you learn the basics. You basically grab the "ball" and try to score a goal. There are 2 teams (red and blue). At the start of a match you have to choose a hero or whatever they are called and put an ability in his ability slot (or slots if you're a higher level). There are 2 currencies (one earned in game, other one can be bought). You can also customise the looks for your heroes, you can choose different colors for their outfits and buy hats for them. At each level up you get a crate which contains free currency or new emblems (basically avatars in-game) or hats.\nI love that this was so simple to get into, unlike any other F2P game these days with 10.000 pop-ups every few seconds and hard to understand mechanics.\nThe game is tremendously fun when you have real people to play and fight with.\nAnd so....the problem is: there are almost no players to play with, and if they are they can destroy you because they are of such a high level...\nAt the time of this review there were 13 players TOTAL on EU servers and only 1 player on US servers.\nThis is why, i'm giving this a negative review. Until the game gets more players this review will stay negative. You can't enjoy a multiplayer game by yourself.","October 10, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

Then you realize there's no way to see what the controls are. There's no way to talk to your team or to invite friends to your team. People are incredibly unskilled at this game and will cause you to lose repeatedly. There is no way to put someone on a "do not invite this person on my team again." People will purposely score points for the OTHER team and troll you without any recompense. If you wanted to actually have a skill for skill competition, look elsewhere. I understand it's early access but the 5 total characters to choose from are not very well balanced unless you can get on VOIP with your teammates somehow. Until then the "tactics" support characters are useless.\n\nTL:DR I used my "speed up a teammate" power on my teammate... then he flew past our afk goalie and shot the disc into our own net scoring a goal for the enemy team. 3/10.","August 22, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It’s the mechanical choices they made, NOT sloppy game play. I feel like the players should move faster, be smaller (or thinner) and bump into each other with less or more of an affect.\n\nThe powers are underwhelming, there is no indication I can see in a reasonable time to know if a pass is coming towards you, and there is a strange need to only let you hold the puck of like 5 seconds, so you have to pass; even in you are surrounded by three people on the enemy team.\n\nOver all I really like the concept, but found the gameplay really growling. It eventually just became 6 people spamming the L-Mouse and bumping into each other.\n\nI think it’s great that there are fans of the game and hope it develops into something really fun, but in its current state it’s not for me.

First of all the lag between servers is terrible - the best team in the world(which doesn't say much since there are around 20-25 actual players, no joke) keeps losing to a team comprised of new players when they play on the Europe server. If you're from NA I'll tell you that this game will be a very negative experience for you because out of those 20-25 players, at least 15 are from Europe, so you'll be playing on their server more often than not.\n\nAlso, you can't play this game outside of tournaments. The reason is that there aren't enough players, you will only play against bots. Again, unless you're from Europe, but even then you'll only have a specific 1-2 hours to play against real players. So if you don't like playing tournaments you won't be able to play this game.\n\nAlso, the game balance is embarrassing, and there are MANY bugs/head-scratching decisions made by devs. Don't expect the devs to make changes, because the main guy(btw, they have said on stream that they have two people working on ACE only) said on stream that they don't like listening to the community.\n\nI will say the main reason for most people who stop playing this game(as they told me) was the community manager. In fact there's at least one other review complaining about the devs. You'll see why in less than a week after downloading this game. If you look at the steamcharts page for this game, you'll notice that they are losing players instead of gaining. It's not a coincidence.\n\nTo recap...The game in its current state is not worth your time, and the devs have made it clear they will not be improving it. And the ONLY way to play this game against real players is to participate in tournaments, which are organized by the community manager, which means it will be impossible for you to avoid him.\n\nDo yourself a favor and don't download this game, even if you're from Europe.","June 16, 2015","false","408.6"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","15","2","13","9","7"

Haven't played enough to know, but this game seems pretty balanced and skill-based. You pretty much just have a goalie then the other 2 work together passing and using their abilities to try and score on the other goal. I'd recommend it as a nice game to play when you're bored or don't have time to play another games, as well as just fun in general. Teamwork is pretty important, but so far playing alone it's not too team-reliant that solo players should feel worried.

In a nutshell the game is an intergalatic air hockey simulator in which you pick a Runner and try to score goals. You play against another team of up to 3 players. Matches last 5 minutes and if undecided run into sudden death, where a golden goal principe is enforced. I like the competive element of the game, it feels like a real sport.\n\nFirst the bad: I tried the game a few months back and it was still very much an early access product. It lacked proper dedicated servers and the interface was cluncky at best. It also had quite a few serious bugs, like loading screens timing out or games starting and not being balanced properly (3v2 or 1v4). At the time I quit, but hey, the game was in early access and it didn't claim to be anything else.\n\nNow the good: About two weeks back I logged back in and was pleasantly suprised: dedicated servers, loading bugs completely fixed and a new slick interface (that naturally could still use some work here and there). It has come to a point where I would definitely recommend the game. There are still some issues, for example some problems with quests registering multiple times, but the core game itself is solid, fun and very easy to get into. The worst problem at the moment though is the limited number of players. Personally I don't mind playing some bots every now and again, but when this happens a lot the game loses some of its tension, because it is great to face off against other players. Besides, the game is free, so why not give it a bash.\n\nMy final thoughts? With some more players this game would be great fun. It feels amazing to score that deciding goal a few seconds before the timer runs out, let alone win a match that has run into sudden death by a well timed shot or a great long pass. Do yourself a favor and check out Arena: Cyber Evolution, or ACE for short.","December 23, 2014","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is only one gamemode, on one map, there's no midgame/endgame etc. to have the game actually develop during a match. The in-game controls are far too simple and lacking for what is considered by the devs as an eSport game. Things such as curve-shots, shot-power regulation, team-passing etc. are missing making the gameplay very shallow gameplay. While this was originally promoted as a community-driven game, the developers have completely moved away from this concept; there is very little room for community input or willingness to engage in discussions which hints at sheer arrogance from the developers' side that they can simply build a competitive game without the input from the playerbase. While some of the developers have prior experience in the gaming industry, as a company Spearhead Games has almost no history of developing games therefore making it an even worse move to not include the community more in the development.\n\nIf I'd have to rate the game right now, I'd give it a 4/10, with the potential for a 8/10 or 9/10, though it's unlikely that the game is ever going to progress to this point.","December 20, 2014","false","220.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
