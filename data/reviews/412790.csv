It's clever and quirky, the controls are tight and the graphics are endearing. From what I understand it's not a very long game, but if it continues to provide the quality of the first level throughout the rest, I can see myself playing through it again and demoing it to a bunch of friends. For what you're getting, $5 is a steal compared so some of the shallower and more costly VR launch titles.","April 5","true","1.4"," 52 of 70 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","52","70","3","0"

Even just a few more levels, taking it to an hour or two of gameplay, would have been enough.\n\nI picked a "yes" recommendation because I do think it's a good VR experience, but it's a little over-priced as it stands.","April 6","true","0.7"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

It packs about as much content as a 12 minute episode of Adventure Time, plus an extra 48 minutes of gameplay. That's worth $5 if you ask me. That's less than the cost of hiring a minimum wage employee to entertain you for an hour.","May 14","true","1.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","15","16","3","0"

It says right on the page that it's only about 45 minutes of playtime so its not like they try to trick you or anything as some of the reviews make it seem. Visually beautiful, smooth controls, and movement abilities that let you make your own path if you want to. The camera was extremely well done so I had zero nausea. Didn't even focus too much on gimmicky 3d stuff, what it had was usually very organic and fit with the overall style. Highly recommend and hope they make a full length one.","April 8","true","1.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It'll probably take around 30-40 minutes to complete and in that time you'll get an experience that's pretty much just like a regular Adventure Time episode. Finn, Jake, LSP and Magic Man all make an appearence with wonderfully crafted character models and the same voice talent from the show. The humour is on point and the world looks just great.\n\nWorks great with a Steam Controller.\n\nThe only negatives are the achievements currently don't work, and the length, I definitely want to play more levels, but for the price it's not a swindle.\n\nWould definitely recommend.","April 11","true","0.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Everything else is super generic with weak controls, sickness-inducing VR follow camera, basic level art and design.\n\nMusic is pretty neat, but as a whole the game is not worth the time.","April 7","false","0.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

It's really N64 Style and I liked it back then and I do like it now again.\n\nBad side: The game lacks content and gameplay variation off anything. From Enemy's to Attacks it's all really basic. Also the type off traps is like any old N64 game. Falling, open/closing or just simple timers.\n\nGood side: It's one of the first VR supported games with this type off content, and I wish they would extend there game to something more. For example: You can play as different characters in diffrents scenarios, like:\n- BMO in a quest to find new batteries >(Time Trail gamemode)\n- Marceline and collect new items for your guitar >(Search for items)\n- Ice King and try to find all the pieces for your ultimate princess >(Gameplay trough diffrent stages and hunt down something)\n\nAslong as this game get's more content I would start recommending to others.\n\n6/10 For now.","April 18","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unfortunately the achievement system seems to be broken as I didn't unlock a single one (which would be impossible to do when playing the game).\n\nHope to see more content in the future, or a longer sequel.

Nonetheless it is easily worth $5 for fans of Adventure Time. The animation, environments and voice-acting are excellent.\n\nIn spite of being a third-person platformer, the game incorporates the player into the story, with Jake at times stretching out of Finn's backpack to talk to you (for example), so to a limited extent you still have the immersion of a first-person experience.\n\nI played on a DK2 using Oculus' 1.3 Runtime, and had no performance issues.","April 27","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But with the $5 price tag, I was happy with the enjoyment I got. I prefered this to any other Adventure Time game I've played so far, as the padding always dragged me down. It gives you the jokes it has and lets you enjoy what it has without stretching the game longer than it should.

A problem I’ve noticed with most of the VR games I've played, (on the Vive), which i originally just assumed was a drawback to the hardware, is harsh lens flare when light sources enter your field of view.  This game completely eliminates that, also with practically no screen door effect!  That experience alone was worth the money for me.  While the game is short it is still extremely fun and pretty much feels like you got dropped into a full length episode of Adventure Time.  The camera does have programmed movement but it’s a very slow paced floating movement and i didn’t experience any kind of dizziness or nausea.\n\nPlease bring us more CN!","May 26","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
