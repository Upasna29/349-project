It took me ~3 hours. The game resolution is fixed at 1024x768 (fullscreen or windowed).\n\nThere are "casual" and "adventure" modes, I played the latter and still found it fairly casual. The game's decent, the art is decent, the sounds are decent, the voiceovers, hmm, the shadow guy may be a little below par. I couldn't find anything outstanding about this game, either positively or negatively. It is no hidden object game, but in many respects similar to one.\n\nIt's ok if you like that sort of thing and can pick it up cheaply (I got it in a bundle), but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. If you're looking for a casual puzzle game with excellent art and writing, check out Puzzle Agent instead - it's better, cheaper, and funnier (and also a little mysterious and scary). If you want to be truly amazed by a casual puzzle game, get The Room.","June 23, 2015","false","4.8"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","17"

Rather, there are items that need to be constructed at various times, such as finding the six pieces of a spear to give to a ghost.  It is almost a point & click game, but while there is definitely pointing and clicking, it is more along the lines of what you typically see in hidden object games that have additional puzzles.  For instance, there you might be asked to match pieces of fresco to where they fit in the scene, or count the number of cubes in a set of blocks.\n\nYou do have to collect objects and assemble them, but unlike most point & click games, you are pretty much told exactly what to do, and there is little doubt most of the time as to what to do next.  If you have any doubt, you can go to your handy guide which has a list of current tasks, in case you are totally brain dead, and you can click a question in which the answer will show that pretty much explicitly tells you exactly what is needed to be done to complete the task.  It's unusual to see what amounts to a hint guide (to this extent) built into a game, but this game seems to be designed for a ten year old who might get confused at times.\n\nWhile the artwork is hand drawn, it is not animated as one might normally expect, but rather you might see a dog running as being indicated as five individual drawings of the dog shown one after the other superimposed on top of the scene.  Or another example is when the screen shakes a little to indicate an earthquake.  This lack of animation hinders the game at times, since it can be quite distracting.\n\nThis game reminded me a little of the hidden object game Mirror Mysteries\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/291630/\n\nbut unlike that game which I felt compelled to finish to the end, I started to find this game quite tedious after finishing with the first ghost given that it holds your hand the whole way and the puzzles and hidden objects (such as they are) present little challenge.\n\nSo is this game worth $10?  Definitely not.  Is it worth perhaps a buck or as part of a bundle (which is how I got it)?  Only if you have a kid who has never played this kind of game before and needs a helping hand.","June 28, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Like most of its kind, it is extremely short and overpriced.\n\nThe game mechanics are similar to a hidden object game, only there are no hidden object scenes: you just gather obviously placed items from the rooms then use them to access very simple, childish puzzles, which quickly start repeating themselves, especially in the fifth chapter.\n\nThe story is about a young woman who is lured into a mansion (what else?) to help six ghosts. All six stages consist of a quick one-room segment where you gain the trust of the ghosts, then a 3-4 screen part where you solve their riddle. It is very straightforward, very simple, but mostly nothing but an excuse to draw some pretty backgrounds.","September 14, 2015","true","2.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Graphics are OK, mini games and puzzles are easy. Sounds and music are average. You are a young woman (as usual. Thanks Artifex Mundi) who has special abilities on ghosts. There is a mysterious ghost, who asks for your help and wants to help you. You must help and free six ghosts in a building. But beware, the danger is always nearer than you expect. My rating for this game is 6/10 because the puzzles are weak, the scenario is not polished enough, and the end-- such a bad ending. It is still worth to purchase, especially in sales or bundles but don't expect so much.","November 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not bad for a game such as this. I'd say the story was the worst part. Freeing 6 ghosts.. blah blah. Voice acting isn't bad, puzzles are diverse and sometimes hard. Cut-scenes and graphics are a touch above average.\n\nWorth $2-3 - Not $10\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

Overly simple art style and the story is... bad. Just bad. I will give most HoG a good try before posting a negative review, couldn't even make myslef play through an hour of this. If you have actually played a decent amount of HoG's before I would recommend giving this one a miss. Not worth it.","December 29, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The minigames are fun, some short, some needs oberservation and thinking,  and you can play them after you found them and successfully solved them once. You can skip your way through the minigames when you just want to enjoy the story. To have a good evening, buy it when its on sale :)","June 3","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
