Let me start this off by saying: The dev definitely listens to the players and takes their opinions into full consideration. I see replies to questions and bugs on the discussions page and it really makes me happy. I have a feeling that this game will go far.\n\nNow, with that out of the way... The review, shall we?\n\nDungeon Souls has to be some of the most fun I've had in a long while. The game only came out a few days ago and it's got a solid start. There's not a whole lot there, but the stuff that is there is pretty dang fun. There's plenty of items, all of which are passive (except potions). There are also orbital items, also passive, that are very useful. Each of the 6 characters (Barbarian, Archer, Thief, Warrior, Wizard, Cleric) has their own skillset. Each one feels and plays differently than the next, which is great. Each dungeon floor is randomly generated. There are different "tile sets" for the dungeon, which is usually switched every 3-4 floors (I haven't counted, but I think that's close). There are also different enemies for each tile set. The bosses are decent, however there isn't much strategy involved as it's mostly spamming your attack, your skills, and potions while dodging projectiles. I hope to see more work on that aspect. There also isn't much enemy variety, which may get repetitive.\n\nHowever, I do believe the developer will address these issues soon. I mean, the game just released on Steam (pretty successfully, if I do say!), so I can't rip on it too much.\nThere are some kinks to work out, yes. There is plenty of work for the developer to do.\n\nI would strongly recommend purchasing this game ASAP.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/383230/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","308 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDungeon Souls is an indie action RPG with roguelike elements. In this game, you play as one of six adventurers, including a Barbarian, Archer, and more. You must activate Marks along the dungeon floor in order to advance deeper into the depths in search of the Soul Orb, the only way to regain your soul. Every few levels, you'll come across a deadly boss who will drop epic loot if you can defeat them. You'll need powerful items and your own skills to survive and succeed.\n\nThe game draws inspiration from games like Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Overture, BitVenture and Shoot First. The gameplay is easy to learn but tough to master. There are three main elements: an autoattack and two special skills with some cooldowns. Items gained can passively increase your characters stats or add special procs to your attacks. Killing enemies yields EXP points to level up and increase your base stats and gems for purchasing items from shops. There's a good amount of variety among the items and enemies that can be found, and the boss battles are frenetic and challenging. In true roguelike fashion, the game is definitely hard, no matter what difficulty level you choose. However, it isn't as RNG-dependent as most other games are, and it definitely rewards skillful play. There is also permadeath, so you can't save progress between runs. However, money that you accumulate is kept and can be used to permanently upgrade your favorite characters, which balances some of the difficulty you can have when starting fresh.\n\nAt the time that this review was posted, the game is still in Early Access. Though the game is fully playable and is totally fun and enjoyable, it isn't a perfect release. Some of the elements are very unbalanced, such as traps and the melee classes. Playing as either one of them can almost guarantee a swift death as they are ridiculously underpowered compared to the other characters. Traps like sliding spike-balls and triggered boulders can quickly end a run. Though I've never experienced any, players in the forums have reported some game-breaking bugs or can't even run/download the game.\n\nStill, the developer, Mike Studios, is dedicated and is constantly tweaking the game. Before release on Steam, Dungeon Souls has gained a notable fan-following on other gaming sites, such as itch.io, Indie DB, and Game Jolt. All in all, the game is good in its current state and is definitely worth buying now if you're a fan of hack n' slash, roguelites, and dungeon crawlers.\n\nTL; DR: For fans of Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, and The Binding of Isaac.","July 3, 2015","true","8.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/383230/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2361 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTaking inspiration from Binding of Isaac and Risk of Rain, Dungeon Souls is looking to make its mark in the field of roguelites or games with rogue elements. As of right now it does not quite stand as tall as what inspired it, but it is a great game nonetheless.\n\nThe rogue gallery of silhouettes players see when starting a new game is an enticing tease. The three starting characters are berserker, archer, and thief archetypes that each feel very different both in stats and in how they attack. In addition to stats making characters different, characters’ basic attacks are melee or ranged, with varied ranges for either and projectiles that behave differently for ranged characters.  Each character has two skills that can be unlocked with level ups besides the basic attack they get from the start, and players get a skill point every few levels. The skills range from a gate that multiplies projectiles and summoning skeletons to a frenzied state or raining arrows on foes.\n\nCharacters are not that hard to unlock, with some requiring luck and others requiring a bit of skill. However, once your roster is full there is an incentive to push forward. Cumulative experience upgrades each characters “neophyte level” with a rank of 5 stars. Each rank upgrades stats by a percent and at the highest ranks grants players an extra stat point on level up, and a brand new costume that, for most characters, looks incredibly spiffy.\n\nIn addition to the neophyte levels offering some mitigation to the grind cycle of dying, there is also some light crafting and some upgrades to passives that apply to all characters. The crafting requires players to obtain recipes from a secret level (which can be time consuming) and hunt down the proper materials, but there seems to be little pay off for this right now. The upgraded passives are quite potent but unnecessary, though movement speed increases just make the experience smoother. However, the game can be beaten without too much hassle even with all of these boosts, in fact due to the game not holding the player’s hand, I didn’t know these mechanics existed until after I had already beaten it with a few different characters.\n\nThe rewards found in chests and by defeating bosses are mostly safe options. Flat damage or defense increases, with some items being able to stack. Getting duplicates of items pass their max stack rank (and some will not stack at all) gives players experience, gold, or crafting materials instead. Most of the items are useful, while others seem questionable, but none of them are quite game changing like Epic/Dr. Fetus or Ancient Scepter.\n\nThe dungeons you crawl through are dark and some of the enemies are fairly familiar. Players are tasked with fighting off ghosts and skeletons in the beginning areas named appropriately Dark Dungeon, but soon they will find themselves fighting yetis and beholders in slightly different areas (with the exception of a tundra like area that stands out the most). Every 3rd level pits players against a boss that has a few abilities and they all summon extra enemies to fight. These boss fights seem to be most closely inspired by, albeit on a much tamer field, bullet hells: even with high survivability, dodging a maze of projectiles while trying to return damage is the key to victory.\n\nThough there is quite a bit of content present already, there seems to be just a few things missing in the current state. It seems that there still needs to be a true final boss (simply referred to as “her” by every other boss), and currently the game just loops over again with increased difficulty after beating the current final boss. Right now with a few dozen hours put in (not a completely accurate time as I have had to leave the game running for hours while paused. Also, this is a good time to mention that pausing is a feature) I have nearly every character fully ranked, some unused recipes and I am fairly positive I have obtained every item multiple times. As great as the classes are now, some could use a bit of tweaking or balance, and I would love to have more classes in general. The class depth right now is good (with the basic attacks, stats, and skills all being different), but the early access statement on the store page says that there will be more abilities to choose from in the future. Really the largest complaint is that I have enjoyed the game so much that I just want more of it in general.\n\nWith a large update of multiplayer and a final boss coming, as well as the possibility of more content, Dungeon Souls is great game that is probably going to get even better.\n\n*Review in progress, will update as game grows or leaves early access.","May 5","true","33.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It runs smoothly is a decent amount of fun for short spurts but overall it just does not add anything new to the rogue-lite genre.\n\nI would say this is a casual game in that it does not require much if any strategic planning and some limited amount of skill avoiding the mobs that constantly flood at you and returning fire via your targeting cursor.\n\nI did not find much depth to this title as most of your progression in game feels like its due to you having played the game longer (you can upgrade passives to your character after each death) or had some really lucky rolls when it comes to item drops/shop keepers. This is not really an issue if you are picking this up as a quick-play casual game. The reason I am giving this title the thumbs down is that after 5 hours I have found nothing I have not seen previously in the genre.\n\nIt does run smooth and there's some fun to had with it if your not looking for anything too serious.

The balance of the characters has gotten worse, and 2 new characters are added and seemingly weren't even tested. Brawler and Engineer, the 2 new characters, are so hilariously broken that it isn't funny. Brawler is able to run around without taking damage, killing everything in a matter of seconds.

Risk of Rain is one of my favorite games for killing times, I play it almost exclusively if I am on a long plane ride or something, and I also enjoy Binding of Isaac, which is a very fun game. So then I looked at this game. Watched someone play it, seemed like it would be awesome, so at 12 AM, tired, and excited for the new game, I purchased it, and in the morning I downloaded and began playing it. And then the mediocrity hit. It's just... Meh. Very unbalanced, unintuitive skill system, just not that fun overall. If you play anyone other than the Ranger, Thief, or Berserker, have fun with the bosses. The Nightblade class is utterly USELESS, touting the awesome ability of teleporting around and switching his weapon between a boomerang like projectile and a giant hammer/axe. This seems amazing, until you realize that you can fire off an attack every 2 seconds it seems, and you do barely ANY damage, with poor range. I can't stomach playing any more of this game, because it seems like enemies suddenly spawn inside of you while you are trying to heal, and then you die.\n\nAnother major aspect of this game is the items. Woohoo! This is where it gets good, right? Right? Right...? Nope. The items are generic, they aren't that interesting. Save your money on this game, go buy Risk of Rain. More fun, more content, more everything.","July 31, 2015","false","1.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/insomniuhh/recommended/383230/","insomniuhh","Insomniuhh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/insomniuhh/","311 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDungeon Souls is a top-down rogue-like dungeon crawler that draws inspiration from titles like Nuclear Throne, but ramps up the difficulty to an intense degree. I think this is best exemplified by their Hero Select screen, where you get to choose from three fallen heroes. You’re already dead at character select. That’s how tough this is, and they’re not trying hide that fact with anything more than a cute pixelated throwback to games of yesteryear.\n\nThere are three heroes to choose from, initially, each with their own unique skills that lend towards different playstyles. You have the Barbarian, for those that enjoy rushing into things head first, cleaving your way through baddies in a blood frenzied rage. Then, you have the Archer, who takes a more cautious approach by raining down arrows on their enemies from afar. Lastly, you have the Thief, for those of you more prone to sneaking around to find best position before you put a knife or bomb in just the right place. There are also five other heroes to be unlocked on your journey, but those are up to you to find.\n\nRegardless of which hero you pick, this game takes a bit of caution and strategy as you wade through procedurally generated dungeons filled with waves of respawning baddies. Your goal in each dungeon is to collect as much loot, equipment and experience to level up enough to ready yourself for the next dungeon. As you level, you can custom tailor your character by spending points in attributes, and between your three skills. This allows a lot of unique builds that you have to take into consideration as you come to face greater foes in each dungeon.\n\nIn order to advance from one dungeon to the next, you have to active several glyphs which summon monsters all around you. Once all the glyphs are activated, you open a gate to the next dungeon, repeating the process until you reach the boss. These fights are where the game starts to feel like as skilled as you may be, you need a little bit of luck on your side as well. As you progress through each dungeon, you’ll get random drops from defeated foes, which can be something as simple as a medicinal herb, to something as powerful as a spiked, magically enchanted suit of armor. It’s all luck of the draw, and I didn’t feel too lucky as I progressed.\n\nThis game isn’t just difficult, it’s brutal, and most of it seems intentional. As you clear sectors of a dungeon, enemies respawn in your wake, which can leave you wondering if you should move on, or stick around and grind for more experience. This choice is made for you if you activate all the glyphs, which summons an undefeatable guardian that will sap your life from you until you move through the gate. This mechanic left me wondering what the developers had intended for their players to do, since they left open the possibility to grind, while ushering you out quickly once you’ve completed the level.\n\nWhile this game did hold me at bay with it’s difficulty, I rarely felt punished, as if it were unavoidable. I just kept hacking away, learning the timings of the different enemies and adjusting my builds to suit my needs and playstyle. The mechanics were solid, leaving me with no complaints about hitboxes, animations or bugs, but there was a certain gameplay element that was incredibly irritating. Hallways. Time and time again, I was forced to walk through a long corridor taking countless hits from off-screen enemies that could see me across the entirety of the map. I can see why this happens, with the levels being procedurally generated and all, but I did feel cheated out of a few good runs because of it.\n\nThe only other complaint I had was the music, which was a single, atmospheric song that repeated through each dungeon I encountered. It is still the beta, though, and this could change, along with many other aspects of the game. All and all, I think that Dungeon Souls is another solid game that’s helping breathe life into the rogue-like genre. It’s still a little rough around the edges, but with a little polishing, this could be quite the gem.\n","October 17, 2015","true","5.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Though during its more unbalaced updates I have not had the chance to experience, Dungeon Souls is a wonderful game.\n\nDungeon Souls is basically a top-down view Rouge-like dungeon crawler, that though it has only a certain amount of level types, it loops through upon beating the last and gets harder and harder each time you loop through. To begin with, you have the typical adventure game party for charcters: Barbarian, Warrior, Ranger, and Thief.\n\nI love Dungeon Souls, because it is certainly a unique game, in my view.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/383230/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroductionWhenever I see a game these days with the name ‘Souls’ in it I get a little bit anxious. A lot of games try to emulate the vibe and/or difficulty of the Dark/Demon Souls games (hence the ‘Souls’ part in the title). As you can judge by the screenshots the vibe isn’t what Dungeon Souls is aiming for, but is it tough-as-nails then? Or is it something else entirely and have I completely misjudged it by looking at its name alone?\n\nGameplayI can happily tell you that - while there are some similarities, like pretty much every game – Dungeon Souls is nothing like the Souls series from From Software. Oh, it *is* hard, mind you, so I guess I was right about that, though. No, if I had to compare it to a different game, then I would sooner compare it to The Binding Of Isaac or Risk Of Rain. That is correct; we have a roguelike game on our hands here.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528494187\nMost likely you will just start off running around the moment you spawn (there are several classes to choose from, by the way), hoping and praying that you know what you’re doing, but it probably won’t take long before your first official death. The game can get a bit hectic too soon and if you don’t exactly know what to do yet, or what effects an item will have on you (you usually don’t have enough time to stand still and properly read the descriptions) then you have basically already lost your first game. And then you retry again – because it’s a roguelike – and try to do better this time. And you will probably succeed in doing this, because you start to learn more about the world, the enemies and the items each and every time you play.\nBut every now and then, when things seem to go so well, the game intentionally decides to ruin one of your games by unleashing a trap on you when you’re in a small room with tons of enemies around. Sigh…\n\nUltimately the goal is to activate all of the marks in a level to open up the portal that will transport you to the next level. Activating a mark will always spawn a group of enemies, so you better be prepared and clear the room before you activate it. Killing enemies will level up your character, which allows you to unlock (a) skill(s). Enemies will become tougher, too, of course, so it balances out nicely eventually. Most of the time. But your enemies can still hit hard unfortunately and your health bar can be drained in a matter of seconds if you’re not careful enough, or if the game just thinks it’s time for you to die. It’s definitely challenging and without a doubt can be considered hard. Maybe even *too* hard. Thankfully this is still in an Early Access state so the difficulty can still be fine-tuned before the final release, but if you’re looking for a casual experience you better continue your search for now.\n\nThere are apparently 4 different environments and every few levels (if I’m not mistaken: 3) you will face a boss. Each level can take up to 5-10  minutes to complete usually, but time is of the essence: once all marks have been activated a timer will countdown and if it hits zero a ‘redeemer’ will appear who will chase you down and drain your health until you’re either dead or have proceeded through the portal. This feature was also available in Risk Of Rain and I didn’t really like it there either. There’s no need for rushing people through the game. Let people take their time and find out what can still be found and done here and there before they decide to finally move on to the next area. You want people to appreciate the work you put into the graphics and lore, don’t you? Well…, maybe you don’t. In any case, there are other ways to increase the difficulty.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528494145\nItems you find during your quest to victory are random each time you play and you might not know about the effects of a specific item until you have actually used it. The results can be either helpful or critical/deathly but one thing is certain: it adds to the tense atmosphere. Will you risk using an item early on and hope it will make your life easier for maybe just a few minutes or will you save it for a different occasion, but risk that you might die before you’ll be able to use it? The risk/reward mechanic is generally speaking a good and fun feature to have, as long as it’s been implemented well. In this case it has been, sort of, but there’s always room for improvement. Especially considering the current difficulty. Because of it there absolutely needs to be some tweaking.\n\nAudio & VisualsNot much to say about the sounds effects (nothing bad, at least) but the game only seems to have one, constantly repeated, track right now. That’s very limited and bound to annoy some people after a while.\n\nOnto the graphics: the graphics are vibrant and reasonably detailed. Everything is also nicely animated. There were a few occasions where I couldn’t make out certain objects, though, but fortunately these moments were very rare. Because of the pixelated graphics things can also get a little hectic whenever there’s happening too much on screen. Pixelated graphics aren’t the best choice in situations like this. However, I can understand the reason why it was chosen, since it can be cost-effective. Other than that it all looks just fine, really. No (further) complaints here.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528494107\nLength/Replay ValueDepending on your skills and luck you could possibly blast through this game in 5-10 hours time. But then you would have to know exactly what you were doing. Most of us won’t be that lucky or smart so let’s say it would take about 5--20 hours before you finished your first game. Since the current price is €10 I’d say that’s more than fair. You can even try it again after that since there are multiple characters to choose from. Plus, the final release will have even more content. Plenty of content to be found here if you’re a roguelike-aficionado.\n\nConclusionIt’s still a work in progress and it needs more content and tweaking as we speak, but so far it shows promise. It doesn’t really introduce anything new, but I guess that’s to be expected with games in this genre. So if you don’t mind any of that go give it a try or at least add it to your watch- or wishlist.\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Random loot\n+ Randomly generated levels\n+ Multiple classes\n+ Cool graphics…\n\nMixed:\n+/- …but sometimes it’s a little hard to make out certain objects\n+/- Not a big fan of the forced ‘time limit’/running for the exit\n\nCons:\n- Controls not as intuitive (+ no controller support, but this will definitely be integrated later (it did negatively influence my experience thus far unfortunately)\n- Traps are annoying, especially if you have no idea where they’re going to come from or when you’re in a crowded room\n- As of now too unforgiving/unfair\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer.\nRating: 6.7 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nWant to read more of my unbiased reviews?

Time spent in offline mode does not transfer over when you go online. In actuality I have roughly 40 hours. Needless to say this is a great game if you don't always have internet capabilities.\n\nThe non-stop action starts here. Essentially Terraria's Dungeon in the form of a rogue-esque game mixed with the Binding of Isaac. Dungeon Souls is by far one of the better pixalated games on the Steam Marketplace, and it's not even finished! While it may still be buggy, and everything may not be completely sorted out, I enjoy it, and am looking forward to the newer updates that include unlockable characters and multiplayer (hopefully more than just split-screen). Dungeon Souls deserves to thrive on a market filled with games that make the PC Master Race the way it is.\n\nOptions: Forgot to mention this previously from the game's release, but in order to change the settings, the game has to reload itself. This could easily be done through real-time.\n\nRanking: Characters can be ranked up by playing. How much it increases is unknown to me. There should be character-specific perma-upgrades rather than a permanent upgrade across all characters.\n\nGameplay: Completing the dungeon only increases the amount of enemy spawns, the number of bosses per boss level (correlating to which dungeon number you are on). Instead of spawning more bosses in, create variants much like how the Binding of Isaac creates variants (being faster and slightly weaker, weaker but two of bosses, different attacks or even attack speed). As well as variants we also need substitutes as fighting the same boss over and over again can just become a chore more than an exhilarating fight. Harder bosses or variants should drop better loot. While the elite variant of the boss (overall harder in general) should have a chance to drop unique items (an idea already circulating the forums).\n\nLoot: Before the update that increased the power of spikeballs or eyeballs instead of getting multiples, spikeballs would demolish bosses as they would constantly rush at you. Even more of an Ex: Dungeon 8, eight Skeleton Kings, without even attacking I just moved around the bosses as my buddies circled me. I had to give up and quit after I hit Dungeon 12 after spending six dungeons in a row without attacking in boss fights. So I'm glad that was fixed.\n\nKeep in note that not only is the game is in Early Access, but I was also playing the current build of the time (Update #4).\nQuite obviously this review is going to change over time as the game progress up to the point where the final game is said to have been polished and released.\n\nOriginal Score: 9/10\nUpdate #4 Score: 9.2/10\n\nKeep up the good effort Mike Studios!","July 4, 2015","true","2.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also you can carry only one active spell item that you might find, they all have 30 sec cooldown and very different in effect.\nCharacters have ranks, once you achieve the highest one the character becomes different in appearance and name.\n\nAlso you get to keep some gold with you after you die, which you can use to increase your character's passive's for the next run, you can increase hp, attack, and more.\n\nThe game look's a lot different from the youtube video's iv seen and the screenshots on steamstore, the hud and other features were changed.\n\nThe Good + A lot of enemies to kill, a lot of levels to beat and a sh!t-ton of items to get.\n+ Great music, pixel graphics, animations and designs in everything.\n+ Great character selection, with their own unique abilities and attacks.\n+ Small progression with character ranks and passives.\n+ Good boss battles, secret levels and lots of loot everywhere.\n+ High replay-value, colorful worlds with good effects.\n\nThe developers are trying to add multiplayer and trust me when I say it will be GREAT in this game, unlike nuclear throne this is not that insanely fast-paced so you could play with someone who's still new to the game.\n\nThe Bad - FPS performance was FIXED!!! now the game runs perfectly.\n\n- Here was I saying how some characters were way too OP This was also fixed!!\n\n\nTL;DR A very outstanding and overwhelming rogue-like dungeon crawler in all aspects of the game! really you should consider buying this outstanding piece of art.\n\nHonestly the game looks exactly like you'd picture it from the screenshots, the price for the game is perfect, give it a shot, if you're into this type of game you wont regret it.","October 26, 2015","true","9.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","6"

Boss fights are the only thing that can realistically kill you.\n\nThe RPG-esque leveling system - where you earn skill points that can be spent to improve your stats - should offer a tactical element to the game... but unfortunately the enemies are so puny that carefully choosing which skills to improve has little effect on your run. Items are also very generic, mostly offering stat-ups. There's none of the risk/reward element that makes games like the Binding of Isaac so much fun. I've only ever seen one item with a downside, and even this was negligable.\n\nAll of this aside, Dungeon Souls is still fun, at least for a while. If the game was rebalanced, given a difficulty boost and had some items nerfed, it could be an absolutely awesome experience. Hopefully the early access label will mean the game will improve in future.","January 19","false","8.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Definitely not recommending anyone to purchase this game. After the re-version from 2.0 to 1.7 to 2.0? the game quit loading. It goes to a black screen and does nothing. I even un-installed the game, cleared out all the old files and re-downloaded it. Now I am greeted with a black screen and music. So, basically I bought this game so I could stare at a black screen and listen to music. Great job! And I can't figure out what any further updates after that 1.7/ 2.0 stuff did to the game, because it hasn't worked since.\nFor actual game play, it is extremely repetetive, there is a lack of levels/ monsters. Same bosses over and over again, gets old really fast. There are better rogue-like/ dungeon games out there, don't waste your money here. As they update the game with more game 'mechanics' it seems to just make the game worse.

It had been on my wishlist for a while and when I got the game I was surprised. The game is more than just playable in it's current state, it's actually enjoyable. It has quite a charm to it and all the items in the game actually affect the character quite greatly and are mostly permanent. It quite reminded me of Hero Siege or even Overture. This is quite a nice surprise as it's still in Early Access but offers a lot of content, an indie game that is actually good. It offers several characters each with their own playstyles. Every character can be further enhanced by purchasing upgrades. Overall the game a huge variety of objects, many bosses, a developer which keeps the game updated. Since the time I purchased it it's been updated at least 5 times. It is also very clean and optimized. The only unfortunate part is lack of multiplayer and Steam integration.

You have been warned. ****\n\nAlso, my review is lengthy and comprehensive, so a tl;dr at the end for those of you who would not like to read the whole review!\n\nIntroductory ThoughtsThese are a couple of asides, but they are related to my reviewing structure, if you don't want to read it, feel free skip to the next paragraph.\nI don't think I've said this in my previous reviews of other games, but I will say it in this one: I don't say exactly what type of game it is that I am reviewing, because you can simply look up there at the description and the developers have kindly written in what type of game it is. I don't think that people need a rehashing of it in the first part of a review\nI usually don't put "tl;dr" sections in my review, but now that I realize how lengthy my reviews are, I will be putting those at the end, not the beginning.\nFirstly, I do want to say that I love this game and that it is in Early Access. It already has a lot of substance to it, and it has much potential. I do think it is worth buying, but I will explain why in my review. It is also reasonablly priced, in my opinion! So often do I think that indie, early access games are overpriced,  but this one is not, in my opinion.  It is a cool $10 well spent!\n\nThis game, from the start, does not hold your hand. This, of course, is a characteristic of roguelike games, and this game certainly fits that. This game does play fair, but does it play EASY? No way. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. This is a roguelike which is tough, and makes you earn your upgrades. There aren't any ones which are simply acquired: they're earned. I like that. They reward you for the risk you take. That’s one of the great parts of this game: the risk you take by moving into a place with enemies, and the reward it gives you. It isn’t easy.\n\nThe Meat of the Review; or, Looking At the Details\nSomewhat of an aside, but relevant (skip to next section if necessary):As I said to begin with I love this game; and honestly, I don't see many negatives in this game. People might ask me, "It can't be a perfect game, so why not tell us some cons, too?" Well, I'd rather go into the positives first. And truthfully, there weren't really any visible negatives to this game. I might think and when I get closer to the end put a con or two, but I don't want to be pedantic. There's a difference between this being a pedantic review and a comprehensive review. Plus there is something to consider very seriously: It is an early access game, and we're fortunate that the developers released it to be allowed to be looked at by the public.\n\nThe Positives\n+Excellent core gameplay: You begin with a character, and the more you play with that character, the more you are rewarded by playing with that character, i.e., there is a ranking system where you "rank your character up," I suppose, and I haven't discovered all the ranks. However, I have used the archer much, and now I start with bonuses because I have played with it multiple times!\n\n+You can destroy certain enemy projectiles that come at you (which is nice, and which usually isn’t the case with anything). It feels good to be able to destroy something especially in an environment that is risky to fight in.\n\n+The Redeemer! For those of you who don't know, this is an NPC in the game that appears after all the sigils have been activated. (Sigils are necessary to progress in the game, and you will figure that out if you play it: I won't spoil everything!) This NPC does punish you for lingering. But let me be clear: it doesn’t punish you for staying too long on levels, unless you’ve activated all sigils in which case, the redeemer comes for you. He saps your health until you are dead. This is understandable though—this is by no means a flaw. The game wants you to progress, or so it seems to me.\n\n+Clear tradeoffs between each class, and each class has its own unique abilities, which makes every playthrough different and interesting! I won't go much into the abilities, because I won't spoil everything. I will speak on somewhere I see I fit. I also will only speak on the first three classes in greater detail and briefly mention a fourth class for a specific reason.\n\n~The barbarian is slower in movement, but has more power and has higher HP than most of the other characters, though his cooldowns are higher (e.g., for his Thunder Axe). You can get hit by a boulder (a trap in the game that causes high damage) and still live with the barbarian! That's impressive!\n\n~The archer is a great balance between the barbarian and the thief. I defeated the first boss with the archer, and I thought I was well equipped to do so. His fire rate is medium, and he does medium damage. He has a great AOE attack that is very good for clearing out areas that I thought I might mention, because I found it to be excellent. (Again, going back to the unique abilities.)\n\n~The thief has an extremely high rate of fire, low damage, but is frail (lower beginning HP)! So you have to be careful with the thief! He’s great to use, but you can’t just get hit by a boulder like with the barbarian! I enjoyed throwing daggers at a high speed, using his invincibility and invisibility perk to get through hoards of enemies.\n\n~The knight is a reward you receive for defeating the Skeleton King, which is the first boss. The knight feels like an upgrade from the first three classes (in my opinion) because he seems to be more powerful overall, though he resembles the barbarian the most in that he is a melee character, whereas the thief and archer are ranged characters. I'm not sure the exact health of the knight, but it seems as though he is just as tanky as the barbarian, and his swing is wider than the barbarian's swing. Overall I liked the knight as a reward for defeating the first boss.\n\n\n+Randomization in the game\n\n+Potion variation!\n*Note:I will only briefly speak of potions.\n\nPotion of rage – upgrades your damage temporarily\nPotion of retrieve – 50% chance of giving you your health back! (I think)\nPotion of health – gives you some portion of your health back\n\n+Trap Variation\nYou don’t know if the trap you’re stepping on could be a magical explosion, or a boulder hurtling straight at you. So it's best to be careful around traps.\n\n+Bosses\n\n+First boss is absolutely difficult\nHe will assault you with everything that you’ve learned in the game so far:\n-Spatial awareness\n-You can destroy projectiles\n-Watch out for traps he throws at you!\n-He spawns enemies, kill them before you resume trying to slay the boss!\n\n+Second boss is at least 2x harder than the first boss\nIt's difficult for me to speak on this boss, because I mostly kept dying before I even got a chance to try to kill him, but he was very fun to fight against! He has a "shield", which was difficult to pierce.\n\nOverall & "tl;dr"Dungeon Souls is a roguelike that sets itself apart. It is very dynamic, i.e., it had many "moving parts" (game mechanics) that gave it greater overall entertainment value and replability. It is worth the $10. It is not overpriced. It is well made so far, and still has great potential. I'm impressed with it so far. But as I try to end all my reviews: don't take my word for it! Go out there, watch some videos if you're doubtful. Read other peoples' reviews. And enjoy Dungeon Souls!\n\nAlso, ask me questions.

At this moment the visuals are good, sounds are working, and in general the game has the functions of a full release.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwenyvier/recommended/383230/","gwenyvier","Gwenyvier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwenyvier/","160 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDungeon Souls is a top-down roguelike rogue-lite hack 'n' slash dungeon crawler. It is similar to Hammerwatch to a degree, so if you like that you will probably like this. The biggest difference between the 2 is that this is strictly single player as of the writing of this review. The game is in early access, so that might change. Generally I avoid early access due to a large amount of them being absolute garbage that will never be finished. I heard good things about this one though so I gave it a shot.\n\nStarting out you have access to 3 characters, the melee based barbarian, the accurate archer, and the fast thief. There are 5 others, which are unlocked by beating certain enemies or finding certain items. There also looks to be more in the works, which will just add to the variety of play options. All the characters are fairly well balanced, none feel noticiably weaker or stronger than others, although they do all play different due to their skills and starting stats. The various characters have different emphasis, but none of them feel like support characters like in Hammerwatch. Please note that I like Hammerwatch a lot, am just explaining the difference. All of them have a basic attack, which is different for each character, and 2 special skills. The skills are unique to the characters as well. The thief for example can throw an AoE bomb and disappear for a couple seconds, while the archer has multi-shot for a few seconds and a devastating arrow rain. There are 4 difficulties, the higher 2 are locked until you beat the game on the previous one.\n\nThe music is decent, not bad for a dungeon crawler. But odds are your attacks, explosions, and what not are going to cover it up a lot, not to mention the almost bullet hell like nature of some of the boss fights. Sound effects are very nice. No voice acting but the game doesn't really need it either.\n\nThis game lacks in story, but it excels in REALLY FUN gameplay! The items you find from chests or in shops are random and some of them can completely change how you play. Due to items I found in one run I ended up with a tank that was near unkillable as long as I didn't try to die due to all the health regen he got. He died on a boss but until then that was an absolutely amazingly fun run. There are a ton of items that boost stats, give regen, bonus damage, statuses attacks, and other things. The dungeons are randomly generated although the way to move to the next level is set. Find and activate 2-5 large glyphs on the floor and go back to where you started that floor at to move on. Enemies are easy to identify, with them being tinted a different color if they're one of the random ones that are stronger than normal. I've only found one sprite that is overtly reused. A mage type enemy that come in 3 different colors, all of which attack completely differently. The floors are nicely done, and very atmosphereic. Dark enough to make them feel dangerous, but not so dark you can't see the things you're supposed to squish.\n\nThe game has a leveling system. Upon level up you get a stat point to put into (physical) damage, defense, magic (damage), speed, resistance, and accuracy. Most characters start with an accuracy of over 70%, 1 starts are 40%, one at 50%. If you are playing a non-melee range character you are going to get that up to 90%+ asap otherwise your attacks have the spread of a shotgun without the damage. You start the game with 1 skill point to toss into your basic attack or to unlock one of the 2 special skills of the character. You get more skill points as you level, but not every level. Both skill and stat points need to be spent wisely or you'll find yourself overwhelmed. Any money you haven't spent at the end of your run is added to the bank at character selection which can be used to buy passive global permanent upgrades for the characters. These upgrades are rather expensive but are very nice, especially for when you unlock the harder modes.\n\nDungeon Souls is also very easy to run. I do not have a high end PC by any means, and the game runs at a nice and steady 60FPS.\n\nI have a few complaints about the game. First, the character unlocks seem either too quick or too easy. I unlocked 2 of the 5 locked characters on my first run by taking out basic mobs. And had them all unlocked in under 3 hours without actually trying to unlock them. Second, the game could really use a tutorial. It isn't stated anywhere to click on your skills once in a run to apply skill points. It again isn't stated anywhere that you use your potions by hitting the 1-3 keys. Or that you can bounce between special skills (which are used with the right click) by using the mouse wheel instead of Q and E.\n\nVery good game, very fun. If you like the genre I'd say it should definitely be on your list of games to play. And early access status aside, this is a game that I would definitely buy again. I am actually looking forward to seeing the future updates for this game.","December 27, 2015","true","34.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

At first the game was a bit challenging to get in to, probably due to a lack of tutorial or tips at the start. For example, I didn't even know that you could hit tab after leveling up to increase a stat or that I had abilities to begin with and that I could choose which one to start off with and improve as I level. The only indicator for this was small yellow text at the bottom right telling me to use the tab key. After I skimmed through the controls it started to make sense, and even figured out that there's a map you can use when you use the "M" key. Those are my only two gripes about the game so far, it's been quite enjoyable. There are bugs though, which is understandable given that the game is early access, the most notable example is trying to turn off fullscreen, which will immediately crash the game for me.\n\nMy latest run got me pretty far, enough to unlock all the classes at this point in time.

But I think it'll be unlikely that I'll ever recommend this game, simply because its fundamentals are about things I don't like.\n\nPretty much the whole design is based on time-pressure on the levels just like Spelunky. The levels are very chaotic, however, and the constant enemy respawning everywhere (including the shop!) makes the exploration feel aimless. The level also has traps, but they are mostly just VERY annoying and contribute to this overall clunky and contradictory rhythm.\n\nThe combat is based on circle-strafing and all-powerful abilities that pretty much clear the screen when used, like in bullet-hell games.\n\nOverall it's a combination of interesting elements that just don't fit well for me. I get very annoyed playing this game, wishing it was something it isn't.\n\nIf time pressure + constantly respawning enemies + circle-strafing combat sounds good to you, you'll probably like this game. If, like me, this combination annoys you deeply, consider yourself warned.\n\nAlso, I got killed instantly by a spike trap when spawning... twice . Hope that's very high on the to-do list before release.\n\nOther things that will probably be fixed in future updates but you should be aware of before you buy into early access:\n- One low-quality music through the entire game. I recommend shutting it off to preserve your sanity.\n- All traps are annoying and their placement is terrible\n- Special mention goes to the world's worst "floor spike" trap. In Dungeon Souls they are a real pain and break the flow of the game as you have to carefully time your way past them every. single. time.\n- Visuals are cluttered and dark already, but when loot starts dropping it gets much worse. It takes a lot of time to get used to it, expect to be constantly hit by enemies and traps that you couldn't even notice because of the lack of visual clarity\n- "Easy" mode could serve as an introduction/tutorial to players, providing them with more time to read the item descriptions and to explore at a more careful pace. Instead, it is the same pushy time-pressure that you get from normal, only with less damage (and less XP, for whatever reason)","August 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The game kinda oozes unbalance. Your character moves too slow to dodge projectile attacks; certain classes are much more powerful than others; minor enemies take many shots to kill, which makes larger enemies, as you can imagine, really just an exercise in patience. By no means forget about Dungeon Souls, just don't buy it right now. If you do, don't expect it to be a game you'll want to play after a few hopeless runs. It'll get there, though.","February 6","false","1.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JoeMajewski/recommended/383230/","JoeMajewski","Joe Majewski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JoeMajewski/","88 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have had enough time to play each of the characters at least once, and to get through the game on easy a single time.\n\nThere is plenty of content here to enjoy. This game is *highly* inspired by RIsk of Rain. They use a very similar upgrade system, where the upgrades can stack if you end up getting the same thing twice. For example, there is a rotating shield upgrade, which causes a shield to spawn, and slowly rotate around the character. If you get a second rotating shield, you will end up getting two of them revolving around you.\n\nThe game is split up into separate areas. Each area contains two floors, followed by a boss floor. The bosses appear to be fixed, rather than random. The boss of the first area was always the same for me. I think I recall counting four areas, but immediately after exiting the fourth boss room, the game crashed, so I can only assume that they plan on adding more.\n\nThe regular areas which you spend most of your time in consist of randomly generated floors with enemies spawning every few seconds. Each floor consists of a locked staircase to the next floor. To unlock the staircase, you must search the floor for the five "glyphs", and defeat the enemies that spawn around it.\n\nAfter clearing a floor, enemies continue spawning, but to prevent the player from grinding out levels, the "Redeemer" spawns, slowly draining your health until you die. I never had the redeemer spawn before clearing all five glyphs, so I'm not sure if there's a mechanic to prevent grinding out a floor before getting the glyphs.\n\nRegardless, the leveling up part doesn't seem to make nearly as big of an impact as the upgrades do, and you'll get plenty of them. Each boss drops a handful of these upgrades, and they are also scattered around in chests throughout the floors, and they can even drop as loot from champion monsters.\n\nIn addition to that, you can also acquire upgrades from the shops. Each floor has a shop, and the shop contain three items for sale. Currently, the only use for money in-game is these shops, and since each shop only lets you buy one of three items for sale, you will most certainly never need to worry about your money.\n\nThe other user for money is permanent character upgrades which happen at the character selection screen. When you die, the money you didn't spend is saved, and you can purchase character class upgrades with that money. Each run will start you with no money, so it doesn't roll-over into your next run.\n\nAs this is a brand-new early access game, it does have it's bugs. But the gameplay is absolutely amazing. They really nailed the combat aspect, and there are quite a few classes to play at the moment.\n\nThis is one of those games that will get more and more fun as the developers begin adding more of the random upgrades to collect, so that players can create more unique builds.\n\nSince the only influence you have towards your upgrades is the shop, which lets you choose one of three items, you don't have that much control over your build. I would certainly like to see more places where the player can spend their in-game money and better control the direction your character is going.\n\nI can already tell that this game is going to make it's way into the ranks of Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac, etcetera.

You start by selecting one of three different classes and can unlock additional classes by playing the game. The dungeons are randomly generated and there is plenty of interesting loot to collect.\n\nFor an early access game, there is a lot of fun to be had and it is getting regularly updated. I didn't encounter any bugs playing the game and the gameplay experience is very smooth running at a constant 60fps on my laptop with an intel graphics card even during very crowded times.\n\nThe only downside I found was that there is no ending, the game loops after you defeat the final boss but gets harder.

Avoid even if it is free. 3/10\n\nThis review reflects the game as it is now and I will update it as needed if i still have the game installed. Whoever made this game is pretty inept and many aspects are right now in dire need of change. That would namely be the terrible technical issues, the small amount of content that loops over and over again on itself, and the game's general lack of any even moderately sustaining replay value, and also its other many major problems holding it down. With each new update this guy keeps burying this game farther in the ground. Right now it is in really bad shape.\n\nAs of Novermber 28 2015 I noticed two new problems after recently reinstalling this. 1) There are many resolution options but they don't do anything. It stays at a 4x3 res. 2) Has a weird flickering invisible line in the middle of the screen. Forcing vsync on or off in nvidia control panel does not change it. Makes the game pretty much unplayable for me even if it didn't suck so bad.\n\n- I have seen other users saying that there is a complete lack of communication from the dev. No updates, no fixes, nothing. Then when he does update it, every time so far, everything gets worse.\n- Game is very unbalanced. Some characters are powerful, most others are completely useless and just should have never even been put it. Difficulty does NOT scale well at all.\n- He went overboard with enemy dmg. You take way too much dmg when being hit by both enemies and traps and die very, very easily.\n- Now you can only hold 3 potions at a time which is a real problem since healing potions heal only a miniscule amount. Many more drop now but it is just a chore continually having to drink so many of them and keep picking up new ones constantly and having to potion-juggle different types in only three potion slots.\n- Enemy health bars are annoyingly huge now. Maybe you can change it in the options but I doubt it. I didn't care to check because I just installed it to check on the game after a couple months and now uninstalled it again.\n- The previously available Wizard class is now for some reason locked and you have to find some item to unlock him.\n- The priest is locked now as well.\n- The necromancer is also locked now but that doesn't matter because he was even far more worthless than the new nightblade character. Both characters are seriously totally worthless and so are their awful, worthless skills.\n- Unlockable characters won't unlock. I've seen people in the forums have this problem as well. I killed 150 skeletons in one run but it did not unlock what I presume would be the necromancer.\n- Characters should not be locked because the game does not have enough content and replay value to make me ever want to unlock a single guy to replay the exact same few levels that loop on themselves when you beat the game, fighting the exact same few enemies, over and over again.\n- The difference in difficulties is night and day. Easy is way, way too easy and on normal it seems like enemies do way more dmg now but I don't think the dev did that. Even so, I can be at full health then all of a sudden I am dead before I can even look to see if I need a health potion. Normal difficulty makes me sick to a point of I just don't play the game anymore really.\n- After I beat the game on easy, the game just keeps looping back to the same levels over again, this time instead of lvl 1 it is now for instance lvl 10 or whatever, and each time through now there is a copy of the boss. I was on my probably sixth time through everything fighting six copies of each boss when I got to them, and the game just became so incredibly boring that I quit. What I mean is that on normal it was impossible so I had to do it on easy and it just made me slam through it all and be done for good. If the game was better designed I could've played longer and tolerated normal mode more until I beat it.\n- The new Nightblade class is one of the most worthless playable characters I have ever seen in a game. His hammer is very slow, takes far more hits to kill enemies than say the archer, and despite having high def he still feels like he takes as much dmg as any other character. His skills are totally worthless also. The archer can clear a room in a couple seconds. Nightblade takes multiple hits on enemies and when 10-15 spawn in a room, what am I supposed to do with him and his useless skills?\n- The game keeps getting harder with each new patch for the wrong reasons. Now, rooms are filled with such an incredible amount of things going on, enemies melee hitting you, bats firing multiple green projectiles, that where before I could get to the third boss, now it is a frustrating struggle to even get to the first boss.\n- There are a ton of other things that need fixed or changed back to how they were before as well. This guy just keeps effing things up each time he updates his game.\n\nEvery time I die in this game it does not feel like it was my fault, it feels like it was 100% the game's fault. Dying and restarting just ends up becoming a boring chore, and each time I get disinterested to the point I just want to stop playing the game and do something else, asking myself "why am I still playing this?"\n\nAll in all, this is ending up just like every other game that it is modeled after. Like Hero Siege. That game kept burying itself after each update until finally a year or two later it is a good game. Too little too late though, so the guy making this game better learn how to do things right, and namely not have characters locked and take such a huge amount of work to unlock in a game with such little content. Makes no sense.","July 26, 2015","false","11.5"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Your sneaky, cloaked back that will be invisible in a maximum of 5 seconds anyway.\n\nNow to the actual review:\nImagine Risk of Rain in a top-down fantasy setting. That's it from the rough side of view. The actual game is alot of fun for a game this new, if you get used to the mechanics and I bet there are alot of other item/class combos which have similar ridiculous outcomes like the one I mentioned above.\nOne bad part I noticed over the course of some playthroughs is the repetition of the levels, since there are only 4 stages with 3 levels each. After the first 4 stages, all enemies will spawn in any stage which kind of defeats the purpose of the themes. The only thing staying true to the themes are the bosses of each stage and everytime you clear all 4 stages, another boss will accompany the one(s) who you fought the last time you were in that stage. So be ready to fight like 7 Skeleton Kings at one point of the game, if you get far enough. I really hope the bosses will get balanced in another way than that and getting a bit more health in the future, but since the developer works really close with the community, this is very likely to happen soon.","July 19, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Please don't abandon this game ♥)\nWhenever something bad is going on with the game (OP monsters, glitchy something-or-other, or just broken in general) it usually gets fixed quickly. If you have an issue with the game that's not out of reason, whine about it a little and it'll most likely get fixed. ;D\n\nMy only real problem is (after some of the updates since I bought it) that the game starts off a bit too difficult for the average Joe, which results in the need to grind a bit to get some passives going (and a dash of luck). Now, that doesn't mean it's so hard that you ragequit every time you play (or at least it's not like that for me), just that it'll take a bit of... 'practice'. I'm sure plenty of you will disagree with me, but isn't that the joy of opinions? :D:\nThere is an Easy difficulty, but, for lack of a better way of saying this, progress doesn't get saved, so playing on Easy only helps you learn whatever character you're trying to play and the general 'rules' and controls of the game (although on the up side it does make it easier to unlock all of the characters).\nI feel like those of you that really enjoy Nuclear Throne will enjoy this as well.

Very well done, dark 'souls' esk originally but has gone through it's fair share of 180's during development.  Doesn't seem to log time while in offline mode and that's a shame cause between a version outside of Steam originally and this EA purchased version I have many more hours vested.\n\nSome classes *cough* ranger *cough* are a bit easier than others and make sure you expand on your passives as this is where the overall progression helps ALL characters.  Item purchase/drops [chests using dropped keys] open to a bounty of items as well shopkeepers so make sure to investigate what each item does and build that 'Risk of Rain' perfect set.\n\nEasy to pickup, hard to master and better to grow with you as you move forward sometimes inching closer each run.  Something new in the latest revision are scrap metal and weapon crafting.  I have yet to use this as I have not collected the needed recipes needed since last time playing it was not introduced.  Looks good, but can't comment fully.\n\nAgain, another great game from a good single guy dev who does care.  If the price is right, pick it up.","May 26","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But here are my nit picks with it so far.\n\n1. It needs multiplayer... if there is a multiplayer system, I haven't seen it.\n2. Potions (not the ones you heal with) are often discouraging to the player because you can basically DIE if you pick one up at the wrong time. This needs to be fixed so that you can tell what the potion does before you pick it up or at least give a little tell to the potion, if there is a tell... I haven't seen one.\n3. Gold is useless after you die, it seems to keep a counter of sorts, but it has no use to my knowledge, I think they could implement maybe character skins that you can buy with the gold or maybe new abilities! Because dying with 40k gold is just boring.\n4. TRAPS ARE ANNOYING! If you are playing on any other difficulty than easy traps will most likely kill you if you don't get the ♥♥♥♥ out of dodge. There needs to be a better tell for this system too, I hate to get pretty far in a run then just to die to a trap I can't avoid because I was too busy running from enemies not to notice the "CLICK" that popped up on my screen. Maybe there is a thing you can see... I haven't if there is. This is still forgiveable in my opinion because it is a rogue-like... still frustrating however.\n\nAll that aside, I really like this game it's fun but it seems like it was rushed out the door possibly... because a rogue-like game like this one with no multiplayer honestly makes me a sad panda. I do recommend this game if you liked Nuclear Throne or Risk of Rain. The visuals are great and the combat is fast and exciting.\n\nWhat worries me is this is still Early Access.. It shows potential... I hope they don't let us down!\n\n\nNEW REVIEW\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe only reason I am keeping the old review to prove points of how the developers have improved their game since I first wrote that review on basically what was release.\n\nFirst off they fixed potions... now all the potions tell you what they do AND you can tell them apart just by looking at them. It is a great improvement from before when it was just random basically.\n\nSecondly you can use the gold you die with to buy passive abilities for your heroes such as more health or higher crit chance. Gold will most likely become useless after you max out all the passives but I really like this added feature that they have done.\n\nThirdly traps are fixed now. You can easily tell where they are (but someone they are harder to dodge, I just suck). ANDDDDDD you won't die to them for no reason, if you have high defense the traps just tickle you now which I find to be muchhhhh better instead of getting one shot by a trap twenty minutes into a run.\n\nThey added so many new features to the game like unlockable characters, new areas, new bosses and new items! This game also has more of it's own identity rather than being more like Nuclear Throne and less like Dungeon Souls. I love the new changes and you should buy this game ASAP if you like hectic rogue-like games. I am enjoying this game so much. Now all it needs is multiplayer and it will be one of the best rogue-likes to come out THIS YEAR! The developers have not abandoned this game and they are showing continous love to it and this has not fallen into early access Hell and I couldn't be happier!\n\nTL;DR - This game is the ♥♥♥♥ and you should buy it if you like rogue-likes.","July 6, 2015","true","31.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Not like in Rogue Legacy, but works almost same).\n\nPros:\n- Different Classes. Currently there are 3 classes to play as since strt (rogue, archer and barbarian) + other guys, unlockable after killing bosses. Every class has 3 skills (such casual :/) - main attack (lmb), charged attack (rmb) and buff. For killing monsters, you gets exp, after lvlup can spend one point to upgrade one of your skills\n- Replayability. As I said, its roguelike, so - levels are randomly generated, you have only one life, bla-bla-bla.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics. Actully nothing wrong with pixel art, but there are 2 huge problems in this game on its current state: low resolution of art and 4:3. YES, IF YOU USES 16:9 OR WIDER MONITOR, YOU WILL SEE HUGE BLACK BORDERS.\n- Controls. For strange thing, you can move throught menu only by using keyboard (in game you can use mouse normally). Also there is still no gamepad support. Sadly.\n- Early Access. Everything here SCREAMS "its wip". Im not about lack of content or glitches, but about game's core. As you can see, game is very different from early builds (simply UI changed thouthand of times, old was better) right now and I have no idea, will its make it better in future or not.\n\nSo... Right now I cant recommend this game. Its MAY be fun in future, but right now its very raw and unfinished. Also Im goes to refund, but wont unsibscribe it - if devs will fix and polish it, I ll grab it again","November 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

However some enemies/bosses are broken. Such as the second boss, the game lags so much because of all the entities on screen it makes the bullet-hell dodging mechanics impossible. The game also gets a bit repetetive over time. The "voice acting" they've added in a recent update is some of the worst I've ever heard. I don't know why they thought a game like this (which besides a few enemies and the bosses I'd mention is a pretty decent game).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soviet/recommended/383230/","soviet","Quixachev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soviet/","102 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter winning a giveaway, I was stoked to spend some time on this game while recovering from recent hip surgery.  A few hours in and I am quite ecstatic about the gift.\n\nThe game is a roguelike and borrows heavily from recent successful titles such as Binding of Isaac, DCSS and even Rogue Legacy with some aspects.  I'm usually a little annoyed by the indie movement of making games look like I'm playing my old Super Nintendo, but this game's does graphics well overall.\n\nThe game is very straight forward as you jump in, you have your two mouse buttons, the WASD to move and your Q/E keys for changing out the abilities.  As you level, you can boost certain character stats and your original abilities along with gathering certain items that will make you stronger.\n\nThe good -\nlike stated above, the graphics are solid for what they are and match the game well.\nThe combat feels nice and your character very responsive.\nThe character progression is a nice touch, with the characters gaining slight permanent boost to stats the longer you play them.\nUnlocking the passive skills with gold is also nice, as it helps you get that extra edge to keep progressing even if you don't have the best luck with drops.\nThe bad -\nAt a certain point, boss fights seem very much 'we're going to fill your screen with projectiles until you die' (at least with certain classes).  It doesn't really make it challenging as some items are pretty game breaking still (it is a beta afterall) and you can literally get 100% parry chance and sit there afk and still win.\nThe class differences are monumental at the beginning until you equalize things with drops.  Yes, you will be able to progress with anything if you take the time to get items and farm enemies for experience if needed, but some feel VERY underpowered in the beginning.\nthe ability switching is also very clunky.  It would be nice if the e/q buttons activated the abilities as soon as you pressed the keys, or alternatively - take a page out of Path of Exile's book and assign the 2nd ability to the middle mouse button,\nprobably the weakest complaint, but reskinning enemies to show toughness is something that annoys me a little bit, especially when they are largely still not a challenge unless you're playing the higher difficulties.\nThe weird/broken:\nSome items are beyond broken.  Theif's lockpick is a 25% chance every 30 seconds to unlock every chest on the map.  You simply spam the key before grabbing the last unlock until you can collect every item.  Nothing else in the item slot comes close IMO to this piece until you're maxed out with parry chance and 'unique' drops.\nThe class discrepancy with the magic/physical aspect is a little annoying to me.  Some characters - let's take the warrior for example - has skills that are boosted by magic damage... why?  Same with the thief and some others.\nMany classes simply don't need all three abilities to play different.  They are a little redundant and frankly after 1 levelsare almost pointless to raise higher.  It makes it even worse that your ability levels are so far between and eventually just stop.  It may be better to give you an ability level each time you level up normally, but cap the Q/E abilities a little bit so you can't raise them too high.\nI'm not a huge fan of the same enemies spawning every time from the locks.  It takes one AOE ability to take everything out most of the time and it's always the same enemies.  The higher difficulties make this a little better, but once you get enough items it still becomes a cake-walk.  The game, with some classes, effectively becomes a dance with bosses with nothing much in between.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of roguelikes.  It has enough replayability with the various classes and progression.  I would like it if the bosses later on had some more interesting mechanics instead of just doubling them up/etc.  Higher difficulties solve a lot of the issues that I have, but are very difficult to play with certain characters even if you are fairly skilled.  I'm sure I will be putting in many more hours into this though.","November 7, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I Have to say, the devs just stopped communicating with the community with the occasional "we are still here" or "hang on" comment in the discussion section. There was a promise of weekly updates, the game has not been updated since october, so yea, here you go. I have to change my review from recommend to not recommend just thanks to these facts. If there will be an update with more ones to come in the future, I will change the review once again, but in this state, I am quite skeptical about the whole projekt.\nTL DR:  If you're looking for this type of genre. Go on and buy Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne or something similar instead for now...\n\nPatch #2.5 review updated\n\nWhile I have played this game just in normal/easy mode, I think, I have experienced enough to write a little review for you guys, who are thinking of buying this game. For those of you, who are not keen on reading a whole paragraph of jibber jabber, here is my verdict.  Even in it's early state, this game is very fun and worth buying, especially for those of you, who like games like Nuclear Throne, Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac, etc.\n\nPROS:\n- awesome art style\n- decent replayablity thanks to randomly generated levels and items\n- variety of enemies\n- fun combat with 7 unique playable characters with different playstyle and spells\n- difficuilty ramping with every playthrough cycle like in Nuclear Throne\n- time pressure thanks to The Redeemer\n- potion problem fixed perfectly, there is now a risk and reward with a 50/50% and effects shown\n\nCONS:\n- fairly limited arsenal of items, but that is understandable, since it is fresh even on early access\n- sometimes chaotic gameplay thanks to spells having too many particles, so the screen gets overwhelmed.\n- in this state only 4 bioms with 4 unique bosses on end of each biom\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- some characters are better than others in my opinion, but I guess it deppens on players playstyle\n- The Redeemer sometimes spawn on really awkward positions eq. by the entrance to the next level\n- monsters don't react or get influenced by traps\n- game is still in a state, where the core mechanics and features are in motion and differ in every patch\n\n\nKeep in mind that this is an early access review and things are going to improve and change, I might update my review after some major changes, to keep it updated with the current state.","July 6, 2015","false","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellOnHearth/recommended/383230/","HellOnHearth","Furry Fucker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellOnHearth/","50 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFlaws, Flaws Everywhere\nI wouldn't say that I recommend this game, yet I wouldn't say that I don't.\nThe game itself is fun, especially when you have a really good build, but it's got so many faults.\n\nFor one, the melee classes are abysmally bad. Getting close to enemies is bad enough, but all of melee classes have a slow attack. With the exception of one, but you still have to get close and personal. Which is bad, because it makes fighting ranged enemies tedious. And fighting some of the bosses is impossible because they either move around a lot or getting close will put you in a bad position, making you die faster a Mayfly. It's just better to use a Ranged class, the best example being Archer and Rogue, because of their quick rate of fire, ability to cancel out projectiles by firing at them, and starting off with the most speed.\n\nAnother flaw in this game is the fact that it lags (this one is personal). A Pixelated game that LAGS. This is something that I very rarely see. From what I can tell, it's all the dynamic lighting and particle effects from the torches. It could also be the corpses as well, since the farther I get into a level, the more lag there is. And the worst part is that my game runs at 30 FPS as oppossed to, what I can tell, is supposed to be 60. So my game runs at half the speed it's supposed to. Everything feels sluggish. It's kind of frustrating in its own right.\n\nThis game seems to be trying to be a difficult roguelike, somewhat akin to something like Nuclear Throne and Dark Souls (And not just because of the "Souls" in both names). And it achieves that. In all the wrong ways. As Vlambeer, the developer of Nuclear Throne, once said, "it's not fair, it's not right". This game isn't right. Some attacks from bosses and enemies happen so fast, you can barely take in it's coming for you before you take in in the face. Some bosses, especially the final boss, fire so many projectiles that they feel impossible to dodge. And if you focus on dodging, you're likely to get shot in the face with a laser you couldn't even comprehend was there until you lose half your health.\n\nI've unlocked hard mode. It was one of the biggest goals I had for this game. And I don't want to reach any farther. Hard Mode is, from what I can tell, Borderline IMPOSSIBLE. I can only imagine the final boss doing twice the already ♥♥♥♥load of damage. I hate games that do Hard Mode like this. The ones that don't change anything except the damage and health of enemies. Also, I'm pretty sure the final boss wouldn't be that bad, if I wasn't sure it would have twice the health.\n\nNow that I've gotten through some of the flaws in this game, I will talk about the cons... After I take a break because I'm getting tired of typing. But it can all be summed up into 1 thing.\n\nDungeon Souls is a mediocre game.\n\nThere you go.\n\n","March 13","false","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't play past the final boss\nAs soon as you beat the game, you are at a pretty much God level. I actually didn't need to attack at all to beat levels, instead aura items would kill one enemy, and then all the "on kill effects" would nuke the entire room. There was literally no challenge at all. It took me two minutes of standing next to four skeleton kings to kill me.\nThe items are amazingly fun to use, but they didn't seem to be designed to synergise with each other, so combining two or more "on hit" or "on kill" effects just makes the game ♥♥♥♥ easy.\n\n2. Don't play the nightwalker\nThis class removes all the challenge from the game, and doesn't even have any real interesting kit to play with. His gimmick is that he can swap weapons to change between a ranged and melee basic attack. Essentially you stand next to the boss holding left click for insane damage, then step back and use your ranged attack until you heal back to full health. I spent nine hours learning thief and the rest of the classes, never beating the final boss. On my first NW run I beat the final boss three times and became invincible.\n\nOverall, this game is awesome, but I think to improve the items should be revised. My suggestions are:\n1. Decrease the % chance of things happening! 50% chance to start a fire is ridiculous with just one item, and then combining it with other effects like explosions just makes the game ridiculous. To do this you could simply make the chances a lot lower and increase the drop rates, or make them not too much lower and make the stacking multiplicatively.\n2. Just decrease the damage on all of them. This means that the mental screen filling particle effects can stay, but there can still be some element of challenge involved when you don't one shot every monster.\n\nI also think that it'd be better if the difficulty increase added new mechanics to enemies like different attack patterns or more bullets, because just increasing the damage/health doesn't make the game tooo interesting :)\n\nI'd rate this 8.5/10","November 30, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

HEY!\ndid you know we sell stuff? -and you would be all like. oh really? silly me, i thought this was a police station, not a place where they sell stuff, i bet there's so many people that didn't get to see that gigantic "market" sign in front of the main ,gate and why not all of the price tags as well? and finally if it told you how everything works it would destroy its personality,yet it would be such a minimalistic criticism, but it doesn't even let that scratch its excelence. and that's just scratching the surface of this early access title. for example the gameplay is so much fun! this is one of those games where, i don't mind grinding for a long time since the combat sistem is a whole lot of fun, its fast paced,dinamic,strategic yet mindless and varied between classes, with one class you could be playing a bullet hell shooter, with another you could be playing a hack n' slash, the next class might be a stealth game with super crits and detection meters, or maybe you are playing a beat em up of sorts, and their implementaion never feels forced as a filler since its personality and execution make up for possible downpoints.\nit's precentation is amazing! the animations are fluid, the pixelart is expressive specially for the tiny size of every sprite and finds a good balance between its size so it doesn't become clunky at all and its interpretation of its own artstyle on pixelart so its visually apealing, the lighting is moody but the atmosphere could improve in my opinion. and im not even gonna bother mentioning the soundtrack since there's only like 2 tracks. and besides, its still early access so obviously there's a lot of things to be added, and even in this state of development its so worth it to give it a try.\n\nit's basically the binding of issac on steroids but with less items and less edmund, this dev, for sure\nneeds to have way more credit for its personality,show of promise and overall being a good dev.\n12/10 and iminent goty (in my eyes at least...)","July 11, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Satisfying sounds, pretty visuals. The only real complaint I have is the spike enemies in the sewer... They can become stuck in doorways, preventing quick progress or even forcing an end to an otherwise solid run. And their damage is a bit much for an unkillable enemy. Other than that, a very nice game to sink some time into. I look forward to future updates, but even the current version is worth getting if you are a fan of roguelikes or top-downs.\n\n*Edit: as of the last update, the spikes in the sewer can now be killed, which is great. The downside is that they have been replaced by the most regular sewer mobs, who now seem to scale way harder than they should.","July 10, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To survive, the player must run, kill, level up, gather items, master skills, and run and kill some more.\n\nIt’s set in a fantasy world where after choosing one of several available character classes, such as the Barbarian, Archer, and Thief, the player must fight their way through hordes of mobs and bosses, gaining powers and facing tougher fights with each floor. Each level is also procedurally generated, making every playthrough unique and vastly more enjoyable had it not been.\n\nOne of the greatest strengths of Dungeon Souls is the balance among the character classes. The Barbarian is tough and meant to be tossed into the fray. It deals decent enough damage, but is slower compared to its long-range counterparts. The Thief is light-footed, can deal decent ranged attacks and has the highest critical-hit damage. But, the HP is quite low, along with its defense. Even though they’re vastly different, neither of the classes felt imbalanced, but rather only changed how I approached my game.\n\nThe only downside I saw was the lack of co-op. As of now the game is still in Early Access, and the developers state the full version will feature multiplayer. Given that, I do have to knock it down a point for what I played myself at this time. When multiplayer gets up and running I’ll gladly revisit this and adjust accordingly.\n\n9/10.

The game has a healthy learning curve, meaning you will die excessively to begin with, but once you get the hang of the game and begin placing some gold into increasing your passives (HP is an absolute necessity on Rogue, lest you be oneshotted by arrow traps upon spawning to a new floor), things fall into a very comfortable rhythm that makes for satisfying gameplay.\n\nThere are still a few bugs that need worked out (Merlin's Hat does not appear to have any effect and Necromancer exceeds his rank's exp cap without leveling up, effectively making him unable to increase in rank), and I do have a few complaints about the UI in regard to how the game's controls are laid out and how much information the game provides you, but all in all, I'd highly recommend this game upon full release to anyone interested in the roguelike genre.\n\nFor some gameplay footage, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUUB3GyQouU#t=4m08s","September 3, 2015","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only real critiques are below:\n\n-As said to death, melee is way outclassed. the weapon size on barbarian is way to small. It's impossible to hit a melee enemy without getting hit. Warrior is manageable, but you have to rely on his ranged ability. Give these classes bigger weapons to balance. Barbarian should be warrior size, and warrior should be a size larger.\n\n-Number on enemies can be ridiculous, especially early game. Wizard handles them with multishot and Cleric does the same, but other classes have trouble with this. I understand preferred playstyle, but compare it to Risk of Rain. Enemies become stronger and more frequent over time. The current system has lead to me watching larger stuff spawn while I deal with crowds of enemies on the first floor.\n\n-Leveling is a pain. You get one statpoint per level, and as far as I've experienced, about one level per floor. Leveling is not a fast process, and should be rewarded more largely. Vice versa, leveling reward could be the same, but leveling could be faster.\n\n-Bosses. I read this in an earlier review and must say that bosses are not impossible, but are one of the greater annoyances in the game. An enemy with 1500 health I'm dealing 7 damage to at a time is tedious. Add constant enemies spawning as I kill them off and attempt to attack the boss is more than most players can handle. Clearly one must be of a higher level to defeat the boss, but as I stated previously, leveling is not properly scaled. Beating a boss right now is the most rewarding feeling in game while overpowered. The statement for bosses is also true in the current version of the game for floors following them. I always feel underleveled when entering floors after a boss, and it usually shows by a swift death.\n\n-Not currently in the game, but there should be some form of tutorial. I know what I'm doing now, but a tutorial would have made the learning curve infinitely easire.\n\nShould I have any other critiques, they will be added, but these are things I would like to see improved right now.","July 4, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomnaut/recommended/383230/","nomnaut","Nomnaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomnaut/","257 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere are some REALLY glaring oversights that make the game not worth playing in its current iteration, which is somewhat understandable for an Early Access Game. Although, why would you bother going to Early Access if your game isn't fun to play yet?!\n\nMost disturbing is the lack of mouse support on the main menu. Without mouse support, the main menu becomes a puzzle in its own right. Arrow keys? No. Press Enter? NOPE. Try the mouse again? Nothing.\n\nYou have to use ASWD on the menu. WTF?! But how do you select options, you ask, if it's not enter. With SPACEBAR of course.\n\nAfter picking from one of three characters (more can be unlocked, to be implemented later I take it), you're dropped into a great pixelated dungeon, usually right on top of enemies. You'll be taking damage from the second you start playing, and it doesn't stop until you die. I mean that. It never stops. Want to spend the point you earned from leveling up? No time. The character sheet nor inventory pause the game. Basically, if you bother to read anything or attempt to understand any nuance of the game, you'll die. Why on God's green earth was this deemed a good idea? I'm not even playing a multiplayer game. I just want a damn second to read what my abilities do. But you don't have a second. Read, and you die. That's the moral of this game.\n\nAlso, it lacks controller support. It's a twin stick shooter... that lacks controller support. Let that soak in. I mean, did everyone forget that twin stick shooters were born in the arcade?! That the WHOLE point was to have independent control of movement and shooting via two separate analog joysticks? Hence, twin stick. Why wasn't this game built from the ground up to support controllers? Do they have any hope of releasing to other platforms? They should! Because the design, aesthetic, art are otherwise fantastic. It just suffers from some REALLY bad production decisions.\n\nThis game is in VERY early access. It has great potential though. Wait for release, otherwise we're sending developers the wrong message. That message being, "Yes, yes I will pay for your proof of concept."","August 19, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It appeals to players of all play styles with the various classes, some with range, some with melee (which aren't as underpowered as you'd think, since they can slice through projectiles) all nicely tied together with great sound.

Each character feels unique enough to stand alone, but not one class feels overpowered than the others.\n\nWhile the gameplay looks most similar to Nuclear Throne, I would say that this game draws closer inspiration from Risk of Rain and Spelunky, due to the insane amount of passive items, along with the various traps and dangers strewn throughout each floor.\n\nRight now, my only major gripe with the game is the visual aspect - the lighting sometimes makes it difficult to find enemies and traps, and the screenshake can get to be a little distracting as well. On top of that, there is no clear visual representation for when your character gets damaged, which would be a handy inclusion to the gameplay.\n\nDespite those issues, the game is great fun, and I'd recommend it in it's current state at the $10 price tag - especially if you're into action-roguelikes. Even now, in it's Early Access stage, there is more than enough content to justify the price.","March 25","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That being said, the devs are quite readily taking in feedback, post a thing on the steam forums and they adress you pretty promptly if they expect the issues to changed or adressed in the next update which is scheduled vaguely every weekend which is pretty good and pleasnt to see on steam's early access and directly attends the player base, compared to using other site's forums or places to manage concerns.\nBut to the game it's self and not the coolbeans people managing it.\nThe game it'self is a really solid mash up of Risk of Rain and top-down dungeon shooters like Nuclear throne but a traditional fantasy setting. The class system adresses each niche fairly and attempts to make every class really unique while attempting to add more of them to the game is really good. The graphics are pleasing and simple and isn't to much or to little for the player to grasp between the shooty bits and your own dude, though i find the bloom a tad much but I always complain about bloom soo i wouldn't take that to seriously. The audio is there, it's not great, it's not annoying, it's just a background at the moment im unsure if they plan to revamp the tunes but as is, is okay but would like a bit more personally.\nThis game at the moment is a horridly balanced circus undergoing more editing than you're average plastic surgeon's regular clientele, and I find it hard to reccomend people to buy it yet, but it'll definately be a worthwhile pick up later or if you don't like the forum posting frequently and the messy meta game then you can see your purchase as a pre-order /shrug.\nOverall a really great looking game with a ton of upcoming potential, and even me who avoids the forums and generally just gripes to friends about Early-Access games (like starbound) instead of posting, feels the need to post veiws and issues on the forum in hopes to see this game flourish.","July 13, 2015","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Satisfying sounds, pretty visuals. The only real complaint I have is the spike enemies in the sewer... They can become stuck in doorways, preventing quick progress or even forcing an end to an otherwise solid run. And their damage is a bit much for an unkillable enemy. Other than that, a very nice game to sink some time into. I look forward to future updates, but even the current version is worth getting if you are a fan of roguelikes or top-downs.\n\n*Edit: as of the last update, the spikes in the sewer can now be killed, which is great. The downside is that they have been replaced by the most regular sewer mobs, who now seem to scale way harder than they should.","July 10, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't play past the final boss\nAs soon as you beat the game, you are at a pretty much God level. I actually didn't need to attack at all to beat levels, instead aura items would kill one enemy, and then all the "on kill effects" would nuke the entire room. There was literally no challenge at all. It took me two minutes of standing next to four skeleton kings to kill me.\nThe items are amazingly fun to use, but they didn't seem to be designed to synergise with each other, so combining two or more "on hit" or "on kill" effects just makes the game ♥♥♥♥ easy.\n\n2. Don't play the nightwalker\nThis class removes all the challenge from the game, and doesn't even have any real interesting kit to play with. His gimmick is that he can swap weapons to change between a ranged and melee basic attack. Essentially you stand next to the boss holding left click for insane damage, then step back and use your ranged attack until you heal back to full health. I spent nine hours learning thief and the rest of the classes, never beating the final boss. On my first NW run I beat the final boss three times and became invincible.\n\nOverall, this game is awesome, but I think to improve the items should be revised. My suggestions are:\n1. Decrease the % chance of things happening! 50% chance to start a fire is ridiculous with just one item, and then combining it with other effects like explosions just makes the game ridiculous. To do this you could simply make the chances a lot lower and increase the drop rates, or make them not too much lower and make the stacking multiplicatively.\n2. Just decrease the damage on all of them. This means that the mental screen filling particle effects can stay, but there can still be some element of challenge involved when you don't one shot every monster.\n\nI also think that it'd be better if the difficulty increase added new mechanics to enemies like different attack patterns or more bullets, because just increasing the damage/health doesn't make the game tooo interesting :)\n\nI'd rate this 8.5/10","November 30, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I Have to say, the devs just stopped communicating with the community with the occasional "we are still here" or "hang on" comment in the discussion section. There was a promise of weekly updates, the game has not been updated since october, so yea, here you go. I have to change my review from recommend to not recommend just thanks to these facts. If there will be an update with more ones to come in the future, I will change the review once again, but in this state, I am quite skeptical about the whole projekt.\nTL DR:  If you're looking for this type of genre. Go on and buy Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne or something similar instead for now...\n\nPatch #2.5 review updated\n\nWhile I have played this game just in normal/easy mode, I think, I have experienced enough to write a little review for you guys, who are thinking of buying this game. For those of you, who are not keen on reading a whole paragraph of jibber jabber, here is my verdict.  Even in it's early state, this game is very fun and worth buying, especially for those of you, who like games like Nuclear Throne, Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac, etc.\n\nPROS:\n- awesome art style\n- decent replayablity thanks to randomly generated levels and items\n- variety of enemies\n- fun combat with 7 unique playable characters with different playstyle and spells\n- difficuilty ramping with every playthrough cycle like in Nuclear Throne\n- time pressure thanks to The Redeemer\n- potion problem fixed perfectly, there is now a risk and reward with a 50/50% and effects shown\n\nCONS:\n- fairly limited arsenal of items, but that is understandable, since it is fresh even on early access\n- sometimes chaotic gameplay thanks to spells having too many particles, so the screen gets overwhelmed.\n- in this state only 4 bioms with 4 unique bosses on end of each biom\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- some characters are better than others in my opinion, but I guess it deppens on players playstyle\n- The Redeemer sometimes spawn on really awkward positions eq. by the entrance to the next level\n- monsters don't react or get influenced by traps\n- game is still in a state, where the core mechanics and features are in motion and differ in every patch\n\n\nKeep in mind that this is an early access review and things are going to improve and change, I might update my review after some major changes, to keep it updated with the current state.","July 6, 2015","false","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You’re character has upgradable stats and abilities to improve their performance, along with collectable items you find throughout the levels. If your character dies you lose all your items, but your character itself levels in rank which gives it bonuses. It would seem that there is a plan for stats being able to improve your abilities as well. There are 5 dungeons in total for every difficulty. Each dungeon has 3 levels, the first 2 is where you gather items, gold, and experience from slaying enemy mobs and the 3rd one is where you face the boss! You have to activate a certain number of spawn nodes in order to proceed to the next level. You must be careful though every level has traps and super mobs, they can get the best of you regardless of how strong your character may be!\n\nWhat this game is doing right so far is the gameplay and items you collect, you can have a ton of fun destroying monsters left, right, and centre  with your abilities and the items that enhance your damage. The boss battles are fun yet frustrating, you will be scratching your head how to overcome certain patterns of a bosses play style. They need to improve on certain enemy designs, some of them starting from the winter dungeon level with the purple square eye mobs seem way to simple, same with the flies in the cathedral. I found that range characters seem to have a disadvantage against certain mobs, the range character typically has low health, high damage, and above average movement speed. There are certain enemies who will rush up to you and start knocking down your health points and before you know it you’re dead, this can be frustrating when there is a lot going on when fighting enemy mobs. The traps need to have a more eye catching notification that they’ve been activated as well following under when there is a lot going on when fighting enemy mobs. melee characters have a great advantage against bosses or enemies who shoot projectiles because their basic attack can stop it.\n\nOverall this game is a lot of fun, it certainly has kept me entertained with the progression of your character, the selection of characters, and collecting items. I haven’t defeated the final boss yet…I will soon! I definitely recommend this game to any dungeon crawler fan because it’s just in early access now and there’s a lot more to come!\n\nI've also made a Let's Play video of if you want to take a look at what I've discussed!\nLet's Play Video Link: https://youtu.be/uJia3tGkxCs","December 29, 2015","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This action-adventure dungeon-crawling game is very catchy. You can set the difficulty level at the very beginning of the game and choose you hero as well. I must say that all Heroes have quite good stats and are easy to use in the battles against the creatures withing the dungeons. You can level up easily and also collect different items for your hero from three chests: Wooden, Silver and Golden. Items can be bought as well from the Shop found in every dungeon and you don't have to worry about currency. You will get enough gold once you start killing creatures.\n\nEven if you don't get the chance to see a story in this game, that's not really a matter as the game is already dynamic and you will always be busy to keep destroying monsters than do anything. But in order to pass the dungeon you have to activate Marks which bring along different packs of monsters. You have to clean and activate all those Marks in order to meet The Redemeer, a selfish guy who will try to steal your soul. (No, not in a romantic way )\n\nThe soundtrack is quite playful, but you will not really pay attention to it, since the game's action is that catchy. However, the sound effects are quite powerful, especially the projectile's sound effect. You will not miss for sure if something is attacking you from the distance.\n\nGraphics are quite typical for a 2D game and I like the fact that the characters are still somehow detailed, I mean you are not seeing some undefined pixeled spots, but some cute tiny characters.\n\nEven though there are not that much features implemented in the current version, Dungeon Souls is very fun to play and entertaining and I strongly recommned this game to anyone. Still, we are expecting new features and goodies in this game in the future.","January 5","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Explore vast dungeons and fight huge bosses! My first thought of this game was a simple beat-them up game. But after a few minutes it was its own game. While there is ain't much of a story, it provides much fun and I personally enjoyed it.\n\nThe 4 four classes you start off with were barbarian, archer, theif, and dark knight. Each class had their own strengths and weakness. Barbarian's have large health but can only fight up close, Archer's attack from long distances but there cool down for their abilities is long, Thief's have high critic chance but they have low health, and NightBlade dual wield weapons. The classes are fun and provide their own unique experience.\n\nThe gameplay for this game is good but it takes some strategy and a bit of caution why because besides enemies you have to watch out for traps in the dungeon. In order to advance from one dungeon to another, you have to activate glows circles called glyphs. When you get to these glyphs monsters will spawn around you. Caution because most times you will be surrounded so never go when you have low health. Once activating all the glyphs, you will be able to go to the next level and you repeat this until you meet the boss. In general this game isn’t a walk in the park but you will have fun. I mean the point in a game is to be challenging.\n\nThe only suggestions I have would be controller support because keyboard and mouse can be difficult to play when there's a lot of enemies. Plus it would appeal more to people. Another suggestion would be if possible make this game available for android, iphone, and tablets expand other than steam. Lastly try to give the thief class a little more health.\n\nOverall this game is fun, it's simple, and it has replayability thanks to all the classes.  I would recommend this game to anyone who has a pc. Plus this game can run on almost any pc or laptop. I really enjoyed this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soviet/recommended/383230/","soviet","Quixachev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soviet/","102 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter winning a giveaway, I was stoked to spend some time on this game while recovering from recent hip surgery.  A few hours in and I am quite ecstatic about the gift.\n\nThe game is a roguelike and borrows heavily from recent successful titles such as Binding of Isaac, DCSS and even Rogue Legacy with some aspects.  I'm usually a little annoyed by the indie movement of making games look like I'm playing my old Super Nintendo, but this game's does graphics well overall.\n\nThe game is very straight forward as you jump in, you have your two mouse buttons, the WASD to move and your Q/E keys for changing out the abilities.  As you level, you can boost certain character stats and your original abilities along with gathering certain items that will make you stronger.\n\nThe good -\nlike stated above, the graphics are solid for what they are and match the game well.\nThe combat feels nice and your character very responsive.\nThe character progression is a nice touch, with the characters gaining slight permanent boost to stats the longer you play them.\nUnlocking the passive skills with gold is also nice, as it helps you get that extra edge to keep progressing even if you don't have the best luck with drops.\nThe bad -\nAt a certain point, boss fights seem very much 'we're going to fill your screen with projectiles until you die' (at least with certain classes).  It doesn't really make it challenging as some items are pretty game breaking still (it is a beta afterall) and you can literally get 100% parry chance and sit there afk and still win.\nThe class differences are monumental at the beginning until you equalize things with drops.  Yes, you will be able to progress with anything if you take the time to get items and farm enemies for experience if needed, but some feel VERY underpowered in the beginning.\nthe ability switching is also very clunky.  It would be nice if the e/q buttons activated the abilities as soon as you pressed the keys, or alternatively - take a page out of Path of Exile's book and assign the 2nd ability to the middle mouse button,\nprobably the weakest complaint, but reskinning enemies to show toughness is something that annoys me a little bit, especially when they are largely still not a challenge unless you're playing the higher difficulties.\nThe weird/broken:\nSome items are beyond broken.  Theif's lockpick is a 25% chance every 30 seconds to unlock every chest on the map.  You simply spam the key before grabbing the last unlock until you can collect every item.  Nothing else in the item slot comes close IMO to this piece until you're maxed out with parry chance and 'unique' drops.\nThe class discrepancy with the magic/physical aspect is a little annoying to me.  Some characters - let's take the warrior for example - has skills that are boosted by magic damage... why?  Same with the thief and some others.\nMany classes simply don't need all three abilities to play different.  They are a little redundant and frankly after 1 levelsare almost pointless to raise higher.  It makes it even worse that your ability levels are so far between and eventually just stop.  It may be better to give you an ability level each time you level up normally, but cap the Q/E abilities a little bit so you can't raise them too high.\nI'm not a huge fan of the same enemies spawning every time from the locks.  It takes one AOE ability to take everything out most of the time and it's always the same enemies.  The higher difficulties make this a little better, but once you get enough items it still becomes a cake-walk.  The game, with some classes, effectively becomes a dance with bosses with nothing much in between.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game if you're a fan of roguelikes.  It has enough replayability with the various classes and progression.  I would like it if the bosses later on had some more interesting mechanics instead of just doubling them up/etc.  Higher difficulties solve a lot of the issues that I have, but are very difficult to play with certain characters even if you are fairly skilled.  I'm sure I will be putting in many more hours into this though.","November 7, 2015","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a top down level crawler with "Risk of Rain" loot system makes this game feel both new and familiar. When I joined there is a total of 8 characters, the first three you get give you a look into the primary classes, Melee bulk, Ranged Burst, and Ranged DPS. The controls were bit wonky at first, but easily acustom to. The other classes you obtain rely on your skill in the game and luck, as some of them rely on you beating levels while some rely on you getting a random rare or more item. I can say getting the characters is not hard, in 30 minutes I had all of them, plus I assume the devs are increasing the classes they release as there was originally only five.

It's got similarities to games like The Binding of Isaac, and Nuclear Throne. It's rather difficult even on Easy, which means it puts up a great challenge. Although, like in Binding of Isaac, you sometimes get really OP runs depending on the items you find. It appeals to players of all play styles with the various classes, some with range, some with melee (which aren't as underpowered as you'd think, since they can slice through projectiles) all nicely tied together with great sound.

With each patch and update, the game has added numerous features, most of which has been recieved badly by the community.  Most recently, (approximately 2 months ago) at the time of writing this review, I encountered a resolution issue, where the game would not run correctly.  I have a 4k monitor, and I'm not expecting the game to be 'stellar, with 4k graphics', but on simply trying to adjust the resolution to 1920x1080 (which is a selectable option in the game), it simply defaults back to 800x600.  Running 800x600 in windowed mode on a 4k monitor simply makes the game unplayable.\n\nI have been waiting over 2 months for a simple update to correct the issue, where hitting 'back' in the options menu reverts the resolution, and all requests for even light feedback on the community forum goes unanswered.  And yes, for those who are unaware, there is no 'confirm' button in the options menu, simply a 'back' button, so it's not user-error regarding resolution.\n\nIn short, add this game to your watch-list, but do not spend your money on it at this time.  Sadly, there are better quality games, some of which are cheaper or even free.\n\nI look forward to when this game is at least playable again.","November 21, 2015","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found many features to be the same as titles such as The Binding Of Issac, Risk of Rian and Nuclear Throne but not in a way that it was copied or somewhat dull to play. i love it to bits and i hope to see more from this game, i really do. but dont take my word, go and buy this golden example of an indie game and see for yourself.","July 12, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can definitely feel borrowed elements from both, whether it is the art style, or simply the presentation of UI elements.\n\nRight now, the game itself is a solid framework for something much deeper. But you will find yourself going through the same maps frequently without too much in variance.\n\nSome of the classes (melee mostly) need some reworking as the game heavily favors non-ranged combat. The latest class added (yesterday), the Necromancer is crippled with the same nagging AI issues that are prevalent with the regular enemy-monsters, except sometimes they simply do not assist the Necromancer with dealing damage.\n\nHowever, despite the unpolished nature of the game, you'll find it fun if you're looking for a quick pick-up-and-die game. Perhaps further down the development road map there'll be much more added to it.","July 13, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only 1 update had come out and the game was in Early Access. However, it was so good that it felt like a finished game. All of the classes are very balanced in the game and all of them feel very powerful but not so powerful that it ruined the game. For instance, the Cleric can heal himself 10HP/second, which seems rather unfair. However, to counter this, his health is the second lowest in the game (alongside Archer) and deals low damage. Other classes have their perks and weaknesses, so there is a class for everybody. A feature that I would like to see in the finished game is Multiplayer so that I can enjoy this wonderful Rougelike with my friends. All I would ask is a tutorial in the game for newer players because the Level Up system is quite confusing\n9/10, like Nuclear Throne and Risk of Rain combined.","July 10, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bought it during the Christmas sale, I think, but never tried it. Start it up and have a lot of problems getting my controller to work (Up is "select menu item"? What? Can only navigate the menu with thumbstick? What? Up is also attack, even if I bind it to another button? What?). I go to the forums to report my issue and I see three discrete threads and a post under the most recent "report bugs here" sticky all complaining about similar or related problems.\n\nThis does not bode well for this game. If you're looking to play with a gamepad, I'd consider holding off until all of these bugs are fixed.\n\n2016-03-05 edit: There was an upate a few days ago which has resolved a few issues. There are still bugs with setting the music/sound (apparently you need to select "mute: yes" to hear anything) and resolution (the game starts at 640x480 regardless of your machine's configuration), and sometimes the game forgets these settings, restarts, and then you need to enter them again.\n\nThe controls seem to work, now, in that I'm actually able to control the character. What I find unforgiveable, though, is that this is a Zelda-style game that uses a cursor for determining which direction your character is facing. Yes, you need to direct the cursor with a thumbstick to determine which way you're facing. Yes, that's every bit as bad as it sounds. Beyond this, the cursor requirement isn't specified anywhere and isn't listed in the controls, so I had to figure this out myself.\n\n2016-03-14 edit: The devs have revisited the control scheme, following a collection of forum threads (including one of mine). This in itself warrants a recommendation, but I will definitely be revisiting this title to get a better opinion of it now that I can actually competently play, and will be likewise revisiting this review.","February 20","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cowmanodoom/recommended/383230/","cowmanodoom","cowmanodoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cowmanodoom/","67 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPremise:\n\nClear each level by killing enemies and activating marks to progress deeper into the dungeon.  Acquire equipment from chests and shops to make yourself more powerful.\n\nDeath is permanent, but not to fear, the resources and experience you collect from your previous deaths can be used to make your character even more powerful, thus making your character stronger every time you die and revive.  Death is an integral part of finally achieving victory!\n\nVisuals:\n\nA cute little game with retro sprite graphics.  The dungeons have neat little designs everywhere, and the characters are cute and really fun.  There's not exactly much to say, but it still looks really nice.\n\nI greatly appreciate that the dungeon backgrounds change with every boss battle.  Instead of making every dungeon look the same with more powerful enemies of the same type, Dungeon Souls changes the dungeon and enemy sprites every 4th level.  It is always refreshing to find a new color palette after you defeat a difficult boss.\n\nMenus/Interface:\n\nA lot of things aren't exactly explained from the start.  The menus and in-game interface can be a little overwhelming at the beginning.  Most of it must be learned through trial and error, and a lot of fiddling around.  It all works well once you figure it out though.\n\nGameplay/Controls:\n\nOverall, gameplay is a lot of fun.  Basic gameplay is just running around and just chop at random stuff.  You collect items from your fallen enemies, and every 3 levels you will be faced with a boss; each one being harder than the last.\n\nThe fact that death is an integral part of eventual victory makes dying a lot less painful in the long run; you die knowing that, next time, you will most likely level up and progress even farther.  So in this case, what kills you makes you stronger!  (Bad reference, I know)\n\nAlso, enemies do appear on top of you randomly, and I find this a little unfair to the player, as players shouldn't be penalized for something that is not in their control.\n\nControls are very simple and well laid out.  While playing, you have easy access to all your attacks, and it is not difficult to use at all, after you learn how they work of course, and that may take some time.\n\nCertain things I am still unsure of how they work.  We could use a little more of a tutorial with this game, as the one currently in place is not the most informative.  I am assuming they are planning on adding a more clear and informative tutorial as development progresses.\n\nGlitches:\n\nBeing in early access, this game does have its fair share of glitches.  At times, the game slows down to around 30 FPS.  Seeing as how the graphics are very simplistic and un-demanding,  this is a little confusing. Another issue I have experienced is a game crash after picking up an item.  Aside from this, I haven't found any other issues.\n\nAs this game is in early access, I cannot hold these minor glitches against the game, as it is still a work in progress.\n\nSummary:\n\nA fun game overall.  I recommend this game.\n\nPros:\n\n-Leveling up after a death adds an element of fun to dying.\n-Combat is generally simplistic, but there are certain more advanced things which can be done to tilt combat in your favor.\n-Cute graphics.\n\nCons:\n\n-Some glitches, but nothing game breaking, although the framerate drop is annoying.\n-Needs a more informative tutorial. Current tutorial leaves the user hanging.\n-Sometimes unfair combat.\n\nSCORE:  8.5 / 10","March 9","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So it's kinda fun.\n\nHopefully the game becomes more varied as the development continues and maybe change how the second and third abilities are used so I don't need to awkwardly swap between them, but it works for now.

HEY!\ndid you know we sell stuff? -and you would be all like. oh really? silly me, i thought this was a police station, not a place where they sell stuff, i bet there's so many people that didn't get to see that gigantic "market" sign in front of the main ,gate and why not all of the price tags as well? and finally if it told you how everything works it would destroy its personality,yet it would be such a minimalistic criticism, but it doesn't even let that scratch its excelence. and that's just scratching the surface of this early access title. for example the gameplay is so much fun! this is one of those games where, i don't mind grinding for a long time since the combat sistem is a whole lot of fun, its fast paced,dinamic,strategic yet mindless and varied between classes, with one class you could be playing a bullet hell shooter, with another you could be playing a hack n' slash, the next class might be a stealth game with super crits and detection meters, or maybe you are playing a beat em up of sorts, and their implementaion never feels forced as a filler since its personality and execution make up for possible downpoints.\nit's precentation is amazing! the animations are fluid, the pixelart is expressive specially for the tiny size of every sprite and finds a good balance between its size so it doesn't become clunky at all and its interpretation of its own artstyle on pixelart so its visually apealing, the lighting is moody but the atmosphere could improve in my opinion. and im not even gonna bother mentioning the soundtrack since there's only like 2 tracks. and besides, its still early access so obviously there's a lot of things to be added, and even in this state of development its so worth it to give it a try.\n\nit's basically the binding of issac on steroids but with less items and less edmund, this dev, for sure\nneeds to have way more credit for its personality,show of promise and overall being a good dev.\n12/10 and iminent goty (in my eyes at least...)","July 11, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though it doesnt have a random story to build up on, the game does its job of entertaining the player and giving us a challange. Classes are mostly perfectly even, but its not completly perfect. Of  course the devs are listening to the players and as of its first update only player wanted soulutions was applied so thumbs up for that mike studios! I have only played it in 2 hours after i bought it, thats because i played so much with my friend on his account that you would even know.\n\nPros:\n-The game is balanced\n-Every character has their own unique abilities/attacks\n-Its cheap\n-Bosses\n-The game runs sweet on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2009 lenovo thinkpad t400\n-The developers lets the game bee based on players meanings\n-Sweet pixel styled game\n-Diffrent maps\n-Loads of items and powerups\n-Lvl up system\n\nCons:\n-No friggin multiplayer ;C\n-No customazations of anything\n-Not to many visuals of powerups\n-Few maps\n-Not enough bosses\n\nWhat i think the developers should add:\n-Hats, clothes, masks, gloves, shoes stuff you can equip that you can find in chests and you keep them, can place them on any charater. Doesnt need to help in the game at all, just for style.\n-Mini quests, daily quests; small side missions you can earn something from. (adds replayability)\n-Multiplayer, add this and i will use this as my os on my computer.\n-A thropy room where it will list your done quests, maybe if you can do so that in a few playthroughs a random statue will be placed and if you destroy it you get it in the thropy room.\n-A training room\n-New classes that you can unlock by doing quests.\n\nOverall an amazing game, and if you get tired of it, come back maybe a month later as the devs are coding like crazy to forfill our dreams. And rememver this is a Early access game so dont get your hopes down. This game is amazing and i hope it will stay amazing.\n","July 11, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hitboxes are too wierd.\n2. First boss needs smaller projectile hitboxes (Same as 1st I guess)\n3. Some enemies are too accurate, you can't dodge their attacks\n4. There are some traps that do too much damage for how unpredictable they are, this is mostly an issue only because on easy mode, they are stupidly strong and can ruin a run, this is an issue? It can be off-putting when a game is too challenging for silly reasons like random patterns.\nI felt like these should be addressed as they might get changed because of this, I would hope so.\n\nBesides all of this, the game generally is a lot of fun, I just wish these complaints would get updated out, as the game is only early access and has a lot of room to change.","July 12, 2015","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are too retro for my taste, perhaps I like more detailed pixel art (like HLD). The game simply isn't enrapturing enough to keep my interest. I lost interest within 2 minutes.\n\nBetter tutorial would have helped. Even if you're marketing this game as "hard" like Dark Souls, at least explain what the hell is going on.

Even playing thru it for the first time. It was easy to play a controller. The tutorial wasn't that straight-forwarded. There was a bit of learning I had to do get farther in the game. But I did start to learn how some of the game mechanics worked in the later part of my play thru of the game. I tried playing the game with a controller first then keyboard and mouse. I really seemed easier to play the game with a controller over the keyboard and mouse. Theres good use of music and sounds in the game. Each character class is different, in which it changes how you would really play the game. The thief class seems to be the weak of all the classes tho.

Great gameplay, yet simplistic. Moderate learning curve, if you pay attention to what you're doing, you'll figure the rest of what you can do out.

It has a wide array of unique items that all have different abilities which adds a lot of replay value; especially with the addition of the arcane forge where you can create new weaponry! There is also many different characters with varying abilities and attacks which can fit into lots of differemt play styles and adds tons of replay value! Honestly, I can't think of a direct reason as to why this wouldn't be a good game.. other than it being difficult..\n\nIf you don't like difficult games, then this may not be the game for you! It is a rogue-like with perma death. It is really easy to die from stupid mistakes and or just being overwhelmed. I personally have died for BS reasons like walking into a room with tons of monsters that create thousands of impossilbe to dodge projectiles, or having one of my minions stepping on a pressure plate and getting crushed against a wall by a boulder. This game is very difficult, and I'm not going to emphasize enough that you will die... a lot. I know I have...\n\n10/10 game in my opinion, so much fun, so much replay value, so much to do!

Heaps of fun for 15 minute runs, but any longer than that it gets kind of tedious due to the fact that it's very repetitive. However, the pickups are intriguing and fun to experiment with!\n2. Exactly what a rogue-like RPG game should be like. Revolving around the idea that there is no clunky inventory system, just pick up the item and get the stats. That's exactly how it should be :)\n\nProps to this game for giving me everything I expected out of it! However, a few changes should be made! This is to you, dev's!\n\n1. More items (Replayability kind of plateau's and gets boring after a while due to the same drops being picked up over and over again)\n2. More stages!!! Cannot stress this enough...
