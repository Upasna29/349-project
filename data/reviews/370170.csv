You only need a mouse to play this game and its very easy to manoeuvre the puzzles. Would recommend it to people who like puzzle games as it can keep you busy for hours on end.","October 8, 2015","true","1.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The controls are simple: you move the artifacts horizontaly with the mouse. You need to match the artifacts, in pairs of 2 or 3 artifacts, in the given time to be able to complete the level.\n\nA little more info about matching: for the matching to count they have to be next to each other in a "stay" position...if you swipe an artifact over more artifacts and there is one of same model under it won't count as a match. Also if an artifact is on the moving platform and another of same time on the ledge near the moving platform when they will be next to each other it won't count as match.\n\nThe complexity of levels differ based on the things you'll find in them: from movable blocks that will help you to get over holes, spikes that will destroy your artifacts, blocks which dissapear after you passed them a number of times to teleporters, moving platforms(which can't keep more than one artifact at a time), magnets and switches.\n\nAs a side note, for long play sessions the soundtrack may become a bit annoying because it gets repetitive.","December 12, 2015","true","5.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The levels didn't changed.\n\nThis game is a matching game, the aim is to clear all items of a level by matching twins or trios of the same item in a limited amount of time. It remember me this kind of game, he it's not that one, on the first mobile phone with a color screen.\n\nThe mechanisms of the game are easy to learn and master, some levels are really challenging. There are also some environments to be aware of or to use, such as: weak blocks, sticky black oil, moving spikes, portals, magnet...\n\n(*):\nThere is only one main glitch that is required in order to finish some levels. In one level you need to pause the game while using a moving platform to save time. Without doing that, you are always running out of time.\n\nThis is still a great game to play, and I recommend to use my guide if needed to finish the game or getting the achievements.","March 13","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
