The music is pretty groovy and there are lots of challenges to complete with a bunch of stuff for speedrunners to look at.\n\nIf I had to fault anything it would be that the shadow system takes a while to get used to as it can seem kinda unnecessary to have so much darkness on the screen at once.","March 8","true","5.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Now, even after extensive development, time passed and name change, I've still got the key just because "Snorms is an older version of Alien Blitz." - such attitude deserves respect.\n\nHey jb, congrats! Well deserved.","March 13","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

So my Steam stats don't paint the whole picture here.\n\nAlien Blitz/Snorms plays like Doom with an overhead view and weapon upgrades.\n\nPROS:\n+ Arcade style action.\n+ RPG-like upgrading system.\n+ Level layouts encourage exploration.\n+ Cleared maps can be replayed with new weapons and upgrades in towe.\n+ Level editor will probably result in newer and cooler maps hitting the web.\n+ Controls via m/k or controller (both Direct input and Xinput).\n+ Windows/Mac/Linux versions all included.\n+ Modest hardware requirements.\n\nCONS:\n- Shadow system takes some getting used to.\n- No multiplayer...yet.\n\n*Indie Game Stand version is the better deal. It is DRM-free and includes the Android APK file for Android devices, and the Desura and (now) Steam keys.","March 8","true","0.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattTheGreat2008/recommended/434240/","MattTheGreat2008","MattTheGreat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattTheGreat2008/","2714 products in account","At first, it didn't seem that good but the more I played, the more it felt reminiscent to doom. Both in gameplay and it captured the addictiveness and wonder of doom that I remember having playing when I was a kid.\nThev voxel graphics are quite nice, at first they felt a little amatuerish and low budget but grew on me.\n\nI think the worst thing about the game is the sound. The effects are low quality and the music is royalty free, stock music which I don't think matches very well with the game at all. In fact the endless loops of it puts me off to the point of wanting to stop playing.\n\nI think the developer was probably working on it by himself or with a few people, without much budget, hence the library stock music. I'd suggest getting a composer/sound engineer to redo the sound and music to create a better atmosphere.\n\nHowever, minus the sound, this is a super addictive little game and for OCD people like myself, there are plenty of collectibles, secrets and stuff to unlock (similar system to doom again).","June 2","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Good weapons, enjoyable sounds, great level design and interesting music. Lots of achievements and in-game challenges to give it some replay value.","June 4","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
