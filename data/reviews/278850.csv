Put in a couple of movement tweaks, and a multitude of power ups and you have Spaceforce. It delivers what  an average game of its type normally does and I enjoyed it.\nit starts a bit slow but picks up pace after you beat the first few levels. It begins to get more challenging, at the same time more power ups appear and stack up to your advantage soon enough I realized it was (although slightly different to control) an enjoyable replacement for those old arcade games. 6.5 out of 10 worth a big mac at least, probably more if you really enjoy this genre. I do not generally play this type of game.","December 16, 2014","true","0.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Now I lot my retro games, I must have spent at least a good $20 every Saturday morning at the local arcade(which was in a bowling alley) so I knew what this game was going to be like. Heck I still have the original luna lander and that game is better than this.\n\nI won't review the graphics or audio because they are both exactly what they show off... pseudo-80's/90's semi-realistic photos that move. No issue with that.\n\nThe issue is the fire button is permanently locked to Left-hand mouse and the shields(missiles) to the Right hand button, yet the movement is keyboard based... what the?!!!\n\nAnd if you press 'ESC' to check the controls or something of the menu... YOU QUIT YOUR GAME!!!!\nYou cannot resume or anything. You'd think they'd give a warning like "Do you really want to quit?" but nooooo.\n\nNot worth $5 USD. Maybe $1... if it was better by... I don't know... being able to re-assign the keys!\n\nI'm going back to Luna Lander now or maybe some Sopwith Camel. Either is better than this.\n\nP.s. How does this game take up almost 200mbs?!!! Have people just given up on compression?!!","March 14","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
