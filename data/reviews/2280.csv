I recomend this game to any person who likes FPS games. I'll try to cover some points of interest:\n\nGraphics: Of course, being this game 22 years old (as of this review) the graphics are really dated for a PC game; having a resolution of 320x200 (IIRC), and 256 colors, you can clearly see 'big' pixels. Even then, the game keeps a good atmosphere for the most part. So if you're picky about graphics, maybe the atmosphere created by the game will keep you sane while playing.\n\nSound: The same as the last point; it's old. Even then, the sounds fit, so enemies growls and scratches evoke a sense of danger around the corner. And the music... oh man, the music fits so well in the game. Fast action along with metal (for the most part) music is a good combination!\n\nGameplay: Now this is the core of this game. This is the reason why I keep coming back to it. Just like the basics of any FPS game, you get a set of weapons, a bunch of enemies and then you empty your shells, cells, batteries, etc. upon them. Doom is just this. There's only you and demons. You have 8 (9 in Doom II) weapons to kill them, and the action is faster than most FPS out there. Walk, strafe, fire, dodge. Of course it's not only a corridor or halls full of enemies you have to dispatch, there are puzzles, with keys (or skulls) and switches or trap floors. It's not only just killing, mind you!\n\nStory: The only story you get is the one that came in the manual, but you can find it easily online. But in short; you're a (unnamed) marine, working at the Union Aerospace Corporation in mars, when portals bring out demons from hell and the rest of the people get slaughtered, so it's up to you to stop the demon invasion. How the story is coming along is told in short 'intermision' screens at the end of every chapter.\n\nReplay Value: Yes. Just yes. Why else would I keep on coming back to doom if this game didn't have any sort of replay value? And if the game bores you, you have the mods. You won't have enough time in your life to play all the community content that has been created for this game. So look for them! There are a lot of websites with links to these mods!\n\nControls: Now, the native controls of Doom will probably feel uncomfortable for most people nowadays. You can only walk, turn, strafe, use and shoot (and of course run). Strafe is kind of tricky the first time, and you can even move with the mouse (not turn). You can only look to the sides, and shooting an enemy above you is done by autoaim.\n\nTry this game with another sourceport that is not Dosbox if you want full support for mods and/or want to change many more options for graphics, sound, and controls (most sourceports makes doom controls more akin to today FPS). There are many different ones for each taste, too.\n\nTLDR: Game is astounding, simple gameplay, enough challenge, and you have countless of mods to keep on playing forever, like I do.","April 1, 2015","true","557.1"," 117 of 120 people (98%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","98","117","120","36","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haruharuharuka/recommended/2280/","haruharuharuka","Haruka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haruharuharuka/","3517 products in account","Ahhh DOOM... Talk to any gamer who grew up in the 90's and they will surely recount fond memories of all the good times they had playing id Software's original magnum opus. Wolfenstein 3D may have pioneered the First-Person Shooter genre, however it was DOOM that really brought it into the spotlight. Originally released in December of '93, DOOM would later be re-released with an extra episode, re-labled as The Ultimate DOOM.\n\nAt first glance The Ultimate DOOM may seem a simple affair by today's standards, what with it's deceptively simple gameplay. However looks can be deceiving, as the DOOM series is know for it's twisted mazelike corridors. Gamers who are used to the linear games of today could find themselves lost for hours in a level, searching for the next keycard. In the era that DOOM was released the length of a game was provided by actual gameplay, and not by artificially padding the experience with cutscenes every 3 seconds.\n\nThe gameplay in DOOM is a satisfying affair in which players must dispatch hoards of hell's minions while searching out colored keycards to unlock the various doors that block their path, all the while searching out the games myriad secrets, which usually results in a serious upgrade of firepower. And you'll need that firepower, as the baddies keep getting bigger and more badass as you go. The best gun in the game, which can be seen below as the player faces off against the Spider Mastermind, is the BFG 9000, AKA the Big Freakin' Gun. It launches a big green ball of energy that will frag the living hell out of anything in it's path.\n\nAnother thing DOOM popularized was the fine art of Deathmatch. Players could use their brand new dialup modems to engage each other in bloody warfare, where victory was determined by how many times you could reduce your foes to a pile of chunky kibble. Since DOOM's inception of Deathmatch it has become a staple of nearly every game in the FPS genre since. The Ultimate DOOM is truely a genre-defining game, and if you have never tried it you owe it to yourself as an FPS fan to give it a try.","November 25, 2013","true","0.6"," 130 of 143 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","130","143","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/2280/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","The Ultimate Doom is a re-release of the original Doom and features an entirely new episode on top of the three that were previously available. In addition it know supports modern controls of “wasd” and mouse support, though you are still unable to look vertically like in the original. It is the spiritual successor to Wolfenstein 3D and is credited for popularizing the FPS genre. This time around you'll be facing the forces of hell instead of Nazis and their dogs. The tone for this game is much more morbid and disturbing than it's predecessor's endless blue and gray hallways. You'll often times find your fellow space marines dead or still alive and twitching if they are unlucky. Rooms can now be pitch black and you will have to slowly inch yourself forward, toward your objective in fear of being caught by surprise in what may be lurking in the darkness. Without the awesome metal soundtrack blasting in the background, Doom would be pretty unsettling at times.\n\nUnlike Wolf 3D this now has floor and ceiling textures, which make for far more immersive environments. But there is no mistaking that these are indeed graphics from 1993 and what may have seemed impressive back then like vertical environments , flickering lights and gore, are typical these days and will no longer impress anyone. Where Doom stands the test of time is in it's gameplay and level design. It's rapid movement and maze like environments to explore are likely to be strange to those that have not experienced an old school FPS, but they do insure ensure fluid, exciting gameplay and replay value as you seek the hidden goodies like extra levels that you didn't find your first time through. There is no iron-sites or reloading here, instead we have an auto-aim feature that will see to it that you hit an enemy if you are facing it, though it does freak out at times when fighting on a vertical plane.\n\nStarting off you will be able to choose any of the four episodes to start off with though I highly recommend starting from the first as to allow the game to introduce weapons, enemies and game mechanics. There is no story to keep track of but if you are to start on the later episodes without a firm understanding of the weapons and how to fight demons, you will surely fail. Then you will chose from five difficulty modes that change the type and amount of enemies you will encounter throughout the level. And as soon as you pick one it's straight to the game. No story and no explanation, just you and a pistol. You will soon come across the body of a deceased marine that is facing the door and you will be able to hear a monstrous gurgle beyond the door. Meeting an enemy for the first time is always an epic encounter and you will not have any time to gawk at it. You just have to try to gun it down and hope that strange creatures goes down before you do. It is scenarios like these, that make me highly advise starting on anything other than episode 1 your first time around.\n\nUnlike Wolf 3D most enemies are not hit-scan and usually have projectiles that you can avoid if you react fast enough. It makes it feel like a really deadly match of dodge-ball as you zoom across the levels, avoiding multiple projectiles and gunning down all in your path without a single scratch. If you do get hit your characters face shown in the bottom of the screen will get bloodier and bloodier, until the point that he is near death and in tears. This is one of the small details that frightened me as a child, seeing your badass space marine bloody and in tears is something still not seen in many games and reminds you that our hero is indeed human, even if it has no gameplay effect and he still moves faster than Sonic the Hedgehog. If you are injured you will have to find a medkit to restore your health and if you are lucky you may also find some armor to absorb some damage. There are also power-ups hidden across the level like a Berserk orb that causes your fists to cause much more damage for the entire level. Some are necessary to progress though like the Hazmat suit that allows you to walk on lava and other hazards.\n\nThinking outside the box will sometimes be necessary  in your search of the three keycards you will need to escape the level. Like in E4M6 there is a teleporter that will teleport you to different locations depending on which side you step on it, it may seem like a simple puzzle but you have to run across lava to access that tiny teleporter. If you quick-save in certain locations like that, it is possible that you will doom yourself to death if you already used the hazmat suit and don't have enough health to run across that much lava. In that case hopefully you had another save or you will be put on the start of that level with just a pistol. Most of these instances are found in Episode 4 as they tried their hand at some light “platforming”  but with Doom's inability to look up and down, crumby auto-aiming if you are not on the same plane as enemy and lightning fast movement, tiny platforms that you must traverse are quite an annoyance.  It is also the first Episode in which you ever have to use the run key and it overall felt like the weakest link out of all Episodes.\n\nWeapons are usually hidden throughout the levels giving you yet another reason to explore areas carefully. These can range from chainguns, rocket launchers and the legendary BFG-9000. You will have to find ammo for them as well and as you can tell by now scavenging for supplies is very important. Ammo backpacks are very will hidden but if you find one they will allow you to carry more ammo at once. The zombie grunts will drop either pistol or shotgun ammo but neither of these will do you much good against the more powerful demons. Demons are very aggressive and this can be used to your advantage. If a demon accidentally hits another demon they will fight to the death and you can use this distraction to either sneak away or to easily take down the victor of that skirmish. They are quite varied and have different methods of attacking, so dealing with each one is requires different method and learning how to identify your largest threat is a must. Confidence can also lead to your downfall, you may think you have taken care of every enemy in the level and spot a powerful gun in the open, only to be ambushed by demons that were hiding. Be it creepy noises, distant groans or evil looking background, this game does a great job at making sure you rarely feel safe.\n\nI did have a problem with the Steam version of this game having distorted colors and flickering. I was  able to fix it by following this guide.  With that said, this game should last you around 6 hours but it does have decent replay value and plenty of secrets to find. After each level it tells you the percent of enemies killed, percent of secrets and the time it took you to complete, which may lead you to want to do better. Most levels before Episode 4 have a unique song that plays throughout that further helps differentiate the levels from one another. The environments are mostly brown and gray, so they start to look the same after a while but thanks to excellent level design, no two levels feel the same. If you ever get lost, there is an in game map for each level, though it can be confusing when levels have some verticality to them. While Doom's graphics are now laughable and can be run on most consoles or even your local ATM, it's now extinct form of gameplay is still as fun as ever.  I wouldn't recommend Doom to those that need a plot to drive them forward or to those that hate exploring. Those that don't mind the lack of narrative and want fast, unrelenting gameplay, are more likely than not going to have a heck of a time with this title. While it is starting to show it's age, good old grandpa Doom still has plenty of fight left in him.","October 4, 2015","true","0.6"," 100 of 106 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","100","106","11","5"

Doom popularized the first person shooter, which is now one of the most popular video game genres. It directly lead to custom maps, modifications, source code releases and online multiplayer being a thing.\n\nMost importantly, Doom is a symbol. It's a symbol of everything good in video games. It is the product of nights spent computer programming, playing Dungeons and Dragons and wishing fervently to make, "That game".

Depending on the difficulty you selected, you might face enemies right off the bat, but for the sake of the review I will base my experience on the “I’m too young to die!” difficulty (very-easy in layman’s terms). Playing through the game on such a level allows me to casually stroll through the levels, while appreciating the atmosphere provided.\n\nThe first level set on Phobos, one of Mars’ moons, where aliens have come through the portals and killed all of your friends. Every single one. You’re the only man left and you’ve made it your duty to take revenge on every last living thing on this moon. You soon find out the scientists working on the moons were working with portals and attempted to link Phobos and Deimos together. One thing lead to another and the events of this game slowly unraveled from there.\nIt’s time to delve into the designs of these levels.\n\nThese new stages in the game are well thought out, with new weapons before tougher enemies, and secrets that reward you with powerful weapons (Ones that you wouldn’t normally get for a few more levels). Key cards are used to open doors with the corresponding color, and are normally accompanied by health and ammo, because it sure as hell wasn’t easy to get to them. Some maps use dark rooms to set the tone, which work to the games advantage, especially when you’re facing those invisible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s which can take huge chunks of health with one swipe. Some maps use maze like configuration to add a level of difficulty, and you can bet that each dead end is guarded by an enemy.\n\nEach level set is finished with a challenging, yet rewarding boss battle. Again, the level design was superb for setting the tone. A long hallway which provided ammo, health, and armor, told me that I was in for a treat when I entered the elevator. For the difficulty I chose, I was given two CyberDemons to face, which were new to me, allowing me to see how they attacked and how much ammo I would be using to kill each one. After defeating the glorified demon at the end of that trek, it truly feels like the levels you played through were just a training match before the final showdown.\n\nTo sum it all up, you should really buy this fantastic, innovative game. The enemies are challenging, the boss battles are rewarding, the setting of the game is revolutionary, and the levels are creative and enjoyable. The game has great replay ability, and finding new secrets with each play through enhances the game play even further.

Well this was back in 1993 when I visited a friend after school and guess what we played DOOM!!! The full registered Version of it ;) *yay* It was just awesome.\n\nI guess everyone back in 1993 who had a computer loved that game. The gameplay, the graphics, the monsters, the levels it was just so cool. You really thought hey I am a "Space Marine" and I am saving the world up here! :)\n\nNuclear Plant (E1M2) was one of my favorites. Not because John Romero designed it - I played this level over and over again because of the cool soundtrack. Did I mention the sound yet?\n\nThe sound of the game is just WOW. You never heard such cool music and sound effects in any other game. Never was so scared by these snarling monsters that lurk along the dark corridors where you´ll encounter the remnants of the lost dead space marines that tried to fight these evil forces before...\n\nThe STEAM Version runs just fine on my system, but I had to edit some files to get it to work properly .

Doom wasn't any normal First Person Shooter - it was THE FPS. The FPS that increased the potential of 3D game design, what the genre could do and made the genre popular. Wolvenstein may have given birth to the genre, but the genre wouldn't be as popular as it is now if it wasn't for this legendary game.\n\n... but the question is, does it still hold up? Let's get on with the review!!\n\nThe story is as simple as early 90s games go but there is also a backstory to the player character as well - after our hero has disobeyed orders from a commanding officer to fire upon civilians and decide to stop him instead, he has been sent to work at a military base on Mars, which behaves as a Security post for a Multi-Planetary Conglomerate called the Union Aerospace Corporation (abbreviated UAC). The UAC itself is currently testing teleportation between Mars and it's two moons Phobos and Deimos in secrecy. Nothing special was really happening there... until one day, all hell quite literally breaks loose. The base on Deimos completely disappears off the face of the moon and a frantic distress signal was sent to Mars from Phobos, stating that something... "evil" has poured out of the teleportation gateway. Our hero (called Doomguy by the community, seems like a fitting enough name I guess) and several other Marines set out from Mars to Phobos to sort out this problem, and as they land on the Phobos base, Doomguy gets commanded to guard the perimeter, only equipped with a mere pistol, while the rest of the squad set foot inside the base. As our hero waits, he hears radio chatter followed by gunfire and screams which was eventually followed by an eerie silence. Doomguy is the only man in his squad left alive. He loads his gun, opens the entrance door, and sets on through the darkness and prepares for the worst. He hears inhuman cries and wails from the distance. There is no turning back now. He is Doomed... is he?\n\nJust a quick heads up: the Steam version of Doom is a DOSbox emulation, so because of this, there will be some things that fans of Modern shooters may need adjusting to. For instance, the controls will be strange to some, as back then there probably wasn't any real support for the mouse - if you move the mouse forward, you walk forward. If you need help trying to adjust to some of the admittedly dated things in this emulation, try checking out the Discussions in Doom's Community section, They will have a ton of solutions, definitely helped me out. But despite having some dated things, once you get the game running how you want it. it will be worth it.\n\nOK, let's get to Gameplay. Despite lacking a lot of things that modern shooters have, it does amazingly well without them and very easily makes up for it. You cannot aim up and down due to the fact that there is no Y axis to aim with, but this is very easily made up for with an auto aim that can help hit enemies a floor above or below. Headshots and stuff like that don't exist at all, but the action is so frantic anyway that it would be unnecessary for such a thing to be useful, and besides, the weapons are deadly enough anyway. Oh, and there is no health regen. We don't like that anyway.\nThe level design was incredible back in the day, and it still is very impressive, personally I still think that this game has some of the most well made levels that have ever been made for a FPS, and it makes the more modern shooters out there look amateurish with their linear corridors. Doom's levels are very labyrinthine and dungeonlike - there are loads of routes to take to get from the start to the finish, as well as coloured keys to look for to help progress through certain levels. What's more if you keep a careful eye out, you will find a secret! With it's complex level design, Doom loves to reward players who explore ... which is something more modern games should do really, it makes the game just that bit more immersive and rewarding. And if you ever happen to get lost, don't worry, check the map.\nThe weapons are limited but still pretty effective and are useful depending on what situation you are in. You start off with a measly pistol, but as you get further into the game you will find more devastating tools, such as a shotgun, Rocket Launcher, the franchise's beloved BFG (Quite literally stands for Big F*cking Gun) and even a kick ♥♥♥ Chainsaw! There are powerups as well, such as Invincibility and a Berserk Pack which gives you enhanced unarmed combat. Most of the weapons and powerups are so effective you'd want to save them for when you really need them, sometimes levels require you to use these to progress which makes this game a lot more strategic then some people thought an old shooter could be.\nEnemy types are varied and hard as nails, and the difficulty curve itself is well paced. They start of simple at first, but as soon as the difficulty curve stars to rise, you will see more threatening types of monsters and more insane situations.  for instance, during the first episode of the game, "Knee Deep in the Dead" everything will be very easy for the player. Ammo will be plentiful, enemies will be easy to deal with, facing nothing but zombies, imps and those pink demon things. The end bosses in this episode will be the only possible threat, but other then that, this episode will hold your hand, unless you play carelessly that is. It won't be THAT easy. Beyond the next two episodes, the difficulty will start to pick up, forcing the player to play smart.\nThen you get to Episode 4, "Thy Flesh Consumed".\nEnemies come in relentless hordes, health and ammo is scarce, there is a threat around every corner, corridors and rooms are incredibly tight, and looking for secrets is vital. This last episode is UNFORGIVING, even on "Hurt Me Plenty" difficulty, and it requires the player to put their Doom skills to the test. Either that, or they are doomed.\nAnd... if you thought the game was a bit too easy on the last episode on "Hurt Me Plenty", then don't worry, Doom has harder difficulty settings, of which will alter the challenge in a couple of ways in the levels, such as harder enemies in certain places.\n\nAs for Audio, although it uses a dated MIDI format, is really good. The soundtrack ranges from fast paced tracks that suit the fast paced action of the game, and then there are more somber, ominous tracks that suit Doom's gothic style. Weapons sound great, the chainsaw for instance sounds as grisly as a chainsaw should be. Monsters sound excellent and the kind of noises they make differ from each type, which can help the player develop a twitch reaction on how to deal with them if they bump into them (eg: Was that an Imp? I'll get my shotgun out...).\n\nGraphics... Ehh. Alright they are horribly dated but there seems to be a gothic style going on here. and not all the levels look the same. Plus each enemy type has a distinct silhouette which can also help develop a twitch reaction on what the player should do to deal with them. Doom isn't an amazing looking game, but it's still not a bad looking one.\n\nI think I described enough of Doom now, now to answer the question I said at the start of this review: Does Doom still hold up?\n\nIn two words: Hell yes. Doom was not only a revolution in the game industry, but it is a achievement in solid game design. while it may have aged poorly in the graphics department and it may lacks some thing most other modern shooters can do, everything else it can do, it does it FLAWLESSLY. The game brought several things to the table back then and it can still do them again and impress. If you haven't played Doom, then for the love of god, DO SO.  Doom is a truly unmissable classic. So, what are you doing? Buy it. Lock, load, rev up that chainsaw, and get ready to rip and tear. Bring on the Ultravionce!!","December 10, 2014","true","13.6"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","34","36","4","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DudeDesigns/recommended/2280/","DudeDesigns","DudeDesigns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DudeDesigns/","254 products in account","One simple word, one simple game, the absolute best FPS on the planet: DOOM\n\nStraight out of 1993, Doom was a game made simply because the group of 20 something year olds wanted to make it. It's a game where design splashes with creativity, something you don't find in almost any modern game today.\n\nThe game is simple. Get to the end of each stage. That's it. You also need to kill the literal thousands of demon hellspawn along the way so don't forget about them either. The monsters range from simple zombie soldiers to demonic goats that shoot rockets at you. The games monsters all revolve around the notion of avoiding projectiles, or hitscans.\n\nThe maps are designed with absolute love and attention. Each episode was made usually by one person, and you really can feel that distinction when you play them. Some maps were mazes, some maps were collosiums, some maps used more of a certain ammo type, thus limiting your approach, but most of all, the designs of the maps are interesting and fun to play.\n\nDoom is a testament to the 90's, and a bit to the 80's. The loud metal induced music, the overall design, the action and horror of films such as Aliens. Everything is combined in such a perfect, uniform way that nothing feels out of place.\n\nDoom is in a nutshell, just a game that feels right to play. Not a single aspect about the game feels wrong at all, and thats something you never see anymore in games. The attention to detail and gameplay is absolutely amazing.\n\nThere is not one single game I've ever played that did everything as perfect as Doom did. The monsters, the maps, the design, the gameplay, the mechanics, the feel, is all so perfect, that you really need this in your library.\n\nBeing a game from 1993, the game runs on DOSBOX. If you don't like that, there's plenty of source ports out there, like ZDoom, Zandronum (which focuses on multiplayer as well), and for a faithfull recration of the game, Chocolate Doom. There's also literally millions upon millions of custom content for the game as well. Some wads I could reccomend include classics such as Alien Vendetta, Memento Mori 1 and 2, Hell Revealed and some new ones such as Back to Saturn X, Doom the way id Did, Doom 2 the way id Did, ZDoom community map project 1 and 2, and the PSX Total Conversion.\n\nDoom is a game I will always see myself coming back to, even when we are in 2047 playing games on a display device in our brains.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrutal Doom Mention: On the topic of this flamboyent mess of a mod, I'll give my honest opinions on it, because as an avid Doomer from the earliest days, I suppose I should explain my self in detail.\nBrutal Doom is a mod for Doom that throws in absolute rediculous amounts of gore and changes the enemies behavior entirely. Shots deal damage based on location on the body. For example, shooting an imp in the head kills it instantly. You have iron sights on some weapons and you have to reload your clips (this can be turned off with "mutators" that can be downloaded individually)\n\nNow all of this sounds like the perfect way to modernize Doom right? Wrong. Brutal Doom completely destroys the balance of the original Doom maps, and many pwads as well. For example. you can kill a Baron of Hell in literally 2 shotgun blasts to the head. This completely destroys Episode 1's finale on the Original Doom.\n\nThe same thing with the Cyberdemon. What used to take a plethra of Rockets now only takes 16-23 rockets. Many of the sub-boss enemies in Doom 2, such as the Arachnotron, Revenant, and Hell Knight, can literally be one shotted with the super shotgun now, which completely breaks the encounters with them and destroys any sense of ammo conservation. The game is extremely annoying. Everytime you kill a monster they scream in agony, which is extremely loud. Blood and gibs fly everywhere, and I mean everywhere, from something as minimal as a pistol shot. It's an annoying audio-visual experience that gives me one ♥♥♥♥♥ of a headache not 4 mins into the game.\n\nAll of this wouldn't annoy me if people didn't berate the original vanilla Doom experience. Newcomers to Doom most of the time berate amazingly well done wads, like ZDoom community map project, Samsara, etc, simply because they have no Brutal Doom support. This is infuriating to no end, especially since the creator of Brutal Doom is not only a Neo-Nazi sexist racist, but he's also given instructions on how to commit suicide. This is a Phil Fish scenario, and me hating the guy has nothing to do with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his mod is. If you ever add me to discuss Doom, don't bring up Brutal Doom. It's not something worth mentioning.]","January 2, 2014","true","469.5"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","41","49","0","8"

To me, this is the birth of the FPS genre and it's great to see how much it has evolved over the years. It's also great to be able to go back into the past to play this game. I love how there are a variety of difficulties, from those who are very newbish to the very hardcore gamer.

Doom really seems like one of those games that you should play at least once before you die. While the original controls are very clunky in this day and age this problem is easily remedied with source ports like GZDoom and Zandronum that allow a modern mouse and keyboard setup. What is on offer is a very challenging game with  fantastic action, intricate level design, and really ignited and paved the way for shooters to come. It seems that every shooter has something that traces back to Doom. When you finish the game there's quite literally thousands of mods to try out.

I'm such a big fan of this Hellish series, I've been playing for years already. And It never gets old. Doom Is one of my most favorite games of all time, I'm not a big fan of Doom 2 though. I'm just too use to this classic here. You play as a Space Marine or Doomguy, as you run and gun your way out of Hellish Demons and Zombies. A classic game from 1993, Doom was one of the goriest games In It's time. And you would headbang to the heavy metal music while gunning down Zombiemen and Imps. This version here Is The Uiltmate Doom, where It Includes a new fourth episode titled Thy Flesh Consumed.\n\nEpisodes:\nKnee-Deep In The Dead: This Is my favorite, well. I'm sure It's everybody's favorite. This Is where It all begins, the Hellish rampage starts.\nThe Shores of Hell: My least favorite, this took me a while to complete.

And This Is my most favorite episode.\nThy Flesh Consumed: I've not played this one yet, but I'll give It a try one of these days.\n\nI highly recommend this game to new and old school gamers, or for those who never played FPS before.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/recommended/2280/","biendeo","Biendeo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/","835 products in account","Long story short: One of the oldest, yet still engaging, shooters of the '90s. It's not only a graphical spectacle, it's also tightly desgined around skill-based encounters, while offering enough variety for a good six to eight hour game length, plus a butt-load of mods online. For those buying the Steam version, check the community guides to help you set it up for a more optimal introduction to the game.\nDISCLAIMER: While no demo is available on Steam, Googling Doom Shareware should lead you to the free version of the game, which contains only the first episode to give you a decently lengthed snippet of what the game is like.\n\nAfter the release of this game, every first-person shooter for the next few years were referred to as Doom clones purely because this game right here did everything so well. Simply, Doom is one of the tightest games you'll ever play. Guaranteed. While taking place on abandoned research bases on Mars, and eventually into Hell itself, the game's spooky vibes do not correspond with horror as much as balls-to-the-wall action. However, most of its spectacle is due to the fact that it was the first of its kind: many FPS games thereafter utilised Doom's formula, to varying and even greater degrees of success. To fully enjoy this game, try to forget all that you already know about games and take this game from its rawest form.\n\nLet's get it out of the way: Doom had a magnificent engine. It needed a decent rig to get working at the time, but man did it get 3D working so well. The engine allowed floors to be rendered at multiple heights, any angle conceivable, and all textured, allowing for some magnificent looking locales. Lighting also worked to build atmosphere and contrast between levels. And, enemy sprites were very detailed, and allowed them to be animated during attacks and hit animations from all angles. Briefly, it was visuals like no other.\n\nThe sound is a little bit uninspired however. Some sound effects are public domain (the imp sound in particular), and may sound familiar. The music also takes a few, let's say, subtle hints from metal and grunge music of the '80s and '90s. However, all of it fits towards the demonic tone that the game goes for.\n\nThe game consists of four episodes, each taking place in different locations. The aesthetics of each place vary a bit too, and the general design changes a bit too. Each episode introduces new things, allowing the player to constantly learn techniques and skills in tackling enemies. Every level also has a bunch of secrets (including some secret levels), which is a great way to give incentives to explore the levels.\n\nThe highlight of the game in my opinion are the enemies. The weakest enemies, the Former Human and Sergeants, are also the only enemies that hitscan (attack with an instant bullet-like attack). Every other enemy uses projectiles of varying damage, speeds, and colours, and they're all avoidable. Doom's gameplay consists of dodging enemy attacks, prioritising targets, navigating and using the map to your advantage, and conserving ammo and attacking efficiently. It leads you in, gives you enough time to evaluate the threat, and skillfully execute a plan to either avoid or take out hoards of enemies. And it does this organically by not removing control or agency from the player.\n\nThe weapons also have a huge layer of depth. Besides the slow starting pistol, every weapon you find doesn't out-right replace other weapons you get. Rather, each weapon has its own benefits and weaknesses. For example, the shotgun can deal large chunks of damage in successive blasts, but it's not as efficient or quick as other weapons, whereas the plasma rifle fires huge balls of energy at enemies, but have a delay between shooting and the projectile hitting the target. Each weapon works well against certain enemies, and the player organically learns these as the game goes on, rather than being down-right told about it.\n\nThe levels are also designed to give varying degrees of challenge between encounters. While enemies are littered around the levels, generally you are presented rooms, and you have to solve problems with them, usually a locked door. This involves crossing the level sometimes, which may also have unlocked a hidden swarm of enemies. Fighting enemies in large open rooms, and fighting in closed in corridors provide different skill-sets.\n\nDoom also was pretty revolutionary for its modding system. The main game acts as a base archive, and custom levels or mods (in WAD files) replace or expand this content. It's simple to distribute, and resources such as the Idgames archive are being updated to this day with new and amazing content. I recommend the Brutal Doom mod, which replaces the weapons and enemy behaviors in a...ludicrous manner.\n\nDoom is one of the greatest games of all time, not because of its graphical leaps, but because it was also a tight as heck game. If you're going to grab the classic bundle, more mods are created for the sequel, Doom II, which expands on this game with crazier enemies and levels. The Doom 3 BFG Edition also includes this game and the sequel as well (not as Steam products, but within the title itself), and remains the best bundle for this game. The price point is a bit high for the game's age, but it's quality is worth every bit of it.\n\nRATING: 3 UP, 0 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals).

It's a classic that popularized the FPS genre, and with a fourth Doom on the way, I figured I should just buy this game to understand the hype. I love video games and have played some pretty old games before, like Jedi Power Battles, Mortal Kombat Trilogy, Pac Man, and Galaga.  Even with all of the advanced graphics and detailed combat we have in today's games, I still go back to the old days from time to time and enjoy the classics.\n\nSo how did I not discover Doom back then? Never heard of it until a few years later. I'm not part of the older gaming generation, which is why. So I decided to try it. It's simple, but it's incredibly fun and it's worth playing if you love the classics.\n\nThis is a game that became the subject of controversy regarding video game violence, which is a subject that has been discussed to death, even to this day (sigh). To be honest with you, violent video games are meant to be played by responsible individuals who can differentiate fiction from reality, although the media hasn't realized that yet..\n\nBut the controversy of this game also contributed to its popularity. Sure, the violence seems like nothing compared to today's video games, but back then, this was probably one of the most violent games ever. When you combine the violence with an ominous soundtrack, you can understand why some people were shocked. With all that aside, it's still an incredible classic, regardless of the controversy, and since video games were meant for fun and nothing else, go ahead and give it a try!","December 26, 2015","true","2.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/2280/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","A lot can be said about Doom. It started a fascination with first-person shooters that still lingers to this day. It spurred a rise in violent video games that eventually necessitated a ratings system. It pushed the limitations of 3D graphics to breathtaking highs in 1993. It revolutionized LAN play and was the catalyst for internet TCP/IP play.\n\nBut by now, you probably all know that. Doom is such a big name that it was even made into a (rather mediocre) film in 2005. It's become part of pop culture and the media conciousness. To try and sum it up is pointless.\n\nWhat you really want to know is whether or not grabbing the Steam version is worth it. In it's default state, I would say no. The copies on Steam are emulated through DOSBox, which kind of sucks. The games run fine and all, but they have low resolution, choppy sound and some obtuse key bindings.\n\nStill, ID Software also pioneered a new file format when they released Doom; the WAD file. Since this version is basically the same one from the 1995 re-release, it has the WAD file that can be extracted to any numerous source ports available. There is even a method of making ZDoom (one of the most popular ports) work with the Steam overlay.\n\nFor that reason, if you don't already own Doom, then go ahead and grab it on Steam. $15 is a great price for 2 classic games and some expansion packs. It doesn't hurt that the fundamental design of Doom is timeless. Even if you have played it before, it remains addictive and ingenius all these years later.\n\nIf anything, I think I'll be playing this until I die. I may go years without touching a single WAD, but when the itch comes, I always stick around for a long while. Those source ports can also get you online multiplayer (along with a host of other "enhancements"), so you really cannot go wrong.\n\nAs for the game itself, I've always loved the simplicity of Doom's design. The level layouts feel like labyrinths and require some lateral thinking. The enemy design is brilliant; it conveys exactly what you need to know in seconds. Even the sound design helps with it's directional audio and individual sound bytes. This is one of the best examples of retro gaming, bar none.\n\nWhile I may prefer the sequel for it's faster combat, it's hard to deny how well made each episode in Doom is. The first episode, to be specific, is one of the greatest collections of maps you're bound to ever find. Even the pointless fourth episode (that was a bonus to the "Ultimate" Doom) can be a bit of fun.\n\nThe game may not be long, but there is definitely a good reason that it has remained a staple for many PC gamers.\n\n10/10","May 16","true","17.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Good times. Then buying that wonderful little gadget made by Naki or something I think that took some AA batteries and allowed you to save a game that didn't have a save function via some form of wizardry to me at the time.\n\nAll of the Doom iterations where good. I don't recall a single bomb. This one was super awesome, in particular. Was grateful to see it here on Steam. :D If memory serves, there was a CD that came with some video game magazine back in the day that had 1000+ extra levels that you could install to this game so you could go on playing virtually forever. One of those CDs will eventually be found millions of years in the future by aliens or whomever inherits the earth after we destroy ourselves, but doubtful you're going to find one. I can't really say here, but I would suggest getting on a big wooden boat with a flag that resembles a warning label and sale the 7 seas looking for them in another form.","January 25, 2015","true","2.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Very easy to play it on Steam using whatever sourceport or frontend you might prefer: just throw it in the game's install folder and rename your chosen executable to dosbox.  Using ZDL with gzDoom makes it super easy for me to load up the game with whatever WAD I feel like playing — including Doom II, for example, provided I copy doom2.wad into the same folder (or just direct ZDL to its location).  You can even throw in stuff like pk_anim.wad (look it up) for smoother weapon animations, which is pretty neat.  Some of you might prefer Chocolate Doom over something like gzDoom for a more pixel-accurate early '90s experience: easily done.  Maybe you want to switch over to Zandronum for some deathmatch: you got it.  Anyway, yes.  Lots of FPS games have come and gone, but Doom remains the golden standard for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2280/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Doom is a legendary FPS that came out in 1993 on PC and was ported to many other consoles, with ports of various quality. It was released by shareware model and had 3 episodes if your ordered. Later it was released as Ultimate Doom, adding the 4th episode.\nCompared to other ports it has full levels and most content. PS1 and Saturn port have it combined with Doom 2 levels and have dark horror atmosphere, with N64 having it's own dark horror atmosphere and was like a new game build from scratch, with it's own levels. The only thing some ports have over PC technically got to be colored lighting. So, you don't miss much, be happy with DOS version.\n\nAs old game, we should take a look at how Steam version handles Doom. And well, Id Software once again did a horrible job with handling DOSBox.\nFirst, it wasn't configured probably, thus it lags amazingly in full-screen mode. To fix that you have to go to game's folder and edit line at "output" to "opengl" in "ultimate.conf" and "ultimatem.conf" files.\nSecond, as you launch game you will notice that you get to choose two control methods: with mouse and classic (Like real man, keyboard only!). And it uses Soundblaster device for Music instead of Midi that everybody is used to. You may think that you can use DOSBox, navigate to game's folder and launch "setup.exe" to configure stuff for yourself, but too bad! Id Software decided not to put it into Steam's version. Your only way to configure controls and music is editing "DEFAULT.CFG" and "MOUSE.CFG" files. Where you have to guess which numbers is related to what keyboard button.\n\nBut once you fixed all those issues you will finally get to play Doom. Ultimate edition, yep. Without any plot or cutscenes... Errr, aside from those at the end of episodes. Without much plot and cutscenes, you are going to be immeditly thrown into levels, each one being a compilated maze and a step over the ealier FPS levels, also having buttons to press which can do something else aside from opening doors and keys to collect. Each of 4 episodes has 8 normal levels and 1 secrets, and I gotta say that the secret level of the third episode is brilliant idea. I also should mention that the first, WHOLE first episode is available for free in demo (shareware) version of a game, and that game is easier than Doom 2 in general. Aside form the 4th episode, which was added with Ultimate Doom version and is even harder than Doom 2, especially first few levels, though that episode doesn't have any new content to it.\n\nThe presentation of the game is quite good. It's colorful more or less while giving it a dirty darkish feeling. Heck, game was considered scary at release, with usage of sector lighting, it even has has fog-like effect where you can see less clearly in dark places, nice. The resolution isn't big and colors are still quite limited, but with all the maze nacigation and sprite scaling it had to do, the game was at the top of technology cutting edge, especially in FPS genre. At least on PC and consoles, Arcades were still kicking. So, you can say that this was the point where console players got something to envy PCs over, while playing their own awesome platformers.\n\nGameplay is just plain awesome, pure arcadeish FPS. It's quite a fast-paced game, with many pickups, wide enemy variety, set of weapons, non-regenerating health, map that you can call with Tab so you will not get lost in mazes and, most importantly, instead of being focused on cover-hiding, it was more about projectile avoidance and more out-into-field shooting and running. Well, almost. Zombie enemies still shoot hitscan at you, but those are low-tier enemies, die easily, not used as much as imps. And compared to many other FPS at that time, Doom is more of fair challenge. Once again, Doom is not perfect, it got hitscan zombies with gun and it even forces you to run over damaging acid/lava few times in some levels, it's not Heretic, but compared to games on Build engine, it's better.\nThough one of the things that may put people off is that levels are abstract mazes. Looking nice but making no logical sense of place to it.\nIt has 8 weapons to keep, from useless fist and pistol, up to BFG9000. It's not perfectly balanced, plasmagun outdoes chaingun, while chaingun outdoes pistol while using same ammo pool, but it's a step over Wolf3D, as in some situation some weapons are better. The effective use of BFG9000 also doesn't make common sense, you should read FAQ somewhere over this. But hey, at least it was before SuperShotgun came, with it being best weapon in whole game in Doom 2.\nDissapointing thing got to be bosses. There is only few. Two uncommon dangerous Barons of Hell in Episode 1, which were used later anyway. And then there is Cyberdemon in Episode 2 who's attack can be avoided too easily and Spider Mastermind in Episode 3 who has hitscan attack and you just have to rush him down. Episode 4 also doesn't have anything of it's own.\n\nMultiplayer isn't supported in Steam version, you will have to use Zandronum source port. Or some other mutlipalyer source ports.\n\nSo, Ultimate Doom is awesome FPS. Simpler than Doom 2, but less brown and has it's own feel. You get to run over mazes while shooting down enemies in fast-paced manner. It's legendary too, though not perfect game. Highly recommended, none the less.\n\nIf you want to get into Doom modding and mods, then instead head toward Doom 2 destination, sir.","April 21, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have at least 10 hours logged on ZDOOM. Better performance, better customisation and the holy autorun feature]\nHaving only bought this on a whim, I wasn't expecting much from Doom. After all, it's extremely primitive compared to shooters from today and is 6 years older than I am. Also, being a pioneer of a fairly complex genre, I wasn't expecting it to hold up by today's standards. However, Doom is a pleasant surprise, if you tweak it a little. The first thing I did when I turned it on was say 'What the ♥♥♥♥ are these controls?' (go get novert). Using the mouse as a joystick is almost impossible for anyone with a desk smaller than Africa. The mouse sensitivity needs to go waaaay up too. However, once you maneuver these hurdles, welcome to one of the most fast-paced, exciting FPSs there is on Steam. The pace of movement is quick and the game almost acts as a 3-D 'shmup' in later levels due to the focus on dodging and evasion. The weapons are satisfying to use and feel as if they have weight and the pixelated gore is both strangely satisfying and... y'know... gory. However, the game's age does show through many of its design quirks. Many levels are maze-like and sometimes devolve into a tedious keyhunt. Not being able to look up is also something quite hard to get used to and can be frustrating if there are invisile enemies at the top of some stairs or on elevated ground. However, despite these, the game remains extremely fun and for bonus points, once you're finished with the 4 chapters offered by the game, you can mod it to pieces\n(Novert link)\nhttps://www.doomworld.com/idgames/utils/misc/novert\n( An awful lot of mods)\nhttps://www.doomworld.com/idgames/","December 12, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

I'd highly recommend downloading a modern "source port" such as ZDoom[zdoom.org], GZDoom[forum.drdteam.org](ZDoom with a modern OpenGL renderer), or Zandronum[zandronum.com](GZDoom with client-server multiplayer) for the best DOOM experience.\nWhich raises another issue, this game is designed for keyboard, so playing with WASD + Mouse makes the game a bit easy compared to just arrow keys.\nFramerate is locked to 35 FPS, which is fixed in aforementioned source ports.\nThe price seems a tiny bit high for such an old game, definitely worth it on sale however.","July 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Running around like a jackrabbit as a space marine blowing the bits out of demons and zombies with like chainguns, shotguns, and plasma guns is pretty fun.\n- Fun to explore levels, though I will admit it is pretty easy to get lost in some areas.\n- Interesting Enemy designs\n- Did I mention you're a space marine fighting demons in mars all the way through hell?\n\nCons\n- It's a game from 1994. The graphics arent great by today's standards and you may very well not. Also first few tries running the game, it didn't mouse support, And had to look through the steam forums for a fix. You may have the same issues.\n\nIf you can stand graphics from 20 years ago and enjoy first person shooters where you obliterate armies of demons, yes you may very well like this game and pretty much the entire Doom Classic Pack. They're all pretty dope.\n\nNote: I'd highly suggest you also try playing the mod Brutal Doom. It's a pretty dope mod, it's pretty much the same game only more difficult and with improved animation sprites and gore, as well as additional takedowns and weapons. You'd just need GZdoom to run it, and i'd actually suggest installing either Zdoom or GZdoom. They run the game better than DOSbox does, plus you've got a lot more options in the options menu.","September 21, 2014","true","0.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gridlocked11/recommended/2280/","Gridlocked11","Grid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gridlocked11/","304 products in account","Classic. It's a word that is used often... And really, I think it's lost it's impact. Everything that holds nostalgic value in some way, shape and form is "classic". Whether jokingly admiring an admittedly BAD piece of media that you liked as a kid, or enjoying one of many similar games out there, ones that don't entirely speak for themselves; we all state that the things we like are "classic". In this case, the genre already existed in various, fledgling forms such as Maze War, and Spasim in the early 70's... All the way up to the venerable title Wolfenstein, a game that helped truly mold the genre at it's most basic values, by the very same company that crafted the leviathan trend-setter for the ages- the masterpiece I'm going to attempt to describe here. It was a title that, at the time, would have been mentioned of in hushed excited tones by the kids at school. A title that was so wildly different, the news media used its inferno-based imagery and its playstyle as a scapegoat for heinous crimes committed. A title SO revolutionary that every single developer creating games that followed in its footsteps were considered "clones"....And rightfully so, many were just carbon copying the EXACT ideals, or in MOST cases, even code, right from this legend. This was the mark of something different, in how was distributed, in how open and accessable much of the content was, and how people played games together: over the internet. The most classic game of this genre may not be the very FIRST of its kind, but the genre truly coalesced with one Big. ♥♥♥♥ing. Game. It's name is Doom. and it is classic. Even if you did not like doom, or grow up with it or even PLAY Doom... Go look up the definition of classic. While those things may be subjective, and that's why we're capable of throwing the label onto anything, it is undeniable that this game is the grandaddy of them all.\nI've given a large enough intro, and i doubt anyone wants to ready the lofty and article-like writing of a giant nerd such as myself for hours, regarding a game that you probably don't even fully care for... So I'll break this down for you.\n\n\n-The perspective had been done before (and then CONSTANTLY AFTER), but the quality and the art drawn in was revolutionary. It still holds up to this day with the right Source Mod (more on that later)\n\n- The sounds, the lighting effects, everything it set out to do, such as running on lower end machines, and even looking and sounding better on NEWER ones, meant that the modular tuning and graphics engine design were brilliant, John Carmack crafted an amazing source code.\n\n-The set up, a protagonist with no dialogue, the story elements cut, is another trend-setter for the genre. The creators intention despite the entertaining HUD, was to make YOU the protagonist, allowing you to relate more and create your own feeling for the nameless marine.\n\n-Multiplayer. Coop with damage enabled, and deathmatch. Doom did it arguably first, or for the time, best.\n\n-How the title was distributed: you got Episode 1 (sound familiar, Valve fans?) for free. 9 levels to play and enjoy nearly everything Doom offered. Free. If you enjoyed it? There were more to buy and enjoy. This leads to two gigantic pillars for which Doom stands as the father of FPS, and helped inspire Valve to do what they're loved for now-\n\nThe source code became open and free to modify a few years later. This allowed for countless mods using Ids revolutionary and modular "WAD" file format. - and for people to convert the source code to run on platform ports (source ports), so that this old DOS game can work on modern machines.... While enjoying mods that enhance and even modernize gameplay.\n\nThe best (well rounded) Source Port to download is GZDoom. Get that, buy this, and run your doom.wad through it. Tune the old graphics enough to clean them up, and relive the classic.\n\nOnce you're done, get some mods. I recommend:\nBrutal Doom\nProject MSX - (amazing HUD with modern mechanics, changes monsters)\nDark 7 - ( amazing mapset, play it with Project MSX)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThose can get you started. And yes, GZDoom will allow you to look UP and DOWN with your mouse...Jump (which is cheating ;] ) and even crouch.\nEnjoy.\n\n\n\nFun facts about Doom:\nNot only was Valve likely inspired by their open distribution of the title, and source-code policies, but they got their start in game design thanks to Id software.\nGabe Newell and Doug Lombardi visited Id around the time of their next trend setter- the fully 3D Quake.\nId helped them start up by giving the entrepeneur coders the source code to Quake, Id Tech 2.... Which they then heavily modified and dubbed Gold Source.... Officialy GoldSrc. This engine powered Half Life.\n\nWhen Gabe Newell was still working for Microsoft, he was the programmer that ported Doom over to Windows from DOS, in an attempt to get more people to accept the platform, as Doom was the most widely downloaded application of the era. It had been downloaded and installed more than Windows itself at the time.","March 27, 2014","true","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

We cannot deny doom did nothing, they pretty much started with shooters back then, of course they had to test things. Why not demons? Ok, let's use demons and see how people react. And oh boy...what an impact it had, has and will still have. Let's be honest: Am I the only one who thinks E1M1's soundtrack (1. level) is pretty much the best? I am no big fan of metal, but omg, that one just makes me wanna go off an shoot demons! ...wait, that is the actual setting of the game...\n\nWhat can I really say about the gameplay...well...the original controls were the arrow pads while Ctrl (I think) being the shooting button.  you have weak enemies, having a pistol or a shotgun, tankers, dealing mediocre damage but being able to take a lot of damage, and ememies, who are just strong, having the ability to fly and deal a lot of damage or just take a lot of damage and dealing a lot. Every enemy has a specific weakness, each one's different. Ofc, a BFG 9000 (i'll talk about the weapons soon) is definetly effective against everyone, but wasting that ammo for some Imps? Not useful. Ammo management is also important, so dont just foolishly spend your minigunammo. Use the shotgun or rocketlauncher, depending on the situation.\nSo we can say, the game requires you to think (*cough* COD *cough*)\n\nThe weapon choice is alright. In total, we have 8 weapons. The fists (pretty much your last choice you should use. DO NOT), the chainsaw (TIMBER), the shotgun (in Doom 2 we also have the double barreled shotgun), the pistol (semi-useful against weak enemies), the chaingun (your "rifle" in this game, sharing the pistol ammo), the rocketlauncher (dont need to add anything), the plasmarifle (strong, fast shooting rifle) and the BFG 9000, sharing the plasmarifle ammo (its name really is Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun 9000). you will know how to use them when playing. BFG of course is the weapon against everything using 60 plasmarifle ammo. while the chaingun is actually useful against everything, it will show its weakness against tanks or high-HP enemies (you will have to use a lot of ammo). Again, the ammomanagement but also the weaponvariety back then! Think of it!\n\nThe last point I want to talk about are the maps:\nWe have 4 chapters with 9 levels each (if I am not mistaken). each of them isnt just like a narrow path you have to follow, you sometimes have to do some backtracking to collect that one keycard you need for the final door. Or you have to solve a little puzzle to reach the end of the level/the next segment of the game. Enemies are placed in a good way, not bothering you but still surprising you at least a bit. And, many people sadly don't know this anymore: Secrets! For those picky people not living with the fact letting bits o' loot in a level, you can look for secrets! Some are quite easy to solve (walking against a wall, pressing the interaction key, normally space; or shooting against a wall) while others require you to think (eg you have to walk back to a specific point of the map and then running afap to the elevator, leading you to the secret). Something for everybody: not too narrow and challenging!\n\nOh, the game has 5 difficulties. the first and second are not worth to try. go for the third or fourth, depending on how tough you think you are. DO NOT TRY NIGHTMARE. DO. NOT. DO. IT.\n\nBut if you do, record it and show the world you are one of the best players around. Only a few managed to speedrun nightmare (as far as I know). It's really hard. For more informations what NIGHTMARE covers, look it up.\n\nOne last tip:\nUse a "newer" software for Doom. DosBos is ~quite~ alright, but I highly recommend programs like zandronum. It automatically sees similar doom programs (mods) and plays them with but a single doubleclick with the doom engine.\n\nIf you excuse me, the girls in H-Doom need some of René Descartes(if you get this joke, please comment this)\n\nPS:Oh, and dont think I dont know the game. I played this game around a year ago, I'd roughly say I have around at least 100 hours with it","December 30, 2015","true","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","5","6","6","2"

It's old, blocky, and tough. It makes me jump in my chair. It fills me with dread every time I have to round a new corner. I spend half the time playing it just cowering in corners waiting for enemies to find me. It makes me feel pathetic.\n\nI keep coming back though, because of that visceral feeling. An arcade game on the PC, realized in full 3D, which exists in its raw form within Doom. It is pure and powerful and awesome.\n\nThe fact that a pixelated game created two decades ago can still scare me pretty good, can still engage me enough to make me worry about what's around the next corner... that is a testament to the staying power of Doom.\n\nPlay Doom.

If you played a PC game in 1995, you played Doom.  Everyone played Doom.  Companies had to institute rules and ban Doom from being played during business hours, because too many employees were playing deathmatches.  Doom was so popular that Microsoft developed a port of it to work on their new Windows 95, in hopes of getting more people to buy the operating system, this of course after Bill Gates toyed with the idea of buying out ID Software all together.\n\nBut even with its popularity, there was the mounds of controversy.  Some hated it for its high levels of blood and gore, others for its satanic symbols.  Groups tried to ban it, tried to get it out of the public eye, blamed it for school shootings and random acts of violence.  Many tried to connect it to violent behavior in young adults, citing the violence learned in the game being brought to reality.  But through all of this it stood tall, exactly what it was, simply a game.\n\nDoom is one of those classics that everyone needs to experience   You don’t have to play the whole thing, or beat every level under par.  But every gamer, that wants to truly be a gamer, should spend a little time running around the halls of the UAC facility on the Mars moon.","May 16, 2013","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Instead of pressing start on your Xbox Controller, we had to type in terribly long commands. But that long journey was worth it. We got to slaughter demons and destroy Hell itself! Now, we're in an age of Call of Duty and DLC. DOOM has risen to steam as... THE ULTIMATE DOOM! The game works real well and everything just feels like your playing on an old school DOS Computer! To step up the fun, download Brutal Doom. Brutal Doom makes everything better like Fatalities, more gore, and health bonuses for brutally killing Imps and Lost Souls! Another thing that I like about Ultimate Doom is how it includes a fourth episode, Thy Flesh Consumed. It's kinda like a prequel to DOOM II Hell on Earth. If you don't know about this game, you're just a sad shell living under a rock playing Call of Duty Black Ops. Everything about DOOM is just so... AWESOME.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/2280/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","It's DOOM. Play this if you like old-school games, gaming history and/or well-designed shooters & somehow haven't tried it yet. What else is there to say about it?\n\n\nAlright, I'll give it a shot. In 1993, ID Software more or less revolutionized the first-person shooter genre (again) with a game that was not only blazingly fast and good-looking for the time, but played and aged so well it inspired a fanbase that persists to this day.\n\nThere have been tens of thousands of custom maps and modifications for Doom and its immediate sequel over the years that take the game in every conceivable direction, and while the 'Doomer' fandom isn't exactly the monstrously huge construction you'd expect to find camping on tumblr*, there's no sign of Doom being truly abandoned any time soon.\n\n\nYou might think, yeah, it was good in its day, but it looks so crude and simple today. Why would anyone still play it? Well, apart from the huge realm of custom content, Doom's gameplay is simply very, very well-tuned. It's a little comparable to bullet hell or chess, in that there's more focus on dodging enemy attacks than there is on tanking them.\n\nDoom's monster AI is simple yet open-ended enough to make for a wide variety of tactical situations, and the player's movement & weaponry aren't any less finely crafted. The one criticism that I can think of is that the gatling gun (which is also incorrectly referred to as a 'chaingun') more or less replaces your starting pistol.\n\nBasically, it's easy to get into, but has enough nuance and depth to carry itself even today. For a while after it was released, games in a similar style were explicitly called 'Doom clones'. To the modern observer, Doom managed to drive progress in the genre enough that in hindsight there really wasn't much shame to be had in being a 'clone' of such an excellent game. (Shoving hundreds of WADs from the Internet into a commercially-released CD was another story.[doom.wikia.com])\n\nYou can't look up or down either, at least not in the game's original form. While there's absolutely something to be said for Doom's purity of form (and compensating autoaim), the ability to look in any direction is kind of a boon for newer games.\n\nYou probably wouldn't want to play this for the story: you'll literally only find the setup in the game's manual. There's just enough story to justify what's happening in the game, although what's there is good for what it is.\n\nOnce the technology was in place, Doom also became a catalyst for early online gaming. This game is, in fact, where the term 'deathmatch' came from. There's still[zandronum.com] options[www.zdaemon.org] available to play Doom with or against other people, without the murderous rates people had to pay 20 years ago. Perhaps bare-bones in comparison to today's offerings, but certainly faster in pace and intensity.\n\n\nSteam's included DOSBox port is pretty poor, so I would recommend grabbing a sourceport like Chocolate Doom or ZDoom. Those two are my personal favorites - the former lets you experience the game as it was in the '90s, and the latter lets you easily load all sorts of modern mods and enhancements.\n\nDoom's default controls are frankly a relic from the pre-WASD standard days, but fortunately pretty much every sourceport lets you change the controls and even look up & down if you wish. I would recommend at least trying the original controls, though, if you're going to start playing Doom.\n\n\nIf you really want to experience classic Doom, you'd do well to pick up its aforementioned sequel at the very least. It adds new enemies and one new weapon, not to mention 32 new levels, and it's been more popular with custom level designers ever since it came out in 1994. That may not sound like much, but then again, if it ain't broke...\n\nAs of this humble summation of Doom, the game in question has persisted for 23 years. I would seriously bet that it will last 23 more.\n\n\n*Not that I particularly dislike tumblr, of course.","November 5, 2011","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.\nJohn was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad “I want to be on the ships daddy.”\nDad said “No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS”\nThere was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.\n“This is Joson” the radio crackered. “You must fight the demons!”\nSo John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.\n“HE GOING TO KILL US” said the demons\n“I will shoot at him” said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.\n“No! I must kill the demons” he shouted\nThe radio said “No, John.

I personally think it would be when you go to hell and they give you a really nice girl to talk to and you seem to be getting along very well, but then you accidentally fall over because you are trying to tie up your shoes and touch her leg and she calls the police. But because this is hell this probably happens forever and instead of a long court case and a moderate fine plus 48 hours of community service instead you go to HELL PRISON or something, which is like normal prison except instead of food you get knives and spikes and stuff, and instead of a bed you get like tarantulas or something. Maybe not tarantulas actually, once i went to the zoo and there was a tarantula and it wasn't really that scary because the man let me hold it although  it did crawl up my wrist and i did have to buy the zoo a new one because i trod on it when i went back to my seat. It was definitely his fault for letting me drop the tarantula though since i am not a tarantula expert. Overall i have to guuess that if you like scary games then this one is the scariest and therefore the best so buy it you will not be disappointed unless you prefer less scary games like Snake II on the nokia phone.","December 23, 2013","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

That is BASICALLY the storyline, in this game, there was barely any storyline. This game was meant for men (and women, but mainly men find the attractiveness in retro gore) who just wanted to shoot things and blow stuff up for no absolute reason and have tons of fun. The demons you fight are actually well-designed and so are the levels. This game was made in 1995 and was an instant blast! This was a game where only one kid's parents would allow him to play, so everybody would attempt to be his friend and look to him as the "cool guy/kid" and they would hang over at his house and play Doom all...night...long...! I still love this game and have already spent twelve hours into it, and will spend more! This is a childhood memory that won't go away for a very...long...time!\n\nSummary: Like retro gore and tons of action with a game that doesn't really have a storyline?...You met your guardian angel!\nWARNING: I recommend this to teenagers, not to younger children, for this game is quite violent despite the 1995 graphics!","September 12, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you haven't played it you should.\n\nDoom is the forefather of all modern first-person shooters. Its controls are tight, its level design remains some of the best ever achieved in the industry, its music is legendary, and the shotgun blast remains iconic in the world of shooters.\n\nThe story is simple, but standard for 1993 games. It begins in the Hangar of the Phobos moon base as the Doomguy fights his way through the forces of hell before arriving on the lost Deimos base. He has to fight his way through even tough challenges here and take down the vile Cyberdemon before descending into Hell itself.\n\nThe first nine levels of Doom were released as shareware in 1993. It set a benchmark that future games would dream of reaching. It also had one of the first modding scenes in PC gaming.\n\nSpeaking of mods, one of the downsides to Doom, especially the Steam version, is that the controls and settings haven't aged all that well. Thus, I'd recommend using a launcher. I personally use GZDoom, which you can find HERE[www.osnanet.de].\n\nThere are other mods that add to the already awesome and timeless gameplay of Doom, specifically the BRUTAL DOOM MOD. This mod adds additional shooting gameplay and a whole lot more blood to the game.\n\nIf you are a gamer. Specifically a shooter gamer, you absolurely cannot do much better than Doom.\n\nFurther information about Doom can be found in this video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5EfGAA01Gk\n\nGame on and take care.","September 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Its arsenal of powerful guns (namely the shotgun and BFG), intense level of gore and perfect balance of adrenaline-soaked action and exploration kept this gamer riveted for years. Initially a shareware product on PC, DOOM also offered the first multiplayer death- matches via LAN. Doom is creepy, atmospheric, with a sense of impending dread that always seems to be just around the next corner or behind that door.

Romero had originally planned to give the story a much greater importance, but for whatever reason, it did not end up the way it was visioned in The Doom Bible.

I first found out about Doom like 4 years ago and im obsessed with it the only reason it says ive only played for 5 hours is because im playing all sorts of mods source ports and even made a few levels my self,Ive read the whole history of doom and the doom clones and I can go on for ever but im just gonna review the game now.\n\nGameplay:\nIts nice fluid and very fast some people will get mad at the fact that theres no crouching jumping or looking up and down,if that really bothers you please dont miss out and get your self a source port and put those funcions on and have fun it dosent bother me but some people cant stand it,the game is a maze every level with you having to find at leats 2 keys to get through though finding all 3 is best because of all the secret areas they unlock theres hidden doors every where some needing keys,hidden buttons and levers or some just being hidden in the walls slightly discolored from the rest.\n\nContent:\nUltimate doom comes with 4 episodes "Knee deep in the dead" "The Shores of Hell" "Inferno" and "Thy Flesh Consumed" each being about nine missions long and being doe in different styles of themes,puzzle types and layout "Knee Deep in the Dead" is a very basic Episode with a few Secret areas  this episode takes place mainly indoors with a few secrets leading outside. "the Shores of Hell" Is my favorite episode with the level design in my opinion truelly being the best taking place mostly indoors from what I can remeber too. Inferno is mainly outside in demon infested areas with lave and rock every where this episode is where doom story wise ends this is my least favorite episode  as it felt kinda easy "Thy Flesh Consumed" was incredibley hard being kind of a sequell to Doom and a backround story for Doom 2 telling you how Doom-Guy got to earth this one is very hard it probabley took me the longest out of all 4 this one is less puzzle solving and more straight foward action you should save often on this one you'll die alot.(I played all 4 on hurt me plenty and beat "Knee Deep in the Dead" On Ultra-Violence)\n\nCons\n(take in mind this game is being run on an amulating source port and is an old game in general)\nMultiplayer requires a source port and is not able to run as is I recommend Zandronum for this as Zdeamon is very dead and the community is full of ####faces\n\n9/10 no game is perfect to me though it will always be a 100,000,000/10","July 9, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Looks alright, but it doesn't sound very good. After a few seconds of playing, the textures on the whole screen turned into various shades of pink and blue and wouldnt change back. Rebooting the game fixed this temporarily, but the texture issue came back almost immediately upon starting it back up. That being said, in the community hub is a post about a way to fix both the audio and video. It was a super easy and quick fix, and now the game looks and sounds great.

This is a true clasic next to Commander Keen, an Wolfentein 3D. I love how when you go down a corridor you never know what to expect in each level. The maps are brilliantly designed an thought out. That feeling when you play it for the first time after so many years is nostalgia its astounding  i love it an i love the fact its on here on Steam after years of looking for it i love the way Steam has put so many classical games like Doom on here.","March 11, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I actually have trouble thinking of anything negative I can actually say about DOOM, it's just so amazingly well designed, the mechanics are so well refined, the story is just enough to fortify the overall experience. Everything about this game has been thought about, the designers clearly thought about the scope of DOOM so they could deliver the best possible experience they could.

For well seasoned gamers you have played of FPS titles such as Unreal Tournament, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D, Wolfenstien, Shadow Warrior, Blood, Rise of the Triad, Painkiller or Serious Sam but not have played DOOM would feel right at home with this game and I would recommend you play this on the harder difficulties or you could download a sourceport for the classic DOOM games for example (Zandronum, GZDoom, ZDoom, DOOMsday etc.) and then get a little mod called Brutal Doom...believe me it's worth the hassle. There are just to many mods and sourceports for DOOM too even mention here.

You job is to kill the Cyber Demon and close the portal to hell.\n\nThe game is quite simple, kill everything and get to the end. There are secrets in each level and can give you some weapons earlier than normal.\n\nThere is a mod called Brutal Doom that gives new weapons, Aiming, extra realistic gore, remasteded music and more. The mod gives Doom a more brutal experience and a ton more fun to play.\n\nI grew up with Doom as i child and have always loved it, so i hope this review helps you if, you some day wants to buy the games\n\nAdditional Infomation :Developer:  id Software\nPublisher:  GT Interactive\nGenre: FPS, Single player\nReleased: 30. apr 1995\n\n\nFollow my Curator page :http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/\nThis review is written for :The Panda's Corner","January 9","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is one of the greatest games of all time.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe atmosphere in Doom is perfect (in the first 3 chapters atleast), and isn't too dark for it's own good. (Like another game later in the franchise).\n\nStory:\nThe story in this game barely exists, because it doesn't need one. There's demons. Kill them.\n\nSound:\nThe music is some of the greatest and some of it is just metal songs from the early 90s in MIDI form.\n\nWeapons:\nThe main guns you will ever use are the shotgun and plasma gun. The other weapons are good and have their uses, but they aren't AS useful as the first two I mentioned.\n\nOverall:\nThe orignal 3 chapters of Doom are great and very memorable. However if you're getting this you definintely need to get a source port ( I suggest GZDoom or ZDoom). Everything about this game is great. If you haven't played it you should, and besides it's only $5.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nBuy it Now","May 18","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Doom doesn’t work on my windows 10 laptop it crashes at the start, but it is easily fixable, you can download a launcher called zdoom, which is free and you will be able to easily get the game up and running on it. There is a link below to zdoom.\n\nWhat I liked about Doom\n•	The game has an awesome soundtrack.\n•	There are many secrets throughout the levels to be found.\n•	The monsters in the game were pretty cool to fight.\n•	Awesome levels. My favourite chapter in the game is Inferno\n•	A great arsenal of weapons. The shotgun and the chainsaw were my favourite weapons to use. The weapons have a real kick to them, makes you feel like a badass as you go around killing enemies.\n•	I liked how at the end of the levels it showed you a map telling you, where you have been and where you are going to next.\n•	You can mod the game. Highly recommend you try brutal doom or Project brutality.\n• I like it how you can see doomguy's face at the bottom of the screen, seeing how he reacts to being shot at or attacked.\n\nWhat I disliked or was disappointed with\n•	Chapter four isn’t that good. A very difficult chapter, especially at the start.\n\nMy conclusion\n\nDoom was one of the first video games I ever played, I have fond memories of it. It is a brilliant first person shooter and made even better with brutal doom or project brutality.

Not my favorite FPS of all time, My absolute favorite. This game was a technical marvel of its time. If you take the SNES verision of this game and put it next to the PC version, you will see that PC blows console out of the water(As usual).  Now that we have all of the tech and bashing out of the way lets get into the actual game! You are an unnamed space marine for the UAC. You are stationed on one of Mar's moons on a base that has been attacked by the horrors of hell. Enough story I want to shoot some demons! As soon as you press new game, choose which episode you want to play, and which difficulty you want to take on hell with, you are immediately dropped into E1M1, The Hanger, with pistol in hand with demon zombies to kill. There is no health regeneration in this game, no M4 carbine with unlimited ammo, no automatic checkpoints, and no hand holding what so ever. As soon as the level starts you are on your own to kill and explore. That is the beauty of this game there is no restriction on where you can go. If you see an area with bad guys outside? You can go there. You see a chain saw and you want it more than anything in the world? Look for a wall to open and go get it and find some meat! The gameplay is the best thing about this game. The primal satisfaction from seeing that enemy go down in a bloody gorey mess from the blast of your shot gun is like no other. The story is there, but it never really matters that much. John Carmack, the lead programmer for the game, has stated this hilarious phrase, "Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important." The music in this game is absolutely phenomenal. At DOOM's gate, the music from E1M1, is ingrained into every person who has played this game. The music is down and dirty metal. It fits the game very well. All in all, I would absolutely recommend this game. For $5 dollars this game is a no brainer. Especially when it's on sale for a little more than a buck.\n\nNow that the sales pitch and review of this game is done, I will have to say that the MS DOS port does not look good in today's standards. I do recommend that you pick up a source port so that you can have the game support your native resolution, mouse support, mods, etc. It's not hard to install or set up, it just consits of finding the source port, I recommend Zandronum, copy the WAD from the location you installed and paste it into your source port. That's it!\n\nI may be a 16 year old kid, but I see what this game has done to the FPS genre. I love all of the mechanics of this game and will always be coming back to this game for years to come.\n\nThank you so much for bearing with me for this long review,\n\nUncle Teo\n\n\n(P.S. Don't judge my hours played I have played this a lot with a source port that doesn't keep track of my hours)","April 3","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of the greatest games of all time.\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe atmosphere in Doom is perfect (in the first 3 chapters atleast), and isn't too dark for it's own good. (Like another game later in the franchise).\n\nStory:\nThe story in this game barely exists, because it doesn't need one. There's demons. Kill them.\n\nSound:\nThe music is some of the greatest and some of it is just metal songs from the early 90s in MIDI form.\n\nWeapons:\nThe main guns you will ever use are the shotgun and plasma gun. The other weapons are good and have their uses, but they aren't AS useful as the first two I mentioned.\n\nOverall:\nThe orignal 3 chapters of Doom are great and very memorable. However if you're getting this you definintely need to get a source port ( I suggest GZDoom or ZDoom). Everything about this game is great. If you haven't played it you should, and besides it's only $5.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nBuy it Now","May 18","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to sit at my dad's PC and play this game non-stop. Constantly replaying Knee Deep in the Dead, it being my favorite episode. Knowing all of the secrets, weapon locations, enemy types. Ah.. Thankfully the 2016 DOOM stays true to it instead of trying to pull what Doom 3 did. Doom 3 wasn't a bad game, it just wasn't a good Doom game. This game can be made better through programs like GZDoom, Zandronum and a few others. Some of these mods even  including PvP multiplayer and a co-op campaign experience. The game is inexpensive, and hella fun. I'd say get it and run it through Zandronum for some multiplayer with friends.","December 4, 2013","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Blasting your way through the adorable, yet terrifying cast of hellspawn in search of a way out is still the most satisfying mechanical experience you could have on A Personal Computing Device.\n\none that hasn't been successfully matched in 23 years\n\none with an endless amount of community-created content, from well crafted packs that replace the 3 episodes, many infamous maps that are great for a quick laugh, single maps that continue to push the limits of what a 1993 game is capable of. [the majority of wads are designed for doom 2, get that one too]\n\nand if it's your thing, there are gameplay mods that totally ruin alter what is already great gameplay and are enjoyable for about five minutes at the most and are a disgrace to one of the finest peices of interactive entertainment.\n\n\nI would definitely recommend using a source port when playing on a modern [not DOS] system, there are many out there which all fill a necessary hole. I recommend Chocolate Doom [designed to be as close to the original executable as possible, with bugs and limits] and Doom Retro [based on an earlier version chocolate doom with less bugs and minor enhancments but still keeps the gritty vibe and vanilla gameplay]. there are a few others, but the other one i would recommend is ZDoom [not gzdoom], as that works with the majority of user-made content and is definitely user-friendly. This isn't an absoulte list of what you need to use, but i highly discourage jumping in whatever port you decide on. that completely ruins many of the levels in the game.\n\nthis game and its sequel have consumed me for 12 years off and on. still one of my all time favorites\nbuy the pack with Doom II+master levels and Final Doom instead of Whatever Your Vice Of Choice Is\n\nbest played on a software renderer, capped at 35 FPS at 320X200.\nUltra-Violence\nKeyboard only if you're feeling courageous\n♥♥♥♥ e4m2","May 31","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't let the system requirements put you off, this runs perfectly well on new operating systems with a few tweaks. It's pretty easy to take for granted from a modern perspective what games such as Doom, System Shock and Half-Life had on the gaming industry upon their release; almost single-handedly creating and then revolutionising the FPS genre. The phenomenal response to the shareware release of Doom and it's colossal (and enduring) success is due to absolutely nailing the formula and standard that id had previously set with Wolfenstein.\n\nFrom the exceptional level design, full of secrets and opportunities for your trusty shotgun to earn its keep, to the brilliant soundtrack backed by excellent sound design as yet another imp is blown away, Doom is everything that many shooters have forgotten: Simple, bloody, fast and instantly gratifying chaos.\nWhen was the last time you played something that was this much fun?\n\nToo outdated for you?

I told my older bother, of whom is 7 years older than me, "Did you play this when you were little?" he said Yes. As soon as I heard that,  i just couldn't stop playing DOOM on My Brother's PC. I would be in his room almost for like 5 or 6 hours straight playing DOOM, and he would be asking me to get off his PC so he can play Half-Life 2 or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

I heard of the game before, but never saw anyone play it\n\nI Was born in the Late '90s now. Sure I played Half-Life and Counter-Strike on the PC when I was in KinderGarden; Doom I did not play until I was about 10 years old and in 5th Grade, and I thought the Graphics were complete ♥♥♥♥ There was a point in my life were I would only play on the Playstation 2, but remember that was like 2002-2005.. I told my older bother, of whom is 7 years older than me, "Did you play this when you were little?" he said Yes. As soon as I heard that,  i just couldn't stop playing DOOM on My Brother's PC. I would be in his room almost for like 5 or 6 hours straight playing DOOM, and he would be asking me to get off his PC so he can play Half-Life 2 or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. But then Something Happend to my brother, he moved out of the house; I live in with my Parents, so now I don't see my brother almost 365 days now.\n\nI didn't know much about Doom until I was a Sophmore in highschool (this last school year, '13-'14, and researched a project about Valve Corp. and with out this game, Valve would not exist, or even Steam. Still think this review is a waste of you time, well Doom got more installments of this MSN DOS Game than anyother Windows OS at the time this game came out. So yeah, GO buy and Play a game that had more installments on Personal Computers than Widnows at one time, Go ahead, Buy It it's the best 5 dollars you can spend on one of my favortie FPS Games, but beware, when I try to Livestream this game Dos BOX.exe Crashes. I Don't Know if it's just me when I try to record with Fraps and Nvidia Geforce Experience GTX Videogame recording software(it came free with my Video Card).\n\nThis game Deserves a 100/10, One of the Best games ever, even better than any COD game Franchise, I Still PLay Call of Duty, but honestly I only play the first 5  and the 7th one , for people wondering on what Call of Duty 5 is, it's World at War and COD 7 is Black opps.

Sure, the arcades were feeling Sega's games like Virtua Racing, but somehow managing to get a 3D shooter to run at 25-30 fps purely through DOS, that will run on a home PC in '93 just amazes me. Some very sneaky tricks must have been used to get that '3D' effect working in DOS. With good sound, good level design, and just a very classic feel to it, the overall experience feels like a primitive (but still very enjoyable) form of the games we have today.\n\nBack then, it would've really stood out. I say this without nostalgic bias, as I wasn't even alive at the time of release, but I can still see the serious jump Doom had over Wolfenstein 3D, or Pathways Into Darkness by Bungie for the Macintosh. ID Software really had the ball rolling here, with 4 player Deathmatch support, and being a key icon in popularising the fps genre, I'm going to have to hand it to them, it's hard to make a game that will still be enjoyable decades later.\n\nFor its time, I'd give it a solid 9/10.","November 19, 2014","true","9.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And once i got into it i was having fun. "this aint that bad!" i said aloud. So i kept playing. It was rly fun, like REALLY FUN. Because of shizzy graphics it made my imagination flow wiled.

Not the first FPS, but I could say it's "The First Bad@$$ FPS Ever. PERIOD". Why the 2 rates? Let's say the 10/10 rate is related to the Game itself (or every Pros I've though of and listed) while the 0/10 is related to the Game As a Steam Release (Everything is listed in the Cons Section). Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically DooM II, Final DooM nor even the Master levels for DooM II. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.\n\n+++PROs+++The Following Points are the reason I MUST recommend this Game FPS. The genre was defined by THIS game (Yes, yes, there was Wolfenstein before, but the mainstream came with DooM overwhelming popularity). I still feel Adrenaline while sporting around an arsenal of weapons through Maps totally full of monsters and a gameplay that can be summarized as "shoot (or run through) everything that moves and get to the exit". Sounds lame but everything started from here, and simpler things are not boring here. They're Fun.\nMUSIC. It's a widely known story and it's true. Most of the bad@$$ music you hear in game are nothing but ripoffs from famous Metal or Hard Rock famous songs. How could a game be more Bad@$$ than this?\nMODS. One of the most Modded game ever. There are even lots of Ports, because DooM originally is a DOS game so it always had few issues with windows' environment (mainly audio related, who remembers autoexec.bat, dos=high umb and other damn DOS lines like them? XD). Lots of famous mods, that can revolutionize the gameplay (like Brutal Doom), or even new maps (See Alien DooM), or totally messed up demented projects (like the Italian And somehow Satyrical/blatantly blasphemous Grezzo 2... I am told it's greatly appreciated around the world... even though most characters are italian or from italian Television, and everything is written/spoken in italian... so... O.o). There are even lots of guides, both in steam and in other sites, with solutions to all of the CONs I've listed.---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam. STEAM OVERLAY. This release runs directly with dosbox, so obviously the overlay won't work.\nTHE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor LAGs, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that it has 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT "Modern input" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And "Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD...

This DOOM port is  a DOS emulator with the DOOMrom attatched. This means that it is poorly optimized for a modern computer. There is a lack of any controller options, meaning you have to use the origional control scheme which is very tank-like, using the arrow keys to go forward, back, and turining while using the "ctrl" key to fire and holding "alt" to strafe. The mouse support is awful simply acting as the arrow keys. A better DOOM for a modern machine is DOOM 3 bfg edition.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kriegmeister/recommended/2280/","kriegmeister","Crazy Eyes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kriegmeister/","191 products in account","I bought this on Steam just so I could write a review of it, and maybe push id in the right direction with sales. I have actually played this game for hundreds of hours. I probably play it for at least 10-20 hours per year, for every year of my life.\n\nLet me make one thing perfectly clear: nostalgia does not factor into this game's enjoyment. Doom still has a very active community, and new mods come out all the time. Thanks to Carmack's programming, Doom made modding a staple of PC gaming, and it hasn't gone away. Getting older has made me see more of Doom's flaws, but I don't really like it any less.\n\nDoom is far from perfect. Unlike modern corridor shooters, which almost completely abandon the principles of level design, Doom is made or broken by its level design. There are a few different level designers that worked on Doom, and once you've played enough you can tell each of them just by playing their levels, even if you don't know their names. This means that level design is inconsistent, and therefore you're going to really like some levels and hate others. Most people who played Doom as a kid forgave the bad levels because, well, they were kids. If you're new to Doom, it's best to start at the beginning and play Episode 1 of Doom 1. This is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, set of levels for Doom, designed by John Romero. They're coherent, look nice (relatively speaking) and have well-placed secrets. Oddly enough, Doom 64 has one of the best sets of levels and plays like any of the other classic Doom games; google "Doom 64 Absolution" and you can easily find a total conversion mod that basically allows you to play Doom 64 on your computer once you have Doom. Thanks, Midway!\n\nVirtually every level can be summed up by "find keys, throw switches, open doors." This sounds bad, but again, it can either be tedious or enjoyable depending on the level's design. I must stress that the player should use their automap (tab key) here. Doom's levels are not afraid of having many twisting paths, and it's quite easy to get lost without it. Helpfully, switches are usually recessed into the wall slightly, which clearly marks them on the automap. If levels truly become tedious, don't be afraid to skip them by typing "IDCLEVXX", where "XX" is a two-digit number following the convention of episode number, then level number. i.e. IDCLEV14 changes to episode 1, level 4. Each episode has 9 levels. I won't lie to you, there are a few quite truly bad levels in Doom, but fortunately id left this cheat code in. Be careful, it starts the level as if you'd started a new game, which means you lose all your weapons except the pistol, and start with 100 health and 0 armor. However, all Doom levels are designed with pistol start in mind, so you should be able to manage with enough skill. Doom should be enjoyed on a level-by-level basis; remember, there is almost nothing in the narrative that ties these levels together. If you really hate a level, you should get used to the idea of just skipping it.\n\nThe guns... well, everyone knows how the guns work, since they were the basis for almost every shooter arsenal until Unreal came out, notable exception being Rise of the Triad. They're quite well-balanced, actually, with the exception of the pistol, which becomes useless once you get the chaingun. The shotgun and chaingun are good at long range. The super shotgun is probably the best all-around weapon in the game, although it doesn't appear until Doom 2. The rocket launcher and plasma rifle are high-power weapons meant to break out against threatening hordes of monsters, and the BFG is there when nothing else substitutes.  Every one of them has a place in your arsenal, although depending on the levels you're playing, you may be using one a lot more than the other due to ammo distribution.\n\nDoom is famously narrative-light. Romero makes a good effort to portray "realistic" military base locations, but the game's somewhat ridiculously deep story penned by Tom Hall was thrown out in short order - trust me, if you'd have read it, you would agree that it is quite over-the-top for a fledgling shooter made in 1993. The inconsistency between levels means that the ultimate choice to abandon any hope of telling a story beyond the intermission text screens was probably for the best. There are a few key events that happen in the plot, but they mostly happen at the end of or between episodes.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Doom for anyone who enjoys shooters but hasn't played Doom before. I also recommend Doom for anyone who is new to shooters, since it was also designed for that audience. If nothing else, it will give them an appreciation for where the genre has come from. This game still holds up very well today, especially with the active modding community.\nHOWEVER: If you do buy this game, do NOT run it as-is from Steam's library. To run the game on modern systems, it comes packaged with DOSBox, which simulates the MS-DOS environment. The emulation can slow down your computer considerably and ironically make running the game more difficult. You should instead download and install one of the many "source ports," which are redesigns of the actual game engine to make it compatible with modern computers. ZDoom is a good and popular choice. Some "purists" swear by Chocolate Doom, which faithfully recreates the game, merely updating it to allow it to run on modern hardware without such niceties as OpenGL or mouselook.","June 19, 2014","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, even though the choice wasn't easy, it always boiled down to my favourite meat-grinding, first-person gore party.\n\nI believe — and this is probably just my heart talking — DOOM II was far better than the original, but even then I knew perfectly that this would be a milestone, this would matter, this would've made history.\n\nIt's not too late to claim your part in it.","November 23, 2014","true","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","1","2","0"

This in of itself would not be a deal breaker... if of course, it worked, and I didn't pay actual money for it!\n\nColour pallete and compatibility issues as well as the game becoming unresponsive seconds into a new game are the name of the game. Unfortunately, as much as I adore this franchise, the pricetag does not justify the *very* brief glimpse of nostalgia you will get from this title; much less buying the bundle pack, as I did.

The problem with the Steam version is that it comes with an old version of DOSBox which crashes on startup. That's probably why this game is on sale so often for as cheap as it is. Sure you can download a new version of DOSBox or even go find a great source port like GZDoom to run the game, but the fact is one of the two of them should come with this Steam version. It should work out of the box, otherwise, I can go tell you "go find a PC from the 90s and you'll be fine playing this." Why should there be that extra step involved? When you buy a hot dog, does the vendor tell you go across the street to cook it? What's odd is that Doom 2 works with its DOSBox, but the Master Levels and Final Doom crash on startup.\n\nIf you really want to play the game straight out of the box, the Doom 3: BFG Edition comes with a playable version of Doom 1, Doom 2, the Master Levels for Doom 2 and more. That's what you want to pick up. You can still use source ports, mods and .wad files for that. What if you need the Ultimate Doom? There are Doom bundles on Steam that you should look into as a cheaper alternative to purchasing just this game.\n\nDoom lives on forever. Its a game that's over twenty years old has been kept alive by the fans and its still going strong today with mods. I've played Doom over twenty years on multiple source ports with multiple .wad level packs made by the community. The source ports are engines to run the old game on modern technology. There are dozens of them, all free. I mentioned GZDoom before, and that's the finest way to play Brutal Doom that everyone has been talking about for the past year or more.\n\nFor those unaware, who have made it past my explanation, Doom is the father of all first person shooters and its predecessor Wolfenstien 3D is the grandfather or great grandfather at this point. Before first person shooters had their own genre, they were called Doom clones.\n\nThere is no story here beyond the back story that's unavailable unless you have the instruction manual from two decades ago. Demons have invaded and its up to only you. There are a few cut scenes after each episode as a reward and a calm moment to take a breather from all the chaos.\n\nDoom puts you down into a science fiction, demonic, almost psychotic setting on Phobos for the first episode. Then Diemos for the second,  and Hail itself for the third. Where the game becomes Ultimate Doom is that fourth challenging, tough and yet fun fourth campaign.\n\nAlthough Ultimate Doom came after Doom 2, the elements of Ultimate Doom are only from the original game. There are no new weapons, enemies or anything else other than a new orange sky for the fourth episode. Its more of the same fantastic game.\n\nSo what makes Doom so fantastic? Its simplicity. You are alone, kill everything that moves. Doom is known for being unable to move your mouse up or down. If an enemy is above or below you, your character will still shoot them, but you just have no way to look down on them.\n\nDoom's combat is fast paced. Your character already moves fast, he can strafe and turn at a swift speed, but then he can also run to dash over small gaps. There is no jump button, why would you need one when you can dodge everything and the game is full of staircases and lifts to take you where you need to go.\n\nBeyond fast paced action, you'll need to flip switches, open doors and hump walls looking for secret entrances. If you ever get lost, there's an easy to use map. There's a lot of exploration in the game and for every eight levels per episode there's a hidden secret level. You'll find soul spheres, backpacks that let you double your maximum amount of ammunition. Armor will take some damage and you'll need med kits and stim packs to restore your health.\n\nDeath will restart the level with a mere pistol, but you can save as often as you'd like. Every trap that has you falling into toxic waste, lava or something that hurts you will always have a platform to lower so you can escape. Its always a fair game like that.\n\nAt the end of each level, you're given a time, a par time, and percentages for kills, secrets and items. Having percentages and times is a good take on a score to keep you immersed in the game. There are five levels of difficulty. The nightmare requires a lot more strategy because enemies respawn a brief time after you've slaughtered them.\n\nIn terms of weapons, you start with a pistol, there's a shotgun that you can use as a sniper rifle. A chaingun that uses pistol ammunition, a plasma rifle that does more damage. Then there's a rocket launcher that does splash damage and you can watch enemies explode into mush. To top it all off, you'll find the BFG 9000 that uses plasma rifle's cell ammunition, but it can wipe out a lot of enemies. Its one of the more fastening weapons. It takes a moment to fire, it has a giant slow particle that when it smashes against something it melts a large radius of enemies.\n\nThe environments diverse array of colors and areas feel different from one another. Metallic bases, rocky mountains, red glowing lava caverns, rivers of toxic waste, bodies behind bars, walls of faces and marble structures. Areas are bright, some are dark, others have flickering lights. This is a horror action game rather than a scary atmospheric romp. Just know your shotgun will keep you safe and even when you're out of bullets you can run faster than a sports car. Who needs to run though when you have your fists and can find a chainsaw?\n\nThe enemies are a nice diverse array of creatures that ramp up as the game progresses. There is a set of two zombie soldiers, one with a pistol, the other with a shotgun. These two are more of a challenge to grant you a bit of ammunition. They still manage to be dangerous on higher difficulties, because they have hitscan weapons, meaning that if they can see you.\n\nLarger foes like imps throw fireballs that let you dodge them before they hit you. Cacodemons hover and posture to belch lightning balls at you. Pinkie demons and spectres take a lot of damage and get in your face, but they're still quick enough to dodge your crosshair when they're a distance away. Lost souls dash forward and bash into you. Barons are grand versions of imps that throw plasma balls and take a lot of punishment. Beyond those enemies are two bosses that cap off the second and third episodes. A giant beast with a rocket launcher as an arm and a spider mastermind with a chaingun hitscan weapon that will keep hitting you with no cover.\n\nThe Ultimate Doom is a fantastic game, its just that it should be playable when you buy it. However, Doomers are known for digging through folders and getting programs to work. There are a lot of ways to get this to work and chances are if you're reading this you've already played Doom before, so go play Doom, but play it elsewhere than this specific version.","January 1","false","0.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","2"

Not being able to look up or down is always annoying. Even worse, moving the mouse forward or back instead moves me forwards or backwards, which is really annoying when I'm trying not to fall. I mean, seriously, what FPS does that, having the mouse move the player? It goes against every gaming instinct I've developed from FPSs.\nAs far as I know, there's no way to change the controls, so I'm stuck with this bass ackwards mouse control.\nOther than that, there's not much to say. I mean, it's the original DOOM, pretty much. An all-time classic. I would say it's aged relatively well. Graphics can get repetitive, what you have to do isn't always straightforward, and some times the game makes you jump through extra hoops just for some cheap hits (if I remember correctly, in E1M4, you have to get the red keycard, which sets off a flag for more enemies to be released, and you have to get through them to get the blue keycard). But overall, it's fun, it's challenging, and it's DOOM.\n\nHell awaits you... Are you ready for it?","May 12","true","5.0"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

How bad? No OpenGL/DirectX. Software Rendering Only. Locked 480p 4:3 Resolution. This is only worth buying for the data files, which you should proceed to use in a newer Source Port engine.\n\n"This is the roots of PC Gaming on Windows people thanks to Gabe Newell who offered to port it." -Just Good PC Games\n\nThe above statement is an obviously paid lie. Calling this a port at all is outright dishonest. This crap got shoved onto steam when Bethesda got the Id catalog, and it's an outdated unpatched dos version running in an emulator. Gabe did nothing, and in no way is this a Windows NT port, but a disgusting cashgrab by Bethesda using a DOS emulator they also didn't develop.\n\nAny other avenue for legally acquiring those files is better than this. This is an awful hackjob that no one should support Bethesda with. If you don't believe me, go look at Super Noah's Ark 3-D. There is nothing preventing these games from running the way they should but Bethesda.\n\nIf you buy this and don't leave an extremely negative review, you are personally contributing to these bad ports on steam. Any and all encouragement to buy this by Curators should be met with extreme distrust and assumption of shilling. You can't play this as it ships and leave with a good impression unless you are a fool completely ignorant of PC Gaming and DOOM. As someone who has spent hundreds of hours playing DOOM, as someone who considers DOOM to be in the high end of their Top 5 Games of All Time, this is not how you should experience doom.

Get out of here.  You don't belong here. The difficulty will have you raging but it is so satisfying when you finally beat the Spider Mastermind. And then, of course, there is one new episode to conquer, your childhood memories don't have to end. And even after that. You still have the multiplayer mode which seems impossible on today's computer. Well, then you download Zandronum and Skulltag and start deathmatching again.

While the horror has worn out nowadays, the gameplay is still very fun. It's not too hard to pick up and play, as it's basically "Shoot things and pick up keys". Don't expect a riveting plot. There are "cutscenes" at the end of the episodes but they're mainly very basic and slightly snarky.\nA recommendation I have is to download a source port (EG. ZDoom or Zandronum) so you can try the mods. The mods are the main things that keep me coming back. While the game itself is fair enough, the mods just add to the fun. Especially ones that replace weapons and monsters. Heck, I've made a few myself.\nExpect lots of pixelated and cheesy gore with satanism that looks like stuff out of a 90s rock band. While back in the day it was shocking, it's mainly kind of corny. It doesn't effect the gameplay value, however.\nAnyways, this is a good game and you should try it. If you like FPSes and don't just limit yourself to modern day shooters like CoD, you might like it.","May 14, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not one of those games that has you going straight from point A to point B. You have to explore the maps to find keys that you to proceed to the next map. There is a wide mariety of maps, this version of DOOM has a total of 36 maps if you also count the secret maps. Some maps can be a maze, however, and it can ruin the pace of the game. The game also has a lot of secrets and even a few secret levels. DOOM also has a good variety of enemies, some can be annoying though, such as the Lost Souls, the pinky Demons with partial invisibility, and the Cacodemons. The bosses are probably the most badass bosses in gaming, a giant robot demon with a rocket launcher for a hand, and a robot spider demon with a chaingun. I won't count the bruiser brothers, because they're just two Barons of Hell. The game also offers some kick ♥♥♥ music, which adds good pace to the game, although some songs can be a bit boring, but most of them are awesome. It has some really neat powerups such as +100% health, invinsibility, increased damage, +200% armor, partial invisibility, a sphere that brings your health and armor to the max (200%), and a radiation suit. You start with 2 weapons, your fists, and a pistol. The other weapons, which you earn as you progress through the game are a shotgun, a chaingun, a rocket launcher, a plasma gun, and the almighty BFG 9000, this weapon is a beast and can kill multiple enemies with one hit, and it's also an easy way to quickly end a boss fight, but it is very overpowered, and might ruin the fun unless you're a psychopath, which you probably are if you can't stay away from DOOM. The gameplay is quite simple, find what you need to continue to the next map and shoot whatever is alive. No living thing here is your friend. The controls can be awkward for players, you use the up and down arrow keys to move forwards and backwards, and the left and right arrow keys to turn left and right, left control shoots, alt strafes, shift sprints, and space flicks switches and pushes buttons, they aren't rebindable. But you can still use GZDoom, which has rebindable keys mouse looking, and it allows you to move left and right. And GZDoom also quickly starts the game, which is something we should really thank the dudes who made GZDoom for because the game takes about a minute to finally get to the main menu.\n\nTL;DR: Doom is awesome, some things can be a bit meh, GZDoom can fix some flaws. My individual rating the aspects I talked about are:\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nEnemies: 8/10\nMap design: 8/10\nMusic: 9/10\nWeapons: 8/10\nControls: 6/10 (GZDoom fixes that)\nTime to load the game: 0/10 (GZDoom makes is a 10/10)\nSimplicity: 10/10\nBosses: 8/10\nPowerups: 10/10\nMaps: 7/10\n\nOverall score: 7.6/10","July 17, 2013","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The granddaddy of all first person shooters. The orignal, the classic, and arguably the best. This game remains the epitome of what FPS games should be. A benchmark for all companys seeking to create a fully featured shooter. Doom has a wide range of weapons, excellent combat, it's challenging, and immensly fun. Even to modern standards, it kicks ♥♥♥. In it's time, there was nothing like it. Guns guns guns and monsters. Blood, guts, glory, and the salvation of the human race.\n\nIt goes without saying, if you love FPS games and haven't played Doom even once, you aren't doing it right. This game is a MUST for all FPS lovers. Learn some history about your favorite genre while you blast away at demons with your trusty shotgun. Experience the game that created and shaped a whole new niche of gaming. I can go on forever about this game.

It's not a trip through disney land. It's a "cozy" maze based shooter.

Hence, "cozy".\n\nJust an incredible game.\n\nIf this is your first time going through this on a modern machine.\n\nPick up gzdoom and the two mods I mentioned above and you're in luck. There's probably a newer version of brutal doom by the time you read this, so get the latest one, but even going through the game once in vanilla is probably fine, but you'll still want to go through the vanilla version in gzdoom because dosbox doesn't always play friendly with the latest OS.\n\nEnjoy one of the best games every made.","August 6, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, technological improvements allowed Doom to be a work with many new elements that gave more gameplay than its predecessor.\nDoom popularized most aspects of FPS games. Many people claim it was Doom that created the platform and patterns that other games of this genre were to follow, as well as in terms of creativity, allowed the insertion of the expansions and the same user could create custom levels for the game (the famous WAD files, which created, probably, the first modding community in the history of video games).\n\nThis is the reason why this game was the CORNERSTONE for other FPS games that remained for posteriority. For example, a great game like Half Life (1998), probably it wouldn't become possible (at least as we know it currently) if Doom (1993) hadn't appeared first because some of the programmers of that game (John Carmack, John Romero, Michael Abrash...) were the same persons who made Quake (1996). Half Life was created using the GoldSrc engine, which is a modification of the updated Quake engine (known as QuakeWorld).\n\nThis game, The Ultimate DOOM (as well DOOM II: Hell on Earth), is for the true FPS hardcore gamer from the oldschool.","January 6, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyway for those that have experienced this game all those years ago and haven't touched it since, I advise to pick it up, play, to relieve the nostalgia, then hop onto the mod scene for a kick in the nuts surprise. Anyway, it is one of the first FPS games that started the genre and got me interested in it. (Though to be fair Duke Nukem 3D was the real spark for me for shooters, and Quake was what got me into competitive MP portion of the genre).\n\nThe vanilla experience is extremely dated, no proper aiming, clunky controls by today's standard, heavy reliance on auto aim and naturaly the primitive graphics. Even with all that I played the vanilla recently (though I ended up modding it via zdoom for better control scheme) and still was fun as ever. Secrets were ♥♥♥♥ well hidden (for those that I couldn't remember), shooting still felt great. Amusing how a primitive shooter like Doom can have such great shooting feeling. Enemies will flinch depending on guns, rockets will gib and blast stuff apart and BFG will clear rooms. The level design was fantastic, mazelike key hunting formula that made a lot of old games great, and put a large majority of modern games to shame when it comes to inteligent level design. While I had an absolute blast with Doom, and not just due to nostalgia, I encountered the large amount of fantastic mods.\n\nAt first I take this with a grain of salt. Mods for games are peculiar, usually extremely specific, niche or such. Here or there there will be some that truly stand out. In Doom's case, good God are there a lot of great mods. I'm not going to rattle them off but I will mention one particular mod that enhances the experience to modern standars, and puts to shame almost every known FPS developer today. I'm talking about Brutal Doom mod. If you liked doom, any iteration of it, go look this up. It takes the entire old game/s and tuns it to 11 with gore, weapons, effects, sound and feeling. To me this mod made Doom game so much more in standard with current games. Doom already was a pinacle, had nothing to prove since it stood among the first and best, but with mods like this it really makes me ask: what the ♥♥♥♥ are current FPS devs doing.\n\nThe original game is timleess, and while I admit there is some nostalgia there, there are still a lot of technical aspects (gameplay wise) that hold strong even 20 years after. With mods (like Brutal Doom), all bets are off, this is balls to the walls amazing value in a game that offers everything a shooter should have. Shooting is fun, satisfying, strategic, skill based, and no matter how much they throw at you you will want more to paint the walls with (that is quite literal in Brutal Doom's case).\n\nIf you feel that game requires fancy graphics to be good, you are in the wrong game genre. This game right here does everything justice in terms of shooting, level exploration, wit, and just not giving a ♥♥♥♥. Go to hell, and make them sorry they ever heard of you.","September 10, 2013","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had trouble enjoying it, until I started playing it on easy mode through a third-party Doom engine like Doomsday or ZDoom. Doomsday has an option to disable the motion-sickness-inducing view bobbing, and has a map overlay that makes navigating the byzantine levels more fun for a modern gamer. Easy mode is built in to the regular game (there are 5 difficulty settings, and the default is the one in the middle), and I found it much more fun to treat the game like a shooting gallery in a maze (with a map that fills out as you go through the level) than a tough as nails, player versus the world hellscape.\n\nThere are people who played Doom when it came out and still love the original game for what it is. The majority of current FPS gamers have never played it, but they should. Maybe they can't appreciate it in the same way as the original fans, but if they're like me they can still enjoy the incredible shooting mechanics. Among all first-person shooters, this game has one of the best and most satisfying to use shotguns, for example.","December 8, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason it is called "the ultimate doom" is because alle the episodes are included. Doom consists of four episodes, three episodes that makes up the main storyline, pluss an extra fourth episode.\n\nThe Doom series is a must have for a PC-gamer born in or before the 90's. This is buy far one of the best first person shooters out there, and is therfore highly recomended. For me, and probably for a lot of other people, this game is packed with action and nostalgia.\n\nIf you are running windows 7/8 you will need to run this game in compability mode for windows "XP (service pack 3)". To do this, go to: Steam>SteamApps>common>Ultimate Doom>base. In this folder you should see the dosbox.exe. Rightclikk it and go to properties. Clikk compability in the top tab. Check "Run this program in compability mode for" And choose: Windows XP (service pack 3) in the dropdown menu.\n\nFor further inprovement you can change the configurationfiles for Dosbox and Doom. The configurationfiels are called: dosbox.conf, ultimate.conf and ultimatem.conf. Open the files with notepad to make your changes. If you are changing annything in this files make sure you set the same values in all three files. If you screew up with theese files, just uninstall and reinstall the game and they should be back to their default setting.

With it’s pixelated 2.5D graphics, midi soundtrack, inability to jump or duck or even look in 3 dimensions, you would think that it would have been long forgotten in a wash of newer, flashier combat games, but that’s where Doom really shines. In its minimalistic nature, Doom makes you forget what it doesn’t have and focus on what it does have: amazing gameplay.\n\nDoom doesn’t hold your hand. Right from the start you are thrust into a foreign Martian world with a pistol and the hope of survival as you are faced with ever increasing opposition which comes in the form of possessed Space Marines and demonic creatures straight from the depths of hell, and over time that’s exactly where you go. Through the game you get access to bigger and badder weapons but also find larger and more dangerous enemies such as the Cyberdemon and the Spiderdemon-both a mix of demonic flesh and futuristic machine a perfect parallel to the twisted world around them-to use them on. Through it all, superior level design and your wits are what separate you from the dead marines at your feet. The levels unobtrusively lead you into your next surprise encounter all the while providing the cover needed to save you from near death. One thing they don’t do is raise that veil of atmosphere that Doom lays on you. All of the pieces fit together wonderfully in this game to give you the perfect immersive experience.\n\nOf course, one of the biggest reasons this game is still relevant today is the still thriving community of modders who create everything from single levels to entire modifications for the game that give you new weapons, enemies, graphics, sounds, levels, game mechanics… even huge multiplayer and coop levels. And it’s all free.\n\nIf you are looking for an adrenaline rush or just want to run screaming down memory lane, look no further than Doom.","July 17, 2014","true","32.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Twenty-plus years after its release, it still stands tall as one of the greatest first person shooters ever made, an orgy of twitchy bloody death and destruction matched only by its own sequel. All the game needs to make you forget it came out in the early 90's is a fresh coat of paint, and all it takes is a few free downloads to cover that. GZDoom ports the game engine to run natively on windows, instead of requiring DOSbox, and gives the game a host of modern conveniences features like fully 3D environment rendering, texture filtering, and most importantly, proper mouse look. Brutal Doom, probably one of the best and most comprehensive mods ever made, fills out the package by overhauling the soundtrack, adding buckets and buckets of gore, and rebalancing the gameplay to be faster and more intense than ever.\n\nIf you're willing to take a few minutes to set it up properly, Doom is absolutely worth your time. It was great then, and thanks to twenty years of technical advancements and a somewhat overzealous fan community, it's even better now.","November 26, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had heard all this and much more about how amazong this game was yet I was hugley sceptical of the as I belived it must be alot of nostaliga that is affecting people view on the game.\n\nSo I bought the game to try it out myself, at first I wasn't keen on it atall as im used to modern titles such as COD and battlefield. But onec I got into the game I realized I was have so much more fun than I did on say a call of duty campaign. The graphics are bad and you cant look up or down but it didn't affect me atall as the game is just so much fun.\n\nIn reflection this game is one of my all time favourite FPS games and maybe even one of my top 10 games of all time, ok maybe im pushing it with top 10 games of all time as there are so many good games out there. I think I got my point accross though that this game is indeed an amazing game and not just a nostaliga throw back.\n\nThe weapons are immesnsily satisiying especially the shot gun and the soundtrack is also fantastic, the levels are also laid out greatly.

Well, at least if you play on ''ULTRA VIOLENCE'' like I do. If you wanna have a walk in the park then the lower difficulties keep you entertained enough.

For our generation, it's the equivalent of being handed the Bible and asked to give it a score out of ten..... The content isn't so much the important issue here, rather it's the legacy the game left behind.\n\nI don't think many people would argue that gaming (especially PC gaming) could be divided into "Before DOOM" and "After DOOM". No, it wasn't the first to do many of the tricks we now take for granted. No, it wasn't the best FPS around. But.... the iPod wasn't the first portable music player and certainly wasn't the best, but it changed the way we listen to music forever. DOOM did the same thing for the FPS, and that's not an exaggeration.\n\nYou only have to look at the timeline of games development to see that it changed both the industry and people's attitudes. Suddenly, corporate networks were being clogged up with data from employees fragging each other when they should have been working. People at home were able to design their own levels and have others play them. The graphic violence drew criticism from various groups and DOOM was talked about in national media. Every games developer in the world was rushing their own FPS to market to try and cream off some of the publicity DOOM was generating. Some were successful (Duke Nukem 3D), some (Nitemare 3D?) less so.\n\nNo, it wasn't the first to do any of these things. But at the time it was nothing short of a phenomenon. There was barely a console around which didn't receive some version of DOOM at some point (Even the VIC-20 got one eventually thanks to homebrew).\n\nIs it the best game ever? No. But it's very important if you're even slightly interested in games, and you owe it to yourself to at least play it. The industry was never the same again after DOOM. It kick-started the interest in LAN gaming, and made 3D gaming if not the standard, then at least a target to aspire to.\n\niD of course managed to make lightning strike twice when Quake was released, but that's another story...","February 26, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, technological improvements allowed Doom to be a work with many new elements that gave more gameplay than its predecessor.\nDoom popularized most aspects of FPS games. Many people claim it was Doom that created the platform and patterns that other games of this genre were to follow, as well as in terms of creativity, allowed the insertion of the expansions and the same user could create custom levels for the game (the famous WAD files, which created, probably, the first modding community in the history of video games).\n\nThis is the reason why this game was the CORNERSTONE for other FPS games that remained for posteriority. For example, a great game like Half Life (1998), probably it wouldn't become possible (at least as we know it currently) if Doom (1993) hadn't appeared first because some of the programmers of that game (John Carmack, John Romero, Michael Abrash...) were the same persons who made Quake (1996). Half Life was created using the GoldSrc engine, which is a modification of the updated Quake engine (known as QuakeWorld).\n\nThis game, The Ultimate DOOM (as well DOOM II: Hell on Earth), is for the true FPS hardcore gamer from the oldschool.","January 6, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Twenty-plus years after its release, it still stands tall as one of the greatest first person shooters ever made, an orgy of twitchy bloody death and destruction matched only by its own sequel. All the game needs to make you forget it came out in the early 90's is a fresh coat of paint, and all it takes is a few free downloads to cover that. GZDoom ports the game engine to run natively on windows, instead of requiring DOSbox, and gives the game a host of modern conveniences features like fully 3D environment rendering, texture filtering, and most importantly, proper mouse look. Brutal Doom, probably one of the best and most comprehensive mods ever made, fills out the package by overhauling the soundtrack, adding buckets and buckets of gore, and rebalancing the gameplay to be faster and more intense than ever.\n\nIf you're willing to take a few minutes to set it up properly, Doom is absolutely worth your time.

Its name may well be synonymous with gaming controversy itself right beside Grand Theft Auto and E.T. It's one of the few 3D games that can say it's old enough to legally drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and own a handgun in its home country at the time of writing. For a long time, I wanted to play the game that was so important it was deemed a national treasure of the United States. When I finally did, I didn't regret it for an instant.\n\nIt goes without saying; Doom is old. You can't crouch, you can't jump, you can't look up or down, and it's not even true 3D - 2.5D, as it was called, unable to stack rooms on top of one another. Pixelated monsters and environments straight out of 1993 look like an absolute mess at the ludicrous speeds the player is capable of and autoaim is a fact of life.\n\nDespite how undeniably and understandably aged Doom is, it's still a fantastic game. It offers a healthy list of useful weapons with unique roles and a good variety of enemies that provide a fair challenge each. Valuable first-person shooter skills saw their rise to prominence in the bloodstained halls of the UAC labs and remain engaging twelve years later. Pacing that satisfies and yet leaves the player wanting for more contributes to an addicting game that gives the player control of how fast and how loose they want to fight their way through each demon-infested level.\n\nInteresting usage of lighting, pleasing level design, detailed sprites and animations - few frames as they had - and a MIDI soundtrack so powerful you'd expect it to take up more than its 800KB in space all drive home Doom's finely aged experience. Even the stock sound effects that Doom relies upon are employed effectively and continue to make their presence heard in video games to this day.\n\nIt's no wonder that the first-person shooter genre had the title of "Doom clone" when this classic was released. More than two decades after id Software put shooters on the map, Doom is still an absolute treat to play. To those who have yet to see what all the yelling and screaming is about, my recommendation is to take the plunge and start cooking with gas.","March 13, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It nails the logical progression of difficulty in terms of enemy placement and quantity as well as map layout. This game is so replayable -- it's actually among the first few games people had the idea of speedrunning. If you're not out for speed, then you can kick the difficulty up a notch or try and get every secret. Every weapon has a distinct application (save for the handgun) and feels satisfying to use. Fantastic gunplay.The Doom engine itself is divine, one of the best I can think of. The game is as challenging as you want it to be, anywhere from ♥♥♥♥ easy (I'm too young to die!) to brutally hard (Nightmare)\n\nYou can't ignore the music and graphics either. Some of the best, most appropriate game music and graphics that have aged incredibly well.\n\nThe atmosphere in Doom is absolutely flawless. Never does the game fail to make me feel like I've got a monstrous task ahead of me. Sometimes you'll be anxious to activate a switch that is so obviously a trap and you don't know if you can make it out alive, but you have to activate it anyway if you want to progess. At others, you'll channel the badass nature of your space marine avatar and let nobody out of your clutches. You're supposed to feel like this is a hell (heh) of a task to take on, but also that you're exactly the man for the job, and that's exactly the feeling Doom gives me.\n\nWith only select Bethesda ARPGs coming even close, Doom is probably the most modded game in the world. There are countless megaWADs, level packs, and gameplay-altering mods. And you can bet your sweet ♥♥♥ there's multiplayer mods available, each with level packs and gameplay mods of their own. Mods are coming out faster than you can probably play them, so don't worry about running out of content. With the base game and all these mods that have been coming out since the early '90s, anyone who gets a kick out of this game can easily get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of it.\n\nBasically, Doom is one of the most polished, most well-designed games on Earth (and Mars, and Hell) and I could play it forever.\n\n10/10","February 20, 2015","true","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
