A lot of recent indie titles in this price range go for theme over mechanics, and because of the subject matter I anticipated much of the same. However, either I'm just terrible (a real possibility) or this game is a genuine challenge which is rare and enjoyable.\n\nFlip side to this is I never actually finished the game, I was playing it for a Let's Play review so I couldn't sink hours into it - resulting in a rage quit. ( Here is a link to my gameplay of this title https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=wVqgiEQoz4k ). I'm definitely going to finish the game in my personal time.\n\nOnly criticisms are a lack of game pad compatibility (which would work well in this case) and the range of music which is on loop.\n\nBut yeah, it's more than affordable so if you're looking for an addictive/challenging platformer I highly recommend you play this game!","April 15","true","0.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

It's simple to play because you only have left & right controls, but levels are interesting and they keep getting harder and harder, so it's definitely not boring. :) Also, it's great that we get a piece of a back story with every level, because the story is very nice and thought-through and it gives a certain depth to the game. Plus the music is awesome.\nSo, once again, great game! :)","April 17","true","15.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

After the first 15 levels the difficulty suddenly increases dramatically until you rage quit after dying endlessly. Difficulty is achieved by introducing death dealing obstacles that can only be surpassed by level spammage; you cannot become a pro at this game as making it to the end of the level becomes a matter of frustrating timing and chance.\n\nTo be fair the music is good, it looks nice and I was even slightly intrigued to follow the melancholic storyline to its conclusion but I just can't. After level 20 I gave up; as if I'm going to punish myself by dragging that lone photon through another 30 gruelling levels! 30 minutes is all I've got to give to it. I suppose a penny a minute is reasonable entertainment value but if you're gonna buy it then bon voyage!","May 11","false","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game does the exact opposite: It presents ridiculously simplistic levels, but gives the player awkward, sluggish movement controls – and no control over jumping whatsoever – so that the entirety of the "gameplay," if you can call it that, consists of fighting the control scheme as it constantly gets in the way of simply moving through levels that otherwise present no real obstacles (at least during the early levels, I didn't stick around past those). Any game where you spend more time fighting the controls than the actual obstacles or enemies is unplayably broken; I got this game for just 51 cents, and I still felt ripped off.","May 7","false","0.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Not difficult either, but that's not a problem. The game tries a little bit too much to be other popular games in this kind of genre.\n\nBut they have a story here, that they try a bit to pass. The game is not really bad, it could just be presented better.\n\nI won't recommend this, because, as it is, it is pretty boring to try and see the story passing through these levels that try too much to be hard. You may, as well, die a lot, but death doesn't mean anything here, except "go back to the beginning of the stage". So, in this case, death means nothing at all and shouldn't be actually overused.\n\nThe game is pretty cheap though, and has some ok music. You may as well try it in a sale, but I won't recommend it.","May 3","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You may say this is just a form of difficulty like any other, but it's a form of difficulty that feels bad in a platformer. Responsive controls are vital and it's why I can't really recommend the game.\n\nThe game is pretty spot on otherwise: the graphics, music and story adds up to a nice atmosphere.

The music is soothing and fits the level design, it doesn't distract from the rythm the photon (?) is jumping in.\n\nWhile you are progressing at the start of each level the narrator tells you a bit more of a story about a man named Joshua Cloud and the events of his life. It's an interesting but tragic story.

Have tons of different obstacles and platforms that have different animation lengths and no discernable pattern emerges. I.E. No jump lines up quite the same each time.\n\nNext, make it so that death doesn\'t reset the stage. Just respawn while everything continues moving.
