"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vyvern7212/recommended/267600/","vyvern7212","Vyvern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vyvern7212/","706 products in account","Airport Simulator might be the most tedious and boring game ever released. Heres what you do in this game:\n1. Select gate for plane to taxi to.\n2. Extend tunnel.\nIf its a passenger plane:\n1. Drive stairs to gate.\n2. Drive bus to gate.\n3. Drive luggage wagon to gate.\n4. Drive interior cleaning to gate.\n5. Drive exterior cleaning to gate.\nIf its a cargo plane:\n1. Drive cargo wagon to gate.\n2. Drive exterior cleaning to gate.\n\nWait 5-10 minutes\n\n1. Drive everything back to the garage.\n\nThats literallyy it. Theres no management, there is no way to lose you just get money for every task you do. You start with 8 gates even though youre probably never going to use more than half of them at a time. You can hire "helpers" that drive the vehicles for you. The game is over once everything got an "helper". The graphics are bad but you cant really expect good graphics from a 15€ game.\n\nWhile playing it I got the feeling that devs were never even close to an airport. On what airport do they use tunnels and stairs/buses on the same plane? On what airport does the luggage go to end of the airport and the passangers to the other?\n\nThe game is also riddled with bugs. When you save the game all textures and models unload and all you see is the skybox for about 3 minutes. The Tunnels jiggle all the time and get stuck inside the terminal. When i tried to taxi a plane back to the runway the game just crashed.\n\nNot only is this game awful it is also falsly advertised: It clearly says in the description that there are "Many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways" which there are none. Not a single one. It also says its available in german, french and italian which isnt the case either. Steam finally has to hire someone that plays every game for at least an hour before it is made available on the store.\n\nTL;DR Do not under any circumstances buy this game, dont even accept it as a gift.","December 19, 2013","false","1.1"," 1,674 of 1,778 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","674","1","6","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tremelo/recommended/267600/","Tremelo","Tremelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tremelo/","322 products in account","This is a frustratingly uneven game. It starts off painstakingly slow: An aircraft comes in and you, apparently being the only person at the airport with a driver’s license, have to drive various vehicles to and from the plane: a passenger bus, a rolling staircase, a fuel truck, two types of cleaning trucks, a luggage trolley, etc.  It’s very tedious, but eventually multiple planes start arriving and you have to juggle various tasks among them. The plane at gate 5 is fueling now, the plane at gate 6 wants fuel next. A plane that just landed is waiting for a parking spot and you’re trying to push back a plane at gate 3 to make room for it. At this point the game isn’t exactly *fun*, but it’s at least involving. Get those tasks done to get the planes off the ground!\n\nBut then you earn money and hire help and once you hire enough employees to handle every vehicle at every gate the game becomes nothing more than a slightly interactive screen saver: A plane lands, you assign it a gate and everything is taken care of. You just sit there and wait for it to take off again.\n\nThere is one maddening exception: The pallet loader for cargo aircraft. You can’t hire anyone to drive this. It’s all you, and it's buggy and annoying. For starters, only one cargo plane can be serviced at a time. If you have 3 cargo planes parked at gates you'll only get loading/unloading instructions for one of them. You can entirely finish loading up the first plane but you won't be able to start loading and unloading the second plane until the first plane is on its way to the runway. It can sometimes take 10-20 minutes between the plane being loaded up and actually pushing back, during which time your pallet loader gathers dust and other cargo planes take up gate space waiting to unload. Additionally if you make the mistake of parking a cargo plane at gate 6, 7 or 8 you need to make ridiculous round trips back and forth across the tarmac between unloading a pallet on the south end, going to a parking spot on the north end, and returning to the cargo area on the south end again to pick the next pallet up (for gates 1-5 the parking spot is thankfully right next door to the cargo area so moving the pallet loader from the cargo area to the parking spot takes about 5 seconds).\n\nThere are other frustrations too:\n\n+ Wonky physics that allow you to flip a plane nearly upside down with a nudge from a luggage cart\n+ Tasks that appear and disappear from your task list\n+ A non-intuitive interface\n+ An inability to move vehicles to a gate prior to a plane being assigned to it\n+ Awkward vehicle/gate rules. An aircraft can't push back until all of the vehicles servicing it have returned to their parking spots. It's not enough to simply clear the gate area. This makes multitasking difficult. For instance, say you're fueling a plane at gate 1 and when finished drive the fuel truck to gate 2 to service that aircraft. Even though the fuel truck is no longer at gate 1, that aircraft won't push back until the fuel truck has actually parked in the fuel truck area.\n\nFor that small percentage of people who *really* like airports, there are bits and pieces of this game that are slightly interesting, but the bugs & game logic & freakin’ pallet loader make it nearly impossible to recommend.","July 18, 2015","false","21.2"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","31","36","5","2"

The game consists of waiting around a lot for things to happen. The things? Driving a few service vehicles aroung from garages to airpot gates and back. Once you have automated all but one task (for some reason loading cargo cannot be automated) you merely sit and watch the same things repeat over and over again. Your involvement is now over. The claim of countless missions is a lie and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves. There is one mission. It just repeats over and over again.

Sound only works if you adjust it to 2001 standards (so it matches the graphics). It's slow and boring. No way to speed up time.  All you do is drive around in excruciatingly slow airport support vehicles to a predetermined location and move on to the next vehicle. This must be done in a certain amount of time or else you start losing money. If you manage to actually make money, you can use it to "upgrade" each service, which simply automates it. So I guess the goal of the game is to upgrade everything to the point that it plays itself...  lame.\n\nGraphics and physics are waaay buggy.

Initially, you have to do all the driving, but you earn money for completing each vehicle task and receive larger cash injections when planes take off.  As you earn money, you can upgrade each of the vehicle tasks to automate the work three times, the only difference seems to be the speed in which the AI vehicles move.  Once you have upgraded all of the vehicle tasks once, everything is automated except for unloading/loading of cargo from/to cargo planes - which cannot be automated.  Once you have upgraded everything as far as it goes, the game ends, which took me about 18 hours, almost all of it waiting and watching.\n\nThe description for this product is also misleading - super jumbos, there are none; coordinating air traffic controllers and technical staff, not in the game; organizing perfect catering, nothing beyond driving the vehicle from point A to point B; detailed and comprehensive simulation of events at an international airport, only if you think the only thing that happens is people driving vehicles; many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways, not in the game; and countless missions and tasks the player has to fulfill, only one "mission" which happens to be the objective of the game (to upgrade all automation tasks) and then the game ends.\n\nOverall the game barely held my attention, and only then because I assumed there must be something more to the game once the gate upgrades were done.  I was wrong, now I want my 18 hours back.  Might be worth it if the price drops to a couple of dollars, otherwise you're just wasting money.","January 2, 2014","false","18.6"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","1"

Again, I was wrong. As you go on, the only way to get by is to automate the airport functions by hiring helpers. At first, they are desperately slow (you have to pay more to make them go faster) which frustrates you into upgrading everything as fast as possible. The problem is, you are effectively upgrading yourself out of the gameplay! There are perhaps 2 functions left that you have to do manually, and that's allocate a gate, and load/unload cargo. The latter is probably one of the more redeeming features of this game, in that the cargo lifter requires a little bit of effort as you have to line it up fairly precisely, and that it has some legitimate animation! If they had extended these features to more of the equipment, so you actually connected and sealed the stairs and the skybridges etc, I might have been inclined to stick around a bit longer.\n\nIn summary, a bit tedious and a bit limited. Save your money...\n\nFor the sake of constructive feedback to any of the development team who might see this (unlikely I know):\nFix the bugs with the AI - they get close to their goal on some tasks and then just abandon it altogether\nGive an option to take over automated tasks - In case of the above, I had no way to step in!\nPlease extend the animations a bit! - Connecting the walkways, and seeing people in the buses can't be that hard to do if you can do containers in and out of a cargo hold!\nFind some form of expandability for once a player has automated the terminal. - Maybe designing and building a new terminal? Extending the current one? Upgrading equipment? Replacing old equipment with newer kit?!?\n\nThere was a fair bit of potential for this game but it just fell short of my expectations, even for this price. Deep down inside I hoped it was going to be like 'Air Mogul' with the customisation of the buildings as well as the operation of the equipment, and i'd definitely come back to it if these things were patched in at some point, but for now, I bid you adieu, Airport Simulator 2014...","December 21, 2013","false","14.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The idea of an Airport Simulator sounded interesting and as I had acquired this in a Bundle Package I thought I would at least give it a try otherwise it would just sit there in my library collecting dust. No more than 15 minutes into the game, it will now definitely continue to sit there gathering dust forever.\n\nJust like some of their other titles, the developers of this game should honestly hang their heads in shame. The game is buggy, there are graphical glitches all over the place and there are absolutely no tutorials on how to control anything you have access to in the game, so you just have to figure it out all by yourself (seriously, what is your problem with tutorials? None of your games that I have played have anything of the sort).\n\nAlso, the dialogs are blurry and impossible to read for me, I know this isn't the case for everybody, but it seems to be the case no matter what settings I apply in-game. I'm not wasting any more time on this game, so I won't write any more as I am just going to be repeating myself. I knew it wasn't going to be amazing because of all the bad reviews, but this is much worse than I even expected.\n\nLong story short: Do not buy this game, not at all, not in a sale and not as a part of a bundle unless you're getting at least one good title out of said bundle.\n\nWaste of my time.","July 5, 2014","false","0.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","2"

If you however want to do something then this isn't that game for you, even if you want to browse the web or play something else while your waiting you can't because when you alt-tab or click outside the windowed version the time stops.\n\nThe graphics aren't to bad and the gameplay is okay, its not overly buggy besides from some animations and things getting stuck when automated, but....\n\nIt's very boring, very repetative and quickly loses  its charm.\n\n3/10","December 19, 2013","false","8.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This is limited to choosing things of a menu without any detail of what your actually doing. The graphics aren't up to scratch which should be expected for a simulator.\n\nThe "comprehensive simulation"  refers to all the time you spend driving around airport vehicles (like buses, stairs, etc) in painfully slow vehicles. The game processes at a turtle speed (I gave up after having to wait 20 minutes without a fast forward button with nothing to do).  There was no tutorial or walkthrough built into the game so made it difficult to play and UI wasn't very approachable.\n\nWould score this game 1 or 2 out of 10.

Then do I have the game for you. Airport Simulator is a game where almost nothing happens in its entirety and I really mean that. This game is so slow that you can grow a beard that is 2 feet long before you complete the first challenge. I mean what else is there to say its so BORING! I have done household chores that are more fun than this game FOR REAL! Another thing is that they are charging $10 for this abomination of what they call a game. Honestly your better off just giving that money to a homeless person because they will be able to find more enjoyment with it. Then there is the sound, dear ♥♥♥♥ing god what were the programers thinking. When you start up the game it sounds like a smoke detecor went off in your house it just drives me crazy. I honestly can't think of anything positive to say about this game and most games that I end up getting that are bad I have at least one positive to them, but not this one. So why did I buy this then? Well have you ever looked for the worst possible game to play just becasue it is bad? I thought that I would get this game because it is literly the worst rated game on steam, its true just how many games are there on steam that have a overwhelmingly negative overall user score  almost none. So I bought it expecting that it would be a good laugh, but enjoyable for being so bad like the Tommy Wiseau's The Room is, instead I was crying and wishing that I had never spent my money on this garbage. I bought this before the steam refund ever existed so I was basically stuck with this thing. Overall don't buy this garbage of a game even if it is on sale you will just waste your money and if you think that it would be funny to send to a friend as a gag gift you would be a terrible person because it will basically give them cancer. There are SO many better games that you can get for $10 and even less. Don't infect your hard drive with this disease and I honestly hope that this trend in all these fake simulator games will just die and fade away because they fill up steam promising fantastic experiance, but instead they just ♥♥♥♥ your wallet and waste your time.","April 23","false","0.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","11","13","8","0"

The game itself, it starts off slow, VERY slow, and then once you start generating little bits of cash and start to upgrade your gates, it starts to get slightly more entertaining! Then, if you're like me, and you upgrade all of your gates, once you upgrade every gate to level 1, there's nothing to do, besides escort cargo for a cargo plane! I told myself everyday, 'Don't worry Josh, ride the wave, you'll do it and finish the game tonight'... I said that for 4 consecutive days... 4 FUDGING DAYS!!! But, i did it... I got the confirmation message, telling me that i'd completed the game and couldn't upgrade my gates any longer and saved myself from dropping into the deep hole of pure insanity!!

Basically, all you get to do is drive around various airport vehicles (stairs, buses, luggage carts...) and assign planes to gates. However, it doesn't really matter which gate you assign a plane to, and there's not much you can do wrong with driving the vehicles around. The "management" part of the game has you paying money for upgrades of the various vehicles, where the first upgrade automates a vehicle (you no longer need to drive it yourself, but you also can't take control if you want to), and subsequent upgrades speed up those vehicles.\n\nAutomated vehicles are slower than manually driven vehicles (which are also pretty slow), so you might think you'd cleverly automate only some vehicles or some gates or what have you and do the rest by hand. However, as soon as you're using more than one gate, you run into a problem with manually driving the vehicles: you only get one of each type. So if you need, say, a passenger bus on gate two while it's already loading or unloading passengers on gate one, you're out of luck. But as you have a time limit for getting any vehicle in place, you'll probably end up driving the bus from plane one to plane two, then back so that unloading can continue - once an activity is started, there is no deadline, but they only continue if the vehicle is present. Except stairs. You can remove stairs and the passengers will continue loading from the bus into the plane.\n\nThe strangest part about this "game" is that the aim of it is to make yourself mostly useless, as you're supposed to get all gates fully automated at upgrade level three. Obviously, just watching the game take care of the planes for ten to fifteen minutes at a time before you get to assign a plane to a gate (one click), then watch again, isn't really that much fun. Apparently even the developers realised this, so they gave us cargo planes. Unloading and loading cargo planes is the one thing you can't automate, so you have to drive the cargo lift yourself. It's a shame though that the game is only capable of keeping track of the loading state of one cargo plane at a time - if you have more than one cargo plane at a gate, the second (and third etc.) planes will have to wait until the first one leaves.\n\nThe only thing you can do "wrong" in the game is be too slow getting a vehicle in place, which will result in money being subtracted from your account - one Euro per second until you get it done. Actually managing to be that slow is almost impossible though. One might think that as the frequency of landing planes increases, a penalty for not getting rid of planes fast enough will occur - not so. They will simply queue up on the taxiway until it is full if you don't assign them to a gate, and once it is full planes will stop landing.\n\nAll in all, the only thing this "Simulator" simulates is a horrible attempt at making a game, but it simulates that very well.","December 20, 2013","false","14.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

I never post reviews when I should but if this review helps just one person save there money then I hope I accomplish that.\n\nOkay at first, I am a big fan of simulation games, and upon seeing this game released on sale I decided t give it a try. Upon opening it, I was brought to the main menu game was running smooth at this point no problems. I clicked on new game, and was brought to a cheap tutorial screen that did not explain anything outside of the fact ill win when i accumlate enough money to hire 3 star assisants.\n\nI was left to my own will to figure it out, so i decided i would give it a go. The world loaded, graphics are mediocre at best, I have seen worse. The first plane landed I was ready to go, I had to pick a gate for the plane to park in, I picked gate #7. The plane eventually made its way over to the gate and parked. A task list then popped up, this is where it takes a turn for the worst. My first task was to drive the gate tunnel to the plane. The controls for this are horrible and theres no explanation for it at all. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how to line the tunnell up with the plane. Ok got that done, my next task was to drive the stairs over. I switched to the stairs, which were all the way on the other side of the airport. I started to drive over to the plane, in the slow slow vehicle. obviously i dont expect ferarri type speeds but it took me at least 3 minutes to get it over there. At this point im thinking okay, i hope it gets more interesting. Nope, my next task is to drive the bus over. Again its half way across the map. I drive it over park it. My next task is guess what? Drive the  mechanic van over. I did it.. My next task was? You guessed it.. I had to drive the luggage truck over.. With horrible vehicle controls on it, i made it over after almost flipping the vehicle about 19 times.. I was hoping i was done.. Nope, my next task? Drive the cleaning van over. I drove it over..My next task youll never guess. Nope not driving, It was waiting! I watched a timer count down from 8 minutes to 0 minutes to do guess what, Drive the bus over to the terminal. After doing that, guess what? I had to drive the stairs back, then the gate, then the luggage truck, then the mechanics truck and then finally i drove the cleaning van back.\n\nSo long story short, if your looking for a annoying horrible physics less than ideal driving simulator that does not explain anything about game mechanincs then buy this. If your looking for an airport simulator look elsewhere.\n\nPros:\nSort of cheap price with the sale\n\nCons:\nBoring\nNo explanations of game mechanics\nMediocre graphics\nHorrible music something like elevator music.","January 2, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Very cut and dry simulation.\n\nThe UI in the game is clumsy at best, and is easily bogged down. There is very little instruction on what exactly needs to be done, and the "goals" in the game aren't explicitly clear. They also don't follow a linear progression of difficulty, because the first goal I recieved took a very long time to achieve, but the second was done within ten minutes.\n\nIt is also not clear in any facet, how you are accumulating money. You just see random influxes of cash when certain tasks are completed, and other times when there is nothing to be done.\n\nAlso, as much as I appreciate the fact that the larger automobiles in the game drive a lot clumsier than the smaller ones, it is totally unnecessary because the game is programmed that each vehicle has the same predetermined speed based on your skill with that task, and that only applies when you have a gate guy driving.\n\nOn the whole, I find this game needs some work, and there needs to be more things to simulate. Like actually running the airport, inviting businesses in and take up real estate to pay you rent, getting other airlines into your airport, managing your monthly expenses, gas, fuel, workers salaries, etc...\n\nIf it combined the data/financial savvy of a game like SimCity, with the easy playability of Airline Tycoon, and added some additional features like growth and expansion from a small airport to an International one, then this game would be golden.\n\nAs it stands, I do not recommend this game.\n\n","January 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Almost everything people have already said, I can agree with. With one exception. I actually did enjoy the game for the first hour or two. The challenge behind making enough money to automate things was great. However, that quickly dies once you find that you have two major steps in playing the game.\n\n1. You work your butt off driving things and trying your hardest to get planes out on time.\n\n2. Once step one is nearly complete and a number of automation is set up you drive around in a vehicle watching things go. Even then your ground crew isnt the most efficient because they will take much longer to drive to places than you.\n\nSitting back and watching a painfully slow airport sim (which you have no control over other than driving vehicles) is crap.

Well uhh.. Look elsewhere. This game is so buggy it makes me wonder if the developers played more than ten minutes of it. The two biggest faults are that vehicles get stuck all over the place -- even when the game's AI is supposed to be handling them -- and there's no fast-forward button. Some tasks take 9 minutes to complete. That's 9 minutes in REAL TIME that you literally have to sit there and wait. The game leaves a LOT to be desired, and it's a shame, because the overall design/layout for the various tasks and stuff is not entirely awful. With some major overhauls this game could actually be worth it.\n\nThat being said, I completed the game to the best of my ability, unlocked all the upgrades for all the gates (took me a solid 24 hours) and even after having everything automated the computer still managed to get vehicles stuck.

Clearly there was no QA done on this other than "Can we start it?".\n\nOne of the many examples of if being broken is the "taxi" vehicle. This is supposed to hook up to ther front of the plane and move it so it can start taxing to the runway and eventually take off. Instead, you have to bump the planes into a circle on the ground, without going into the circle yourself, otherwise everything stops working. Oh, and its not uncommon at all for the planes to freak out and end up upside down from this, all of which you only find out after at least an hour of playtime.\n\n\nTo cover the marketing claims:\n"The most detailed and comprehensive simulation of the events at an international airport"\nAssuming those events include no people other than the one guy with the keys to all the vehicles, and some really odd union stuff which means each AI can only ever drive one vehicle per terminal, incredibly slowly, that is.\n\n"Many management and business options for the expansion of terminals and extension of runways"\nBettern known as "Drive this vehicle to here. Now this one to here. How wait 15 minutes. Now drive the first one back."

Not a really Airport Simulator like the Airport Inc. was in 2001, where you could build your own airport and manage the flights. All you can do in this Airport Simulator 2014 is to moving the service vehicles to and from the airplanes. You have no influence on anything else. The airport is fix, flight chart is random - or AI controlled. Despite of no-modify environment the graphic is very poor and low-poly, textures are blurred.\nIt's all you can do is only moving the bus, catering or fuel truck and some other service vehicles to and from the plane, and really this is the whole game. There's a timer within you have to reach the airplane, but there's always enough time. Anyway, sometimes you have to wait 10 minutes in real time until a service car done his job, and until that there's nothing to do. The vehicles has also poor graphic and detail, many of them looks more cartoonish than realistic, and many of them has the same sound.\nI absolutely don't recommend this game, its just a waste of your money.","December 21, 2013","false","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game took 20 hours to beat and was as boring as watching a box of rocks, I was only able to overcome the shear pain of playing by filling out paperwork (Work Related) or by actually playing another game (handheld/phone) while this one was running. When you first start off in the game you have to do all the work yourself, which is just driving vehicles to and from the planes in a timely fashion, and the idea is that you will make money and hire workers so you dont have too do the tasks. In the end you will have a task that you must complete on average every 15min, the rest of the time the airport runs itself. I do not see how this game can ever be enjoyable to anyone! UIG (creators/publisher/whatever) needs to be taken off of Steam, there games are simply crap, and should never had made it past steam's quality control.

I thought, I might give this game a try. I really enjoy simulation games, but this one is crap. It's really crap. Gameplay itself is not that crappy, but the engine is totally messed up.\n\n- I got two gates operating with one plane each. The empty bus at plane 1 could simply unload plane 2. But it has to return to its parking lot first, otherwise plane 1 can not lift of. That itself would not be a great problem if all of the vehicles weren't THAT incredibly slow. So I drive across the airport for like an eternity to park my bus, just to make sure my plane 1 can start, and THEN drive back again to plane 2, that stands RIGHT BESIDES PLANE 1. Sigh...\n\n- Last part before starting a plane is to pull it from terminal to starting lane. So that's a great idea. Unfortunately the puller-car doesn't pull the plane at all. I parked it right where the game told me to, then drove of to the destination point... and the plane remained, where it was. Well... I tried, what I could do about that. And I ended up with pushing the plane all the way across the airport. Yet it has not arrived in its destination, but my car got stuck under the engine. Sigh...\n\n- You can buy employees to operate the vehicles. One at a time, three speeds each. I was happy to see the first vehicle operate by itself. It started its mission, drove off to the plane... and kept on driving... and driving... and driving... DAMMIT, these cars are SO DAMN SLOW! It might get faster, the better you upgrade them. But one step one it's another thing that takes forever. Did I mention, that the vehicles drive ultimately slow? Sigh...\n\n- Oh, and I accidently parked the car you can use to explore the airport somewhere wrong. On a road. It was wrong because the AI wasn't able to navigate around it. When it met my car, they had a quick "bump" and then the AI stopped. It didn't even try to drive around. OR EVEN PUSH IT AWAY! It just stood there and looked unsatisfied. But didn't even notice me about that problem. Wonder what happened if I didn't look after that one... Sigh...\n\nBut well... in fact you can play it. If you get it started. And it doesn't stop while playing. And you don't get stuck. And there are no bugs that keep you from winning. And if you really enjoy to see planes leaping across the airport, right after you pushed them with your luggage-car. That was fun to see. But in fact it was a bit... disappointing, regarding to where the plane was intended to be. Sigh...","January 31, 2014","false","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's someone's 3D model of an airport with planes that land and take off, and all you really do is watch them do it.

A simulator would likely allow you to get inside the vehicles you drive, or even go inside the buildings. This dosent do much. Certain aspects are broken. Like taking the plane taxi and moving the plane in place for takeoff. On my first try I flipped the plane several times. In order to move the plane you have to ram the wheels. Yes ram a airplane full of passengers which can cause a flip. If it was real life there would be no survivors. Another thing is when you first get in its very confusing and you get lost in certain aspects pretty quick. A simulator is expected to be like the real world. This dosent even come close. You technically dont hire people at all. You make upgrades which actually are helpers which actually do all the driving for you. Once you get to a certain point, the game literally plays itself. You dont have to do anything except tell the planes what gate to go. What would make a airplane simulator fun would allow you to build buildings, put in shops and organize how your main buildings process new custormers, buy airplanes, hire employees for various jobs, and even design your airstrips. This game has none of that and cannot be recommended. Out of 5 I give this game a 1.5.

Maybe it is because of the mindless tasks you need to fullfill or the soothing music, but one of the game producers is called Insomnia, which should give some hint to how much it will demand from the gamer.\n\nThe graphics are rather good and the music is excellent, though very repetative since it's only 1 or 2 tracks. You are in charge of the loading, unloading, fueling, repairing and pushing back airplanes at an airport. This is easier than it sounds, since all you have to do is drive vehicles to their marked parking spots next to the airplane, at their (un)loading docks or garage. With the exception of the cargo loader for cargo planes and the taxi used to push an airplane from the gate to the taxi strip, the occasional upgrading of vehicles so that not you but an NPC gets to those jobs and assigning a recently landed aircraft to a gate there really isn't all that much you can do.\n\nI found it addictive though, and with a little program called Voice Attack I don't even have to touch my mouse / keyboard unless I assigned an airplane to a gate which has no NPC's. Ow yes, almost forgot, the cargo loader for cargo airplanes cannot be automated, so at least you can do that manually.\n\nIt still has a lot of potential and a future version 2015 or 2016 I wouldn't mind playing. I recommend this only because I have fallen slave to it, but I think most people would rather play something where you actually have to DO something.","August 21, 2015","true","37.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'll give you the negative points first; The video settings, no matter what aspect ratio and/or resolution I set the game to I could not for the life of me get it to show me the full game screen in fullscreen mode. Instead, I was forced to play in windowed mode, which was irritating. The game crashed a total of 3 times in the span on 4 hours. The fixed view from the control tower has blind spots due to where it is located, and if you preselect units which are almost completed with their tasks, you run the risk of the game bugging out and being made to sit and wait a long, long time before the next objective becomes available. I should also mention there is no tutorial, you are thrown in head first to figure it out as you go.\n\nSounds like a lot of negative right? It is, but this game for some weird reason was also very addictive. Once I got over the initial shock of not having a tutorial, I got into a nice rhythm and within about 4 or 5 hours I had upgraded all 8 gates at least once and was working on the second level upgrades. My airport was essentially running itself by that point. I had a lot of fun with it and while it does have it's negative drawbacks, it can still be a lot of fun to play. I would recommend this game to someone, only after they have reviewed each of the negative points I made and went into this game cognizant of what to expect.","July 18, 2015","true","22.8"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","10","23","3","0"

Spots with arrows to you goals are in the "world" but not a compass in HUD i so it can be quite hard to find your goal. I gave up after an hour when I could not find the goal to transport my passengers that I unloaded from a plane to a bus. Even after zooming out as far as I could and using the tower view, I could not see it. THen in frustration I drove the bus on the runway to see what would happen when I got in front of a plane taxiing. The plane kept going, bounced my bus into an underground "glitch" and the bus fell into a twighlight zone hundreds of feet under the runway.

I believe they thought it was a flight simulator.  IT IS NOT...  It is an Airport simulator.  You have to manage an airport.  There is no flying involved in managing an airport, but there is a lot of running around.  Airport Simulator is a lot like The Sims.  If you don't like The Sims, you won't like Airport Simulator.  Maybe if you look at airport simulator for what it is, you might enjoy it more.  It is entertaining to solve the puzzles, while all the time trying to keep up with the traffic in and out of your airport.  But I can understand those not liking the game because they just do not like the tedious tasks involved with running an airport.  You probably find it boring while I consider it a challenge.

My shift began at 10 A.M, and the airport seemed to be a ghost town. It didn't take long before the first plane landed. The luggage collector's speed was limited at 20 km/h, and I soon found out that all of my vehicles were. The previous maintenance crew must've had it's reasons and after a while, I didn't mind it all. I decided to declare the airport "Valium International Airport", turned on some yacht rock and drove away into the sun, towards gate 3. Many days later, I invented robots and the airport was under the control of an A.I. hive. And me? I watched from the control tower, smoked cigarettes and drank coffee.

It's actually quite fun and educational if you take the time to read the infos on why you drive the vehicles around the airport. To be fair, this is a simulation of airport operations not driving experience so it's to be expected that vehicle handling is only an approximation. That said, vehicle handling is quite distinct between vehicle types. The cute baggage transporter is a little skittish compared to its bigger sibling the cargo transporter for example and this is compounded with the fact that it uses a swivel junction point. OK enough about vehicle handling as this is not a driving simulator but suffice to say the overall handling is quite pleasant and the zoomable rotational camera makes it easy to look around to see where you need to go.\n\nSpecific implementation	 As the name imply, this game depicts quite well the scope of ground operations needed to support aircraft servicing requirements. Having said that, the representation of airport operations are somewhat simplified ; not that i know anything about it in real life. Simplification is both good and bad. IMO this level of simulation could be called basic to intermediate.\n\nExample\nBasic model\nYou drive the refuelling vehicle from parking bay to aircraft. Refuelling is fully automated. You drive the vehicle back to the bay on completion of refuelling.\n\nDetail model\nYou manually start & stop the refuelling operation waiting for the tank to fill-up. Close valves and drive the vehicle back to parking bay. Tanker needs to refuel ballast from either ground storage or wait for scheduled fuel suppliers to replenish fuel stocks.\n\nThe same goes for other operations like transporting catering supplies to & from aircraft. No provision is made for stock resupply or cost. Especially cost. Nowhere in this simulator is cost a concern. You crash a vehicle, no repair cost, you tip a plane no penalty or fine. Like i said this is both good and bad. To fully simulate airport operations in fine detail would probably need a 6 core, 12 threads CPU with 32 GB RAM at least.\n\nSummation - Unfinshed Business Back to what is at hand. There is no human traffic anywhere within the boundary of operations save the drivers. Passengers embarking and disembarking are not shown for example but this is alright unless the game simulate congestion or delays. In a nutshell Airport Simulator 2014 only focuses on ancillary vehicle operations in relation to aircraft needs. No other aspects of airport management are simulated like operational costs, resource cost, commercial income, stocks resupply schedule and other staffing requirements besides ground handling crew. I've not put sufficient hours into this game to comment on execution bugs if any but 2 things clearly indicate lack of completion. One is the lack of graphic customizations; you're only given 5 levels of general settings, 5 being the highest. Two is the inability to pull the aircraft across the tarmac using the taxi / towing behemoth; not sure if this is the case in real life but i would expect at least a coupling and de-coupling function before & after taxiing manoeuvres. But this is minor, it should be possible to complete the game if savegames can be backed-up.\n\nFinal score  7/10 Reminiscent of Transport Tycoon","January 16, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","3","12","2","0"

E.g. the vehicle with the stairs on it to let the passengers out, the bus to take them to the main building, the repair vehicles and so on. You then have to wait lots of real time for them to perform their tasks. You can't speed time up, so have fun rotating the screen or driving the little utility vehicle that doesn't do anything round the airport, slowly, while you wait.\n\nThere's not even any passengers to see, so you feel like you're just playing with toy cars.\n\nAlso there seems to be no on-screen notification that a plane has landed (at which point you need to assign it to a gate) so if you're deaf like me that could be a problem.\n\nAdd to this some difficulties starting the game up and shutting it down and you have the perfect gift... for a person you don't like.","February 8, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","2"

Just finished the game, the ending really is somewhat disappointing but it's what it is. I will admit, by the time you get all of the gates with level 2 vehicles the game is 30 times slower , that was the point when I had to get a speed hack. Never thought I would, but it was that or 30 more hours playing , and when I say playing I mean driving the cargo from plane, to storage, to garage, because that's really it once you have every single thing automated.","December 28, 2013","true","15.4"," 5 of 28 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","5","28","0","0"

If you approach the game from the expectation that it's a cheap crappy sim, you won't be disappointed.\nA few bugs here and there (including some planes landing/taking off being full volume and in mono), extremely annoying and pointless generic upbeat background music, and quite stupid AI.\nGameplay is insanely slow and boring (it's realtime) unless you use speedhack at 2x in CheatEngine.\nUltimately nowhere near a full Airport simulator, and is an enjoyable timewaster despite annoying bugs.

I have always been a huge fan of everything aircraft related, I even worked at an airport for a time.  This "game" was more tedious than any day I ever worked.  Very slow pace, very boring gameplay.  Laughable controls as you move each service vehicle to and from the aircraft, one...at...a...........time.\n\nAnd as I was almost finished servicing the first aircraft, I thought to myself, "I think I will cheat some cash to automate this crap."  Yep, thinking about cheating to automate a game in less than one hour because it was so boring.  Not a good sign.\n\nControlling the different vehicles is a matter of using the up arrows.  Everything moves at the same slow pace, turning is unrealistic, no damage models, of course.\n\nThe gameplay is simply telling the plane where to park.  Then you move the ramp to the plane.  Move the stairs, move the bus, move the cleanign crew, move the maintenance crew, move the caterer, move each one back on at a time.  Repeat on the next plane....and the next...and the next...\n\nWas it worth the $7.49 I paid?  Hell to the no.

You drive vehicles poorly.  Looks nice. Could be used as part of a prison sentence.\n\nI read all of the reviews and decided to install the game anyway.  How do I describe this game . . . It is the most boring game I have ever played in my life.  Here's the game:\n1) Decide which Gate to land a plane at.\n2) Drive a number of vehicles to a location at the airport.  Easy, but confusing as the location might not be apparent, and can be blocked by the environment.  This was like a scavenger hunt.  A boring, painful, punishment-like hunt.\n3) Buy some upgraded vehicles.\n4) Rinse and repeat.\n\nI got it as part of a bundle, so I'm not sure what I paid.  Was it worth the minimal amount I paid?  Sure.  Would I play the game again.  No.  It looks nice - but you can't change the livery on the planes or redesign your airport . . . So I don't really think its an airport simulator.

After purchasing Airport Simulator 2014 and sinking about 23 hours in it, I felt highly disappointed for the following reasons:\n\n- There is only ONE airport that you can play with, it has 8 gates and when those are filled there's a nice queue of 5 aircraft so you'll never run out. They never start moaning about the waiting times either, keep that in mind for the next point.\n\n- You can drive 12 vehicles around the apron. You only get one of each and many aircraft need the same vehicles at a time. This could get a bit hectic, if it wasn't for the patience of the waiting pilots. Just drive your vehicle from gate 1 to gate 2, and maybe to 3 and 4 as well, just to make your time deadlines, then get back over at gate 1 and do the actual work etc.\n\n- This all gains you small bits of "money", and a good sum when a processed aircraft takes off, which you can then use to hire drivers for 11 of the vehicles, for each gate specific. Funny, as these drivers come with their own vehicles, so gates don't have to share a single vehicle anymore. Drivers come in three skill levels, you start with the slow ones and go up to the faster ones. (Yet the vehicles still drive at the same pace!) The 12th vehicle is a cargo container loading platform, there is no driver available for that so you have to keep doing this until the end of times.\n\n- After earning enough "money" to upgrade all your drivers, you get a "Well done!" message, saying that your drivers are now fully automated and you can either return to the main menu or keep playing to load/unload cargo planes.\n\n- There is no way of expanding your terminals (you only have one, and it disappears after a while!) or extending your runways. It is however advertized as such in the game description in the Steam store. False advertizing!\n\nConclusion: think I am going to make a couple of screenshots and then use the false advertising as reason to ask for a refund. I strongly suggest you do not buy this game.","January 19, 2014","false","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Assets randomly disappear (like the entire terminal building!) and the inability to hire a minion to drive the cargo carrier makes sequencing cargo planes a nightmare, they just clog up the gates.  While not truly simulation behaviour, the game should be more aware of what is going on, you can end up with very long periods of nothing to do as you have gates available but no planes are landing are you are waiting for your existing planes to finish loading or taxi away.\n\nFeels like a beta, the elements are there but there is little polish.","January 4, 2014","false","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I honestly feel like an idiot for paying anything, let alone $15 for this.\n\nThe main issue that has made me throw up my hands and say "I'm done." is the bugs. It came to a point where I literally could not continue playing the game because of a bug with the Tunnels, or Aerobridges as they're probably better know as. Upon looking at the community hub this is a widespread issue with the only fix being crashing another vehicle into the bugged tunnel and hoping to dislodge it.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the vast majority is literally driving aircraft service vehicles (eg. Catering Trucks, Tugs, etc.) from point A to point B, leaving them there for several minutes then driving them back to point A. While the coordination of this to get planes in the air again as quickly as possible did get me to use my head at times, the lack of variation and visible rewards really kill any prospect of this being a game you'll ever touch again after a day or two.\n\nPricewise I'd say if you were -absolutely- desperate to experience the badness of this game, do not pay a cent more than $5 and thats probably being way too generous.\n\nWhile I am legitimately interested in the goings-on of airports and really would absolutely love to see a simulation game that can truly reflect the experience, this is not it. This is a half-baked, ♥♥♥♥ weak abomination made by people who, judging by this product, seem to have no respect whatsoever for fans of the simulation genre or gamers generally.\n\nAvoid this "game" like the plague, seriously.","January 5, 2014","false","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I honestly feel like an idiot for paying anything, let alone $15 for this.\n\nThe main issue that has made me throw up my hands and say "I'm done." is the bugs. It came to a point where I literally could not continue playing the game because of a bug with the Tunnels, or Aerobridges as they're probably better know as. Upon looking at the community hub this is a widespread issue with the only fix being crashing another vehicle into the bugged tunnel and hoping to dislodge it.\n\nIn terms of gameplay the vast majority is literally driving aircraft service vehicles (eg. Catering Trucks, Tugs, etc.) from point A to point B, leaving them there for several minutes then driving them back to point A. While the coordination of this to get planes in the air again as quickly as possible did get me to use my head at times, the lack of variation and visible rewards really kill any prospect of this being a game you'll ever touch again after a day or two.\n\nPricewise I'd say if you were -absolutely- desperate to experience the badness of this game, do not pay a cent more than $5 and thats probably being way too generous.\n\nWhile I am legitimately interested in the goings-on of airports and really would absolutely love to see a simulation game that can truly reflect the experience, this is not it. This is a half-baked, ♥♥♥♥ weak abomination made by people who, judging by this product, seem to have no respect whatsoever for fans of the simulation genre or gamers generally.\n\nAvoid this "game" like the plague, seriously.","January 5, 2014","false","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You repeat the same tasks over and over to service planes, and once you upgrade all the gate equipment, its mostly all automated so there is really nothing to do.  There is no management and business options for the expansions of terminals and runways as promised by the developer.  There is only one possible airport to "manage" and there is no ability to build or run any of it except for basic gate operations.\n\nI played for a while because it sort of was a stress reducer and easy game, but then I encoutered bugs that prevented my from going forward such as poor vehicle physics and concurrent cargo planes that got stuck at the gates and would not let me unload them.  The game gives you one mission, which is to upgrade all the equipment at all eight gates to level 3 using money you earn from servicing planes.  There are no challenges, no random events, no real strategy, and no tutorial for just starting out.  Additionally, the graphics are crude and there are no people ever visible in the entire airport except for the drivers of vehicles.\n\nI really think an airport simulator could be a great game if it could be done right.  Managing gates, terminals, shops, parking, traffic, runways, security, and air traffic control could present a truly emmersive real-time strategy game.  This game shows little to no effort to attempt to capture such a strategy.  I want a game that does gate/traffic management like a SimCity, internal terminal economics/traffic like rollercoaster tycoon (every ride is a gate), and vehicular traffic and parking management like Cities in Motion.

Also there are plenty of glitches.\n\nThe game pretends to offer the challenge of managing an airport, but once you get into the game it turns out that you are presented with the series of tasks that goes into servicing a plane on turnaround, this i done on a time limit and you are payed for each completed task and fined for breaking the timelimit.\nSo far so good, this could have developed into something if additional complexity was added - but it turns out that the next step is to begin servicing the next plane at the next gate. In time you can purchase "assistants" to perform tasks at the gates. Doing this automates the task, and ensures that it is performed slowly enough to incur fines, without there being any way to help things along.\n\nAfter a few hours I was wondering when things would change, and a quick peek in the forums revealed to me that they wouldn't.... So basically you will be less and less involved in the tasks, and eventually you will have hired assistants for every function.\n\nAmazingly this is done without ever giving you any sort of real gameplay...","January 26, 2014","false","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sanity check here;\n- You drive everything back to the respective garage;\n- You upgrade (hire assistants - no more driving) everything.\n\nThat`s all. After a while you will probably upgrade everything and win the game (I have not survived more than 30 minutes, so I have no idea of what would be this "end").\n\nCan STEAM refund? lol\n\n","January 26, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You repeat the same tasks over and over to service planes, and once you upgrade all the gate equipment, its mostly all automated so there is really nothing to do.  There is no management and business options for the expansions of terminals and runways as promised by the developer.  There is only one possible airport to "manage" and there is no ability to build or run any of it except for basic gate operations.\n\nI played for a while because it sort of was a stress reducer and easy game, but then I encoutered bugs that prevented my from going forward such as poor vehicle physics and concurrent cargo planes that got stuck at the gates and would not let me unload them.  The game gives you one mission, which is to upgrade all the equipment at all eight gates to level 3 using money you earn from servicing planes.  There are no challenges, no random events, no real strategy, and no tutorial for just starting out.  Additionally, the graphics are crude and there are no people ever visible in the entire airport except for the drivers of vehicles.\n\nI really think an airport simulator could be a great game if it could be done right.  Managing gates, terminals, shops, parking, traffic, runways, security, and air traffic control could present a truly emmersive real-time strategy game.  This game shows little to no effort to attempt to capture such a strategy.  I want a game that does gate/traffic management like a SimCity, internal terminal economics/traffic like rollercoaster tycoon (every ride is a gate), and vehicular traffic and parking management like Cities in Motion.  I would pay $49.99 for such a game, but please do not pay for this game.","January 7, 2014","false","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the most boring game I have ever played in my life.  Here's the game:\n1) Decide which Gate to land a plane at.\n2) Drive a number of vehicles to a location at the airport.  Easy, but confusing as the location might not be apparent, and can be blocked by the environment.  This was like a scavenger hunt.  A boring, painful, punishment-like hunt.\n3) Buy some upgraded vehicles.\n4) Rinse and repeat.\n\nI got it as part of a bundle, so I'm not sure what I paid.  Was it worth the minimal amount I paid?  Sure.  Would I play the game again.  No.  It looks nice - but you can't change the livery on the planes or redesign your airport . . . So I don't really think its an airport simulator.

This was a very bad idea. If you still for some reason are considering buying this game, spoilers are ahead.\n\nThe game consists of the following features:\n1. Wating for planes to arrive at your airport, which occurs somewhere on the order of once every 15-20 minutes. No, you cannot speed up time until the next flight arrives. No, there is nothing even remotely entertaining to do while you wait.\n2. Driving various airport vehicles from their respective parking spots to the airplane and back. Cargo trucks, maintenance vehicles, cleaning services, and even your own personal game! Honestly, the game makes it seem like it's going to be incredibly difficult to fulfill all the airport roles by yourself but it takes only a few minutes to move around vehicles that then take ten minutes to complete their respective jobs. On top of that, you can't even do anything fun with the vehicles because most of them are incredibly slow at max speed.\n3. Waiting for planes to mysteriously decide to leave the gate after an arbitrarily decided amount of time that you have no notification of whatsoever. After you finish "servicing" the plane, it waits in the gate for some time before randomly departing.\n\nThis game is easily the most disappointing title in my entire library. Please do not buy this game.","October 9, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are my negative points:\n- The gameplay is too slow (you have to go 5 minutes just pressing W to ride your super slow car to a spot where a plane just appeared out of nowhere).\n- The game is not very much fun to play. All the vehicles in the game need to be rode (I'm not a native english speaker so this may be wrong, past perfect of "to ride")to the same place, which makes it à very repetitive expoerience\n- For fun I drove two cars into eachother. In the end the cars leaned against eachother, with the weels off the ground so I couldn't move anymore. I had to quit and restart. Then I noticed another thing:\n- The game doesn't have an autosave feature, so I had to start all over again.\n\nConclusionAll in all I really have respect for the guy who modeled it all, because The 3D world looks very nice. The game designers have to make the game, eevn if it is a simulator, a lot more fun to play, because I couldn't set myself to playing it longer than half an hour. I got it in a Humble Bundle, so I didn't really waste my money, but if you consider buying this for a full price, Please Don't.

Requires some clever analysis of the game logic to understand how to avoid the penalties. Really cool game once you understand what its all about. All tasks in themselves are small and boring but have 20 of them going on at the same time, then managing gets tricky and really addictive.\nFor example one of the cornerstone of this sim is the question, how do you fuel three airplanes simultaniously with one fuel truck that can only be at one place at a time without being late anywhere nor busting any deadlines. Yes it is possible and it is intended that you figure this trick out and thats where things get interesting.\n\nFinally DO NOT upgrade all your gates to level 1 because at that moment you have killed the game - you have nothing to do anymore. Instead keep 3-4 gates always to yourself and upgrade the rest. Also avoid level 1 upgrades. The wrkers are unbeliveabely slow. So always upgrade a station to atleast level 2. Once 4-5 gates are all level 3, you can start upgrading the gates you kept for your self. The upgrading of the last gate is however always painfully bodring and slow.

It's quite simple: Yet Another Crappy German Simulator.\n\nI don't know what it is with German developers and their obsession with simulation games, but I understand even less why they think releasing buggy pieces of utter crap like this is fine. Maybe it's because Valve doesn't really care and lets them get away with it.\n\nAirport Simulator 2014 is just plain awful. Everything is so slow, you'd think it's Dear Esther on wheels. The graphics look like they're from the early 2000's, and pop in so slowly after loading a saved game that it takes a minute to show everything... *IF* you end up getting everything shown, that is. During my playtime, half of the assets suddenly disappeared, and reloading a previous save file or restarting the game didn't fix it. All the terminals were gone, leaving only the gates to hang in mid-air. The river in the background dried up mysteriously as well for some reason. Actually, this is helping you because the buildings no longer hide the arrows which tell you where your snails on wheels are supposed to crawl to.\n\nThen there are the bugs. For no apparent reasons, the tunnels suddenly begin to move on their own, rolling back and forth as if they were possessed by ghosts. While it is amusing to watch them slowly clip through the gates, it becomes rather aggravating when you're supposed to deploy them because that's no longer possible then. This, however, is one of the few things which gets fixed with a reload... sometimes, that is.\n\nEverything happens in real-time. When the game tells you that a plane needs to be repaired for 20 minutes, it will indeed take 20 minutes of real time to be done, and it's the same with every task. Thus on average, a plane will take up about 1 hour of your time to be fully handled.\n\nEventually, you have earned enough money to hire so-called helpers. These move even slower, though, but at least you don't have to babysit them constantly as the pathfinding works surprisingly well. Each time a plane takes off again, you receive a nice bonus which lets you hire more helpers until everything is automated.\n\nAnd that's the major problem of the game.

It's quite simple: Yet Another Crappy German Simulator.\n\nI don't know what it is with German developers and their obsession with simulation games, but I understand even less why they think releasing buggy pieces of utter crap like this is fine. Maybe it's because Valve doesn't really care and lets them get away with it.\n\nAirport Simulator 2014 is just plain awful. Everything is so slow, you'd think it's Dear Esther on wheels. The graphics look like they're from the early 2000's, and pop in so slowly after loading a saved game that it takes a minute to show everything... *IF* you end up getting everything shown, that is. During my playtime, half of the assets suddenly disappeared, and reloading a previous save file or restarting the game didn't fix it. All the terminals were gone, leaving only the gates to hang in mid-air. The river in the background dried up mysteriously as well for some reason. Actually, this is helping you because the buildings no longer hide the arrows which tell you where your snails on wheels are supposed to crawl to.\n\nThen there are the bugs. For no apparent reasons, the tunnels suddenly begin to move on their own, rolling back and forth as if they were possessed by ghosts. While it is amusing to watch them slowly clip through the gates, it becomes rather aggravating when you're supposed to deploy them because that's no longer possible then. This, however, is one of the few things which gets fixed with a reload... sometimes, that is.\n\nEverything happens in real-time. When the game tells you that a plane needs to be repaired for 20 minutes, it will indeed take 20 minutes of real time to be done, and it's the same with every task. Thus on average, a plane will take up about 1 hour of your time to be fully handled.\n\nEventually, you have earned enough money to hire so-called helpers. These move even slower, though, but at least you don't have to babysit them constantly as the pathfinding works surprisingly well. Each time a plane takes off again, you receive a nice bonus which lets you hire more helpers until everything is automated.\n\nAnd that's the major problem of the game. By the time you have upgraded 4 gates, you won't have anything to do anymore because there's nothing left apart from driving around in a van which has no other function. This would be alright if you were able to advance time, but nope, there's no such option. You are now doomed to sit there and twiddle your thumbs while waiting for the money to roll in.\n\nIf you have masochistic tendencies, you might enjoy this game. Everybody else shouldn't bother getting this.\n\nSeriously, when a Simulator is developed by a "GmbH" (German for "Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung", which means "company with limited liability"), stay away from it.
