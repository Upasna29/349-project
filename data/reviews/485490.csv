Dungeon Journey is a cousin of Rune Stone Keeper and Dungelot and that's a very goodthing. Unlike the previous games however some reflexes are required. When a monster attacks you need to hit the space bar at the right time to minimize damage.\n\nThe game clearly looks like it is made for phones. I don't mind what the platform is as long as the game play is fun. The graphics are quite nice and the game has a fun sense of humor. There are two endless dungeon areas that will be unlocked on your journey. You are faced with some interesting choices as you delve deeper. Not sure what that spell does? Right click it and you get the skinny on it. Your character levels up but remember that this is a roguelike so don't get too attached.\n\nIt's no epic journey like Legend of Grimrock or the classic Dungeon Keeper. Rather, it's a fun game to fire up when you just want some simple fun.","June 4","true","1.0"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","3"

Frankly its a lot better than some of the casual games that I have paid up to $15 for! a worthy effort indeed for just over a dollar!","June 4","true","5.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
