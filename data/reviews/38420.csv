Being a huge fan of the series I still gave this game a try and I wasn't dissapointed to say the least.\n\nFallout Tactics, like the name already says, is a tactical game in the Fallout universe. You start by creating your main character and give him/her the skills you prefer. You start out with 2 other squad members and as the game progresses your squad members level up so you can adjust their skills like all (PC) Fallout games. After each mission you enter the worldmap to go to different locations like you're bunker where you can recruit new squad members and/or buy/sell equipment. Squad members can ofcourse die and won't return (unless you load your savegame).\n\nWhat sets Fallout Tactics apart from other tactical games for me:\n1. The variety of enemies. Sometimes you'll be battling Bugs, the other time you will be facing Super Mutants and several other enemies I won't name here (spoilers). Every enemy calls for a different approach.\n2. The variety of missions. Sometimes you will have to rescue people, sometimes you have to do an escort mission. Also in most missions you've got a vehicle at your disposal.\n3. The variety of weapons. Fallout Tactics has a huge range of weapons, both realistic and unrealistic but they all fit in the game nicely.\n4. The use of skills in a game. Lockpicking, Healing, Defusing... it's all there.\n5. Different 'races'. Your squad may also contain different kinds of races like ghouls and Super Mutants. All of them ofcourse have their own speciality/skills.\n6. Gameplay. The tactical combat just works really well in this game as a tactical game should obviously. Everytime you make a clean kill feels very good.\n7. Graphics. The graphics have aged very well in my opinion. Blood and gore is ofcourse included and every kill feels satisfying.\n8. Last but not least; The Fallout universe.\n\nSimply put in my opinion Fallout Tactics is still the best tactical game out there. Although I have to admit it's partially due the Fallout universe. I have played the XCOM series and Jagged Alliance and this game is still number 1 in my book.","October 14, 2014","true","0.4"," 133 of 152 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","133","152","3","0"

XCOM would then attend the local pub for booze and fistfights, and a shoulder to cry on, if the time proved right. There he would meet this really rad dude called Starcraft, and they'd go pick up chicks near the grocery market, and smoke blunts under the bridge with some other sketchy fellows. He'd soon fall in love with this beatiful woman named Manhunt, who he realized how bloody the world was, and he'd fall into a raging love for blood, and soon join the military before a huge tramautic nuclear war, that engulfs the world in flames, and he soon comes home to rubble, and a son named Fallout, who ingested mass amounts of Bubble Gum (containing mass amounts of Rads) to which he had to strangle the gum out of his throat, leaving his son scarred for life. Soon that son had given care to a pet lion, whom he shared many deep secrets with, and soon one day, the lion grew very suspicious of Fallout, and murdered him in his sleep, digesting his thoughts and forming into a second head, who spoke in very deep third person tones, talking about war, and how it never changes. After 20 years, Call of Duty returns and influences the lion into a quickscoping match, where the lion grows so intimidated, he vows never to return to FPS'  again, and sticks to RTS and tactical games and develops a game from the blood he cried, and it was called, "Fallout Tactics"....\n\nSeriously thought its a pretty good game.\n\n9/10","March 4, 2014","true","12.0"," 209 of 272 people (77%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","77","209","272","57","6"

Instead of towns, Fallout Tactics centers around Brotherhood bunkers and missions. The bunkers serve as a central point for the Brotherhood, and players can obtain the services of quartermasters, mechanics, personnel yeomen, and medics.\n\nCombat in Fallout Tactics is a bit more complicated than the previous two Fallout games. Unlike those, which featured an individual turn-based system, Fallout Tactics features three combat types: Continuous Turn-Based (everyone can act at the same time, and action points are regenerated at a rate based on Agility), Individual Turn-Based (used in the original games) and Squad Turn-Based (each turn is given to a squad and include the ability to change stance, modifiers for height, and setting sentry modes).\n\nFallout Tactics is also the first of the Fallout games to feature a multi-player mode.\nIn this mode, each player controls a squad of characters and faces off against opposing players. During game setup, players are granted a number of points with which to purchase squad members and gear.\n\nAlthough the main character in the single player game has to be human, recruits from the brotherhood and characters in multiplayer matches can be of any of the six races featured in the game. Humans, Super Mutants, Ghouls, Deathclaws, Dogs or Humanoid Robots.","June 5, 2015","true","20.5"," 77 of 86 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","77","86","4","0"

The reasons behind this are political and moral as the West Coast Brotherhood are technology hoarders that want little to do with the people of the wastes, which conflicts with certain ideals. Thus creating a "Mid-Western"-esc Brotherhood.\n\nYou are introduced as an up and coming recruit for this new Brotherhood and take control of a new squad; With the sole purpose of completing objectives for the Brotherhood to expand it, and to later unravel the mysteries of the infamous "Vault 0".\n\nFallout Tactics focuses heavily on the "tactial" portions of their six-man-squad combat, rather than Fallout 1 and Fallout 2's open world RPG elements. The open world in Tactics has nothing much to offer other than some random encounters and the locations which are only unlocked via missions making it kind of underwhelming. Also Tactics suffers from a majority of its plot being linear, with the only real decision making being toward the end of the game.\n\nThis game however, is an extremely well crafted action-based tactial shooter with small amounts of RPG elements sprinkled into it and is a good change of pace from the previous iterations. Some of the missions that I played, were truly difficult and required a hefty amount of thinking power to push through them.\n\nI had a tremendously fantastic time with this Fallout, and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the series or to anyone who enjoys cRPGs.","August 4, 2015","true","66.7"," 57 of 61 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","57","61","3","0"

As far as the actual game goes, I don't really recall much of a story line, I don't think it really claims to have one either, it's more managing your characters and setting up combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/38420/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Squad-based tactical game in the universe of Fallout, with post-nuclear war havoc reigns the world, and you have to fight the hordes of Chaos in the name of Order. To be precise, you gotta kill much in the name of Brotherhood of Steel. But I guess you've figured that out by yourself, simple by reading the name of the game. I'll say even more of obvious things now, so for those who are short-in-temper for reading, I suggest to skip to the bottom right away.\n\nI remember that at time when it was released, the plenty of critics were against it. They were very angry with that approach on beloved universe of Fallout 1&2, which ruined one of the brightest RPG experience ever... That was common thought back than.\n\nNow it's 2016 year, it's been 15 years after game's release. What's the situation now, why there are so many positive reviews on Steam, why people still enjoying the game, that was almost completely sinked after release? There are two main answers: first, it is still branded as Fallout game, even if the story is not "canonical". Classic nonetheless, as people say. Now, the second reason... surprisingly, it is a fair tactical game! Certainly not the best in the genre, but hey! - all good games in that "tactical" genre you can count with your fingers! Every working approach there worth its money!\n\nCertainly, Fallout Tactics is not for everyone. If you don't like games where you need to clear levels from enemies in the quite slow-paced turn-by-turn style, just pass by. And even if you are good with turn-based combats, in the most cases, I'd recommend you to buy and play Wasteland 2 instead. It is providing much better experience for much wider auditory.\n\nFallout Tactics has many downsides. The story tastes... not fresh, and even not-satisfying. The battle system is good, but not calculated enough. The worst part of it is moving in turn-based mode: the maps are big, and your legs are quite short! What's even worse, the bugs with way-mapping still there, just like I remember them from 2001 year. The skills and all other SPECIAL system from the original Fallout also not fitting in, considering the fact it is not a proper RPG, but rather a "shoot'em all" pattern turn-based combat simulator.\n\nBut... all of those minuses are manageble, if you have some temper and will. All but one, the final of the story there is way worse than in the Fallout 3. So, even strongest by will cannot really vouch for replayablity in that game. Unless they are not bothering with the story at all.\n\nMultiplayer could be a mind-blowing thing, but no. Not even the possibility to ride deathclaws can fix some real difficulties with combat system and the possibility to connect with other players (its LAN only now, servers are gone)... Simply put, there is no fun. You'd be much better with XCom Enemy Unknown multiplayer, by any reason.\n\nSo. Why you can buy that game? Obviously, the main reason, for it goes in the bundle with the main games, Fallout 1&2. I even remember some events when the keys for that trio (F1, F2 and F tactics) were distributed free of charge...\n\nWhy play it? Well, if you have a thing for turn-based squad tactical games, with lots of guns, and big maps filled with all the menagerie of Wasteland... Give the game a shot, it is worth one. Like I already said, there are too few of decent squad-based tactical games, to turn up your nose against it.\n\nMy rating is 69/100, for I forget nothing.","January 24","true","93.2"," 59 of 69 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","59","69","6","0"

With this shift in basic gameplay most rpg aspects from the two first Fallout instalments have been removed, e.g. sequence of missions is fixed and linear, no cities, limited exploration and character dialogues.\n\nOne of the greatest changes is the introduction of the squad-based combat system, which gives you complete control of each member of your party (up to 6 members). With each story-related mission, you can pick up additional team members with different talents, allowing you to customize your team to suit your preferred tactical approach.\n\nIn addition you have the possibility of the continuous turn-based (ctb) combat mode, which for the most part should be called real-time mode. From a strategic viewpoint the game lives up to its title, in providing a captivating tactical gameplay with several ways to successfully complete each mission.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThe fan community has released one mod called Redux (hosted on No Mutants Allowed), that fixes most problems of the game.

Bear in mind my review is that of a rank amateur, but someone who has played this particular game all the way through several times, on Steam and off.\n\nIf there is anyone else out there like me, someone who doesn't enjoy fast-paced first-person shooter games but still wants a *little* bit of real-time pressure on your game play, this is a great game for that. The learning curve is pretty short, considering this type of game was unfamiliar to me. The post-apocalyptic setting is at time humorous and never takes itself  too seriously. By today's standards the animation is a little clunky, and graphics processing a bit cumbersome.\n\nThis was possibly the first game I've ever played where friendly fire was a real danger. At first it was frustrating that I couldn't expect my PC's to shoot around each other, but then it simply became a natural part of the tactical challenge. (Why would I ever realistically expect NOT to be injured when someone standing right behind me opens up with a .50 cal in my direction?)\n\nFor anyone working on third-person sequels to this: please do something about the ladders and stairs.

Then this game might be for you if you are down for running a 6 man (or woman or mixed) team of soldiers in retaking the wasteland from the Mutants, ghouls, raiders and other enemies you meet along the way!\n\nThis game uses a large over world map that you can freely explore (ahla Fallout 1 and 2) and run into random encounters or just plot a point to your next objective.  Once you hit an encounter or your next objective it changes over to a 3/4th top down view of the battlefield and gives you command of your troopers.  You can either run the game in real time or in turn based (as in Fallout 1 and 2).  I've found the game much more enjoyable in the real time element.  You can for instance have a sniper climb a tower to spot enemies, then sneak a couple of other people up to either side of a door and set them to fire on anything that comes rushing out.  Once the sniper takes the first shot it's game on.\n\nHonestly the reviews when the game came out largely panned the game but I feel like it deserves better than it got.

First off I'll admit, yes, this game is WAAAAYYY different from fallout 1 &2, But not all the changes are bad, the graphics have substantially improved, and character customization is almost as strong as in the first 2 games. However, the main reason I feel this game is worth buying is because they focus on the combat. A lot of people will disagree with me, but I think combat is something the original fallout games should have focused more on. This game focuses almost entirely on it and somehow manages to pull it off. The fallout series most notable feature is its dynamic choice system, in that choices you make directly and indirectly influence the world around you. This game has very little of that, so if really want a diverse range of choices that can effect you negatively and positively, then you probably won't find much here to entertain you. Choices are very limited, at best and charisma influences nothing but your availiable recruits. This means that most of what makes up a fallout game isn't present in a fallout game, treason, I know. BUTTTTTTTTTTTTTT, the combat is so fricking awesome that I can't help but recommend this game, if you enjoy turn based or RTS combat with a touch of non-canon fallout lore, this game is definitely for you.","June 27, 2014","true","19.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

Lee Ermy. Oo ♥♥♥♥in' rahh gunney!\n\nReason number 2 - Voice acting by mother ♥♥♥♥ing Gunnery Sergeant R. Lee Ermy. Nothing gets your ♥♥♥♥ harder than Gunney Ermey giving you a mission brief!\n\nReason number 3 - Setting up a final protective line, FPL, to cut your enemies in half with a Ma Deuce, i.e. a Browning,      fully automatic, .50 caliber machine gun, firing at the cyclic rate of 500 widows per minute.... kill bodies, eat babies\n\nReason number 4 - Build the ground element of a Marine Corps air ground task force, MAGTF, this is your ♥♥♥♥in' war, wage it however you see fit, sir.... EDIT - There will unfortunately not be an air element to your MAGTF, so do a good ♥♥♥♥in' job on the ground.\n\nReason number 5 - Establish a well oiled, well greased, killing machine of a squad. You need a charismatic squad leader, you, google Fallout Tactics perks for why. (benifiting the squad is better than benefiting yourself) An 0331, Machine Gunner/heavy weapons expert, for supressive fire and severely ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥ up. An 0351, assaultman, for kicking in doors with a shotgun at the ready. An 0326, Reconaissance Marine, for gathering intel on your enemy. A Navy corpsman, Doc, to patch you up when ♥♥♥♥ goes bad. An 0311, Riflemen, Grunt, Killer, Baby Eater, Life Taker, Murderous, Evil Sum ♥♥♥♥♥, Amphibious ♥♥♥♥in' warrior, ♥♥♥♥ down the neck of a decapitated corpse, god damned life taking man.\n\nSIDE NOTE - The latter description of the 0311 really really applies to any Marine Corps MOS beginning with the numbers "03".\n\nsorry 0341's, go play cards at some other FOB.... 0352's, your in CAAT platoon, which means your on the .50, so your in. And my brother is an 0352, so I like ya'll.\n\nReason number 6 - Men run faster than women, because ♥♥♥♥ equality. This is a god damn combat simulation. Strap a 100 lb. ILBE to a woman's back, and another to a man's back, and see who moves ♥♥♥♥in' quicker\n\nReason number 7 - Orchestrating an ambush feels, and sounds, like Chopin's Nocturne in E Flat Major. It's god damn beautiful when you cut several men/super mutants/robots in half. The cacophony of machine gun fire fuses into a melodic battle hymn, as you see your enemies crumble before you.\n\nReason number 8 - Enfilade fire, when the long axis of the target coincides with the long axis of the beaten zone. the machine gunners wet dream. Google it, understand it, use it.\n\nReason number 9 -  Voice acting by Gunney Ermey....\n\nReason number 10 - You get a ♥♥♥♥in' tank....","May 6","true","2.2"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","67","22","33","22","2"

Can be played either as either Turn Based or Real Time, or better yet, a mix of the two.  I love the turn based combat from the first two Fallout games, but in this game, I generally stay in real time, or Continuous Turn Based, as they call it.  There is a ton of combat, so the CTB is much faster unless you get to a particularly hard part.  Even in the CTB there is plenty of tactics and positioning before you engage.  Having your squad sneak up behind a barrier in a crawl, then have them simultaneously pop up and burst AK47 fire and shotgun blasts into the enemies face is great fun.  Get caught off guard and find yourself swarmed, don't panic, simply hit Return and enter turn based.\n\nThe campaign is interesting, and all the leveling and character customization from the Fallout RPGs (1/2)  is here.

Not as unique or visually apealling as say, Wasteland2.\n\nAlso, you use your skills way more in Wasteland.  I havent had to pick but two locks in three missions and have used no other skills.\n\nThe Good---\n\nThere is an open map with random encounters that you are free to explore, so leveling up is done on your pace, not by game missions.\n\nThe enemies are fun to kill.\n\nWide variety of weapons.  Hitting some waste-skum with both barrels of of a shotgun is satifying. haha\n\nYou can pick between real time combat, which is insanely awkward and pointless in my opinion and two types of turnbased combat.(One member at time interspersed with enemies or your whole squad, then enemy's whole squad.)\n\nCool story line for fans of the Fallout universe.\n\nCool Fallout atmosphere with Pip-Boys, Bunkers, and Rad Scorpions.\n\nGunny does the voicework for the BoS general. haha\n\n\nSo, all considered, it is maybe unfare to compare this to Wasteland 2, as this costs ten bones and Wasteland costs thirty.

If you are a die hard fallout fan the yes insta buy this title. Otherwise just keep in mind that this is a hard and long game that can be as fun as you want it to be. It was designed to let you play through levels in a variety of styles.

Fallout Tactics is a strategy game, and unlike its forefathers, has no speech skill, no major RPG elements, and more straightforward, action based gameplay. It has a very unique story, and is so far the only Fallout game that has its setting in the Midwestern United States.\n\nFallout Tactics has voiceacted dialog, unlike Fallout 1 and 2. Fallout Tactics also offers four difficulty settings, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane. Easy is about what you would expect, easy, it makes the game very very easy and significantly more easygoing. Normal isn't much different, but it too offers a more story and action based game than the two harder difficulties. Hard is a minor step up from Normal, forcing you to play more adaptively, and sparringly with your supplies, as vendors either don't restock, or you have to complete a mission for them to, making supplies very restricted if you waste them. Insane is exactly what you would expect, insane. It's borderline impossibly hard if you play with Tough Guy Mode turned on, which I will touch on in a second. Insane mode drops your accuracy by a flat 20%, halves your average damage, curbs your chance to get criticals to extremely low, doubles enemy damage, resistence, accuracy, and worst of all, the enemy will get critical hits with frightening frequency. Strategy is everything on Insane. Your supplies become even more limited, and you will die many many many times, which makes Tough Guy even more bitter.\n\nTough Guy Mode makes it so you can only save when you are in a bunker, which makes Mission 1 extremely frustrating and bitter. You start off not in a bunker, with no autosave for the character you made, meaning if you die, you're going to have to remake your character all over again. Some people would say that's a very poor design choice, and I'm inclined to agree. Tough Guy Mode is something I have only ever played Fallout Tactics with turned on, extra difficulty and in this case, a Resident Evil style restrictive save system appeals to my nostalgia for difficulty driven older games. It's not too frustrating on all 3 of the easier difficulties, but on Insane, it's definitely going to make you angry once or twice per level, because there are going to be more than a few occassions in which you're going to either lose a character, or die and have to restart, due to bad luck with criticals or missing a shot you desperately needed to hit.\n\nFallout Tactics also comes with an editor which you can use to mod and edit the game yourself, and it's extremely well made, and isn't hard at all to learn how to use. Among the few things you can do with it, you can remedy the frustration of Mission 1 on Tough Guy Mode by checking a box in the editor that registers Mission 1 as a "bunker" which allows you to save after you make your character, open the editor, turn it off, and after that it's up to you, as you can save whenever you want for the duration of that specific save game's Mission 1, or you can save once immediately after making your character and never do it again out of honor, it's a way to alleviate the tedious nature of having to recreate your character multiple times if you're playing on a harder difficulty. The editor's readme.txt offers a fully comprehensible manual on what you need to do to use the editor, including details on what files you need to extract.\n\nThere is also a mod for Fallout Tactics that's very very similar to the Restoration Project in that it revamps a lot of the games issues and kinks, and all in all the Redux Mod, as it's called, is very well made, if albeit a bit more difficult in general, namely a few enemies are inserted into very cheap places, like corners, with weapons that have the potential to kill you instantly, and on Mission 1, with TG turned on, you can probably imagine why that will drive you crazy, which is namely what made me abuse the life out of savescumming on M1 with TG on on Insane, as both remaking my character, and the possibility of having to restart the level over and over again due to cheap enemy placement wore its welcome out very very quickly.\n\nCharisma is also a significantly more important stat than in the previous games, or maybe not, that varies on if you used to have a posse of companions in F1 and 2. Charisma in Fallout Tactics dictates how quickly you will advance in ranks in the Brotherhood of Steel, which controls the quality of goods the Brotherhood Quartermasters will have, the quality of recruits you will have access to, and also, how soon you acquire Power Armor.\n\nThe level design is more straight along a single path than previous games, and the sandbox elements are extremely limited. There is also an infamous glitch that's unavoidable in which you will get several random encounters per second, which unless you have 100% Outdoorsman, will drain your already extraordinarily finite resources, which is extremely laborous, and frustrating, as you have the potential to die during one of these, and on Tough Guy, that will send you back to your last save at a bunker. These random encounters aren't particularly unique, or fun either, as they usually consist of the same general enemies that are commonplace for that area, which can range from komodo dragons, to deathclaws, and even just a bunch of ghostly looking civilians. It can be extremely frustratingly tedious.\n\nDo I recommend this game? For people that enjoy strategy games, and even just diehard Fallout fans, definitely, it has drawbacks, and many flaws, but then again, doesn't any game?","May 10","true","324.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For a variety of reasons, some of them justified. This game wasn't designed by Black Isle, instead it was licensed off to third party studios.\n\nNow what I should state is what this game isn't. Fallout Tactics doesn't feature any towns and the game's story is mostly mission based with breaks inbetween to visit Brotherhood of steel bunkers. It also takes place in Illinois, so the original Fallout continuity is also slightly butchered.\n\nHowever, Tactics is an isometric turn based tactical shooter where you control a squad of soldiers. Your squad is entirely customizeable and all level up like you do. Later on in the game you get access to more unique party members like Super Mutants and Deathclaws. The Tactics in general are very pronounced in this game, and it is very rewarding to complete a mission.\n\nIn general I believe it mostly got hate because of the dumbed down spin off nature of the game. But if you go into it not expecting the Fallout 3 we were promised before Black Isle bit the dust, you'll find yourself a fairly decent tactical shooter for a good price.","February 27, 2013","true","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I loved Fallout 1 and 2 and I really wanted to love Fallout Tactics. It was different than previous games and have had some interesting concepts. Overall it was solid piece of game for which this review should be possitive. But it's not. Reason why is the way this game behaves on modern stronger machines. As long as you are not on world map everything is fine. Everything works correctly and exactly as I remebered it when I was playing that game ~10 years ago. What is the problem with map you might ask? Well it's simple - encounter rate is somehow related to your CPU clock or ammount of FPS.. Between Briar Woods (First Location) and Bunker Alpha I have had 15~20 random encounters. For some it might be a lot of fun but for me at that point of time it was tedious and annoying. Sorry Fallout Tactics - I will play you when I will revive my old PII/32 MB ram PC some time in future, For now if you have got modern PC - buy it at your own risk or look for mod or something that hopefully fixes that issue.","October 26, 2015","false","3.3"," 32 of 62 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","32","62","0","7"

This is how great many negative reviews start. Before I begin to point out why I am mostly disappointed with Tactics in the range of fresh impressions, I would like to mention I have played the original Fallout and its sequel for a long time before I joined STEAM. I got accustomed to them. When I saw Tactics, at first I though the graphics are acceptable to the point that if an utopian Fallout 3 was done with that visuals - yet in the manner of two earlier editions in such aspects as gameplay, plot and hex-based mechanics - I would be satisfied.\n\nUnfortunately, soon I learned that within given outlook and layout things as if blend into background, the overall picture seems a bit blurry, images of objects are too small next to being hardly distinctive - and I know how to change resolutions, as well as hopefully my eyesight is fair. Personally, I find the graphical side unfriendly.\n\nI had quite a laugh when I saw that the main characters hair, skin and peripheral elements are customizable in terms of colour. I painted my doll with light-greenish when it comes to skin, black when it comes to hair and underwear-pink when it comes to armor and other stuff. I named it UGLUK, made it a kamikaze-heavyhanded melee outdoorsman-stealth specialist. UGLUK is quite effective in bludgeoning and looting, what this game is all about, just like DIablo 2. "Tactics" is only in the title. Still, I think I would prefer the second one mentioned product in given category, nevertheless have some sentiment towards Fallout and post-nuclear themes.\n\nThe game appears to be thought by developers as swift and intuitive, but it fails here shortly. Neither "continous-turn-based" aka real-time - nor turn based combat are good. The first one is too rapid or loose to be able to carry out simultaneous complex operations within its conditions - as if these were needed at all, but still. Lack of the pause-and-command button is significantly bothersome. The other indicated combat mode feels secondary and slow, next to being more difficult.\n\nSPECIAL system looks paradoxically complicated in comparison to the dumbed-down battlescape controls, which appear as if were meant to support quick and intuitive play. It has been difficult for me to get into this aspect of Tactics. One accidental wrong click and the turn is lost for an entire squad, along with some equipment waste. Perhaps this "fragility" was to be one of the traits of the games "swiftness", unfortunately it just lowers the quality of gameplay. Besides, many options available through key shortcuts are unfeatured on the controls panel, which seem unhandy, especially if to recall the general clearness and tactical composure known from the classical two editions.\n\nSPECIAL is unproportional for a play that was supposed to be easily graspable. It carries lots of little parameters and tweaks to get into while commanding a raging squad in a run-for-the-hotkey game. The system ought to have been dumbed-down as well, but if it was, the game would become even more like Diablo sequel. But you know, perhaps Diablo 2 is a good pattern after all - at least in some cases - since it achieved a major success, unlike Fallout Tactics?\n\nI already mentioned the hex-based battlescape mechanics - characteristic for two earlier Fallout releases - that the reviewed product lacks. With the actual Tactics solution, it is usually a question where the character will ultimately stand when clicked to set off. Besides, movement is cumbersome in execution - and shines in this regard when addressed at once to an entire squad. The action - once initiated - is hard to stop. There is a hotkey to cease an ordered procedure, nevertheless it maintains to be "run for the hotkey" challenge, which this game is full of, especially in "real time" combat mode.\n\nControls, ways of characters responsivity, battlescape mechanics, adjustment of the system, image and visual clarity, legacy - instead of fluently working together for a smooth play, fall onto one another as if in a carcrash, creating an obstacle to enjoy the product that otherwise could have been pretty decent. I can hardly get rid of the sense of irony.\n\nCumbersome and unhandy - disrecommended.\n\nPS.\n\nI am okay with linear plot and lack of real dialogue - just like in case of Diablo 2. At least it should perhaps keep some stable mediocre level - better this than poor execution of overambitious goals.","June 5","false","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Encounters are different and over missions you meet more difficult opponents, from standard bandits (raiders) to super mutant and creatures like deathclaws to super robots.\n\nIf you like strategy games, especially turn based ones with quite a lot action I would recommand this game to everyone.\n\nAlso don't forget to activate secret mission in Springfield before you arrive to Bunker Gamma.","November 17, 2013","true","59.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you are a fan of the FALLOUT series then this game is a must have for your collection. If you have not bought a FALLOUT game before then please don't buy this one. I recommend buying FALLOUT 3 first then take it from there.\nGraphics are simple but works well for this mini FALLOUT game.\nSound effects are good however it will get a little repetitive after long play.\nGame play is relatively simple throughout and easy to understand. There are in-game tutorials before you begin. Control's can get a little awkward in high risk combat situations, but after a bit of practice, that is easily remedied. This version of FALLOUT has  a linear based storyline and is not as open world as the other games.\n\nThis is my first review, I hope it helped.","December 5, 2013","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Instead of being another RPG, or one of the new shooter games, this is a tactical squad based game, that tests your skills of planning, timing, and organization. You need to prove yourself as a cunning squad leader, who can lead his or her soldiers into battle, and fight to victory. You won't just be fighting raiders and mutants, there's threats in this fallout that have never been seen before, and if you're good enough, will never be seen again.  The levels in this game all seem hand crafted and thought out, almost like a puzzle, and each character you meet will be unique and flavorful. I completely recommend this game to people who enjoy tactical video games, and to those who want to see more of the fallout universe.

Fallout Tactics is more of a strategy game that puts the emphasis on realism in the fights. The elements of the combat system present in both Fallout and Fallout 2 such as the line of sight and cover have been improved. Skills like sneak or traps now have a meaning. Vehicles have more implementations now, you can hide behind them for protection, shoot at them to initialise the explosion or ram your enemies while driving. Characters in Fallout Tactics can also fight while crouching or crawling. Aggressive and defensive stances allow you to prepare effective ambushes. Combat can be played out in turns or in real-time. It's a really polished game, one of the best out there compared to other games that require tactical thinking.","January 13, 2012","true","43.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

SPOILER: A few missions in you are required to investigate an abandoned underground base below a “tribal” village. At one point, you have to pull a switch to access a second portion of the base. When you pull the switch, it disengages the bases internal defenses and engages the external defenses after a 10 second timer. This has the consequence of killing almost all of the villagers. I realised after the mission that the 10 seconds gives you just enough time to run a character through the internal portion, afterwhich you can have another character disengage the switch, thus defending the villagers above ground!)\n\nCons:\nTraveling between missions can be a huge pain if you don't have a high outdoors skill (dragging you into tedious fights)\nNo base management (If that's your thing!)\nVehicle movement is horrible!\nThere does not appear to be an option to display a hex-grid for character movement.

I probably have about a dozen play throughs under my belt since it was originally released and I still keep coming back to it. Sure it's a little buggy and poorly optimized and doesn't have half the depth of Fallout 1 or 2 but it's just such a well constructed tactical game.\nThe real-time-turn-based system is so well balanced and executed it has to be experience to truly appreciate it. The art and aesthetic is 100% Fallout in every way with amazing attention to detail. The game world and story line is huge and well thought out with balanced map design and tons of little interactive set pieces in every encounter. You can play this game different every time as even the smallest mistakes or extra achievements in a mission have an effect on the final outcome.\n\nIt's a beautiful end of the isometric Fallout games and it may not be a "real" Fallout game in some senses it definitely still has the soul.","January 6, 2015","true","21.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will probably die a lot, and you will probably reload a lot if losing a squad member permanently is unacceptable to you. Mistakes are punished swiftly (and often brutally), and trying to just blast your way through is rarely a workable approach.\n\nAs a special note, be sure to save often and incrementally. I nearly made it to the end of the game, but was prevented when a defeated enemy blocked the only route to my goal. Unfortunately, I had made my only save just after the enemy was felled, which would have required me to roll back to the beginning of the area to try again. It had been such an exhausting process to get to that point that I just opted to stop playing. (Having put over 60 hours into the game, I figured that I had seen most of the show anyway.)\n\nAnyway - this title is a classic example of game design, and definitely worth checking out. It won't "nursemaid" you, but that's part of what made it the experience that it was.","January 8, 2015","true","62.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's because it is slow to start.\n\nIf you like a gritty unforgiving micromanagement RTS this is something you should look into.\nOne of the things that stood out to me is the insane difficult (notably for psychopaths) and the intense amounts of gore you can see.\n\nThe first time I opened this game I left it for a while as it didn't appeal to me- the controls weren't what I was used to since I played a lot of Fallout 1 and 2, and the slow start was unattractive. Once I figured out what I was doing though, the game quickly grew on me.\n\n-Charisma\nIt is possible to pass the game with 1 charisma with very little penalties, but it does have a use. It affects how quickly you rank up and also opens up some recruits earlier. I read somewhere that it allows you to take two of the best recruits in the game.\n\nI've played the game as a sniper and enjoyed this game very thoroughly.\n\n-If you're a melee user then you might be disappointed. It seems that melee is not really that great after super mutants show up, so you're boned.\n\nTL;DR\nIt's an acquired taste.\nMicromanagement RTS\nMelee skills non-existent after super mutants\nVery fun once the controls are down\nslow but strategic at times","June 20, 2015","true","38.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Anyhow... the game does remind me of the cool Fallout 1 and 2, but with far more action and really REALLY shredded story, it is very linear with very few ways to alter the ending. You run a team of 1-6 Characters based on the Fallout 1-2 SPECIAL set up, only the first character is possible to make the rest start out as defaults and you must choose them and improve them or change them into what you want. I prefer to be the Heavy gunner on my own character as it is definatly the weapon that is easiest to cause friendly fire and keeping the rest on single sniping and short range burst to make choke points and a medic with mid-range burst weapons.\n\nNow the game can be turned into fallout 1-2 mode, where action points are used on your turn or remain in a sort of fast forward everyone gun down everyone mode which can be highly deadly in the later parts of the game. In the Start however you will enjoy having a 6 man team with hunting rifles sniping the crap out of the enemy before they reach you and it goes fast, but when 3 hover droids with rocket launchers pop up you kinda go.... ZOMG I iz deadz. and it is true, not even power armor can guarantee survivability against a barrage of rockets fired every 2 seconds or so.... in those moments the Fallout 1-2 mode will save your well toasted behind. It strikes me that it might be this mode that made Bethesda make their own version of it for fallout 3 because it is very similar to it, you use your AP up and then it is your next guy in rotations turn, he uses his AP up and then it is the enemies turn... this does give your team a very good chance to kill whatever they are fighting with a few well placed mid-range bursts or Grenadeds.\n\nEven if you cheat and make your main guy immortal and a 1 man army with unlimited AP there are missions that requires a team of people to succede because the targets heal each other and are spread across the map, unless all die at the same time it is impossible to succede.\n\nThe worst downside of the game is however the overland map that is annoying as hell, random encounters happens way to often, and is seriously lacking in usability, you tend to use more resources killing things than what you get.\n\nBottomline: story is meh okay and gameplay is meh okay. Only a true fan of the series would like it enough to beat it and feel that they did not waste time, but as it follows with Fallout 1 and 2 in a bunble it will be worth it.","March 7, 2015","true","26.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timshel66/recommended/38420/","timshel66","Mike (who are you running from?)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timshel66/","125 products in account","I suggest any prospective players of Fallout Tactics ignore the rose-tinted nostalgia contained in many of these positive reviews, and realize that even at the time of release Fallout Tactics had a well-deserved reputation as a mediocre knockoff of Fallout 1 and 2. At its core the game is a squad based, isometric RPG with a similar control scheme to Infinity Engine games such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, but it tries to focus almost entirely on large scale combat over the lore, exploration and storytelling that made the original two Fallout games so enjoyable. You generally use the same mechanics, weapons and abilities found in Fallout 2, and even can switch between real-time and the "classic" turn based combat, but the end result feels like a poorly balanced mess. My major complaints:\n\n1. Inability to switch from real time to turn based mode outside of combat gives encamped enemies way too much of an advantage\n\n2. Movement range in turn based mode is too small for the size of the maps you play on\n\n3. Vehicles die too easily and are annoying to control\n\n4. Some mission objectives are stupidly vague and NPCs don't give useful context clues\n\nIf it's not clear already, "needlessly slowing down the pace of the game" seems to be a reoccuring theme here. But there are other major areas the game has problems with:\n\n5. The plot and characters are generic and unmemorable, and besides that, aren't even considered canon\n\n6. Most of the skills outside of combat are useless\n\nDespite these issues I'm not saying this game is all terrible. Being able to use cover and crouch is a cool concept that adds a layer of complexity to the combat system that the original Fallout games did not have. I like being able to play as other races like Deathclaws or Ghouls, they all have their own playstyle quirks that make them feel interesting and distinct. I also like the general concept of epic scale battles against heavily fortified groups of enemies- it's just that the concept was poorly tested and poorly executed. Because this game is not considered canon you are really not missing out on much as a Fallout fan if you decide not to play through it, but if you do I suggest not trying to ramp up the difficulty mode so you can stick with real-time combat (and thus minimize the pacing issues) as much as possible.","July 26, 2015","false","50.1"," 42 of 87 people (48%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","48","42","87","6","0"

The biggest change comes in the speed of combat; there are modes in this game now that makes combat freaking mad fast. Rather than controlling one unit, you can now control Squad members which significantly increase combat depth. In return all “choice” in the rpg aspect of this game is gone, npc dialog interaction doesn’t exist. I find this game to be closer to the Commandos series than Fallout, which is not necessarily a bad thing but if you’re playing this out of love of the first two Fallouts, stop now. Gameplay wise, this game is superior by far. Story and immersion wise, this game is nowhere near the level of Fallout 1 and 2.","April 22, 2012","true","49.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This is fallout with almost all combat with a few more tactical things like crouching and proning.\nThe story, enviorenments, and characters are worse than any other fallout game, though. In that aspect it's mainly basic character archetypes or basic fallout fare for story and enviorenments. It's a good game, but only if you like the combat of the original fallouts. Even then, they still have the option to switch that up, with active-time combat or a squad turn based system.

Talking about popping in and out, if you're in the open desert and as you walk, enemies will spawn right behin where you just walked. This is especially annoying when you want to clear rooms and suddenly find out that enemies spawned as you left the room, even worse in large areas where the objective is to kill everyone and you have to backtrack to look for those that spawned after you left.\n\nUnlike previous Fallout games, you can't see what's in a room when you're not in it. That's fine, if it wasn't so buggy. Enemies will appear and reappear in the room after several seconds of you standing inside of it, you might even just stand right infront of a enemy and have to wait for it to appear so you can kill it.\n\nIf you're in it for Fallout lore, remember that this game is only semi-cannon and also that there is barely any Fallout here. Sure there are few references to Fallout here and there, many of which are minor and uninteresting.\n\nIf you're here for the Squad-Based Combat, go elsewhere. Any interactions i've had with the rest of the squad has been unpleasant and annoying. If you're playing in turn-based mode, you'll find that the AI's turns take an insane amount of time, oddly enough, if there are no AIs in the area it still takes alot of time. I playing in real time mode and found that my teammates are more likely to kill themselves and me, rather than the enemy. I abandoned them and played mostly solo, which was more like the other Fallout games and alot more enjoyable.\n\nThe story seemed like it could be promising but the intro after you start a new game is laughably bad, so much that it's painful to watch. The general, whom you get your missions from, is an awful tough guy cliche. I wish he was muted so i didn't have to listen to him everytime i enter a new mission area. The voice acting is pretty bad and the writing doesn't help either. I especially hate the real world character pictures used for all the characters in the game. It screams low production and i think that's what this game is.\nMost of the story is told through a picture book with narration but that only happens when major event occur and is honestly the most interest part of the whole thing.\n\nVehicle combat is a thing, it's unresponsive, the vehicle gets stuck, doesn't go where you want it to go and is very buggy. All in all, it's a terrible experience and i'd much rather just not do those missions.\n\nI don't intend on finishing this game, it's not worth it. And i think if you want to do yourself a big favor, i would say don't buy this game.","November 7, 2015","false","2.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","2"

It is a spin-off, set in the time between the two original Fallouts and focusing almost entirely on the one aspect of it's predecessors that was almost universally disliked, squad combat.\n\nAs you head off into the wasteland one more time you will find some comfort in the familiar. The SPECIAL system is still in place and allows you to customize both yourself and the squad with which you are now required to do battle beside. Memories of NPC burstfiring and having Marcus in your team at all can quickly be dismissed however as your entire squad is completely under your control this time.\n\nBattles play out in either the regular turn based mode which with a big team, big maps and lots of enemies make the game dreadfully slow at times, or a pseudo-realtime mode that lets everyone act out their turns in concert with each other. The real time mode might make some of the smaller battles fly past quicker but as it was obviously never part of the core mechanics it comes with a whole slew of problems that makes it unusable when faced with bigger enemy parties, most notably each character will only perform one action at a time and will then stand around afterwards, waiting to be told to fire off his gun for a second time.\n\nThe great writing of the old Fallout's make a return, although in a more condensed format and lots of the over the top humor from Fallout 2 is present as well making the non-combat segments of the game quite enjoyable, the non-linearity and the choice and consequence system from those games are not present however.\n\nGraphically the game feels dated, a long time has passed since the original Fallout and not much has changed since then. The soundtrack still contains some gems and the game does succeed in places at re-creating that Fallout fell. Those instances are unfortunately quite rare.\n\nAll in all Fallout Tactics is a game that takes too much away from what is tried and true. It tries to create a new experience in a medium with which it has little familiarity and the many rookie mistakes shines through all too much. This makes this a hard game to recommend, even for a die-hard Fallout fan such as myself.","June 3, 2013","false","98.2"," 55 of 147 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","55","147","2","6"

Also it is imposible to get anywhere on the mapas you run into contacts every five seconds it becomes annoying when you have no ammo and no caps to buy any and your squad is not fast enoung to run from most eneimes such as dogs and scropians will catch you if you run where as raiders wil just shoot you in the back.

These bugs nearly swayed my recommendation, but it doesn't quite ruin the whole game unless you're a one-save kind of person.\n\nAnother issue is the slow-paced combat when using the turn-based options, while the continuous turn-based isn't so bad, but it has its drawbacks. For instance, you might be moving two separate groups in an area and might forget another group for long enough for an enemy patrol to come by and open fire on them.\n\nTraveling on the world map is another bad experience due to the frequent, almost constant barrage of random encounters. This makes it absolutely vital to level somebody's Outdoorsman skill to 100 or more to give you the option to skip them and continue your journey.\n\nIt's a decent game, but it has a few nagging drawbacks that keep it from comparing to the first two Fallout games. If you play it, keep these things in mind, as they're quite frustrating at times.","September 22, 2014","true","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I began the Fallout series with Fallout 3 and then New Vegas - without every playing their predecessors.\n\nFallout Tactics BOS has a no holds bar approach to dialogue and gore (also seen in rest of the series). Not only does it provide interesting and realistic conversations and situations but the story is so vastly complete that it kicks your adventurous spirit and curiosity in to over-drive. I never exit the game feeling like i hadnt accomplished something. And I always want more.\n\nIf you love the Fallout Universe and havent played Tactics, PLEASE give it a whirl! You will not be disappointed (Unless you're just an FPS junkie). And even if you're unfamiliar with Fallout but you enjoy games like; Exile, Avernum, Geneforge, D&D, Shadowrun, XCOM, Baldurs Gate or other various RPG's in that catergory, this is the game you've been waiting for!\n\nSide Notes:\n1. Expect some inventory micro-managing if you HAVE to have EVERY peice of loot, like myself.\n2. Don't use melee! Stick to unarmed if you want close combat. 100x better.\n3. You don't have to use a perk when you first get it. If you hit cancel you can use it later when a better perk becomes available.\n4. Don't bother with Turn-Based mode, it's pretty buggy. It may help during hostage situations but Real-Time mode is smooth.\n\nLastly... Save Save SAVE!!!\n\n10/10 All day!","August 20, 2015","true","27.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I'll not shy away from playing it again. There's something about the management of a team of guys coupled with turn based (or faux real-time) combat that ticks all the boxes in my brain.\n\nIf you ever enjoyed Jagged Allience 2, this is certianly worth a go.\n\nPros:\n- quite a big game.\n- nicely written (and in keeping with Fallout originals) lore.\n- nice squad options and varience.\n- I personally like the controls.\n\ncons:\n- tricky to get into\n- some lore breaks the Fallout concept :(\n- unforgiving view ( I wish i could rotate the screen at times)\n- old graphics (and it shows!)\n- you likely need a 'workaround' to play it on most modern PC","June 4","true","35.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
