This game isn't for everybody, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. If you like relaxing, slow paced, and somewhat realistic simulators, give this one a look. There are over a hundred different vehichles, and tons of different features. It's also fully moddable, with a thriving modding community. It's bug free, and runs on relatively low end machines. Works on my four year old rig.","November 26, 2013","true","195.9"," 208 of 225 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","208","225","0","4"

I’ve played this, the 2011, and the 2009 versions for many countless hours.\n\nAs background, I have a graduate degree in agriculture economics and have spent a good portion of my life farming.  By all accounts, I should dislike this game:\n\n* the controls are clunky\n* the physics are often aggravating\n* the particle flow/dust and other graphical elements are a throwback to 1990’s 3D engines\n* the ‘farming’ elements are incredibly simplistic and the economics are silly.\n\nAnd yet there is something oddly cathartic and relaxing about this game that keeps me coming back for more day after day.\n\nI derive the most enjoyment from utilizing some of the many modifications to stretch this game to its limits.  The most important is Courseplay, which allows me to automate most of the tasks and play a managerial role, even though the game it technically a driving simulator.  I also enjoy user-submitted maps, such as Paradise 2013, which are set up for larger operations and automated farming.\n\nEven though I wish the developers would license a better game engine so that the physics, rendering, and particle flow are more realistic, as well as include an 'advanced' mode that actually adjusts growth conditions and incorporates specific pests/weeds that I have to control, I can’t help but think that I’ll keep playing this game for a long time to come.","December 30, 2013","true","152.8"," 119 of 127 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","119","127","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelticFC1888EST/recommended/220260/","CelticFC1888EST","JamieBhoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelticFC1888EST/","209 products in account","This is surprisingly good for something that doesn't even try to hide the fact it's a farming simulator. That said, of course it still *is* a farming simulator, so you *will* be doing some things that are a little more tedious than you'd expect from a typical game. For example, there's no denying that a large part of farm work is driving up and down a field at slow speed, so you will be doing some of that. At the same time you don't have most of the sources of excitement that other open world games have, you're doing honest work (except if you're stealing golf carts, which is possible and apparently nobody cares) so you're not going to be in any police chases or shootouts. The game does a very good job at simulating a farm. You start out with some money, machinery, a loan, and a field (depending on difficulty) and manage the operation from there on. You tend your fields, buy machines, buy more fields, perhaps some animals, and so on, and the level of detail is mostly pretty good. All this takes place in a completely open world, and while you can't buy any cars unless you install mods, there's a very large selection of tractors and other equipment that you can drive around. The nice thing is that equipment generally works like you'd expect it to work: Trailers can be attached to tractors, or in some cases to other trailers, making trains; then you drive them over a grate and press a key to unload your grains, which will happen in a way specific to the type of trailer you're using. Front loaders can pick up things and carry them around, sowers sow, sprayers spray, additional tanks attached to the front of your tractor provide more fertilizer for the sprayer attached to its rear, balers pick up straw and make bales, which you can then pick up with a front loader or another machine that stacks them. Cows produce manure, which you can use to fertilize your fields if you choose to do so, and so forth.\n\nThe game does try to alleviate some of the tedium by letting you hire help for some of the repetitive driving tasks. For example, plowing, cultivating, sowing, fertilizing, spraying, and harvesting can all be done by a computer controlled clone of you. This is implemented very nicely, you just drive the machine to the starting point and press H and it'll start doing what you'd expect it to do. For example, a combine harvester will start slowly harvesting your field, driving up and down, and eventually stop when it's full. Then you can pull up next to it with a trailer and the computer help will extend the combine's pipe and unload the harvest into your trailer and continue. Similarly if you drive next to it while it's harvesting, it'll transfer the harvest to your trailer as you go. This makes it very easy to do some of the typical farming tasks that normally require more than one person. It also adds an aspect of time management to the game when you have multiple computer controlled helpers working your fields and need to jump around between them to support them.\n\nYou also don't have to wait for your plants to grow. There are three settings to control how fast plants grow, and separately you can also speed up time by 120x. Machines only work at one fixed pace, though.\n\nThe farming aspect of this game includes various types of grains, potatoes, beets, as well as cattle (for dairy), sheep (for wool), and chicken (for eggs). Additionally, you can buy green houses that you can freely place on the map to grow things such as herbs or tomatoes, and you can buy bee houses that'll produce honey.\n\nIn addition to typical farming tasks, there also are some half arsed missions (basically two types: one requires you to pick up something with a front loader, another requires you to mow strangely rectangular areas where grass suddenly appeared on the golf course). You can also buy solar panels and wind energy converters, which will provide a nice consistent stream of extra income (they're a little too good).\n\nI'm rating this game a 9 out of 10 because it's a good farming simulator with a very nice open world and very detailed equipment. But as I stated above, it's still a farming simulator, and not an action game, and I would not necessarily expect it to appeal to the same audience as other open world games.","October 14, 2014","true","40.6"," 94 of 97 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","94","97","8","4"

From the visually stunning detail on every tractor, to the joy of harvesting that last potato, this game had it all. Want to plant some corn? Go for it! Feel like selling some eggs? You can do that too! The possibilities are endless when you're running your own farm. Why not play with friends? Feel the excitement when you and your buddies connect over the internet webs and spend hours cultivating your first crops. You will never run out of things to do with an extensive range of different sized fields. Form a clan and take on the annual MLG Farming Simulator 2013 Internationals to compete against the top teams of farmers around the world. Need to get somewhere in a hurry? Just steal a golf cart from the local golf club, and even crash it into a lake.  If that's not enough, Titanium Edition comes with 4 new maps and the urban camo assault crossbow. Pick up a copy of game of the year edition and become eligible for Double XP weekends and gain access to the Farming Simulator 2014 multiplayer beta upon release. So what are you waiting for?

You get 2 maps to start with, Hagenstedt and Westbridge Hills. The game started off with Hagenstedt, but more content and Westbridge Hills was added later in the Titanium upgrade.\nSo what do you do at your farm?\nYou grow crops, manage ure animals and do missions to put it simply.\nThe crops that you can grow are: Wheat, Barley, Canola, Sugar Beets and Potatoes.\nThe animals you can have are: Cows, Sheep and Chickens.\nThere is also two type of missions you can do: Transport Missions and Mowing.\nYou can freely choose how you play the game, and can freely roam on the map, doing what you like. If you only wanna grow crops, for example, thats just fine.\n\nPros:\n- The free playstyle, doing what you want, when you want.\n- Multiplayer. This game is made for it, you can have tons of fun with ure friends working together on the farm.\n- Loads of equipment. From plows to harvesters.\n- Easy to learn and get into.\n- Literally TONS of mods to further enhance your gameplay!\n\nCons:\nI really cant say bad things about the game, but no game is perfect.\n- The handling of some machines are wonky and hard to control (but you get used to it.)\n- Easy to get stuck in fences/rocks and stupid Ai cars. (Fortunately there is a reset function for ure equipment if it flips over or get stuck.)\n- It sometimes feels like your alone in a empty world just driving your machines in single player. There is Ai cars and people, but still feels empty. (Multiplayer fixes that.)\n\nMy personal Thoughts:\nThis is one of my favorite types of sim games. The playstyle is relaxed and easy. Might be a bit stressful at harvest time, but other than that, its really a great game. The game flows well, atleast in single player. Lag issues and small freezes can occur in multplayer, but thats not the game´s fault. I had some great fun farming with my friends. Its a perfect co-op game to work at your farm and earn cash for new machinery and expanding your farm.\nThe game has plenty of machines and equipment to choose from and isnt that enough, there is a great mod community that offers tons of mods of all sorts from new maps and new equipment to gameplay mechanics.\n\nThis is a great game if u like farming sim games. The new one is out, but i recommend to get this new "classic" too.","November 7, 2014","true","405.4"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","46","54","3","0"

I tend to prefer this version to the 2015 version because I am not a fan of the logging focus that was forced into 2015. I think they should have spent their efforts adding more crops and farming styles (like orchards for example). Regardless, they are both EXCELLENT games for those that enjoy an open play style and empire building style. A relaxing and enjoyable experience all around.\n\nThe Modding community behind these games is AMAZING. If you can imagine it, then someone, somewhere has probably built it.

There is a wide selection of brands in the game which you can be sure would have not been endorsed provided they had knowledge of said mini games.\n\nWhile there is a disappointing lack of locales - just two which include some generic place in Germany and another in the US, the real yield of the game is what you are able to harvest from it with your own imagination.

By the title you can probably tell it is do with farming and that just what it is. From most simulators I have played this is the most polished and better designed compared to the rest. For me I didn't really know to much about farming and wouldn't be able to tell you a peice of equipment if you asked me about it but after playing this game I began to learn about the equipment and how it was used. It was more of learning excerise I had than a game but it was fun playing with couple of friends here and there if there was nothing else to do. Its not a game I would say have to play but if you and couple of mates are bored I would suggest all getting it and giving it a try. The price at £29.99 is a bit steep.. well.. very steep but I got it on sale when it was under £10 so I didn't pay but if you want to give it a try with mates not that fun to play alone. I would rate this 7/10 not because its a really good game but because of the enjoyment I had with it with friends not best buy but if you have nothing better to do give it a shot.","December 16, 2013","true","23.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The extraordinary thing is the title is a bland, no bells and whistles sim.\n\nSo what's the attraction?\n\nInitially, starting with 1 paddock on the stock map and a small amount of equipment provides an impetus to do what farmers do. Plant, reap, sell, expand. But it doesn't take long to learn the quirks and the cash points so "expansion" and accummulation of wealth becomes kinda pointless soon enough.\n\nThe scenery can be special, the fields and textures quite mundane. Equipment modelling is very nice. The AI can be quite stupid at times (but I couldn't imagine playing this without them) and it's got a definite farm feel. On it's own, it might get 300-400 hours to dedicated tycoon-sim fan.\n\nSo what is it? What made me do (and will probably continue) over 1200+ hrs of playtime?\n\nFS2013, to me, is all about the mods. New maps, new equipment, new fruits, new animals and new ways to do things are offered by a very dedicated modding community and have been since the game first released.\n\nThe ability to connect the dots to create any specific industry on the farm has increased exponentially. New animal mods, such as the piggery, provide for a very diverse form of infrastructure modelling to run successfully. From grain to root vegetables to water to straw to mixed rations and onwards.\n\nGiants themselves have done very little to gameplay and it took them 12 months to release a new map and some new equipment, along with an engine update. They have not added new animals or fruits and even the new farm and new equipment was a DLC purchase. Pretty poor tbh, given the money made (and continues) from this, one of the most popular farming sims out there.\n\nMod it up and it's worth every single cent and will remain a stalwart amongst the box of games we call sims.\n\n7/10 unmodded.\n9/10 modded.\n\ngg","December 12, 2013","true","259.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I'd say it is aimed at a specific audience for a start. Some may find the gameplay potentially mind-numbing due to the whole repetitiveness with no action, but personally I find it's not too bad to play, because in some points you can also hire workers if you find it too stretching. It is better with friends (as are most games) as it creates more of a mood as well as splitting up the work between you.\n\nEssentially: Start with a little bit of money and some vehicles. Plant stuff, harvest, sell, repeat and get more income so that you're able to upgrade your vehicles, equipment and buy more land to maximise your profit. Pretty much an endless cycle until you have the best equipment and vehicles.\nThe graphics aren't particularly good, but if you're someone that isn't bothered by that - You'll be right.\n\nThe physics are pretty weird, but that's fine because they're pretty funny to play with. The game can also be customised to a certain degree with a large variety of community maps and vehicles that can be downloaded in.\nOnce again, I say that this game is surely not for everyone, but it's not bad if you don't mind the straight forward farming concept with partial monetary and banking section involved.\n\nIn final, I'd say pick this up on a sale if you like the look of it. What you see from gameplay and trailers are essentially what you get. You're in charge of your own wallet here.","December 13, 2013","true","10.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","3"

Essentially, this game focuses on all the things that bored me when I was a farmer years ago. Plowing seemingly endless fields, before preparing and seeding them again. However, it is a beautifully created game and just not my cup of tea. There is nothing functionally wrong with the game, the level of detail and quality of mods are excellent. I suspect also that if I could stomach playing for a few more days solid I might get more bang for my buck\n\nHowever, I have a job and the last thing I want to come home and do after a long day at work is go back to work and plow the fields for a few hours! Sorry, I just found this game intensely dull, it's not overly complex. Plant, harvest, plow, prepare. When you've repeated that, buy some more fields and do it again.\n\nI don't know what I was expecting, perhaps something a little more fun like the old days of Sim Farm which had a bit more pace to it. Nevertheless, I'm sure enthusiasts love this game as the attention to detail is exsquisite - so I would recommend this game to anyone who falls into that category.

You search desperately for the bandits and the dragons and pretty princesses. You watch videos and expect extreme dubstep drops from space.\nBut, spoiler alert, you won't miss such trivialities.

The game offers you quests every so often, to mow a lawn or haul a crate across the lush, bountiful countryside. A simple diversion to earn a simple amount of cash while your farm hands do the repetitive tasks.\nAnd then oh god yes, the multiplayer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevior/recommended/220260/","kevior","Kevior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kevior/","93 products in account","Introduction\nFarming Simulator is by far the best farming simulation franchise out there and this edition is no exception. It has much more equipment and a better appearance.  Many may know it for its glitchy physics but in truth this is the most realistic farming simulator on steam and on the gaming market. If you are interested in the world of agriculture or just love machines then this is definitely the game for you.\n\nGameplay\nFarming Simulator 2013 is, as i say again, by far the best farming simulator out there to date. With the expection of very bouncy and unrealistic physics, it is the most realistic agricultural simulator that you can find. The graphics could do with an upgrade to compete with other simulation games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 but none the less the equipment you can buy is still fairly detailed.\n\nWhen you first jump into the game you are given a very large, yet abandoned farm. You are given a few older tractors to start off with and some basic implements to put on the back. Things start off slow but it doesn't take long before you can be running a highly profitable business. In the begining you are expected to work the fields by planting grain crops such as wheat, barley or canola. The smallest leap into new areas of farming is to simply buy yourself a mower and plant grass instead. As you get further into the game you can explore new areas of farming from turning silage into biogas to growing potatoes and harvesting them with some colossal machinery.\n\nFarming Simulator 2013 has a large variety of real life tractors, implements and other agricultural equipment which look fairly good. If you feel that this selection is not large enough for you and you need more equipment then there is a large and very active modding community for this game with most mods being very simple to install. You can find some of the best mods here[www.farming-simulator.com] on GIANTS own website.\n\nConclusion\nFarming Simulator is very addictive. Before long you will be wracking up many hours of gameplay. The quantity of areas to explore can lead you into hundreds of hours of gaming pleasure and when you've explored all of that there's still the modding community to rely on. If you like farming or big machines i can almost guarentee that you'll love this game.","December 19, 2013","true","211.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although because of all the time spent on it my dog died from malnutrition and porkchop bones it ate off my numerous plates because I am too drawn to this game to do the dishes. It's fantastic. It has traktors, plants, animals (that you can't see, probably ninjas, or black), and people. I bought this game on sale and it's titanium edition so I knew I couldn't be getting a better deal. But the game was so good I went back and paid full price when the sale was over. That's how fantastic it was. Then I saw Jesus farming my field, but the game spelled his name wrong and it looked something like De Jesus. I knew at that moment this game was endowed by our celestial creator n schtuff.

That was my justification for buying this one; it's super cheap, and you should be willing to try anything at least once, with an open mind.\n\nHow is this game?  Let me give you an elaborate analogy: if gaming is like eating, then your 60-hour RPGs are the heavy turkey dinner.  FPSs are like the coffee afterward.  Indie platformers are the sugary deserts, 2D fighters are the alternate pasta entree, and MOBAs are the pizza the loud guys upstairs are having.\n\nTHIS game is like the nap you have after eating too much.  The caffeine buzz has time to wear off, you feel a little less heavy because you've digested that turkey, and you're nice and relaxed because all your dinner guests have gone home.  The upstairs neighbors have gone to a sports bar to watch the game.\n\nThis game is like taking a nap with your eyes open.  The first 2 stages of the tutorial were, collectively, a nice 32-minute nap.","June 23, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides farming you can mess around with lots of different tractors and machines and it is a lot of fun having a race etc. I would recommend this for anyone who is up for a laugh but also wanting to work. The best part is playing multiplayer. I hope the 2015 version will come out and it will be as much fun, even better, than this one.","August 3, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That was my justification for buying this one; it's super cheap, and you should be willing to try anything at least once, with an open mind.\n\nHow is this game?  Let me give you an elaborate analogy: if gaming is like eating, then your 60-hour RPGs are the heavy turkey dinner.  FPSs are like the coffee afterward.  Indie platformers are the sugary deserts, 2D fighters are the alternate pasta entree, and MOBAs are the pizza the loud guys upstairs are having.\n\nTHIS game is like the nap you have after eating too much.  The caffeine buzz has time to wear off, you feel a little less heavy because you've digested that turkey, and you're nice and relaxed because all your dinner guests have gone home.  The upstairs neighbors have gone to a sports bar to watch the game.\n\nThis game is like taking a nap with your eyes open.  The first 2 stages of the tutorial were, collectively, a nice 32-minute nap.","June 23, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You know your life has taken a turn for the worse when you're harvesting crops on a Friday night.\n\nThis could honestly be an enjoyable game if they fixed the following issues:\n\n- Worker AI is pretty bad. If they face an obstruction of any sort such as a tree, other equipment or even another worker, they will just idle there and you end up still paying them\n- Driving to and from the market to sell your harvest can't be automated, resulting in an enjoyable trip through empty towns on a 5mph tractor\n- You can't run over people because everyone are just ghosts. Is this a farming sim or Scooby Doo?\n- Some in-game music would be lovely. I suggest the Wurzels or Rednex for next year's iteration\n- You can buy beehives, chickens etc. to get some regular income but no options for brewing moonshine or selling your family\n- I know it's meant to be a simulator, but buggering up things by driving too fast is not fun. Either cap the max speed so you don't have to accelerate for 3 seconds then stop pressing W for a while, or just remove this altogether so equipment doesn't fall off your vehicle etc.","October 8, 2013","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are also seperate missions to boost your income, animals to tend, the continual feeding of grass clippings into the biogas plant which produces fertilizer for your crops, and an active modding community producing new maps and equipment to download and enhance gameplay.\n\nAs other reviewers have illuded, as  much as I have enjoyed games like Minecraft and Skyrim over the years, this game has been a nice alternative to the constant stress of exploring creeper-infested mines and caverns, or having to fight for your life forever threatened by orcs, goblins, trolls, zombies, and every other horrific imaginings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/220260/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","I know what you're thinking.  "Farming sim? Who would want to do that?".  Well, that's a good question Billy.  Let's sit down and figure this one out, shall we?  I would say this game appeals to a side of me where you start out with very little and you have to work to improve what you have.  Games like Minecraft, Harvest Moon, The Sims, etc.\n\nNow I'm not saying you are going to dig for diamonds and fight zombies and creepers, nor am I saying this is exactly like Harvest moon or whatever.  I'm just saying that in those games you're started off without much and you have to work to make your world grow.  Likewise, they start you off with a single field and a few tractors and a bank loan, and from there you have to pay off the loan, plant your crops, figure out the best time to sell your crops, and in general keep finding new ways to make money.\n\nIf you want to be lame, you can buy windmills, and solar panels and a bunch of other easy money-making items.  These items require very little to no maintenance and you earn money every day.  There's no challenge in that though.  You might want one so that you have some steady income while you're working 5 fields at once and hiring 2-3 workers to keep things moving as you jump from tractor to tractor.  You don't want to be able to just walk away and come back 8 hours later to find you're filthy rich though.\n\nThere's plenty to do in this game.  You can play the original map (in Germany?) or now with the Titanium edition, you can play the same game with a more American theme.  There's cows for milk, sheep for wool, chickens for eggs, and several crops to plant (some of which require special machinery). You also need to learn where to sell your eggs and wool as well as how to feed your cows so your milk output is at its best,\n\nWhen you feel like exploring there are some hidden items in the map that  you can collect (it doesn't really affect the game so you can ignore it if you like) and occasionally there are some side-jobs you can take on for extra cash.\n\nThe only thing that's missing in single-player is an actual economy.  Prices will go down if you flood the market with a certain type of crop, but other than that, demand seems to be purely random.  There are no competing farmers for your crops so you merely wait for the best time to sell (except maybe in the early days when you have the loan to pay off).\n\nFortunately, you can play this game online so it doesn't feel so empty...and it's a lot of fun to cooperate with farm work, though you'd need mods to get "paid" for your work in an online game.   If this game had a neighboring farm that you could cooperate with and/or compete with, and if there was an actual economy that was reflected in the prices (instead of price changes to simulate an economy), this game would be perfect.\n\nStill, as you can see, I've spent a lot of time playing this, and that was mostly before the titanium edition.  I've only just begun a game on the new map.  If you enjoy the satisfaction of building up a farm (or an empire or whatever) this game will have a lot to keep you interested.  It can also be relaxing to just chill out as you are taking care of the farm business.","December 17, 2012","true","229.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Fighters and bombers soar overhead, aircraft drop legions of paratroopers onto the farmland you so meticulously tilled as you realize that you, a lone farmer, are the last line of defense from foreign invaders. You prepare for war by breaking out that rifle you kept to ward off thiefs, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition, rocket launchers, grenades, anti aircraft guns, and that Davy Crockett you kept for those special occasions. As you fight through your blood soaked little property, you must continue to make those crucial crop deliveries in order to help sustain the crumbling war effort. The delivery missions are brutal, as you must guide your tractor convoy to its destination through complex ambushes, IEDs, and indirect fire.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/220260/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","I know what you're thinking.  "Farming sim? Who would want to do that?".  Well, that's a good question Billy.  Let's sit down and figure this one out, shall we?  I would say this game appeals to a side of me where you start out with very little and you have to work to improve what you have.  Games like Minecraft, Harvest Moon, The Sims, etc.\n\nNow I'm not saying you are going to dig for diamonds and fight zombies and creepers, nor am I saying this is exactly like Harvest moon or whatever.  I'm just saying that in those games you're started off without much and you have to work to make your world grow.  Likewise, they start you off with a single field and a few tractors and a bank loan, and from there you have to pay off the loan, plant your crops, figure out the best time to sell your crops, and in general keep finding new ways to make money.\n\nIf you want to be lame, you can buy windmills, and solar panels and a bunch of other easy money-making items.  These items require very little to no maintenance and you earn money every day.  There's no challenge in that though.  You might want one so that you have some steady income while you're working 5 fields at once and hiring 2-3 workers to keep things moving as you jump from tractor to tractor.  You don't want to be able to just walk away and come back 8 hours later to find you're filthy rich though.\n\nThere's plenty to do in this game.  You can play the original map (in Germany?) or now with the Titanium edition, you can play the same game with a more American theme.  There's cows for milk, sheep for wool, chickens for eggs, and several crops to plant (some of which require special machinery). You also need to learn where to sell your eggs and wool as well as how to feed your cows so your milk output is at its best,\n\nWhen you feel like exploring there are some hidden items in the map that  you can collect (it doesn't really affect the game so you can ignore it if you like) and occasionally there are some side-jobs you can take on for extra cash.\n\nThe only thing that's missing in single-player is an actual economy.  Prices will go down if you flood the market with a certain type of crop, but other than that, demand seems to be purely random.  There are no competing farmers for your crops so you merely wait for the best time to sell (except maybe in the early days when you have the loan to pay off).\n\nFortunately, you can play this game online so it doesn't feel so empty...and it's a lot of fun to cooperate with farm work, though you'd need mods to get "paid" for your work in an online game.   If this game had a neighboring farm that you could cooperate with and/or compete with, and if there was an actual economy that was reflected in the prices (instead of price changes to simulate an economy), this game would be perfect.\n\nStill, as you can see, I've spent a lot of time playing this, and that was mostly before the titanium edition.  I've only just begun a game on the new map.  If you enjoy the satisfaction of building up a farm (or an empire or whatever) this game will have a lot to keep you interested.  It can also be relaxing to just chill out as you are taking care of the farm business.","December 17, 2012","true","229.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

At first, it seems like a simple farming game, until out of nowhere there are North Korean soldiers overrunning your peaceful farm. Fighters and bombers soar overhead, aircraft drop legions of paratroopers onto the farmland you so meticulously tilled as you realize that you, a lone farmer, are the last line of defense from foreign invaders. You prepare for war by breaking out that rifle you kept to ward off thiefs, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition, rocket launchers, grenades, anti aircraft guns, and that Davy Crockett you kept for those special occasions. As you fight through your blood soaked little property, you must continue to make those crucial crop deliveries in order to help sustain the crumbling war effort. The delivery missions are brutal, as you must guide your tractor convoy to its destination through complex ambushes, IEDs, and indirect fire.

That was my justification for buying this one; it's super cheap, and you should be willing to try anything at least once, with an open mind.\n\nHow is this game?  Let me give you an elaborate analogy: if gaming is like eating, then your 60-hour RPGs are the heavy turkey dinner.  FPSs are like the coffee afterward.  Indie platformers are the sugary deserts, 2D fighters are the alternate pasta entree, and MOBAs are the pizza the loud guys upstairs are having.\n\nTHIS game is like the nap you have after eating too much.  The caffeine buzz has time to wear off, you feel a little less heavy because you've digested that turkey, and you're nice and relaxed because all your dinner guests have gone home.  The upstairs neighbors have gone to a sports bar to watch the game.\n\nThis game is like taking a nap with your eyes open.  The first 2 stages of the tutorial were, collectively, a nice 32-minute nap.","June 23, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will tell yourself when purchasing this game "I'll give it a go, play for a bit and just come back to it now and again..." Then, after your purchase you will be on it for hours. In a good way. It will have you wanting to play it. And play it you will. As i said, you won't enjoy it if you are a gamer who likes fast paced games.\n\nThis game is for gamers who enjoy management games with a need to put a little work in for yourself. I didn't. I do now.\nThere is so much more to this game than any of the simulator games on the market. It is that that makes it shine\n\nGood points: Good gameplay, A finance system that wont have you pulling your hair out, fantastically animated machinery, simplified farming (No need to worry about things such as crop rotation, and other technical details) Meaning this game is for non-farmers and farm enthusiasts alike, Side missions allowing you to get off the farm and do a little for the community, changable time multiplier (real time/5x/10x/ and so on...) making it a lot easier when waiting for crops. Large maps with lots of room for farm expansion, Moddable.\n\nBad points: Textures are not great on some objects, THAT DAMN COCKREL (you'll see), very rarely you may get a glitch. but it is very rare, Tutorials which dont teach you everything you need to know, UI could be a little better.\n\nIf you have any interest in management, and being able to get involved. Get this game. You will not be dissapointed...\n\nRating 9/10\nThe game can be pushed to 10/10 with the addition of mods (Easy to obtain and install)","December 17, 2013","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of my favourite games for sure!\n\nThe only draw back is after some time the gameplay becomes very painful and the maintenance on the farm becomes repetitive and time consuming to the point where boredom sets in. You HAVE TO play this with a friend or 2. You cannot do everything yourself and if you do you will not make as much money, you won't get everything done quickly and you will get seriously bored.\n\nDo take a look at the communities for mods.

Having to do manual work for a while, eventually, you work your way to owning atleast 20 fields (some are larger then others, and other maps have more of them). You even hire lots of workers to run your fields. I reccomend, finding some mods, and downloading more maps for the game.","September 11, 2013","true","59.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Challak/recommended/220260/","Challak","Challak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Challak/","2117 products in account","Summary: A game for those who don't care whether their farm has aliens they need to fight off, or NPCs they can romance. This game doesn't have that. It has farming equipment and a great environment for people looking for a relaxing evening or a great co-operative experience with friends who enjoy simulated farming with heavy equipment.\n\nHours of fun: *Varies - If you like simulators then it may well be infinite\nSuggested Retail Value: $20\nGraphics: 7/10\nVoice-acting: NA - No voice-acting\nMusic/SFX: NA - Calm music on menus only\nUniqueness: 5/10\nFirst Play-through Experience: 8/10\nReplay Value: 9/10\n\nIf you have any love for simulated farming then I doubt you would regret paying up to $20 for the full version. I was introduced to the game through a friend who had put in 100s of hours and just convinced me to give it a try so I could experience what he loved so much about it. I didn't expect it to be this much fun, but it's a blast on co-op play.\nAfter a stressful day, I can sit back and relax and handle issues as they rise. Choosing to pace myself in the game by switching it to real-time and literally doing needed chores then watching the beautiful sunset or... whatever.\nThen, when I'm feeling ambitious, we both hop into our private server and divy up the tasks at hand, co-operating in beautiful harmony to bring our farm ever closer to being a mega-success.\nIt's hard to describe how it feels to grow a farm from humble beginnings with one small field to a booming business with dozens of fields, 1000s of tons of equipment, and a ranch boasting hundreds of animals, but I highly recommend sharing it with friends.\nTo help with that, the game has an incredible community. Whether you're looking to see the mods that are available, wanting to create your own, looking for a buddy to chat with while you drive the harvesters, or wanting to join a sever with dozens of players trying to achieve a shared farm (even splitting up the tasks, creating jobs, dolling out wages, the whole deal!) the truth is you'll find it all here.\nI say this about few games (Skyrim readily comes to mind) but FS 2013 feels less like a game and more like a world you visit for as long as you like. Highly recommended if the above sounds interesting to you.","July 21, 2014","true","47.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When I say rollercoaster ride I really mean those horrible tractor rides at local fairs which go against all health and safety protocols.\n\nAnyway back to the game. Farming Simulator 2013 feels very empty and I cant quite put my finger on it... Could it be the lack of interaction between you and the environment along with the lifeless NPCs which share very similar player models. The fact that you just a floating head and most of the work can be done without you adds to the point that this world is lifeless and frankly dull.\n\nNow I am writing this in 2016 so many people may be saying, "this game is three years old, give it a break". The first statement is true however if we compare it to other games from the same year you begin to see really how bland it is. Grand theft auto 5, The last of us, Bioshock Infinite, Tomb raider  and battlefield 4 are only a selection of games which were released in 2013 and are still enjoyable.\n\nThe controls are sloppy and the Interface is very basic. Not really much else to say about the actual.\n\nFarming Simulator is not. Who really wants to simulate manual labour in a world populated by 2D mountains and the same dead NPC. Not me really. One factor to take into consideration is that it has a multiplayer option which can be quite fun with friends until you realise the only thing to do is plow the same fields over and over again.\n\nSo no I do not recommend this game, unless you are training to be a farmer. This game could actually teach you a lot about how you should not waste your time on this Earth playing a flimsy simulator based around a motionless town.\n\nGoodnight.","February 20","false","4.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

There are some glitchy parts to it like with the loading of hay bales onto bale carts as well with the front end loaders but no major issues found here. The game also allows modding which makes getting something thats not in te game very easy. It also has decent performance even on my non-gaming computer. Overall Id give it a 9/10 just because of the minor problems and some of the vehical textures(in the cab) dont look very good or dont function at all(like with the computers in the harvesters, etc) Id definitely recommend this game to someone looking for a relaxing game.","April 6, 2014","true","74.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's what ultimately led me to give it a try (and it was $4 on sale). This game is really fun, even if you're mainly chugging through to get the achievements like I did at first. Then you realize this is a really great sim game.\n\nIt's a steeper learning curve than most, but with guides you can adjust easily. The scope is a little overwhelming at first too, but it certainly takes patience (just like real crops?). Gameplay is addicting and fun. Haven't tried MP, but looks like it's almost essential to keep from going mad (there's a LOT to do and keep tabs on).\n\nGraphics aren't bad, and no real bugs from what I've encountered so far. A solid game. Mod community is big, and plenty to download.\n\nIf you like any kind of city building or other sim games you have to give this one a go.\n\n8/10\n\n+Gameplay is fun and solid\n+Graphics on par for a non AAA title in '13\n+Modding community\n+DLCs are fun but not required to enjoy the full game\n\n-Clunky interface\n-Tutorial only covers machine operation\n-Physics not always consistent","December 31, 2015","true","48.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is great for someone who is REALLY into ploughing fields.  I mean REALLY.  The trucks and equiptment are nice and there is quite a bit of variety, but it's definitely more of a game about vehicles and farming technicallities than planting crops or raising animals.  The low rating is only because it was not really advertised directly as such, and therefore I thought it might have more to do with animal husbandry etc.  Great game if you're into the other, technical, physical side of farming.","October 30, 2013","false","12.8"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Well, there's a great series out that allows you to farm that's just for you!!  The nice, relaxing and serene environment of the country as you harvest many types of vegetables and fruit.  I am, of course, talking about the Harvest Moon series.\n\nThis, however, is not Harvest Moon.  It can barely be classified as a game.  There are no goals, no physics and no one else on the farm.  I may just be a simple suburb folk but I'm pretty sure that realistic farms are a multiperson job even with tractors.\n\nOh, yeah.  There are some people.  They drive in cars and don't seem to react at all when you drive your farming equipment over them or tip them over.   If you have some cash to spend, you could probably have a much more enjoyable time by going down to your local Sherwin Williams, buy some paint, toss it at your wall and watch it dry.   Mmmm...lovely paint drying...Certainly much more enjoyable than this locust infestation.","May 31, 2014","false","1.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Bought this for my missus as I thought it would be like sim farm where you had your workers to do this for you. She didn't have a clue so I bought it myself to do the tutorial and I could teach her. Didn't realise you had to actually do the whole bloody lot yourself, get in the tractor, pick up the tool... drive around the field.\n\nBugger that... too slow.. too dull.... mistake to buy for me. Maybe my fault for not reading so much but the opening movie gives no indictation of how this works at all. It makes it look like a "settlers farming"... not a full on farming simulation.","September 17, 2015","false","1.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnnyramrod/recommended/220260/","johnnyramrod","JohnnyRamrod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnnyramrod/","583 products in account","OK... where to begin... Let's dive straight in, shall we?\n\nPROS:\n\n- It's cheap! Given there's a newer version out, this is a bargain. (Of course, why you'd even CONSIDER buying a new version is beyond me, once is truly, SURELY enough...)\n- It provides a very clear insight into the riveting, high octane world of farming!\n- lots of vehicles, accessories, things to load, unload, fill, plough etc (if that's your bag...)\n\nCONS:\n- I wanted to die while I played this...\n- It's a simulator about farming - and yep, you guessed it, it's 'somewhat' realistic. That means it's so frightfully boring and dull you'll have trouble stopping your brain from exploding.\n- There are in excess of 3000 people who own this game who gave it the thumbs up... Why is that a CON? Well... let's put it this way, the type of people who'd most likely give this a thumbs up probably like watching grass grow, and can't get enough of farming so they turn to a simulator to continue the experience into the evening. I'm shocked. Seriously I am.\n\nSUMMARY: It's not that the game is terrible. In fact, you could very reasonably argue that in playing a farming simulator, you need to set your expectations lower than a crack ho' turning tricks with Jack the Ripper. But here's the thing - even knowing it's a farming simulator, it still was so awfully dull, so painfully boring that I can't believe I played as long as I did.\n\nI mowed some grass at a golf course, I drove a tractor with a trailor perfectly lined up next to a harvester to catch wheat, then dumped said wheat in a grain silo, I took a load of peanuts to a place so they could attract a runaway elephant back (yep, you heard me right), i sold a tractor, I ploughed a field. Then I realised I was SPENDING MINUTES OF MY LIFE, JUST WASTING AWAY DOING THIS!!!!\n\nThe tutorial was mildly amusing for 5 minutes, then the game just continues the awful, mind-sapping exercise. Oh man, how this game will sap your very soul!","September 17, 2015","false","4.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

I love sims and farming and all that stuff that's boring, and this does all that. The only problem with it is the physics. It's like farming on Mars. Carrying a pallet on your forklift and hit a bump, have fun chasing it down and spending the next 5 minutes lining your forks back up just right to load it up and have it sailing off into oblivion the next bump you hit. Get your sheep going, finally get a few pallets of wool together and loaded on the trailer? Make sure not to turn that trailer because, as we all know, any sort of turn sends your load flying off. Accidentally hit Q on your harvester? Better bring your forklift over to try to flip your implement for the next 10 minutes.\n\nAccidentally put grass in your hopper instead of grains, have fun tilling that field for the next half hour and never getting it quite right.\n\nIt's just bad. It could be a great game but it just isn't. Models are great, the towns are OK, gameplay is decent aside from the just terrible physics. Accidentally hitting one key will cost you 20 minutes of frustration. If you buy this game I suggest you save often because it's better to load 10 minutes back than try to recover from the slightest mistake.","October 13, 2014","false","33.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's definitely not a pvp game or competition of any kind, but there is something extremely relaxing to play this game in multiplayer, it's sort of a bonding experience if you can convince your friends to buy this. It has pretty much all the "paid DLC features" that FS2011 had, a much bigger array of real life brands and implemented some of the community mods.\nOh yeah, this game also shine by it's vibrant modding community.\nIt's sort of boring alone, and sort of fun in MP, it's also cheap.

After being surprised by the excellent Euro Truck Simulator 2, I was expecting sort of the same experience, only with cows and grain instead of long nightly drives through Germany. And with multiplayer! But I was let down…\n\nTo be fair: the game can be fun, especially on a LAN with some friends, country music on the speakers and a bottle of Jack to pass around. And the models of the farming machines are pretty nice and detailed as well. However, many things simply are a let-down or maybe wasted potential. For example, the rear mirrors are not functioning, essentially making it impossible to play the game first person when driving. And don’t get me started about the dreadful physics engine powering it all: you will encounter gravity defying bouncing farming equipment at regular intervals (and pray those will not get stuck in the scenery). Also, there are no real management options: you can hire some dumb helping hands but that is about it. Even an ancient game like Sim Farm had this. And speaking of Sim Farm: why is there no option to actually upgrade the farm itself (beyond the buying of extra fields).\n\nHopefully future versions will fix some of the issues I had with this game, since there is some great potential here. But for now I cannot really recommended it, unless it’s really cheap in some sale and you have some friends to enjoy it with.","March 8, 2014","false","14.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

There is no management, no depth, no challenge.The multiplayer is non - existant, though there seems to be a market for it. Some dedicated servers would be cool here. The level difficulty is awful. Easy is tutorial and far too easy to bother with. Normal is easy. Hard says - you start off in debt, workers cost more to hire. Okay, so going into the game I start off with a random 8000 dollars, I don't seem to have any debt or loan at all. Workers cost more to hire yes, but I hired them anyway and still got a profit. Also managed to sell my two useless tractors for 18,000. Then decided to open the shop, and oh....I can only buy the very most basic items, and only one type of some to do the entire map. This level isn't hard, its just pointless as you now cannot progress.\n\nAlso, the devs seem to have plopped down this empty shell of a sim, and from then til now and forever, are just churning out dlc with new tractor bits from various companies. How about you add to the game more...?\n\nOther players put it well for me -\n\n''What I dislike is the fact that you start out with a really big farm in terms of buildings and stuff. I would so much like to build everything myself, just starting out with a small field and some equipment. I also miss seasons and crop rotations, as well as fatigue.\n\nWhile the game is somewhat shallow in terms of the overall mechanics,''\n\n''6.5/10. This game is great for someone who is REALLY into ploughing fields. I mean REALLY. The trucks and equiptment are nice and there is quite a bit of variety, but it's definitely more of a game about vehicles and farming technicallities than planting crops or raising animals. The low rating is only because it was not really advertised directly as such, and therefore I thought it might have more to do with animal husbandry etc. Great game if you're into the other, technical, physical side of farming.''","April 30, 2014","false","7.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

You cant "plan" and watch anything you literally have to drive your tractor and plow the field, and then drive over it again to plant, then drive over it again to spray, then drive over it again to harvest.  Meanwhile there is no way to automate anything, you literally have to drive your tractor to the chicken yard then get out and run around picking up eggs.  OK there is one thing you can automate...a half ♥♥♥♥♥ worker to drive the harvester.  Did you want to sell  eggs?  well IF you can find the place to do it (since the ingame map barely functional) after you ran around like an idiot picking them up THEN you drive your tractor to that place and sell them.  Same silly plan with sheep and cows.  And crops for that matter.  There are ridiclous pop up missions that would be great if the game was called "heavy equipment simulator" where you drive your front end loader to pick up pallets.\n\nIn short as a tractor driving simulation this is basicly "OK".  As a farm sim it is almost unplayable.","January 1, 2014","false","3.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

You can also play multiplayer with your friends which is fun. Farming Simulator 2015 came out not that long ago. In my opinion it is better than 2013.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104656930/recommended/220260/","76561198104656930","william.petzold","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104656930/","31 products in account","As a little boy whose parents and grandparents farmed, I grew up in the 1980s pushing little diecast Ertl tractors around on the carpet and making my own tractor sounds, pretending to be a farmer and working my own imaginary fields. Now that I'm an adult, I have enjoyed hours and hours of challenging farming satisfaction thanks to Farming Simulator 2013.\n\nThe Titanium add-ons have added literally hundreds of hours of fun trying out new equipment, and the Westbridge Hills map was a terrific purchase because it more closely resembles the area where my family farmed in Michigan.\n\nI'm currently downloading FS 2015, and while doing so I thought I would put in a good word for FS 2013. Some people might not understand the appeal of a farm sim, but once you begin you're almost immediately hooked. I became bored with Facebook-based games like Farmville within minutes, but I was blown away by how engaging and realistic FS 2013 is, and having seen gameplay footage of FS 2015 I realize it was just the next step in the evolution of farming sims. You plant crops, care for animals and slowly amass a fortune as you build a business in a very realistic manner. I told my parents I started a game and had three tractors, $50,000 in the bank and $150,000 in debt and they said, "Well, that sounds like real farming!" The mowing missions give you a quick boost financially, for example you can earn $11,000 for mowing a patch of grass at the golf course. That's slightly unrealistic, but considering my mowing rig costs about $70,000 it's realistic in that you have to buy the equipment and then do the work until the gear "pays for itself."\n\nFarming Simulator 2013 is seriously challening on the Hard difficulty level. Your crops are worth very little and money is much more difficult to come by. Even on easy mode where the cash flows a little more freely, I've wasted entire days trying to reach a certain dollar amount. There's always something to do, there's always something to buy. Every thing you want to do - i.e. raise cattle to sell milk daily -- requires specific equipment and the know-how to use it, sometimes trial and error -- and while the game cannot be absolutely true-to-life, I think it does a terrific job conveying the experience of trying to make a living as a farmer. You can even buy a few wind turbines and let the cash roll in as you amass a collection of classic tractors like a lot of the old-timers around here have been doing for the past several years. Likewise, you can invest in more land, more gear and more employees like a lot of the bigger family operations around here and turn yourself into a business-savvy Ag baron.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: It's a big -- no gigantic -- sandbox full of almost every real life piece of gear you could hope to purchase from many notable brands -- except for John Deere, of course, which publishes its own game that I haven't played because it costs $80. Since I've begun playing FS 2013 I've noticed real farmers in my area using the same gear that I've purchased in the game and I admire the detail the designers put into each round baler and Case IH harvester. I get to play along without having the financial responsiblity of purchasing a $500,000 Grimme self-propelled sugar beet harvester. If you were a farm kid like me who went to college and found a career in the city, this game lets you experience what might have been had you chosen to try to turn the family farm into an Ag empire.\n\nHighly, highly recommended. I have spent nearly 450 hours playing this game -- which is a little shocking -- and honestly, I still haven't planted every single field the game has to offer. Some gamers complain about minor imperfections, but I grew up playing an Atari 2600 and the original NES. This game is sweet!","November 16, 2014","true","481.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(lines, plants, etc appear and disapear as the ground is interacted with)\n\n\nAll in all, this a slow paced and relaxing game. It does require some planning ahead and management skills as you grow. Thus far, I have a bustling little farm that is growing a steady pace. Really enjoying it.\n","October 28, 2014","true","36.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a farming simulator. It has great graphics, good vehicle choice, and several methods to aquire crops, funds, and other things.\n\nIt also has great modding support, adding even more vehicles and mechanics into the game. Having multiplayer is also a nice touch.\n\nWith the vanilla game, however, it has its limitations. Aside from 'make money', there are no goals and no directions. There are missions, but those could be considered 'side jobs', eg mow the lawn or forklift this box over there. This offers a great amount of freedom into the game, but it can also be overwhelming for new players.\n\nOverall, this is a great farming simulator, but it falls short for anyone expecting it to be more than just a farming simulator.","September 16, 2014","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now that I'm an adult, I have enjoyed hours and hours of challenging farming satisfaction thanks to Farming Simulator 2013.\n\nThe Titanium add-ons have added literally hundreds of hours of fun trying out new equipment, and the Westbridge Hills map was a terrific purchase because it more closely resembles the area where my family farmed in Michigan.\n\nI'm currently downloading FS 2015, and while doing so I thought I would put in a good word for FS 2013. Some people might not understand the appeal of a farm sim, but once you begin you're almost immediately hooked. I became bored with Facebook-based games like Farmville within minutes, but I was blown away by how engaging and realistic FS 2013 is, and having seen gameplay footage of FS 2015 I realize it was just the next step in the evolution of farming sims. You plant crops, care for animals and slowly amass a fortune as you build a business in a very realistic manner. I told my parents I started a game and had three tractors, $50,000 in the bank and $150,000 in debt and they said, "Well, that sounds like real farming!" The mowing missions give you a quick boost financially, for example you can earn $11,000 for mowing a patch of grass at the golf course. That's slightly unrealistic, but considering my mowing rig costs about $70,000 it's realistic in that you have to buy the equipment and then do the work until the gear "pays for itself."\n\nFarming Simulator 2013 is seriously challening on the Hard difficulty level. Your crops are worth very little and money is much more difficult to come by. Even on easy mode where the cash flows a little more freely, I've wasted entire days trying to reach a certain dollar amount. There's always something to do, there's always something to buy. Every thing you want to do - i.e. raise cattle to sell milk daily -- requires specific equipment and the know-how to use it, sometimes trial and error -- and while the game cannot be absolutely true-to-life, I think it does a terrific job conveying the experience of trying to make a living as a farmer. You can even buy a few wind turbines and let the cash roll in as you amass a collection of classic tractors like a lot of the old-timers around here have been doing for the past several years. Likewise, you can invest in more land, more gear and more employees like a lot of the bigger family operations around here and turn yourself into a business-savvy Ag baron.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: It's a big -- no gigantic -- sandbox full of almost every real life piece of gear you could hope to purchase from many notable brands -- except for John Deere, of course, which publishes its own game that I haven't played because it costs $80. Since I've begun playing FS 2013 I've noticed real farmers in my area using the same gear that I've purchased in the game and I admire the detail the designers put into each round baler and Case IH harvester. I get to play along without having the financial responsiblity of purchasing a $500,000 Grimme self-propelled sugar beet harvester. If you were a farm kid like me who went to college and found a career in the city, this game lets you experience what might have been had you chosen to try to turn the family farm into an Ag empire.\n\nHighly, highly recommended. I have spent nearly 450 hours playing this game -- which is a little shocking -- and honestly, I still haven't planted every single field the game has to offer. Some gamers complain about minor imperfections, but I grew up playing an Atari 2600 and the original NES. This game is sweet!","November 16, 2014","true","481.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I grew up on a farm, I went to an Ag school for pre-vet.  So, it's a fun game, although I don't really consider it a game.  It's a simulator....like any other sim, except with this one, you get to be farmer John.  This sim is a great learning tool.  I play with my kids.  I teach them the value and importance of saving and working.  I start each with 100,000 dollars.  I told them thats all the money they get, and teach them about saving...in this case for needed equipment.   It's actually perfect for this kind of thing.\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, I'd like to see a few changes.  Since there is now an American farm, it'd be nice to see the weather in degrees, instead of celsius.  I know most probably use Centigrade, however, it'd at least be nice to be able to toggle from one or the other.  Also, since you don't have the means at the start, it'd be nice to be able to buy hay and straw for feeding purposes.  You can buy animals and other placeable buildings, so doing this would enhance the simulation.   Additionally, for the American farm, putting the fields in acres instead of hectares would be a nice change as well.   Lastly, it'd be nice to see the seasons change for a more realistic planting experience.  Example, corn in spring/summer, wheat in winter.  Perhaps color coding the calendar with fall/winter/summer would be a good way to accomplish this.\n\nIf you want a "game" that you can kill hours on, and have some moderate fun....this is it.  Keep in mind...it's a sim....about farming.  Those who work, or have worked on a farm understand....there is ALOT of monotony.  Nothing happens fast on a farm...except spending money....and lots of it.","August 1, 2014","true","312.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then we found something that game us alot of money so for the next 2 hours we drove around in tractors while others tried to block us off with bee hives .The next time we started playing a few more of us had joined up which then lead to Loader westling we have only played for a few days and I plan on having more fun as this game continues.
