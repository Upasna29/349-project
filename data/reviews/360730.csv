Most glaringly, it's pay to win.\n\nThey give you a nice starting with campaign scenarios,  but when you actually play multiplayer you see very quickly what wins and those decks that are stacked with epics win. About half of the best cards are locked in the "Warlock Academy Campaign",  a campaign that you have to buy as DLC. This DLC costs 34.99 USD.\n\n*see the math belowe but, forget the math. the point is, is it's bull ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\n2. Connection Error, try again later.\n\nThis one comes and goes, but when it comes, it seems to last all day. There are also apparently scheduled downtimes which are not known so if you want to play during those times you're just ♥♥♥♥ out of luck.  Connection Error happens in single player, too, so you can't even play / grind when the network is down.\n\n\n3. Single Player is pretty meh.\n\nSince MP is pay to win, single player needs some love, and gets very little (at least it is there, barely). You can keep playing the same AI, each faction, and they are always single deck instead of 2-deck, which makes it pretty boring. THe AI is bad. They buff their units after the units attack, they don't rely on focus fire to eliminate units and wipe themselves out on futile attacks, they don't stack their pierces properly, and so on. They don't card-buff their units at all, which is the most prevalent thing you see in multi.\nAnd you need to be online to play at all whatsoever.\nThe prescripted scenarios become extremely frustrating and you won't go back to them after you beat them.\n\n\n\nThe art style is good and the tactics are quite good too, until of course you get to the overpowered cards, and then it just gets dumb. And it's only going to get worse as time goes by, and they release more decks with more epics and what not. It's the same for all pay to win stuff especially card games, I saw it happen to Pox Nora.\n\n\n\nSo, I'm still pretty addicted to it but really, I don't recommend that you get into it. It's a money sink and it's still buggy enough that you drop games to connection errors too often. There are other issues too, like changes to balance, and having cards removed from your deck (and repaid in shards, but possibly at a lower value than the original cards cost, I can't tell because, when they did it, they didnt even tell me what cards were removed and I was pretty new so I don't know what cards I lost, but due to the amount of shards I know some were the highest cards)\n\n\n* It is possible to open the campaign with earned game points (CP) but the amount of CP earned is limited daily, seems to be about 300 (not including the 1 daily quest which is 700 to 1000). The Warlock Academy campaign is 5 chapters, 50,000 CP each (unless the later chapters are even more, I am assuming they are the same amount). That's 250,000 cp. I think that 300 per day, 3000 per 10 days, 9000 per month, that's 27 months. That's not including quests but that's figuring you MAX out cp gain EVERY DAY. And I can't figure out exactly what the cp cap is, it seems damn random.","November 5, 2015","false","105.6"," 95 of 130 people (73%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","73","95","130","11","10"

However, it's not worth the full £6.99 price. I don't know whether I didn't link to my Steam account correctly, but I never received the Early Access Pack, or the Steampunk castle.\n\nIt's soon apparent that to progress quickly, you need to be spending real cash to buy silver coins, which unlocks extra quests and cards. I did play Hearthstone for free for many months  and many hours grinding daily quests for gold. It was an endless chore which I don't ever want to repeat. The same mechanism is in place here. From daily quests you can earn 2,100cp daily. To unlock some of the scenarios, takes 25,000cp. That a lot of days grinding to unlock a few scenarios...\n\nMeanwhile, people ploughing real money into this will be so far ahead in terms of the cards they can play.","October 24, 2015","false","1.2"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","33","51","0","0"

I’d like to warn any and everyone, that since i am a big HS player i will be making all my comparisons to it.\n\nLets start off where i'm ticked off the most and we’ll make our way to the positives.\n\n\nCONs\nThe “dust” system is completely broken ( they call it shards) but its ...i cant belive im saying this but more grindy than HS !\n....here's proof\nHS DUST			CaC Shards				Disenchanting	Crafting		Disenchanting	Creating		Common	5	40	8:1	10	100	10:1	Gold/Rainbow	50	400	8:1	20	1000	50:1								Rare	20	100	5:1	40	400	10:1	Gold/Rainbow	100	800	8:1	80	2000	25:1								Epic	100	400	4:1	400	2000	5:1	Gold/Rainbow	400	1600	4:1	800	8000	10:1								Legendary	400	1600	4:1	2000	8000	4:1	Gold/Rainbow	1600	3200	2:1	4000	16000	4:1\ni understand it just left early access but its driving me crazy how i have this visual glitch, that makes me restart my game to get rid of it.\nI hate when people call games that are not P2W (Pay 2 Win), P2W. most card games i've seen including HS are NOT P2W, i gave them my own title called P2S (Pay 2 Succeed). Why? because the term P2W means u NEED to pay real $$ to get items unobtainable by free players. Which is not true in HS, and (that i've noticed) not true in CaC. So yes you can pay to Advance faster so u dont have to grind, but damn it seems more expensive than HS xD. I never knew that was possible too. For being a very early game and charging 12,000SP (Silver Points [Premium Currency] ) for a PreOrder of a new expansion just like HS. Which is not so uncommon for a Game (HS) because they have a massive company behind them to support them which CaC does not have\n\nFYI: 12,000SP = $50\n\na lot of the HS mechanics seams copied\n\n\nPROs\nYou can have more than 9 deck slots ( Bad news, you need to pay for extra slots with IRL$)\nthe battlefield is a grid so it's different than HS’s gameplay style ( not saying one is harder than the other)\n”Async” lets u play games at your own pace ( never tried it but from what i understand..) it's a mode where you and a friend set up a game and unlike a real time turn based game, whenever one of the players finishes their turn the other player gets a notification to play for up to 1 day.\nSoo.. final thought, sadly i'm going to still play it *cough* friends forced me to *cough*\n\nif anything gets updated that i'm aware of i'll update it here :D\n\nGLHF\n-BOF007\n\nPS: Any questions or concerns post a comment :D\n\n***********\n\nok so i read everything and i am completely undertstanding where i stand now ( i really hoep this post makes sense im super tired o.O) also im ok with the discussion post :D honeslty i was rather surprised.\n\nok idk if u want me to compare it to MoW:FO but i will just briefly, it has the same grid layout ( smaller grind but still a grid) and the win mechanic in MoW is totally different then "face/castle" rush type kills, beacuse in MoW 80% of the time if ur fighting units your doing "face" dmg too. and imo i didnt really see the stratigic aspect of MoW\n\non a side note about CaC:\n\ni only compared CaC to HS so people who have played HS and did not "P2W" *cough* P2S, would understand that it was going to be a long road\nsoley on the aspect of how CaC plays i had to compare it to something 70% of the population is firmliar with because if i state, its a really fun game that feels fast paced than you realise its not a faced paced but was acctually slow paced the whole time, IDK many people that would understand---\nok so... here it is a quickish summary of CaC\nyou play on a grid, with 3-4 cards starting theres buildings that give passive buffs/debuffs, spells and units\nthe objective is to destory the enemy castle, while not losing your own\nyou play minons and try to "outsmart" your opponent, while card favor might be a thing (his/her deck is rated higher because of how powerful the cards it contains are)\nyou may think card favor isnt that big of a deal but it is because in all honesty with most card games ( at least online that i have noticed) 50% of the game is decided before it starts, for instance your playing a rush character while the enemy has "face" heals and distracts so any damage you do is null/void and wasting your time, see my drift?... this does not happen very often in most games... also RNG is a huge factor in ALLLLLLLL card games some more then others but still a factor)\nhmm other things about why I dont personaly enjoy the game\nUI is super glitchy, card searching mechanic is non-existant, actual gameplay seams to be all rush decks, yes u can play controll but it has its hits and misses\nPS: @ ɚʍI̊ɴтʀuΔ if u like the "traditional" card exchange thing ( that i crave but cant find a good game) TRY http://Infinty Wars\nthey also have a much more comprehensive straigic element that ive never seen before, simultaneous turns.\n\nany confusions please ask :D","December 20, 2015","false","9.2"," 119 of 209 people (57%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","57","119","209","9","60"

I'm pretty sure it will be able to stand its own as a PC game as well.\n\nThe comparison to Hearthstone is inevitable as the game borrows heavily from it and is now competing in the same markets, so I will make it a lot, since I guess many people have experienced HS.\n\nThe game is like Hearthstone done right. No RNG bs effects on cards. Fast iteration on card balance (no patrons ruining the game for months). And tons more options for how you use your units thanks to the fact that you have to move them on a chess-like board. All in all a fantastic mix of card strategy and positional tactics.\n\nThe F2P model is very good (basically the same as in HS) and you can get any cards by just playing the game. There is no pressure to buy stuff. Even the scenarios are price accessible (unlike HS)\n\nCons: the artwork is very nice and colorful (if you like that kind of fun-light style) but not very consistent.

This is the first one I'm posting, as I don't think the game deserves less than a "positive" overall opinion.\n\nMy perspective comes from having always enjoyed CCGs and TBS, since earlier days of e.g. Magic: The Gathering and Final Fantasy Tactics/Fire Emblem. Naturally, I was excited to see a game marrying both elements (not that it's the first out there), and I've been playing C&C for months now on mobile. So what's kept me playing, and why should you play, or not play it?\n\nART:\nYMMV. The game goes for a particular cartoonish art style, which you'll like or dislike instantly - just see the screenshots. Clear differences between the 5 factions. If you appreciate the style, the art and animation are excellent. If not, perhaps the game isn't for you. However, there's no reason to diss the graphics as terrible; contemporaneous CCG-type games such as Hearthstone or Card Hunter have totally different art styles which are equally attractive. In comparison, I don't like how March of War looks - it's all personal taste.\n\nMUSIC:\n...adequate for the genre - i.e. turn off in favour of your own music after 1 hour.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n5 factions, which you may choose to play solo, or combine with another faction (e.g. crusader/warlock or warlock/pirate) for a total of 15 different combinations. Playing solo factions gains you access to powerful faction-specific "hero" cards, while including a 2nd faction obviously provides versatility. Factions are distinct with their own playstyle, and quite well-balanced (especially after recent changes to pirates). Also, all deck types are viable - aggro, midrange, control, ramp, whatever type your fevered mind can dream up.\n\nP2WIN-NESS:\nThe obvious bugbear for some. If you're looking to gain a significant collection without putting in any effort, I would suggest against playing any digital CCG-based game.\n\nWhat some people may be sore about is facing players with many epics/legendaries and getting stomped. Do realise - the game has been out on mobile for > 1 year, and many players have near-complete collections. However, many of them haven't paid significant amounts of real $$, and you're getting stomped as they know the game better than you do, not because their cards are significantly better than yours.\n\nThe question is, can you compete as a new player? It's entirely possible with mostly common/uncommon cards, with a smattering of rares. Legendaries are limited to 1 copy each/deck (used to be up to the normal 2 copies/deck until a couple of months ago), which helps to limit their use. Overall, no better or worse than Hearthstone (which seems to be the benchmark, after all) in this aspect.\n\nFinally, no gameplay element is locked behind a real $$ paywall, only cosmetic stuff (e.g. different castle looks) or more deck slots (>9).\n\nACCESSIBILITY:\nBig one for me - the ability to play asynchronous games, which is what I wish Hearthstone had. Not as relevant to the desktop gamer, but hey - you can play on your desktop, and continue to play in short bursts on the go on mobile.\n\n\nCAVEATS:\nI decided against putting in a "Pros" section - I've covered most of the points above. Let the game speak for itself, it's free to try now anyway. However, some caveats are as follows, especially if you're considering putting in real $$.\n\n- As some have pointed out, it's harder to craft epics/legendaries in C&C compared to e.g. Hearthstone. The cost for those was increased a couple of months ago, ostensibly so that crafting them would be harder and actually getting one would be more exciting. ...Whatever the reason, do note that it won't be easy to obtain epics/legendaries without spending at least a little $$.\n- Smaller card pool. Currently, the card pool is in no way comparable to e.g. Hearthstone, even vanilla Hearthstone from way back. I don't feel like there's a lack of variety even after 4-5 months or so of playing, but it's just something to keep in mind. There's an expansion (Age of Dragons) coming up Jan 2016, which will help shake things up.\n- Grindiness. The gold (non-premium currency) earning rate was nerfed, and coupled with the high cost of crafting epics/legendaries, you may feel pushed to spend just to get the juicy looking epics/legendaries. That said, as mentioned above - you can compete (in a fair fashion) using common/uncommon/rare cards. Some figures for the current state of the game - 1 quest per day (generally 800-1200 gold), average of 15-50 gold/win, 1 booster costs 2000 gold ---> 1 booster every 2 days (or slightly less, depending on how much you play). Whether or not you think it's worth your time, you decide.\n- Fluidity. The game has had more significant card/balance changes since its mobile launch days than e.g. Hearthstone, including some changes (e.g. to ranged units, or to many pirates cards) which happened even after the devs posted that they were done with significant changes to gameplay (after the 2.0 update on mobile). While the changes have been beneficial for game balance and shows that the devs are responsive, C&C does not (and may never have) have the stability/polish that the big players (e.g. Hearthstone or MTG) exhibit. To their credit, it's rather hard to match the big boys when you're a small developer with a small team. Anyway, be prepared that what you like/don't like about certain cards/factions can change (sometimes suddenly).\n- Fluctuating business model. Let's just say that changes in costs (both upwards/downwards) for many things (crafting, boosters, the recent "wing-based" expansion, draft tournaments) have made some unhappy. While I would not call out the developers for greed/making the game P2W, they're experimenting as they go, so prices may not be as stable as some would like (definitely not as stable as e.g. Hearthstone). Be prepared before you spend any $$ (although, the premium currency prices have not changed at all since I started playing - what's changed is the costs of what you can buy with it).\n\nTL;DR:\n- All things considered, C&C has lots of charm, and a good degree of game balance/variation. It scratches my itch for a TBS/CCG mashup and isn't overly complex. Furthermore, there are many potential mechanics yet to be explored, so the game has lots of room to grow.\n- The best testament: I stopped playing Hearthstone. I still play C&C.\n- Don't want to get stomped by the pros? Join now! Since it's recently out of early access, more new players will be flooding in. This is the best time to fumble around together :)","December 22, 2015","true","0.1"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","18","29","3","4"

If I would have paid 10$ for this game, I would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It`s a great example of a Fee-to-Pay game, though not as expensive initially as others.\n\nLet´s start with the overall game: People compare this to Hero Academy and Hearthstone, and the collecting and crafting aspect is really reminisent of Hearthstone. I think the game is better compared with Scrolls when it comes to the battles. It has the same resource system, card based system and turn-based play style as Scrolles. I like Scrolles, and I like this game as a "easier"  Scrolls. So, what´s the deal?\n\nMy problems lie in the "Free-to-Play" system of this 10$ game. When I first played it, the pricing was really fair- akin to Hearthstone - you got cards really fast and you could craft your desired cards in a resonable amount of time. But, they made an update to the game since then, that changed the pricing of the card packs and crafting.\n\nSo, what changed exactly?\nBear with me on this one, I think it´s important to compare this game to Hearthstone, which is a real Free-to-play (or win) game, meaning no initial price.\nIf you´re familiar with Hearthstone you know that a cardpack costs 100 gold, this gold is the only currency in Hearthstone, meaning you can also buy it with real money. This game has a premium currency, I´ll talk more about that later, first I want to get to the crafting.\nThere are 4 rarities in both of these games (Common-Rare-Epic-Legendary).\nHearthstones crafting table goes as follows: Commons cost 40 Dust to craft and give 5 when disenchanted (de), Rares cost 125 and give 25, Epics cost 400 and give 100 and Legendaries cost 1600 and give 400. This means you need 320 commons for a legendary which sounds like a lot, but out of 5 cards in a pack, up to 4 are common.\nBefore the update this game had a price system that was nearly identical (packs costing 300 in-game money, with 5 cards in each pack, but legendaries and epics were cheaper to make).\nWell, after this update, the prices in this game changed drastically. Packs cost 2000 in-game money now (7x rise), whereas the reward for a win rose from 15 to 45... Good luck winning 45 games for one pack.\nThe crafting prices rose for epics from 400 to make them to 4000 (10x rise) legendaries rose from around 1400 to 8000 (~5x rise), they do give 1000 back when disenchanted. Meanwhile a common gives 4, so you need 2000 commons for one legendary, compare that to Hearthstone again, where it´s 320.\n\nLastly, the premium currency. It´s extremly overpriced, the upcoming single-player adventure will cost you 30$, a super offer of 42 packs with one guranteed legendary will only cost you around 55$. What a steal!\n\nBefore this update the game was great, but now it shows the worst that Fee- and Free-to-Play have to offer.\nStay far away from this if you don´t want to grind for all eternity for every little bit of progress.\n\n\nP.S.: Please, don´t take this as advertisement for Hearthstone, it was just the perfect comparision, because both ames had a similiar pricing model.","October 20, 2015","false","5.8"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","20","33","3","0"

Everthing got worse. Dual faction decks are now complete senseless, because you can't do missions with them. Playing without missions wont give you CPs anymore (before you got up to 100 CP per win =  step forward to pay2win ) and because they won't give you monthly prices anymore, there is no sense in leveling (=playing) at all. The tournaments now can only played at two days per week (before you could play as often you liked and it was never a problem to find an enemy to fight with, so there was no reason to change that) and since you need CPs for that, it is even worse you dont get CP anymore for your wins.\n\nI liked the game and played it alot.

The daily mission get you enough CP to play the tournaments, which are still fun.","March 25","false","182.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

You can earn all these cards for free I earned plenty playing without ever spending a dime and I dont ever plan to.

However, you still stand a strong chance of winning, although I must admit, the game has become rather frustrating for me to play considering the fact that I've played this game upon first release on steam. The game is forever changing and strategies become null after an update.\nYou have to remain forever updated on the game otherwise you stand no chance of winning these days. Strategies have become based around the new expansion of which costs quite some money, so If you want to play this game purely to win, I must now recommend against it. I wouldn't even bother with free-to-play because as all free-to-plays go... You have to pay to stand chances of getting some wins under your belt.\nI have the new expansion, because the game in my opinion is worth it, but the very idea of having to pay to win is sickening and most developers are following this scheme. Play at your own risk.\n\nalthough the strong negative above indicates you should navigate away from this game, I stil recommend it as it will eventually become free to play, but for the concept that you're paying for the game, as well as expansions is rather a bold choice by the developers. I would not recommend buying this game, however i still recommend playing.)\n\nCards and castles is a fantastic card game, I've played and won 12 out of 15 games thus far, and I am completely new to the game. The tutorials to the game are extremely useful so If one desires to buy the game or play the game when this eventually becomes free to play, I recommend doing the tutorials, as you will level up decks you have and have time to acquire new cards. Highly recommended the scenarios long before multiplayer is played, for the most part you will be at a disadvantage for the lack of cards gained in the early moments of playing.\n\nThis game is rather fair in the fact that all players have equal opportunities to gather the same cards as one another so you will never be at a disadvantage upon completing the tutorial/scenario aspect of the game.\n\nIf you're going to play this game and then decide to buy booster packs with the free CP you get, I would strongly recommend playing the draft mode as you are guaranteed a booster pack and a chance to win more for only 450CP. So why wouldn't you do this?\n\nI strongly recommend this game if you like card games, as this is especially close to hearthstone, although as most would probably hate to admit but is a whole lot more fun, for me at least to play this over hearthstone as it adds more of a twist of not only deck creation but unit stances within the actual game itself, heavily introducing more aspects of strategy into the card game.\n\nI've only played 11.9 hours as of current writing review, and I feel a strong amount of hours being placed into the game, and is definitely worth investing into.\n\nThe positive\n- The game is entirely fair and gives everyone a chance to succeed at the game.\n- The game has a strong variety of cards and a vast variety of strategies that can be made.\n- The game can be very irratating at times, but isn't this what keeps us coming back for more?\n- You can get Easy credit points, currency to buy cards and draft mode with quests every day to give play time a meaning. As well as an easy to understand tutorial that gets you understanding of the games mechanics right off the bat.\n- Quick and easy experience to level up fast which offers a chance to level up fast and earn new cards for different factions.\n\nThe negative:\n- Not so much a negative however, if you're impatient and want to get right into multiplayer, you are indeed going to be at a disadvantage and would be most beneficial for you to get started on the tutorial and scenario for extra cards.\n- The game has strong incoming pay to win aspects. The new expansion, which costs a heck ton of money, for minimal bonus cards, and then new cards that require shards to make, make the game stupidly frustrating at times to go against.\n\nNote There is a shop section where you can buy cards and the question would arise: "Is this game pay to win?" absolutely not would be my answer. Although the paying for cards strongly reduces the need to play the tutorial and scenario section for the extra cards and makes acquiring cards much quicker with the use of money. If you wanna save yourself some time and get "starter" decks custom built for you then It's a minimal investment of $4.99 which equates to something like £1.75 to £2.50 which is actually rather decent in comparison to some investments I have seen in some trading card games, Ahem  Magic duels... cough magic 2015.\n\nThis game in my opinion has been the most enjoyable 11.9 hours of card games I've played in my life and I am going to enjoy plenty more hours in this game!\n\nI Hope this has helped some of you come to a conclusion on the game, I'll see you on multiplayer!","October 7, 2015","true","124.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","16","26","2","3"

Incorporating cards, this game ran a particular risk in that it could easily become heavily P2W, require too much time to attain necessary game elements, and/or botch its game board element by way of card abilities.\n\nThis game avoided all of the vices.\n\nCards and Castles upholds the virtues of its genre(s). As of its most recent patch, it is highly balanced and increasingly so. It lets you jump in head first without stripping the player of all merit-based reward. And perhaps most importantly: The game is FUN. With my first 100 hours of gameplay, I can safely say that the game has lots of steam left in it. You can  enjoy this game in passing moments via Asynchronous play, in short sessions to test new decks via friendly mode, or grind it out over time toward the heralded Rank 1 in ranked mode. Each option grants the full Cards and Castles experience in its own way.\n\nI look forward to continued improvements. Slight bugs persist, but they are addressed quickly. Connection issues have improved rapidly. Never before have I messaged about slight issues and had the lead game developer personally respond about the status of the fix toward the issues I had brought to light.\n\nThis is the work of people who know what they are doing and anyone would be wise to jump in early and grow alongside the game.","November 23, 2015","true","251.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

Easy to play and if you're into Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, then this is a match for you. Tutorial was too easy, as you can do literally what you want and still win. Pay attention on what cards do - cleave, charge etc. -  and you're on a good start. Sometimes, client freezes when going into the 'Cards' menu. Sadly, you can 'pay to win', which kinda destroys the fun and joy.\n\nWhat to delete/fix/add:\n\n- A certain utility tower, (can't remember the name) that does 1 damage to every enemy unit on the start of your turn is just overpowered, if the enemy has a hard time attacking you.\n- Evaluate ideas on how to get a fair matchup, so you don't end up against people with extreme cards at Rank 20.\n- Some cards have a pretty extreme charge-range. A possible -1 would be more realistic.\n\nTips:\n\n- Defend your Shaman.\n- Range cards are extremely good, if you can keep positioning you out of melee range.\n\n\nTutorial: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 7/10\n\nOverall: 7/10\n\nPAY TO WIN RUINS IT!","December 20, 2015","true","3.2"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","17","29","3","0"

The game gives you cards, currency and premium currency dailey albiet at a very slow rate. You can complete quests for more cards and the higher you climb in the ranks the better the boosters you get. It's basically hearthstone with a grid which makes the game less predictable and it adds a bunch of mechanisms to make the grid interesting. It also lets you combine two of the five factions in a deck to suit your own play style. I found it very hard to win any matches at all in hearthstone as a new player with few cards, I still get beat a lot in cards and castles but I can complete my quests each day without too much frustration.

As you play the game you earn points that you use to buy boosters, you can choose to spend real money to advance faster in order to build your dream deck faster, which is pretty standard monitization strategy in this genre.\n\nCards and Castles is an iOS/android port, it has existed as a mobile game for close to 2 years now. The UI is still optimized for mobile. Gameplay itself looks fine, but the Store and Deck building menus could use some work for PC.\n\nHaving this client on Steam is great for people who play the game already on their phone and come home and want to sit down on a nice desk chair. The art has a flash style to it, similar to that you'd find on Kongregate. To me it looks nice, its cute, and is polished.\n\nMechanicially there are 5 factions, with their own flavors. I haven't spent too much time to really break down the Meta game, but they're flavorfull first and foremost. For me, as Vikings, I place units, back them up with range units, and play an occasional spell to buff them. I've played through the practice modes to unlock each of the factions, but haven't played the multiplayer yet.\n\nThe single player champaign does need to be unlocked, which is unfortunate, if you wish to continue playing solo you'll have to spend some of the hard earned CP that you have to continue the missions, which seems rather silly.\n\nWhile going through the menu's I did run into a disconnection once, and it took a while for the connection error to go away for me to continue my trial of the game.\n\nVerdict: 7 / 10","December 17, 2015","true","3.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Given the nature of the genre, these are my early thoughts.\n\nPicked this up in the recent Bundle Stars Crazy Loot Bundle. Not expecting much I booted it up and was pleasantly surprised in both the depth and scale of the game.\n\nCards and Castles is a crazy mash up between Hearthstone / Hero Academy and dollop of Chess. I’m fairly new to all these collectible card games and count myself a novice at best, when it comes to the strategy involved in creating decks etc. The tutorial scenario shows you the ropes, as to the basic ruleset and gameplay flow.\n\nInstead of a static board like Hearthstone, the playfield is much like a rectangle chess board with each player's castle positioned at each end. You spent gold to place units on the board and then move them towards your opponent. As in Chess, units have various movement attributes. Extra game mechanics are added with units also having different stats health / attack points. You have spells and static building which add yet more buffs.\n\nI love the artstyle of the game. The 5 different factions all have character and kind of remind me of Kingdom Rush. The music is fairly generic squeezebox medieval type tackle.\n\nGiven the size of the Bit Mass team, they should have no hope competing against the behemoth that is Blizzard, in any kind of genre. C&C may not have the polish, but it adds something fresh to mix which is movement / placement of units / buildings. It's a very potent and addictive cocktail of strategy goodness.\n\nI’ve only put in 7+ hours, but I can see myself playing a lot more. To have a hearthstone-esk game on Steam is great and considering what I paid for the game, I’d recommend it to any fan of CCG’s.","October 18, 2015","true","25.5"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

While this does create overall balance, it also favours new cards and favours those who can quickly obtain the new cards.\n- Nice art, I like the art style. You can see from the pictures displayed whether you like it or not.\n- Somewhat strategic, alot of the strategy involves building decks out of cards, but there is some strategy while playing. Note alot of the performance is dictated by the draw.\n- Pretty active and responsive developers, - They listen to the community when it comes to card balances.\n\n\nCons:\n- Greatly favours those who pay money\n- Slightly difficult for those who recently start the game to be very competitive as they don't really have a wide range of cards.\n- Because of the sychronizations of different cards, this does cause metas. Often combinations of different factions (note there are 5 factions and this dictates the range of cards you can choose from) always utilize a unit, spell, building or synergies of multiple cards.\n\nOverall I enjoy it and rate it 7/10.\n\np.s Thanks to some of the negative reviews highlighting the bad card recycling ratio, it has been changed.","December 19, 2015","true","5.8"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","16","29","2","0"

That's not to say that the game is bad. No, it has a surprising amount of depth and strategy, and the board-game aspect only helps to differentiate it from other TCGs, a genre that can easily feel too repetitive. But this review feels incomplete, because I feel as if I've yet to play any of the game. The game starts you off with 5 pre-built decks, and the time it takes for you to grind up and build your own functioning deck that's better than one of the basic pre-built ones is ... Well, I don't know. I have 10 hours in the game, grinding only one deck type and it's still inferior. There's a few campaigns you can do without paying real life money, and they can sort of seem fun, but I just want to be able to make a deck and play with my friends. The prebuilt decks also seem ridiculously imbalanced when fighting eachother, so even casually playing with your friends on that most basic level isn't really an option.\n\n'Pay to win' isn't really accurate. It's pay to play without the Steam price-tag.","February 7","false","12.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Gameplay is fun and balance updates occur frequently which is a blessing and a curse. On one hand, overpowered strategies are made fair in a timely manner, but on the other, cards that take a long time to earn (or were bought using real money) are nerfed or changed. I can see why someone would get mad at that, but I don't personally mind. I started playing, on and off, very early in the game's development and as such, I developed a good collection of cards. It takes a while to earn really powerful cards and losing to rare cards in ladder can be frustrating. Pulling a legendary in a pack or earning the shards to craft one is extremely rewarding, however.\n\nThis game, in my opinion, is a little bit niche and won't appeal to everyone. If you're into card games like MtG and Hearthstone and like strategy games like Poxnora or Final Fantasy Tactics, I'd recommend giving this a try. Just don't expect to win all your games if you don't spend a lot of time grinding or using money.","April 5","true","80.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's just a bit of a bummer that in the tutorials of the game this isn't clearly highlighted. Or i just missed i dont know, but if i did, my bad.\nThanks to kilpper for clearing that out!.\n\nIt looks hella cute. It's a cool mix of Hearthstone, Duelyst, even Card wars in a blender. I like the feel of it, it assumes itself the way it is and it gives it charm. Games aren't too long nor too quick\n\nHowever, there's a couple of things missing in my opinion, especially this: In the 4 games i played, i got this ''stalemate'' message 3 times, either for me or my opponent. Basically, it tells you that when you run out of cards, your castle will now loose 2 hp each turn. Fine by me, but until now i havn't seen the counter of my cards left in my deck. I did search in the options, did check on the interface from one corner to the other, nothing. And then the most awkward thing happens when both players runs out of cards... They just watch eachother slowly die. I think that isn't fun.\nIt's missing a little something, either a counter of how many cards are left in the deck OR another way of countering this like, i don't know, you get a random number of cards back in your hand from your graveyard based on the hp left on your castle and then from there you try and save yourself from this situation? I dont know, it was just a quick idea.. :/\n\nOverall this game in my opinion is so close to be done if anything if left to be done, it looks good, feels good, easy game for beginners and veterans of similar games.","December 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I'd really recommend this game! The art style is oddly pleasing and has a children's game vibe to it but don't be mistaken lots of thinking has to be made for a game like this. What cards to be put in a deck? will this card benefit? etc. If you like virtual card games that requires you to trade like mad or buy at unreasonable prices to craft badges and gain exp for levels that don't matter, don't buy this, stick with Steam!

It's easy to pick up but hard to master. It's a card building game that you simply can't put down.\nEarn cards by reaching certain levels or defeating certain enemies. Buy packs if that's something you're interested in. It plays well by itself that you don't need to invest real money beyond what it cost to buy the game but if you like the guranteed notion of a Rare, Epic, or Legendary cards, than investing some green might be the thing for you.\n\nIt offers a multiplayer mode and it's a hopping place. I haven't waiting more than a minute for an oppenent at all times of day and night. You can also enter tournaments, play scenarios, or invite your friends to a hearty battle. It has a good selection to choose from regarding game play.\n\nWhat I really like about this game though is that I'm not stuck with the deck I built. I can go in and edit it or build a completely new deck AND keep my old one if I want. Combinations seem endless and I've spent so much time trying to build the perfect deck.

They added another element in here that just spices up the gameplay a bit more and makes you think about how you play your cards and how you make your moves. It's exactly for that reason that I find it more enjoyable.\n\nOne of the best things for me with this game is that it's 'alive' and what I mean with that is when you play hearthstone you just sit and watch how your card jumps ontop of another card. It really feels like I'm playing a card game face to face with literally nothing interesting happening on the screen. Cards and Castles doesn't have that. The characters you play are on the screen, they move and interact with the others. It just feels more like a game to me and the simple yet cute artstyle is exactly what I love about it.\n\nI tried several games like this that share the genre but the problem that I have with it is that: Most of it has lore or things that I'm not aware of. Hearthstone is being used as example here yet again. It's tied in with the WoW lore and while I find the games of this genre simple to play because you understand what you have to do, I'm not drawn to WoW so I miss a huge part of the excitement of familiar characters and places. Same with Magic the Gathering games. This game doesn't have that though and that's exactly what I need. I can just pick it up and play without having to go deep into lore.\n\nFun, simple and addicting. Finally a game of this genre I can enjoy without too much thinking and lucky lucky I can use my account for a mobile device and play on the train as well.\n\nIt's cute, simple and addictive. And just packs a little more interaction than one would expect from a card game like this.","December 15, 2015","true","16.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

To its credit, C&C is quite accessible without monetary investments: daily quests have reasonable objectives (so far), completing 2 or 3 of them will allow you to gain a booster pack but the campaigns offer more advantageous rewards while constituting proper gaming content.\n\nBest not to look into the shop page period. I balked at the day-one opening sales pitch as the high-pressure sales tactic that it is. An offer of 99.00$ as "best value" for silver points nearly made me uninstall. No, the proper way to enjoy C&C is by playing practice matches until you're past level 5, doing the daily quests whenever you can and going through the campaigns. I recommend C&C as a side game: something to play between sessions of some other game you bought as a relaxing alternative.\n\nThere's ONE change I'd want to make. Presently, in the grid-based arena that is C&C, troops can pass through enemy units like they just aren't there. I'm sure there was plenty of play-testing involved before developers reached a decision but when you make a design choice to have all of your action happen on a grid, then movement matters and therefore obstacles must be an option so that movement has value. Right now movement only has value in the amount of turns it takes to reach the target and this is robbing the game of a primal strategic aspect. Make passing or blocking a keyword but obstacles need to happen if you want people to appreciate the differences between that and Heartstone!\n\nC&C is a free, casual and approachable TCG with a great forum community that offers enough content to be worth the experience. Balance between factions is great and a cursory amount of research was enough to make me aware of the effort that was put into this product. I especially recommend this product to fellow players disabused by the increasingly competitive nature of Heartstone and Mythic-centric MtG. Campaigns, not competition make this experience worth it.","December 24, 2015","true","18.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

To its credit, C&C is quite accessible without monetary investments: daily quests have reasonable objectives (so far), completing 2 or 3 of them will allow you to gain a booster pack but the campaigns offer more advantageous rewards while constituting proper gaming content.\n\nBest not to look into the shop page period. I balked at the day-one opening sales pitch as the high-pressure sales tactic that it is. An offer of 99.00$ as "best value" for silver points nearly made me uninstall. No, the proper way to enjoy C&C is by playing practice matches until you're past level 5, doing the daily quests whenever you can and going through the campaigns. I recommend C&C as a side game: something to play between sessions of some other game you bought as a relaxing alternative.\n\nThere's ONE change I'd want to make. Presently, in the grid-based arena that is C&C, troops can pass through enemy units like they just aren't there. I'm sure there was plenty of play-testing involved before developers reached a decision but when you make a design choice to have all of your action happen on a grid, then movement matters and therefore obstacles must be an option so that movement has value. Right now movement only has value in the amount of turns it takes to reach the target and this is robbing the game of a primal strategic aspect. Make passing or blocking a keyword but obstacles need to happen if you want people to appreciate the differences between that and Heartstone!\n\nC&C is a free, casual and approachable TCG with a great forum community that offers enough content to be worth the experience. Balance between factions is great and a cursory amount of research was enough to make me aware of the effort that was put into this product. I especially recommend this product to fellow players disabused by the increasingly competitive nature of Heartstone and Mythic-centric MtG. Campaigns, not competition make this experience worth it.","December 24, 2015","true","18.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The game is good as a F2P, but the 10$ price tag might hinder the experience for some.\n\nGameplay: It's good. You play on a grid-based board, and your pawns are unit cards that you deploy. Plays a lot like other CCGs, but the board differentiates the gameplay enough from the others.\n\nGraphics: Cartoony and kinda comical. I like it, you might like it you might not. The card arts are beautiful, the sprite arts are decent.\n\nBusiness: Probably disappointing. There has been a lot of back and forth with some of the content and pricing (the single player DLC (and the card rewards) which costs 45$ or months of grinding has been moved to the packs, making it kinda free). But with the Steam release, this shouldn't be happening again.\n\nOverall, get the game, it's free now.","December 18, 2015","true","64.7"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","11","23","2","1"

To give a quick example, from the practice games, pirates have more AoE and single target damage than warlock, who focuses on it.\n\nYou do not start out with enough cards to make your own deck to play in the practice games, and there's no indication of that. Even after a few levels (Say, 4), you still have a good chance of not having the cards that you need to fill out a 30 card deck.\n\nThe game is somewhat buggy - I've rerolled a daily quest to get nothing in return before.\n\nToo much of the game's element seeks to borrow from Hearthstone without taking advantage of its own unique system of strategy game. Some of the elements borrowed from Hearthstone works poorly.\n\nThe building concept it interesting, but should be expanded upon. Currently they are passive "Enchantments" that can be destroyed by units, and there's not a lot of interaction beyond "Let it trigger, or destroy it". Perhaps something like a Watchtower that gives ranged unit 1 additional range if they "ride" on it? ... Well, this isn't a place for suggestions.\n\nKeyword references sometimes do not show up, but this may be a bug. There are some interesting keywords such as Lightning, however.\n\nMultiplayer experience is mostly summed up with "He who strikes first loses". If you attack first, you still get retaliated with attacks, giving the player little incentive to strike first, since you not only put yourself into a worse position, but they are free to play units and immediately strike at you, creating very unfair trades (Especially with ranged units). Vikings will clump their units up and wait for an oppotunity to buff all their units with spells, while warlocks and pirates can somewhat counter that with AoE spells.\n\nIt's a good starting place and engine, but the content in itself isn't enough of a game for me to recommend this to anyone else.\n\nShould I be proven wrong with more hours put in, I would be happy to change my review.","December 20, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

That, combined with Early Access, spells Quick Cash Grab.\n\nThe game itself is fairly mundane and uninteresting. Standard simple battle game with a grid that's so small and cramped it doesn't add much in the way of strategy and may as well not really exist.\n\nIf you want an interesting strategic card game, I recommend Magic: The Gathering, and if you want a free to play good/easy/fun card game, I recommend Hearthstone.

I personally would spend the same amount on GTA5 during sales.\n\nIt is perfectly fine for developers to make money out of their games. But such pricing strategy will definitely put off a lot of casual gamers and thus kill the multiplayer.\n\nThis game will be dead within its early access period.","October 23, 2015","false","4.3"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/verrikan/recommended/360730/","verrikan","Arakis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/verrikan/","69 products in account","This game is a cash grab.\n\nWhile possessing a relatively entertaining premise, this game is typical of the free to play (pay to win) genre. Though polished in appearance, passable graphics can't hide the basic nature of the game. The in game points can buy only one item in the shop, and at an excessive cost. The same points are also needed to unlock the almost entirely absent one player portion of the game, and with the primary method to getting more of these points winning pvp matches that are completely lacking in balancing, it is something that can take you a few hours to achieve. Compare this to the points purchased with -actual- currency which will give buyers a head start on anyone that was looking for a free (and fun) time killer. Not to mention the 10:1 presence of items purchasable with the cash currency, compared to the 'free' points (which themselves can be bought with real money). In part due to its recent launch, the game will have you waiting a while when trying to find an opponent for the pvp matches, not that it matters since once you get into a match ranked or non your odds of standing a chance are directly dependent on your cash investment for 4/5ths of those matches. This game should have stayed in testing a good while longer to flesh it out more and make it a fun game instead of a shameful cash grab that has visibly more time invested in how to get you to pay than in how to get you to have fun. It is free to play so you don't risk anything other than time, but for me at least it is time I could have better spent elsewhere.","December 22, 2015","false","4.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

They sell 1 Legendary per day to people who have money. These Legendary cards are so powerful and hard to get, that it imbalances the game. For normal people who don't pay, you have to disenchant your cards to get Shards, then buy the Legendary.\n\nBased on my screenshots, the current exchange rate is 1200 Silver Points for 1 Legendary.

Many of the same mechanics of Hearthstone are implemented including the mana curve. It's simple to learn but a lot harder to understand exactly what it takes to win. The tutorial was helpful but it was only after many tournament runs (hearthstone's arena equivalent) that I had a full grasp on the game. Legendaries are not as game breaking and are balanced with the rest of the cards. There are some cards that are above the curve in terms of strength but seeing how it is a young game, I'll let it slide. I love the artwork especially, the captivating visuals make it easy on the eyes.\n\nOverall, it's a good game. The lack of a strong player base causes queue times for high tournament wins to be lengthy but it's manageable. With it's refreshing and simple design, it brings me back to the old days of hearthstone and the learning experience of it all. Highly recommended.","December 27, 2015","true","37.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyxmir/recommended/360730/","wyxmir","Moe Terminator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wyxmir/","108 products in account","At the time of writing this review. I'm a brand new player who just started a couple days ago. I only have about 18 hours in and I sunk 10 dollars in for the hell of it because I'm very much enjoying the game. I bought the Warlock campaign and a beginner only 5 booster pack bundle. I've completed the first two parts of the Warlock campaign and I'm currently stuck on the Open Mind scenario in part three. Wether it's because I'm bad or not I'm unsure, but I feel it's because I lack the deck building ability and cards I need. I've completed both The Ancient Hero and Tournament campaigns with minimal effort just took trial and error to learn the ropes. I also did my first free tournament and got utterly and completely trashed (as expected)\n\nNow that my history is out of the way, I can safely say this is a GOOD game with a couple glaring flaws in my opinion. I believe shop costs are perfectly fine. As long as you do your quests and wind a few matches a day you can build up plenty of points to purchase packs and the non special campaigns. Though at the pace I'm at I highly doubt i will be playing any ranked at all for a long time unless if i were to drop a significant amount of money to get to the point where I can build a solid deck I'm super comfortable with. Though I will say this the game is very well balanced as far as I can tell. It's not like you can't win with economy decks but if the person is plain better than you and has plenty of good cards you don't stand a chance. The game is mostly skill and it should be. The factions are creative and the combinations you can make are plentyful, though I don't know the metagame because I've mostly been experimenting on my own. I've found comfort in a Crusader/Warlock deck the most so far.\n\nAs for flaws. The game is, I feel, very beginner unfriendly towards crafting. When required cards cost at least 400 all the way to 8000 shards to craft and you only get 10 to 20 shards per card scrap that's just unsightly and plain bad. It's very demoralizing and I find no way to be able to surmount to those costs anytime in the near future. Really demoralizes me and makes me feel shafted. And another tournament costs. 12000 CP to enter a tournament? really? A card pack costs 2000 CP already, which i believe is a fair price, but 12000 is way steep. That takes DAYS of saving for (this is my immediate impression, correct me if im wrong) ALL players, especially newer ones where they will easily feel their CP is better spent on packs. I have no way to try out new cards and feel out decks and know what i cards i want in teh future if i cant play in tourneys. Not to mention tourney's are the only place in the current game where you can play on fair footing with everyone.\n\nBut I digress, I have fallen in love with the game. I really like it. But in the end I feel like it's a great game with a couple BIG flaws. I plan to keep playing, and I want to get into it and try hard and be good at it, but I just feel it's a little impossible at this stage for me. I do recommend it to anyone who will play casually and not care about being competitive. Would advise those looking to be competitive that to be satisfied you'll either need to drop a good bit of cash (because ten dollars won't cut it) or pray and wait for game changes.\n\n","December 23, 2015","true","24.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Pay to win is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t name for those kind of game.\n\nThis game also push out rush mentality, because cheap units move very fast (3 spaces in a 9 space lane) with natural Haste and high cost cards are very strong.

Sure, there's one free campaign planned.  But there are also five paid ones, which will together cost either $35 or 250,000 of the in-game currency.  Is this a joke?

Then I had to build a new deck, however, it was not possible, or did not seem to be, to scroll through all of the cards to select them. The game did not fit in the window I was playing in and there was no way to change the size of the window. It is early access, so hopefully they will fix this. Also, after finishing the scenarios, the only options were to vs other players.

This would be a very nice simple game with some strategy elements and pretty cartoonish graphics. You play against AI or other players, by winning you get coins and with those you buy packs with new cards. BUT. There's this currency. Crystals or something like that. Bought currency that actually unlocks parts of the game you're basically unable to access. Without them getting new cards is unbearably slow. You even have locked whole story mode except the 1st episode... like, what the hell is that? It's a very nice concept, but too simple to suck money out of people.","November 1, 2015","false","3.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

It is simple, easy to learn, not pay to win, and honestly doesn't have any crazy gimmicks to try to keep you playing, because its just good enough without them!. There are six deck factions, each with there own building, unit and spell cards. The factions are Vikings, Ninjas, Pirates, Warlocks, Crusaders, and Neutral. Each deck can only be comprised of neutral cards and one factions cards. as you play the cards in game they become playable pieces on a grid like board for you to command and move around your units for battle. The goal is to try to lower your opponents castle health to zero.\n\nThe game doesn't really have much more to it than that, but the gameplay is so simple and effective that it makes you want to not stop, something that for me personally is hard for a card game to do. Id recommend it to anyone who is a fan of free to play card games, and wants one they can play with pretty much anyone.","December 18, 2015","true","4.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

I'll put a pros and cons list shall I...\nPro's, free to play and rather intriguing at first.\nCons, and there is a few of them when you really start playing it properly. So first of all the micro transactions are very real. For you to open a booster pack would take nearly an hour of grinding for example. The objectives at first are rather easy and you get a few booster packs here n there but good luck getting something good you can use... On top of this it takes nearly 2000 of these coins that you earn to open one single booster pack that contains 5 cards which are completely random. Secondly it literally forces you to play certain factions or you will literally lose. If you don't play the other factions you get nothing but really bad cards over and over again. I'm talking I went down to around 10 "castle" damage before I even got a creature out on the board..... TWICE. I laughed so hard at this pathetic attempt to force you to try out all the factions. These games are about diversity and you've took that away aswell as stuck a bunch of micro transactions inside it. I even tried to go online for my first time, is there any sort of skill based match making ? Is there hell! There is a ranked based match making but I couldn't play that without my own deck which funny enough I didn't have enough cards to make said deck... You see where I'm going right! So I went onto friendly thinking everybody would be on about the same level as me with the same cards... NOPE. No such luck. I literally got put up against somebody who had epic cards at nearly every draw and I got 3 creatures out on the board before he was already attacking me..... I tried out the campaign. I had to use my "CP" that I had earned grinding through the pathetic attempt at forcing me to play each faction. Literally half my CP and I thought, okay then there must be some kind of reward at the end of it... Please don't be stupid. You end up with around 250 extra CP. Even though this game is completely dependant on the draw of your hand the computer gives no Eff's. Just starts throwing out cards that have abilities like "do critical damage." This is not worth the 250 cp that would be grinding for around 1 and a half hours+\n\nSo you ask me do I recommend a game that is riddled with microtransactions and boarderline senseless acts at trying to force them on me ?\n\nWould I hell...","December 19, 2015","false","1.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Similar to Hearthstone for those who know of it. Visually speaking it is mediocre, cartoonish, and not very imaginative. The theme is castles and medieval times, which is okay I suppose for this type of game, but there is little to no imagination in the way they went about putting everything together. The AI is also not as complex as other card collecting turn-based strategy games, as I completed all 5 stages of the tutorial as well as 3 practice matches without even coming close to losing, whereas with Hearthstone I had to carefully plan out each move and think ahead, with Cards and Castles, strategy wasn't as important because sometimes the AI didn't even bother drawing a card, especially if I was close to beating it. Personally, I think you can do better if you like these types of games.

It is a buy to play - early access - pay to win game. This game is nothing but a scam and an insult towards all PC gamers.\nDevelopers acctualy ask money from people now in order to play their their games at a beta/alpha stage ( that never acctualy imrpove ).\n\nthere are two reviews posted already for this game and they are either shills or drones. here is a quote from one of them : " The F2P model is very good (basically the same as in HS) and you can get any cards by just playing the game "\n\nThere is nothing good about HS free to play model. When the game was released it was ok but now after all the advaentures and expansions a free to play option is a joke.\n\nThis game is the same, a huge grind that puts you at a big disadvantage against those who pay.\n\nBut hey I guess when it comes to gamers their time /life has zero importance to these developers so if you can unlock something by grinding 10 hours a day every day then it is all fine and the game is not pay to win. Yeah, right...\n\nAnother shill/drone in his positive review posted this ' Controls 10/10\nWork just like they did on mobile and it just....works. "\nNo, controls are far from 10/10. Drag and drop controls do not work in a good way at all.\n\nThe game copide some other stuff from Hearthstone also ( another game i would recomend to stay away from also ).\nSo again we have a game where there is zero comunication betwen players.\n"toxic" community  and ' trolls ' is an excuse used for this. That of course has nothing to do with it. OPTIONAL chat would solve that problem easily. You do not want to talk to somen? Fine, just turn OFF the chat or add an option to block from the chat some individuals.\n\nIt is 2015 and we have less and less options in games. There should be a voice and text chat. And I repeat OPTIONAL one.\n\nBut hay these "smart" developers add those irritating emotes from hearthstone that most people acctualy do not like so it is "greetings" "sorry" " thank you" all over again. These time only with speach bubble and no way to disable that at all.\n\n- The game is locked at 60 fps. I guess these developers have never heard of 120hz monitors or maybe they still live in a fantasy land where ' human eye can only see 30 fps ... " or maybe they are your typical developers with no intentions to imrove the game where some people will not notice.\n\n- The game it self does not look that bad if you like the childish art . i personaly do not, but that is a matter of taste. The semi 2D look is ok and the overall look is easy on the eyes.\n\n- There is a problem with the cards in your hand. The picture is cut too much. You basically see just the tip of the card instead of the full art.\n\n- Sound is not that good. Some sound effects like the card drawing are just irritating.\n\n- Gameplay it self is also not that good . It becomes borring real fast.\n\nWhat you can expect from this game in the future is the same thing like in Hearthstone. More expansions with OP cards in order to force you to buy them and the game becoming more and more pay to win.\n\n\nDo your self a favor and do not waste your money on this game. At least wait until this  early access scam ends and test the game for free then.\n\nupdate: and they copied another bad thing from moneystone also. There is no trading option, so when you get the copies of the cards you already have you can disechant them. Anyone who has played HS knows you have to destroy like 4 rare cards in order to build one. That is a terible ratio.\nIt seems in this game ratio is similar to that also.\n\nLike i said, only thing you can expect from this " game " is for it to become worse and worse.","September 18, 2015","false","1.8"," 23 of 64 people (36%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","36","23","64","3","0"

The music may actually be my favorite part though--the tunes just never get old!","February 9","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bigger units have loads of health and no way to insta kill them, the lowwer units die by every thing imaginable. Spells do a lot, and buildings seem weak. The look and feel of the game is very enjoyable tho. by no means a pro but It feels like a godo time waster and why else would you play card games ;).","February 5","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
