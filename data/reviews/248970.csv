Based on the video, I was expecting a bit more control over the action.  The gamplay is too simple to keep me interested, but people who like simple tap-on-time games might like it.\n\nIt's a "hit the button on cue" game.  The guy automatically runs, and you have to press up, down, left or right on cue to make him jump, slide, or speed up.  Special tricks other than those basic moves are done by hitting the up arrow when you're right underneath a 'special trick' cue block.  You can't do any trick at any time.  You can jump or slide, but not speed up or choose how you vault over an object.\n\nThere are no options other than resolution, and there's no gamepad support.  (You'd have to use JoyToKey to assign keyboard mappings to your gamepad.)  You can't change key bindings.\n\nIt has user profile support, so if more than one person plays on your Steam account they can do so without changing your progress.  There doesn't seem to be any reason for this though, because there's only one way to do any given level, and you can go back and redo them at any time.\n\nIt's not a bad game or anything.  The animation is really well done, and the moves flow really well.  It plays like a lot of online Flash games, where something complex is happening and you introduce mild changes to it by tapping a button at a specific time.\n\n[EDIT]:\nI was getting complaints that people thought I hadn't put enough time into the game to form a good opinion.  So, I dove back in.\n\nAs a result, I'm downgrading my review.  In addition to the gameplay being mind numbingly boring and not delivering on gamepad support (which has since been removed from the store page), there are critical gameplay issues.\n\nFirst, you have almost no control over what move the guy does to pass an obstacle.  He might vault it, or he might jump.  The game does seem to take a cue from how close you are to it, but it's a very small target and it makes a lot of difference to where you end up when you regain character control.\n\nSecond, whereas he's pretty smart about picking cool-looking moves, he's dumb as a sack of bricks when it comes to jump distance.  You can't hop between platforms if they're too close.  You'd think he'd figure it out, but he's like "Nope, you pushed up, I'm going for full air-time even if it makes no sense and I fall down that pit."  I thought game devs had figured this mechanic out with Mario 1 for NES, but no, apparently not.\n\nThird, you very often find that although you think you did fine in a level and picked up all of the pickups, you do not have enough to buy the next level's skills.  You have to either go back and grind that level again, or just play the next level without its extra tricks.\n\nFourth, I was told world 2 was better and I should get to it before judging.  Well, turned out after I suffered through world 1, I didn't have enough stuff to unlock entry to the mystical wonderland of world 2.  When you finish world 1, you most likely have to go back and grind world 1 again until you've accumulated enough stars or coins.  (And, it's a LOT of coins.)\n\nFifth, pickups seem to often be a trap.  Going for them sometimes seems to be the wrong thing to do, and if you do you always lose.\n\nSixth, you quite often can't see far enough to the right to make a decision in time to pass an area.  When you do the sensible thing, you find out mid-jump that the sensible thing traps you in a corner and makes you restart.  So, you just have to beat your head on it until you memorize when those things happen, so you can get by.  Given how limited your visibility is vs. the screen real estate available, it looks ridiculous on a PC.  Then, just to rub it in, every now and then the camera is scripted to zoom out to the distance where you CAN see things, but only when you don't really need it.\n\nSo, I'm downgrading from "I can see some people liking this game but I don't", to "I don't understand why people like this game."\n\nLet the rage comments flow.  I've uninstalled this to reclaim the 56 megs of disk, and I'm no longer wishing there was a "meh" option so that I could leave this informative rather than negative.","December 5, 2013","false","1.4"," 1,054 of 1,380 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","054","1","7","50"

After playing the game for over an hour, I 100% approve of buying this game. It's cheap (less then $10 USD!), installs really fast (no kidding, this game is a puny 56MB!), and plays fast too. It's perfect for people who enjoy games like Mirror's Edge (both real game and the 2D platformer made by Brad Borne, creator of the Fancy Pants Adventures games) and platformers like Super Mario, Sonic, and BIT.TRIP RUNNER. Trying to get three stars in all the courses is quite a challenge and requires a lot of dying (which you get achievements for both getting three stars in all courses and the amount of times you've died).

This burst range from either to a hour, or for the most part, to thirty minutes per interval. This is only because after a while; unfortunately, the game does feel like it becomes a bit repetative from just pressing up, down, left, and right. Yet, I find myself always drawn back to the game, always wondering what badass parkour moves I can pull off next, or by curiosity to see what the next level has in store for me. For me, the game doesn't dissapoint as running from multiple hunters can make the game seem hectic, and keep the game interesting, along with the music and the environment that the style of vector makes. Seeing the obstacles in black, and the enviroment in full, glorious colors really depicts how the main character, vector, feels. This, at least to me, really ties in with the introduction scene of vector. Being trapped and doing the same tasks on a daily basis, and only having one desire, and that is to be free! However, there are some things that really make me furious at certain times while playing Vector. At times, there will be certain animations, or scripts, that you want vector to do, yet he won't do it. I found several times that I press the up button several seconds away from the object yet he would do the animation that would prohibit me from getting a certain cube. This would then cause me to restart the level just so I can get that one damned cube so I can progess. Because of this, it gives the game a sense of trial and error that is very misleading to me, for the "challenging" aspect of this game is to remember where to exactly jump so you can get all the cubes and tricks within that certain level. However, after beating that level, I get a sense of accomplishment, and sense of pride that makes it worth while for me.\n\nSo I'm giving Vector a 7/10, to me the game is very fun, but it's fun in short bursts, delays in script triggers, and level memorization rather than an actual challenge really knocks the game back from what it actually could be.","November 7, 2014","true","9.6"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","22","26","3","0"

After 33 hours clocked in game time I've finally collected every achievement, got all the stars and also finished Hunter mode completely. So I feel like I can give me full opinion on the game. (without spoilers ofcourse)\n\nQuick Game Summary:\nVector is an action packed 2D sidescrolling parkour game, with a basic but kinda gripping (atleast to me) storyline. You wanna break free from control by ''The Man'', in this case ''Big Brother'' and the hunters are after you. Basicly all you need to know is in the discription in the store page.\n\nGameplay:\nVector as I said before is a 2D Sidescroller, but not one with free controll like, let's say Mario. No, Vector is an on-rails autoscroller where, depending on the situation, you either press down to slide, up to jump or hold to the right to sprint. You also have these parkour tricks you can purchase to do cool tricks in the level by pressing up when you land on a trick. Unlike the Facebook port and free version on the mobile phone, you get enough money at the end of the level, to purchase all the tricks that are needed for the next level. The game gets pretty hard and challenging which is a good thing, but the hardest part of the game is the Hunter Mode, where you play as the hunter and try to hunt down Vector. I like to call this part the hard mode since thats the reason why it took me so long, but it's extremely satisfying when you get Vector at the end and it adds for lots of replayability.\n\nVector is in the end a fun timewaster and I recommend you atleast try it out, it's worth the price and you may end up liking it.\n\nI'm still waiting on that level creator though. Oh and also super psyched for Vector 2.","September 24, 2015","true","34.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/248970/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Vector is a fairly good game. It's a mix of Canabalt and Mirror's Edge. However, the game actually uses levels and because of that it's not an endless runner like Canabalt is. The game itself is played as a platformer but you don't have to actually run; the game will do this for you. It's up to you to collect as many coins as you can and perform the various tricks scattered throughout the levels. It's because of the constant running/climbing and doing tricks that many people will be reminded of Mirror's Edge.\n\nEach level you'll be chased. This adds a certain layer of tension to the game but since you're not fully controlling your character it will most likely not scare you as much as it should. The graphics are nicely detailed and the animations of your character are mostly fluid. It's unfortunate that the character itself isn't all that detailed, lowres even, even if it's a silhouette.\n\nBy collecting money found in the levels you'll be able to purchase new tricks. Use the new tricks in the later levels to earn even more cash. It's a vicious circle. Ok, I wouldn't say vicious, but at least it's a fun way to keep replaying some of the levels, even if they're frustratingly hard sometimes. Earning 3 stars in every level will take you a long, long time. And you'll have to restart quite often because even the slightest mistake can result in failure. Thankfully the levels are only a few minutes long so it's not all that important, but still worth a mention.\n\nIt's also where the game fails in being a very good or excellent game. Some of the levels require a good memory and others will have you take leaps of faith because you can't see where you have to land in order to keep going. This can be frustrating because you also need (a bit of) luck if you want to finish some of these levels. It would've been better if you could see far ahead so you would know exactly where to go and if you could just take one path and not more, or at least make all of these paths accessible.\n\nIn the end Vector is still pretty fun to play and considering the price it's easily worth the money. There's more than enough value here.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","December 11, 2013","true","3.9"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","21","31","0","1"

Seeing this game actually reminded me of the 2d mobile version of mirrors edge which I enjoyed greatly. However, upon actually playing I was met with disapointment. This game is more of a, press "X" button when you are told to. I definetely do not feel the "Free" in Free Running while playing. The custom moves are fun, however, when learning the game I missed a couple of the weird coins on of the first levels. Because of this, as I kept playing I was always just short on the coins which were needed to perform these special moves. This game was a good idea. We need another free running game. However, this isn't the one we need right now. The whole game feels like its on rails, and while an argument against this may be "Well, its a 2-D platformer" just isn't going to cut it, as plenty of more creative and engaging platformers have been made in this style, and have pulled it off well. Also, it would've been nice if instead of having to have a certain amount of coins to perform the special moves (which is clearly in effect so that players are forced to go back and play more of the levels they've beaten for no reason), special moves could have been a key combo you could press.\nI do not recommend this game due to the lack of much player involvement beyond just pressing the right key at the right time.","December 11, 2013","false","0.2"," 86 of 154 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","86","154","0","0"

To be brief, Vector is an arcade-style "runner" game where you play as a character with exceptional free running and parkour skills, on the run from the hunters trying to capture and re-imprison you back into their totalitarian World, "where freedom and individually is nothing more than a distant dream."\nThere is also a fairly recent new mode that allows you to play as the Hunter instead of the Runner, these are definitely more difficult but just as fun as the standard mode tracks, it gives you more variation and replayability for your money.\n\nThe game has a ton of characteristics that make it a good one, I really love the art-style behind Vector and the music suits the theme and tension of the game perfectly (playing without the music just isn't the same). The controls are extremely simple, it takes no time at all to learn, however, sometimes they can be very tricky giving you little to no time at all to press a button at the right moment, which can be frustrating on a number of tracks, particularly if you're aiming to get all 360 stars.\n\nSo all in all, Vector has become my favourite "runner" game, it's fast-paced and easy to learn gameplay is executed perfectly making it enjoying from the start to the end.

The game being a platformer too was a huge plus, so I decided to go for it. The game is a 2D platformer which has you play some nameless character with no apparent story at all other than the description of the game (I suppose you have to think of your own story).\n\nEach level is a setting filled with obstacles that you must traverse using free running techniques, while being chased by a single cop who has the same parkour skills as you, and is absolutely relentless (makes no mistakes in his running either). The levels get tougher as you go, and sometimes border on the frustrating, but enjoyable nonetheless. Along the way you must collect money in the form of floating icons which give you access to further levels and parkour techniques. Furthermore, you are rated on your performance at the completion of each level, and awarded stars based on your performance.\n\nAll in all, its a very enjoyable indie title and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of platformers. Dont let the fact that its 2D discourage you (especially if you are a Mirror's Edge fan) as the animations are fluid, the tension is great and the feeling of a perfectly timed and executed level is very satisfying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/recommended/248970/","dronak","Dronak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/","2192 products in account","I think this is basically a platformer where the focus is on free-running to try to escape the police of an oppressive society while performing Parkour-type moves to get past obstacles.  I've played it longer on mobile than Steam, but assuming it's designed the same, there are three worlds with around 12 levels each (I forget exactly).  As you run through them, you'll pick up cubes for points and coins that you can use to buy more Parkour moves.  To get a 3-star score on each level, you have to collect all the cubes, which isn't always easy, and perform all of the Parkour tricks, whose locations are marked for you so they're easy to spot (but you still have to time them right).  Since the tricks are purchased, you may have to grind for money in order to buy them.  Grinding isn't really necessary in the beginning, but as the games goes on and the cost goes up, you'll probably need to do more grinding.  Each of the three worlds has specific game moves, with the second and third building up a little from the first -- IIRC, the second one introduces stopping and lets you jump back and forth between walls to reach higher areas, and the third introduces reversing direction and using elevators to go up and down.  For the most part, the game is linear in that most levels seem to have only one way to clear them, and it's mainly a matter of practice and timing to learn how to do that.  They're usually not too long or frustrating though, which is a good thing.  I'm not sure exactly how the game ends though, because I didn't finish it on mobile (I got tired of grinding after a while).  But even after finishing it, I think there will be some replay value, because you can keep trying to get that perfect 3-star score, beat your previous fastest time, and/or go for Steam achievements.  Also, I see a Hunter Mode in the game's menu, which is unlocked by earning 50 stars, and that new mode should add some variety and replay value as well.  While I would have preferred a bit less grinding for money to buy moves, the game is good overall and I'd recommend it.","July 25, 2014","true","4.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theredherring/recommended/248970/","theredherring","The Red Herring","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theredherring/","156 products in account","The thing about vector is it initially seems to be suited more for the mobile market rather than as a pc game. The UI would support this with its large buttons and the control scheme is easy to imagine as taps and swipes rather than pressing buttons on a keyboard. Indeed, the whole game is very much of an arcardy, pick-up-and-play style of experience, with the levels being short enough to complete in a couple of minutes, what would seem to be an ideal mobile experience. As it goes though, Vector is by far not a bad little pc game. There are three main areas the levels are set in, and then each area also has a few bonus levels to complete. As it goes on the game introduces new mechanics and implements them well, and then towards the end adds in a certain level of dynamic level design to make the levels that little bit harder. The game can definitely be finished in under an hour, and any difficult level can be beaten reletively easily on its third playthrough. There were several frustrating moments with the sprinting mechanic that saw me having to repeat the same level over and over because I wanted to three star it. Overall, the game itself is definitely suited more for a movile platform but for those people like me who would want to try and three-star every level and 100%, there is certainly some level of replayability in the game, along with a couple of really irritating parts. Not a bad game, not a bad pc game, but it doesn't seem to have reached its full potential on the pc platform.","July 20, 2014","true","13.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Think Mirror's Edge meets BitTripRunner. There is a Facebook version but a few notable differences between this and the Android and FB versions are: the game has incredible HD graphics. I've been playing the FB version for months and the full screen view on my 1980x1080 HD monitor is gorgeous. Also gaining coins to access new moves is a lot less grindy because you also gain coins from the star rating for completing each level. It still presents the same challenge as all the other versions but without replaying the same level 5 times just to earn enough to get more cool parkour moves. Not to mention lots of Steam achievements for the hunters out there.\n\nThe developers are currently working on added features including a hunter mode and level editor. While this is all good and nice I would like to see leaderboards and cloud support in addition to the things already planned.

I just cant understand why cant they add dificulty where they could set up a bit slower hunter and the cubes at easier spots for those who stuck on several maps and cant get done even after millions of retries. Even working more fun than trying the same map for the 1000th time to get 3stars. At least in work you get paid but here instead you need to pay for the game and so suffer from this game. Why cant games have difficulty settings? There should be a warning on steam store for every game which dont have difficulty settings!

As such, it is one of the best of its type, with very fluid controls and animation, and a decent (although overly repetitive) soundtrack.\n\nI personally found the entire genre of auto-runners to be slightly less fun on the PC than on my tablet or phone, but I must admit, even with PC controls this was a blast to play in short spurts. My only real complaint is that you have to be doing nothing else to pick up the tricks you "need" to collect throughout the level. If you have another button pressed even for a second of the window for the trick pick-up, it won't register.\n\nAlso, it would be nice if you had more control over your character, being able to use the tricks you get when you want, maybe even combo them for points or something. Instead, picking up and unlocking the tricks seems to be largely a waste of time, as the tricks you know don't carry over level to level. This last complaint is really a complaint with the whole auto-runner genre in general, though, so its hard to fault Vector for it.\n\nUltimately, if you like auto-runners, Vector is a sure win for you, if you don't normally care for them, its still worth checking out, as its professional layout, excellent graphics, and high replayability may make you reconsider the genre.","June 30, 2014","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Your only weapon is yourself. Jump, leap, and roll your way to freedom; just watch out for those pesky guards who are constantly chasing you. If they get too close...ZAM! you're electrocuted.\n\nBetween the parkour style mechanics, the challenge of completing each level with a full three stars, bonus levels, and a mode where you play as the guard, this game has loads to offer.

Or maybe he's just that good. 11/10 for seriousness.\n\nI got this game in a bundle and was interested in trying out a 2D speedrunning/parkour game. The experience was both satisfying and frustrating at different times, and it is a game that I revisit with my best friend.\n\nIf you like speedrunning/parkour, flashy tricks, precision platforming gaming, and semi-casual gameplay, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice - the amount of detail in the different backgrounds is good, and the different character animations (in particular, the large amount of speedrunning tricks) can be pretty flashy. A well-executed run is very aesthetically pleasing because of the smoothness in the movement transitions; however, this will also show you how bad you are doing when you are bumping into every obstacle. The music and sounds are good, however, I quickly decided to play my own music to add to the intensity of the gameplay. The levels are short enough to allow this game to be played in bursts, which is something I appreciated greatly.\n\nThe controls are easy to familiarize yourself with, however, I personally prefer using a controller - both the keyboard and controller have very responsive controls. Many movements require you to hit the appropriate key once your character enters a specific window (a square showing the type of movement), and you will not be able to do these special tricks without entering the window. The game rewards precision immensely - you will quickly notice that jumping even a few steps too early/late can result in your immediate death. There is a tutorial that is a little too long, but also very helpful in teaching you most elements in the game. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, and much of the game involves repeated trial and error (ex: finding that perfect spot to jump from to land on an obstacle instead of crashing into it). The most challenging part you will encounter is getting the timing correct. For achievement hunters, you will have a grand time trying to get 100%, there is a large enough amount of levels to keep you interested and playing.\n\nDuring gameplay, your character is running toward an end point at the right side of the map. Along the way, you may collect pickups that add to your score (you need all of them for full stars (3/3) at the end). Trick boxes will litter the stage, and you need to have unlocked the specific skill found within before you can actually execute it. In the later levels, you will also have to  run away from enemies, keeping ahead of them to avoid being incapacitated/caught. There are multiple stages and many bonus ones as well.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun and remains challenging at a very appropriate pace. Any parkour/platforming enthusiasts will enjoy Vector and should definitely give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\n","January 28, 2015","true","3.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","2"

(not all 3 stars yet).\n\nI played and completed the 3D 'First Person View' game 'Mirrors Edge' on both X360 and PC back when GFWL was at it's peak. What some may remember was that there was a 2D 'side scrolling' game of 'Mirrors Edge' as well. I haven't spent as much time with that and although I don't remember clearly but think you may have had control over the players movement, not sure. Anyway, I quite enjoyed the 'Mirrors Edge' games and the uniqueness of them.\n\nSo, if you also have fond memories of those games then you may also like 'Vector'.\n\nThis game is a 2D 'side scrolling' 'runner' game. I say 'runner' because you don't get to control your characters direction of movement. You only control when you jump, slide, and do tricks over obstacles based on 'timing' of your key presses, etc. This might sound 'simple' but a few things keep it challenging;\nYou have enemies chasing you which you need to keep ahead of by maintaining your speed via flow of movement past obstacles.\nYou have to decide on the fly what you want to do; sometimes you want to jump earlier to get on top of an obstacle, sometimes you want to volley over them.\nHitting into an obstacle will cost you a small delay as your character composes themselves and gets moving again.\nSome levels will require a few runs so you can workout which 'path' you want to take.\nTo '3 star' a level you basically have to be perfect.\nIf you want to '3 star' all levels and collect everything then I can see a lot of replayability here.\n\nSometimes you probably have to play a level 10 or more times to get past it so there is some repetitiveness. If you are ok with that aspect then you may enjoy the challenge. It can be funny sometimes seeing the trouble your character or the 'hunter/chaser' gets into. Had to chuckle a few times when my character met a demise when I knew I had hit an incorrect key or got my timing completely wrong.\n\nSome cool things I have noticed so far;\nCollect coins in the levels which you can use to buy 'stunts' which are needed if you want to get '3 stars'.\nThere is quite a variety of character animations and the mentioned 'stunts' add more.\nThere is a 'hunted' mode which I am guessing means you play a 'hunter' chasing a 'runner' down for a change.\nSome levels have you following an 'npc runner' which was refreshing and added another level of challenge again.\nPlus I would like to give a special thanks to the very helpful developer that helped me access an older version of this game that works with my 'aging' computer.\n\nAfter reading all that if you think this 'sounds like your cup of tea' then I would recommend this game to you. You could also try the 'demo' version first to see what you think.","April 9","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not sure how alone I am on this, but I really liked Mirror's Edge.  So when I saw Vector I figured it would be right up my alley.  Unfortunately, it's proven to be pretty disappointing.\n\nThey went with a very similar approach as Mirror's Edge in that you play a man living in a world that has been cleaned to the point of oppression.  So you're constantly running from the cops, and they're always right on your heels.  So ok, I don't really mind that.  It seems interesting to me that free runners are so frequently depicted as anti-oppression rebels because they want to run free, but really who cares.  This isn't about the story, it's about the game and the gameplay stinks.\n\nFor all the freedom from oppression rhetoric, Vector has very severe limits on what you can do.  You don't control anything.  Your runner just runs and you push buttons to make him jump, slide, vault or accelerate based on what sort of obstacle you're up against.  It's purely a timing game.  Push a button at the right time and get a biscuit, I mean jump over an instant death pit.\n\nThere are some decent production values put into this game, and I wish I could recommend it, but at the end of the day they have managed to make a concept like free running across building tops boring to play.","April 11, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Though it is seen in a 2d perspective, the magnificent character animations show a slight amount of 3d, at least in my eyes. Unfortunetly, with the game's system, you can only do certain tricks in certian spots and you can't choose when you wish to sprint, which may seem a bit restricive to most people. The only real reason I got it on steam was because I first had it on my tablet and wanted to play it on the PC.

Granted, Vector has none of these things and is clearly meant for the casual gamers scene. Regardless, it drew my interest, which certainly is due to its theme: Le Parkour - l'art du déplacement - a great sport, which I am practicing myself for a couple of months now.\n\nIn Vector you play a traceur breaking free from a society to which human individuality bears no more meaning. Your goal: escape from the authorities, who are trying to jam you back into your prison cell called office. Well, and thats all you'll ever hear of the story. The game leads you through a rather minimalistic 2D environment full of obstacles to overcome. Watch out, for the system is on your heels at any moment!\n\nThe controls in Vector are limited to the four arrow keys. Bluntly, sometimes you don't even have to do anything, since your characters is running, pulling himself up and jumping down from ledges, all by himself. However, without your help, you will see him stumbling and tumbling all the time. Use "up" at the right time to vault over obstacles in no time and build up momentum, tap "down" to slide beneath a scaffold, use "right" to accelerate before a huge jump and "left" to slow down in order to prevent a painful crash into a wall. Timing is everything. Chain your moves effectively and you will progress through the levels much quicker.\n\nMeanwhile, there is some more to concentrate on. In each level, there are 3 spots where you can show off your skills big time by incorporating some stylish freerunning moves. These special moves must be unlocked over time by spending coins. Coins are earned ingame when you reach certain areas in the level. Some are right on track and easy to reach, others require you to adjust your usual rhythm.\n\nIn conclusion, Vector really is a fun little game worth its money. The theme is well implemented. The animations are smooth, the parkour moves look real. If you have some affection for this sport and could do with a little distraction, Vector is for you!","December 7, 2013","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One day you snap and make a run for it.  And you run.  And run.  and run.  :)\n\nSo, basically it's a 2D side scroller where your character is running away from one of the policeman (who will taze you if they catch up to you).  The cool part is that you are basically running an obstacle course, as you make your getaway with some Parkour-ish flair.\n\nThe levels are achievement-based -- your score is based on time, bonuses (which are objects you pick up as you run), and stunts performed (these are cue'd at certain points in each level and make it easier for you to pick up bonus objects or time the upcoming obstacle).  You also pickup coins, which you use to unlock additional tricks.\n\nA valid criticism is that this really isn't "free" running.  That is correct.  It's much more of a timed and scripted obstacle course.  You have to figure out the proper (or workable) timing to get all the items, coins, and trick cues.  This is interesting because it means that until you unlock all the tricks used in a level, you're never going to get the full score on the first try.  On the other hand, each level so far has been challenging enough that I've had to run through it multiple times to get the perfect 3-star score.  During that time, I usually pick up enough coins to unlock the needed tricks, usually around the time that I've gotten familiar enough with the level to understand how the tricks will help me with certain obstacles.\n\nFor an indie game, it's quite well done and surprisingly tense.  The policeman is never far behind you.  He's quite good, and a mistake on your part can easily have him almost within arm reach as you scramble to get back up to speed.\n\nEven the failures can be amusing.  I, at least, find it amusing when, after sliding, jumping, and flipping my way over the scenery like a badas, I suddenly run off an edge and fall to my death.  Or just flat out slam into a wall.  Or faceplant on the ground.  I don't know why I find it funny, but I do.  :)  It takes the edge off of having to restart the level.  The novelty does wear off, though, and some of the levels are just crazy difficult.  Having to restart a complicated level after each failure does get frustrating after a while.\n\nHaving said all that, even though I normally hate platformers, I don't regret picking up Vector.\n","January 4, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So it could have been a 10/10 game. But right now it's a 0/10 game. The reason: YOU CAN'T SEE WHERE THE CHARACTER IS GOING!!!  The camera always zooms in, to give a more "cinematic" view, so the only way to play the game is to memorize the levels. Every time you jump, you don't see what follows, so you jump randomly hoping that you land correctly.\nThis is the most silly mistake I've ever seen in a platform game. The fun and the challenge in a game like this, is to perfectly time your jumps, not to memorize every step of every level.\nThe good thing is that the solution is easy: KEEP THE CAMERA ZOOMED OUT!!!! Or at least give the player the option to choose between the "standard" camera and the "cinematic".\nVector is a beautiful game made with a lot of love for parkour. Developers, please keep the camera zoomed out and your game will be a perfect 10/10.","February 22, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is pretty entertaining, WHEN the character does what you want him to.\n\nYou will only press 3 buttons in this game: up for jumping, down for sliding and right for accellerating (at certain points in the level, though that gimmick is totally superflous and you could just auto accellerate...).\n\nYour goal is to reach the end of the level. You are always being chased by a hunter, who is exactly as fast as you are, so if you mess up too much, bye bye. You can also collect bonus points and money as well as do tricks at certain points in the level. Collecting all bonus points often means taking a different and longer route than the hunter, which makes for extra excitement. If you die, you start from the beginning, no check points. Doing the tricks simply means pushing "up" whenever you are DIRECTLY (mother♥♥♥♥ing directly) at the trick point, not a split second too early or too late or you miss it...and this is where I have my first gripe with the game. Pressing the button in exactly the right time is not easy. It's like a QTE. Of course, this is a mobile port, so yadda yadda, BUT the controls are sometimes a bit weird and of course, how you jumped an obstacle just before another obstacle can also mean the difference between success and failure, so it's not just getting across obstacles, it is also importand HOW you do that. There's regular jumping on the obstacle, then somewhat clumsily roll over it or slide or hop like a pro. That all is determined by WHEN you press the jump button and it gets kind of tricky and a bit unresponsive imho. So, the controls could be better and maybe also more diverse.\n\nMy second gripe is also with the tricks. In order to do them you have to UNLOCK them...wtf. That means spending cash in ever increasing numbers. You only get cash by completing levels and you will most likely have to do levels multiple times to earn more cash to unlock all the tricks. Do you need those tricks in order to complete the level? According to the game, yes (it says so on the level screen), but really no. You can complete a level without a trick just as well, you just can't get the three star rating. Still this is a stupid idea for a PC game. The same goes for the gadets. You can buy those for currency as well, but apparently they are one time use only...so ♥♥♥♥ you. That being said, I have only unlocked one gadget for now, but still I can only imagine that it will be the same for the others (this one lets you get away from a nearby hunter...but for 400 currency and 1 time use...that is just a ripoff and means replaying the levels even more often to get enough cash. I can possibly understand it for mobile if the app is free and then you offer ♥♥♥♥ing micro transactions for money, but...nah...it is annoying.\n\nThe graphics are minimal, but that is ok. The foreground is black, the characters are black and the backdrop is a static image of one of the three different levels. The only issue here are frame rate drops that occur occasionally.\n\nGetting to the end of a level is a challenge in and of itself in the later stages, but getting all three stars is even harder.\n\nThird and final gripe: In order to unlock the other levels you have to earn a certain amount of stars. Like gripe number 2 this is a mobile idea. Gating content behind possible pay or skill walls. I beat the god damn level, so let me continue with the rest of the game...no? Well, thanks.\nThat's the same ♥♥♥♥ Trackmania does with its "get gold on all levels to unlock these levels"...Just let me play them and keep the hardcore stuff for the completionists...no one will cry a river.\n\nConclusion: I bought this on sale and it has a lot of content and the game play is enticing if minimalistic. There is quite a bit of content in it, so you can give it a try if it is reduced in price I'd say.\nInstead of just doing a mobile port, however, this could have been made into a really solid experience with a solid graphics engine that does not have any framerate drops like this one. Possibly include a few more diverse levels and most of all get rid of the pay ♥♥♥♥. Then there could have also been more active gameplay elements. Jumping and sliding are ok, but you could also include real QTEs for the tricks and make them mandatory but also offer the chance to complete the level if you fail them. And make gadgets meaningful choices instead of yet another money sink...\n\nThis game could have been so much more than it is, but maybe the money will go into a proper "sequel"...","October 3, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's no strategy, no skill, and barely any gameplay involved.\n\nWhat little gameplay does exist consists of restarting levels over and over and over until you figure out (memorize) the right timing for a sequence of button presses you need to hit to finish a level and move onto the next.

I'm very glad I bought it for PC!\n\nVector is a great side-scrolling parkour game. The controls are very simple, run, speed up, slow down, jump, slide, and fall. In some situations you can do a wall climb, and that's about it.\n\nEach level has three special parkour moves that you can do once each in a set location in the level, assuming you have enough coins to unlock the move before attempting the level. These moves are activated by pushing up in the same way as a regular jump, but some of them are pretty impressive, and they add extra flair to the game.\n\nThe intro is cool and sets the mood for the game well, and the story gradually progresses as you play through. I'm not finished yet, but each time I've encountered a little plot hook so far it's made me smile. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next.\n\nThe graphics in Vector are very simple, but the animation is fantastic and works amazingly well. It reminds me of the original Prince of Persia animation: very fluid and flowing; perfect for this game.\n\nReplayability of levels you've already beaten comes in the form of retrying the levels to get more coins, which are then used to unlock moves in later levels. Getting a perfect score in some levels will take many, many replays.\n\nI definitely recommend Vector. I don't know if I'll ever finish it 100%, with all levels perfect, but for now I'm enjoying the attempt.\n","May 23, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have to UNLOCK TRICKS in order to perform them. I don't know about you, but limitations in games are the BANE of a gamer like me.

The whole parkour concept is pretty cool, but there's just not much content here. It's very repetitive.\n\nBasically, the game, which I believe originated as an iOS game, is broken up into worlds and levels. I think it's three worlds (at least that I could se before I gave up), each with 12-13 levels. I got about halfway through the second world before I gave up.\n\nEach level, you have an enemy chasing you. Your character auto-runs, and it's up to you to hit up (jump), down (slide), right (speed up) or left (slow down) to navigate obstacles. You die and restart the level if the enemy catches up to you or you fall to your death or run into obstacles at high speeds.\n\nAlong the way, you must collect bonus boxes and complete special tricks (typically just hitting up at the right time) to collect additional stars. You get one star just for completing the level.\n\nSometimes there are different routes, but there is clearly a "correct" path, as the bonus boxes are typically only along one path or the other. Sometimes, the other route is a dead end and leads to auto death.\n\nMaybe I would have a slightly higher appreciation if the developers took time to beautify the graphics. On a mobile phone, it's fine. On a big monitor, it's just overly simple.\n\nIn any case, at core, the game is just dull. The mechanics are fine. The physics are fine. But every level is the exact same thing, and it wasn't exciting to begin with. If you're a fan of auto-run games or endless runner, then maybe you'll enjoy this. But just hitting four keys every couple of seconds is not my idea of fun, especially when it requires a fair amount of precision.\n\n2/10","March 6, 2015","false","2.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It's a Canabalt clone! I loved Canabalt so if this game takes it a step or two further that'd be great!"\n\nVector is a frustrating grind. Perfection is the only option, and repeatedly failing over and over is the only method of achieving it. This kind of thing can work in some formats such as bullet hell shooters (for me) but those games usually have something satisfying along the way or while you're failing. The simple graphics and initially confusing (non customizable) controls do not do a good job of making a first impression that makes me want to struggle to achieve the perfection the game is expecting.\n\nJust play Canabalt: http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/mega/\nThe control is better (and tighter). The music is awesome. And the simple graphics serve the gameplay just fine by not distracting but still conveying so much if you pay attention to them. Also, Canabalt is fast!

It had a free and a "premium" version. The free version was purposely grindy to force you to buy coins via IAPs, whilst the premium one had a good flow and unlock pattern to it.\n\nAnyways, coming back to this, it is so much better to play. 60fps, HD graphics and more precise controls (you can never rely on swipe gestures!). It may look simple, but I assure you it is not. Completing a level may not be the biggest of challenges, but if you want to 3-star a level, prepare to be frustrated.

I wanna say its also a rage game but thats just me i think.\n\nThe game doesn't implement those endless running parkour games, and the different stunts that you can do in the game is very cool. The controls are pretty simple, up to jump, down to slide, right/left to run/stop during a running sequence, R to retry and Z to use item.\n\nThis is one of those games that requires u to memorize every little jump, roll and dodge u need to take to perfect a level, and repeating a level for like hundreds of times is not surprising. Not all levels are difficult like that but it gets very frustrating later on. Kinda reminds me of rage games, but I know this is not within that genre....yet.\n\nThere is a different mode where you play as the Hunter and I dont see the point of this mode. The level design is the same as the classic mode but u're just chasing after the MC.\n\nI would like to mention that I also played the touchscreen version of this before, and the controls are in my opinion very unresponsive. Pc for the win for this game.\n\nOverall, not a bad game. Achievements are pretty hard to complete since u practically need to 100% the game to get it. So, if u dont get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off easily or u like to play simple parkour games just to kill time, I recommend this game.\n\n7/10","September 7, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
