The upside to the DLC is the missions, the missions were actually fun ecspecially the one where you had to rescue the dinosaurs from the military. All in all this is a great expansion pack for an awesome game (even though there isn't alot to it).","July 21, 2014","true","16.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"
