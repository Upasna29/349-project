I really really really wanted to like it.\nI love the concept of rotating objects to reveal the shapes.\nHowever, this game falls way short.\n\nIt feels like something someone made in Blender. Transitions are low resolution, plastic-looking, and low-framerate.\nThe levels range from super-easy, to "are you freaking kidding me?" with no coherent progression. (Easy levels and hard levels are all thrown together in no order)\n\nThe "story" is cringe-worthy. Sure, I want to know what happens next, but the voice-over feels strained. The levels often feel like the end-object was arbitrariarly chosen just so it could fit with the story. But worse, at times it feels like the story arbitrarily bends itself just to justify whatever the object was. It makes no sense.\n\nSome levels are so incredibly "unfair", it seems like it's by-design how unfair they are.\nOh, but luckily there's a hint system.\nClick the hint button, and it'll show you the shadow of the object that you're looking for.\nNot enough? Click the hint button again, to get a sort of "radar" color, that will change to green as you get closer to the target shape.\nThat sounds lovely.\nEXCEPT for the fact that you're only given 10-hints to start with. OH, maybe they give you more hints after solving a level on your own? NO!\nOnce you use up the 10-hints, your only option next is to BUY MORE hints.\nSeriously? I already bought the game, and I cannot continue because I can't figure out this obtuse, intentionally frustrating level, because I don't have enough hints, and I must pay more to continue?\nSkip. That.\n\nNot to mention that the entire interface looks like it was designed for touch-screen. (Including some early on-screen prompts).\n\nAnd there are ADVERTISEMENTS in the game directing you to their website for other (mobile) games.\nOn top of the in-app purchases, in a game I already spent money to buy?\n\nI'm done with this game.. I wanted to enjoy it so much. But there's no love here.\nSuch a shame.\n\nIf you read this far, you really should check out "SHADOWMATIC", which is available for iPhone/iPad.\nI guarantee that you'll like it more than "perfect angle"","December 23, 2015","false","1.0"," 59 of 78 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","59","78","0","6"

The puzzles were interesting and in some cases very challenging. I do have some negative points, but nothing that makes the game unplayable or unenjoyable.\n\n1) The game, despite being fun, is a huge advertisement for OTHER games. With some levels, you are provided a special link outside of the game. Where do those links take you? To a webpage trying to get you to buy some other game. Really???\n\n2) I played through on a non-gaming rig, with a sub-par graphics card, and with that there were some moments where certain graphics appeared to be broken, like water/reflections jumping around. Considering the game relies on visual cues to play, this could be an issue, but it never seemed to impact me to the point that I couldn't beat the level.\n\nAgain, overall, I had fun, and would even play again at some point in the future (not much replayability here), and if you don't mind advertising in your paid game, then you may like it too.","May 14","true","36.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markzwaan/recommended/427780/","markzwaan","markzwaan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markzwaan/","2495 products in account","While I like most of the puzzles and the presentation is pretty good, two aspects of the game force me to give the game the thumbs down. First of all they developers decided to embed the puzzles into a narated story that slowly unfolds when you succesfully solve the puzzles. We've seen how this good can work when it's done right from games like Portal 2 and the TALOS principle. But the execution in this game fails. The connection between the puzzles and the story is weak, objects you've discovered are often shoehorned into the story. But even worse the story is narrated by the most dull and emotionless voice I've ever heard in a game. The accompanying stills are amateurish at best and do not help to draw you into the story. The other problem I have is with microtransitions. You actually have to buy clues to help solve the puzzles when you're stuck. A recent update will give you a free clue every five minutes (if you're at zero clues) but since most puzzles have no title (until after you've solved them) are not linked together by theme and also have no visual clues you're bound to get stumped every ten puzzles or so. I don't mind paying for DLC that adds new puzzles to an existing game (I recently bought the DLC for the TALOS principle) but paying for something that would otherwise be free leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\nWith a better told story (both in story telling and in voice acting) and more natural clues for the puzzles (by linking them by theme, giving a clue in the name of the puzzle and/or by giving subtle visual clues) this could be a pretty good puzzle game. In it's current form however the negatives outweigh the positives.","January 11","false","4.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/427780/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1843 products in account","**QUICK THOUGHTS**\n\nConsider the visual aesthetic of Portal meshed with a story line around memories, and you get Perfect Angle. I was unaware going in this was a mobile port, and the mouse sensitivity truly shows this almost immediately. I found it insanely hard to move things around, even at the lowest sensitivity, though this could also be the new mouse I just purchased playing a role in it.\n\nEither way, score is beautiful and matches the soothing atmosphere of the title. Put the images together at a certain angle for a few levels to unlock a new memory. The mild narrator keeps urging you on to finish, creating an alzheimers kind of narrative (I have yet to finish the game so I'm not sure if that's exactly what the game is going for at the moment).\n\nBut hey, remember when you would be able to pay money for a game and not be nudged into paying more? Well this one feels paying a hefty price for a ported app isn't enough. This title costs $6.99 US right out the gate and if you get stuck you can acquire hints. These take time to become available, or you can slap down $1.99 for ten of them with real currency. Ok, it;'s not a necessary thing but it leads on to wonder when it became ok to include these free-to-play tactics in a full priced title. Oh, right, it's never ok...\n\nEither way, I do enjoy the idea of the game for a soothing, casual gameplay experience, and do recomend it for someone looking to just relax, say, after a hard day of work or stressful life situation.","April 3","true","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

And was I pleasantly surprised!\n\nThe game runs fine, looks pretty and the puzzles are genuinely enticing if somewhat easy once you figure out what you're looking for (I even solved some of them completely at random without realising it!). Controls are mostly fine, I was only kinda confused at the parts where you had to rotate the object instead of going around it yourself as it wasn't very intuitive but I managed. And the water levels look amazing!\n\nNow, the UI part of the game is what mostly disappointed me here. The options menu is weird (as well as the level select). What's wrong with making separate pages for audio/video/controls/other stuff? Or why couldn't they all be on one page? All that scrolling seriously annoyed me. And where is the option to change resolution (and switch to window mode because using Alt+Enter gets boring fast)? One thing that triggers me most in games - the lack of proper window setting.How am I supposed to follow the guide if I have to switch back and forth?Not in this case but still\n\nLighting in some of the rooms was kinda weird - floor suddenly switched from black to white at certain angles.\n\nAlso, it's weird that unused hints carry over but their timer does not.And unskippably being promted to use hints wnen you don't have any is annoying.\n\nAll in all, good puzzles, befuddling UI.

Controls are mostly fine, I was only kinda confused at the parts where you had to rotate the object instead of going around it yourself as it wasn't very intuitive but I managed. And the water levels look amazing!\n\nNow, the UI part of the game is what mostly disappointed me here. The options menu is weird (as well as the level select). What's wrong with making separate pages for audio/video/controls/other stuff? Or why couldn't they all be on one page? All that scrolling seriously annoyed me. And where is the option to change resolution (and switch to window mode because using Alt+Enter gets boring fast)? One thing that triggers me most in games - the lack of proper window setting.How am I supposed to follow the guide if I have to switch back and forth?Not in this case but still\n\nLighting in some of the rooms was kinda weird - floor suddenly switched from black to white at certain angles.\n\nAlso, it's weird that unused hints carry over but their timer does not.And unskippably being promted to use hints wnen you don't have any is annoying.\n\nAll in all, good puzzles, befuddling UI. Overall, I think I enjoyed it. Hope you'll have fun too!","May 10","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Find perfect angle to unlock memories of old man.\n\nThere is really bad rocket mechanic, you don't have free camera so you have to find angle that you can shoot from.\n\nNegative reviews there mostly apply for hard levels and microtransactions + really bad advertising in game but still you can find free code each week on their facebook and you can use brain to find shapes, it's not that hard :)\n\nIf you like puzzles and thinking about your every move then its game for you.\n\nOverall 9/10 because i like this genre and its solid product.\n","May 25","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Another thing that makes no sense is a large number of the puzzles with a good number of them being advertisements for their other games. There are microtransactions for some reason, which aren't cheap either, you're better off just going to youtube and finding the solutions.\n\nOverall its alright, nothing to new or interesting.

Oh and you have no idea what you're looking for! Also in many puzzles there are a lot of "extra parts" that are not part of the shape you need to find and are there just to make it more confusing. Also there is no logic way to even wonder what you're looking for: It could be a banana and the next one could be a car, and then a key or something. After you finish a few levels you get a scene with the objects you found but still most of the time the make no sense (like the car could be just passing on the background or the banana could be stamped on the shirt of someone passing by and a toy could be a picture printed on some book). Also as someone said there are quite a few adds. Not as banners but the logo of the company appears as one of the puzzles and there is often some poster for another game on the background and even an add for some other game on the "go to the next level" screen appeared once.\nOnly way I would recomend getting this game is if you get it for free on some giveaway, so you can get the cards and sell for some steam credits and maybe get some better game.\nEditimg: there were a lot more links to other games and even some puzzles were icons for other games. Also I finished (maybe I'm a masochist) just to see if the story made any sense and it sucks! Like really sucks! They are weird fragments that hardly fit together (sometimes seems like they just got a some random lines from random stories and throw in).","June 1","false","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
