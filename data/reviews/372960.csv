It reminds me of Level 22 (guy who is running late for work and must sneak into work) but Robbery Bob is better imo. Haven't used vents, but hide in bushes, under carpets, set off alarms, disguises and more. It also has a few aspects of the Marvelous Mistake. Its a nice basic stealth game, I hope to see more fun games like this and even some more serious stealth robber games too such as Crookz the Heist.\n\nI can't believe with all the stealth games I search for this was not auto-reccomened by Steam (update maybe because stealth was not in the tags for some reason, I added it), I had to search robber to get some more stealth games in my searches.","October 23, 2015","true","3.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/372960/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","I suck at stealth games, plain and simple. Thief, Styx, Dishonored, Metal Gear, Splinter Cell... count me out, because I'm terrible. I am not a patient person. Surprisingly enough, I found myself rocking through Robbery Bob: Man of Steal with little effort.  "Why is this happening?" I thought to myself over the course of three chapters, each consisting of 15 levels. I realized towards the end of the game that it's because Robbery Bob also lets you play at a faster pace that other stealth games neglect.\n\nYes, this game is a mobile port. No, that doesn't make it awful. In fact, next to Major Mayhem this is the best ported mobile game I've played. The graphics and sound are decent enough, the story is simple yet enjoyable and the dialogue exchanges are mildly humorous. That being said, the main game doesn't last very long, even when getting three "stars" in each level. I completed the main three chapters in just over 2.5 hours. However, there are still a wide plethora of bonus stages that I have yet to complete.\n\nIn each stage you will find yourself dodging various obstacles, whether it be patrolling guards, dogs, security cameras, lasers or mad scientists. If you get all of the treasure without getting caught, and have done so in a timely manner, you will gain all three "stars" for that level. I put stars in quotation marks because they're not really stars so much as they are objectives, but they function as stars would in most other mobile games of this nature.\n\nThe controls are smooth and simple, and you can play with either a keyboard or a controller. You will be able to easily navigate Bob, hide in certain elements such as bushes and boxes, trigger distractions, run, and speed up time. The latter two elements are really what set this game apart from other stealth titles. The ability to run without alerting enemies frequently and being able to speed up time so you're not waiting forever for a patrol's pattern to reset are what cause this game to be played quickly.\n\nI should also mention that you are able to upgrade Bob's stats; at least his Speed, Stamina, Stealth and "Grab-ability", the latter of which allows him to pick up treasure from further away. You can also invest in various items such as lockpicks and noise distractions that will help you on any level that you may find particularly challenging, although I did not use any of these items within the main three chapters. There are also many outfits that you can purchase if you're tired of seeing Bob in his regular attire. You can purchase these things with the gold that you gain from completing levels; the more "stars" you get, the higher your gold take is.\n\nFor a casual stealth game, I cannot recommend Robbery Bob: Man of Steal enough! It's an excellent little title that's both short and fun. I happen to find the price of $8.79 CAD a little steep for it, but I did get it on sale for around $3.50 CAD. Whether you pick it up now or wait until it's on sale, you definitely won't be disappointed so long as you're not expecting a hardcore challenge.\n\nRating: 4.5/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","January 9","true","3.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"
