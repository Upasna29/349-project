It proved impossible to play with mouse, keyboard or even joystick, requiring me to plug in a gamepad, much to my disgust. Its flashy graphics are often overwhelming, to the point I more than once had difficulty actually seeing the enemies past all the explosions. A lack of variety in enemy ships and tactics and too much reliance on timed missions (especially the absolutely terrible final mission) hampered my involvement with the title. Still, it frenetic combat had its moments and - especially given the desert of space-sims these days - I could hardly turn my nose up at any offering. Flawed it may have been, but still fun.","November 25, 2013","true","8.8"," 248 of 295 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","248","295","0","5"

You get to do strafing runs on Cruisers or Frigates, and taking out their turrets or weak points is very satisfying. Using the strike suit is a blast once you get the hang of it. At rapid pace you can lock and then launch about 40 missiles at varying targets, either severely crippling a smaller capital ship or thinning out a fighter formation.\n\nThe story is somewhat interesting, but mostly only serves to tie together the levels. Checkpoints are plentiful towards the beginning of the game but become non-existant at the end of the game when you need them most to save yourself from having to redo sections that are cakewalks leading up to some very challenging sections.\n\nUnfortunately for me personally the frustrating checkpoint system really hampered my enjoyment during key moments of the game. For instance in mission 13 of the standard campaign a character essentially just monologues a bunch of story explanation at you while you navigate some incredibly tight tunnels for about 7 minutes before reaching your destination. There are two major problems with this. First of all the game up until this point does not in any way prepare you for precision flying, with every other level taking place in a wide open space battle. Secondly there are absolutely no checkpoints on this mission and this means when you inevitably die on this level, you must hear the explanation monlogue again... and again... and keep redoing the same simple manuevers.\n\nAt it's best the game is a well put together space combat game. At it's worst it is an exercise in frustration. Overall I would say that it is slightly above average, and recommend it only to fans of the genre.","November 25, 2013","true","10.5"," 138 of 156 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","138","156","0","0"

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","I was really having a great time at first, and it felt like X-Wing or Wing Commander had jumped forward in time a couple decades. Then I got the Strike Suit, and the game started to feel like it had a weird split personality, and half the time I was playing one of those games, and the other half I transformed into a giant robot in space and played Zone of the Enders instead. It did not seem like they fit together at first, but after playing a little more, things started to work out. However, with the ability to only save between missions and the very, very sparse checkpoints, I rapidly got very tired of having to repeat the long, easy parts of levels just to get another chance at the hard bit at the end. It got frustrating enough that I wished I had a physical copy of it so I could throw it at something. Then I uninstalled the game, even though it's otherwise fun, because I have better things to do with my time than play the boring parts of a game over and over again.\n\nEdit: Just for the record, Strike Suit Infinity addressed my main complaint with this game, and I found myself enjoying that a lot more because of the faster pace and ability to jump right into the heavier action. Ironically, I probably wouldn't've been able to get into that as easily and have as much fun with it if I hadn't spent some time playing this one first.","September 2, 2013","false","4.2"," 319 of 430 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","319","430","3","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zyrxil/recommended/209540/","Zyrxil","Zyrxil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zyrxil/","580 products in account","This is the sort of game you -want- to like: an indie Kickstarter darling that wants to bring back the space-shooter with style. Unfortunately, it's just not very good, in many different ways.\n\nA quick overview of SSZ: obviously it's a space-"sim", or what I call a space-shooter. It is not, as you might expect, a game based on the old X-Wing/Wing Commander/Freespace style of games, but rather a 50/50 blend of Japanese space shooters and Freespace. Your aiming reticule is not fixed in the middle of the screen, but floating around, and some missile weapons allow you to 'multi-lock' by sweeping over multiple targets while holding down the missile button. Aesthetically, the anime influences the music (think Ghost in the Shell, not anime schoolgirls). and your transforming ship/suit . Wing Commander/Freespace influences everything else, with capital ships that use both torpedoes from Wing Commander and Beam Weapons from Freespace.\n\nTo begin with, even starting the game leaves a bad impression. The game's menus are very poorly optimized for mouse control, and its design suggests the devs at some point were trying very hard to prepare to the game for a console release that never happened. In addition, the game defaults to 720P, and inexplicably will change to 720P if you alt-tab to a different window, regardless of what setting you had it on before. The control rebinding is also very clunky, needlessly splitting up the keys into multiple categories based on the state your ship is in. It allows you to have the same key bound to multiple actions without warning you, and this is exacerbated by that fact that some actions will not conflict with each other (e.g. movement keys in the different ship modes) but others will. Which is which is up to you to experience and be frustrated by.\n\nSecond, the writing is a complete throwaway. The space-dogfighting genre for whatever reason, has a history of having good writing, or at least interesting plots. From Wing Commander to Tie Fighter to the eternally classic Freespace, they all had writing to keep you interested. Not so here. The devs had exactly two ideas: to create a space shooter, and that it should involve a Macross-style transforming space-jet-fighter. There is no interesting dialogue; only one of the characters are even given the barest of characterizations (and he disappears after three missions). Even the backstory to the war in the game is vague and illogical, and contradicts itself in some of the loading screen expository background information texts.\n\nThird you get to problems with the gameplay- to put it succinctly, it's simply not fun. The game bounces between far too easy dogfight sections and extremely tedious destroy-the-torpedoes capital ship protection sections. The console heritage is noticeable here, with none of the weapons/shield energy systems management from classic space shooters. There's even a lack of targetting buttons to cycle through targetting enemy ship subsystems. It's all much simpler than fully Western-influence space shooters. Unfortunately, the Japanese influence on the game doesn't add much either. The transforming jet that is so poorly justified in the writing is also poorly justified in the gameplay. You need build up 'flux energy' to even be able to transform into 'mech mode', but the power of it isn't even so impressive. Essentially you use it to be able to spam infinite missiles at Capital Ship hardpoints while you have the transform meter, and to allow yourself the ability to turn much faster than in jet mode. It's not at all exhilarating, which is pretty damn disappointing for a game's central gimmick.\n\nA note on the game's Freespace 2 inspirations: when Freespace 2 was released, it was highly praised for how exciting the capital ships made combat, with flak shells exploding around you and massively powerful beam cannons being traded between capital ships. SSZ superficially copies all of this, but completely fails to capture any of the emotion. The sound design is completely lacking, so you barely notice any of the capital chips around. Flak Shells make feeble buzzing on your shield. Completely missing is any of massive weapons rocking your small fighter around in the battlefield. Capital Ship Beam Weapons also lack both a sound effect punch and the actually gameplay punch. They may light up between capital ships, but the damage is actually still done with lots and lots of torpedoes. In essence, all of the aesthetic are 'cargo-cult' ish: capturing the appearance but none of the essence.\n\nLastly, something so terrible it deserves a section it's own, the game's final mission. The developers responsible for creating the final mission should never be allow to design anything again. They should not even be able to voice opinions about other games. The very existing of this game's final mission is a crime against gaming itself. The final mission unfolds as follows: instead of the gameplay from the previous 95% of the game, you find yourself suddenly just flying in a narrow tunnel. Your only objective is to avoid hitting the walls, which will drain your shields and armor, eventually killing you if you scrape the walls too often. The tunnel makes frequent 90 degree turns just so it's not too easy. In addition, all the tunnels look alike, and it is very easy to bounce off a wall, and get turned around without realizing it. This goes on for a minumum of 6 minutes, even if you're holding the thrust button down the whole time, and this is =all without checkpoints=. At the end, you get to make a choice about whether to destroy something for 1 briefly narrated ending, or to flying through more tunnels (timed!) to destroy something else for a different briefly narrated ending that isn't any better.\n\nIf you are a decent human being, the last mission of the game alone should be reason enough not to pay even one cent for this game. Seriously. Go play something else.","January 5, 2014","false","7.3"," 89 of 120 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","89","120","0","6"

Knowing when and how to use your mech is key to winning a lot of missions.\n\n+ Bonus objectives within each mission allows you to unlock upgrades. You are also awarded medals at the end of each mission depending on how well you did although completing the mission under target time usually gets you the highest medal. These provide good incentives to replay the level.\n\n+ The controls may take a little time getting use to but once you get good you will be tearing apart ships very easily\n\n+ Achievements are not too hard to get and may take a little time, a found them to be the right mix of fun and challenging.\n\n+ Good soundtrack\n\n\nThe Average:\n\nEach mission has a checkpoint system and although its fine in the earlier missions, some of the longer missions could have used a few more checkpoints.\n\n\nThere is a story...it involves you and a ship and other people and things start happening...and.....there are explosions...To be quite honest although I'm sure the overall plot is decent the story just isn't presented all that well. It's so difficult to care about any of the characters or the plot.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- One reason why it's so hard to care about the story is that each mission is very repetitive. Every missions involves the exact same thing....blow up enemy ships..over and over and over again. The only difference between missions is the amount of enemies you have to fight.\n\n- The game has some really odd difficulty spikes. Some missions you will beat very easily only to be stuck in the next mission.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a game that has such strong core mechanics that work well but is held back by some very poor design decisions. I would love to see a sequel that really adds diversity to the levels. You don't have to be a fan of space combat games to enjoy this as I found it to be pretty easy to learn all the mechanics but it does have difficulty holding interest for long periods of time.\n","September 13, 2015","true","17.6"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","34","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/209540/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","It's always been a little odd to me that an idea as freaking cool as mecha has be so minimally explored in games.\n\nI guess the easy answer for that would be because making a quality mecha game is a lot harder than it sounds, which Strike Suit Zero exemplifies even as it comes possibly closer than anyone to pulling it off. In the same breath it also attempts to revitalize space combat shooters, again succeeding to a commendable degree yet still failing to shake the nagging issues that quickly present themselves. Strike Suit Zero's potential and ambition never wanes, but that doesn't stop its aspirations to come crashing down when they collide with reality.\n\nStrike Suit Zero as stated before, is a merging of large scale space fighter-pilot combat and screen filling mecha insanity, by way of the titular Strike Suit which can transform between a fast, maneuverable ship and the extremely power mecha form. The dynamic of swooping around picking off stray fighters and then switching forms to annihilate larger enemies is strategic but also just super cool, making you feel like the all-powerful terror your enemies supposedly see you as and gives developer Born Ready Games an excuse to blow the particle effects out during massive space battles that if nothing else are incredible to look at.\n\nThere's a weight to your ship that feels powerful, but without the limited mobility that often comes with higher firepower. It's balanced by requiring you to charge up your ship by killing enemies before you can transformed, and this limited fuel makes combat fast and frantic, as you chain together attacks to keep your meter full while trying to keep track of the situation. Strike Suit Zero excels at making you feel like just one small part of the giant battles going on around you, but still one capable of destroying giant cruisers and chasing down fighters.\n\nUnfortunately Born Ready Games has flown a little too close to the sun as the scale of the game quickly seems to get away from them, and the experience as a whole suffers quite a bit for it. Pacing is on of Strike Suit Zero's biggest opponents, and a concept it's fairly unconcerned with. Early missions are plodding, slow excursions as stiff bombing ships before you're given the Strike Suit, but even after missions have a tendency to stretch on and on as they continue to pile on new objectives which look very much like the last. Mission variety is virtually nonexistent, giving you largely the exact same scenarios each mission but ratcheting up the difficulty to uncomfortable levels.\n\nThese difficulty spikes and the unequaled number of checkpoints intensifies the lack of mission variation, which may have gone unnoticed for awhile but becomes hard to ignore when you already had to complete said objective dozens of times do to some untimely deaths. The vagueness with which objectives are explains only makes things worse, often overwhelming me with different tasks to where I didn't even know how to start or simply saying one thing while expecting me to infer the actual objective myself, usually by watching my ship explode and then reloading to hopefully get it the second time. Or the third. Or the forth. That's if I'm lucky.\n\nMuch of this difficulty could likely be the result of having missed upgrades the game expected me to have, as each is tied to a specific optional mission objective which are typically much harder to achieve than the original scenario. You can likely see the problem with a system like this, as it rewards skilled play but leaves everyone else in a state of incapable inferiority. The only option then is to replay old missions attempting to unlock the necessary upgrade or pray you can somehow scrape through anyway, which in my case usually involved copious amounts of perseverance and luck.\n\nIf not for the constant interruption of a cutscene I'd have likely forgotten there was a narrative here at all, one note and vague on details, delivered with monotone voiceovers telling of events you don't care about and characters you can't remember. There's the basis of something really interesting here, but it waits until the last moment to tell you any of it and by then it's too late to salvage much of anything from a story which for all intents and purposes is just you blowing up countless enemies that for some reason hate your guts.\n\nThe moments when Strike Suit Zero opens up, when the pieces click into place and its firing on all cylinders, are amazing and what kept me playing despite them being perpetuated with frustration and monotony. Born Ready Games has so entirely nailed the feel of the game they wanted to create, if only the scenarios you were placed in could keep up or give you any reason to want to continue on with them.","January 17, 2015","true","12.6"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","2"

Boring missions, terrible voice acting, and lousy checkpointing really strained by patience. The story is kind of fun, but the characters are all broadly-drawn stereotypes that completely undermine anything really interesting about it. The space combat is solid, but when you're grinding through another "destroy 20 enemy fighters" objective for the fourth time in the same mission, it gets a little old.\n\nWorst of all, the strike suit itself actually sucks. It has a few powers that are essential to your mission objectives, but using it in regular dogfighting makes you far, far less effective. The controls change, so you're disoriented, and by design not as mobile. So you take a ton of damage as you spin around, trying to lock on to as many things as you can with your multi-missiles.

If steam had a "so-so" button, I would choose that over a thumbs up. I enjoy this genre but I have a feeling majority won't. I should also mention you cannot freely fly around in space. You may freely fly around the battlefield.\n\nYou are a fighter pilot from United Nations of Earth versus galactic colonies. Generally, you will be assigned minor to major roles as the battle rages on. This may include taking out turrets, specific ships or guarding one of your own friendlies. As you fight, your teammates will be doing their own thing against the enemy. This is a neat concept but the game didn't go as in-depth as it could have. Essentially, you can change your targeting system to whomever you'd wish at any moment but unless your specifically supposed to take out 7 enemy fighters, you'll have no idea how many enemies are left.\n\nThe game controls themselves are okay. The rolling feature is okay but doesn't feel extremely effecting in dodging opponents fire. The flying itself takes a bit of time to get used to. Once you are accustomed to the style, most likely you will excel in the art. There are no cool gimmicks to do loop-to-loops like Star Fox or any crazy barrel rolls. Boost at least was included as well as a feature to "brake". They did add an arsenal of weapons to choose from. The basic weapon given is an energy weapon in which you can choose to shoot it rapidly over time or all in one burst. This weapon needs time to cool down in order to be fired efficiently again. Pressing the D-pad to the right will switch from an energy weapon to a chain-gun/machine gun sort of weapon. I personally like this one as the enemies health can quickly degrade. Missiles are another feature within the game. These can also be changed given what you like most or what you deem important for certain missions. Upon completing a few missions, the player will be given the opportunity to use other ships and even transform their ship into a space mech. The space mech can only be used when the player accumulates enough flux from landing their shots on enemies. Upon pressing A to transform, the mech utilizes it's own special set of weapons and missiles that can literally fire at many targets. This is a high light feature of the game. Overall, the flying experience is pleasurable and the combat experience is mediocre at best.\n\nThe visuals are very nice and use somewhat of a luminescent look. The sounds are decent as well as the dialogue. There isn't much variance when it comes to explosions or when weapons are being fired. A cockpit view as well as a ship view is available to choose from which is greatly appreciated!\n\nAs I've stated, a few people may find this game exceptional while others may stop playing a few missions in. It is fun, but it can feel like a grind after a while doing the similar missions over and over. I also found the difficulty to sort of jump at times.\n\n\n\nRATING : 6.85/10\n\nGameplay	C+	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+\n\nScreenShots :\nCockpit view","December 23, 2015","true","2.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

However, the lack of any sort of multiplayer detracts from the experience, but not too terribly. I also found everything well-made graphically and often rather pleasing to the eye. In terms of gameplay, the titular machine really feels like a force to be reckoned with; however, while all the vehicles feel different from the others, the Strike Suit is the one that really stood out for me, as it most likely has and probably will for others who have piloted or will pilot it.\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8.5/10","May 21, 2015","true","68.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

It's a genre that's curiously disappeared from gaming despite the same appeal -- fast-paced action, reflex & skill gameplay, gorgeous sci-fi settings -- still being alive and well.\n\nOut of the blue for me came Strike Suit Zero, an underdog sci-fi dogfighting adventure about gunning down ships, bombarding frigates, and launching 50 missiles at the same time while barely jetting out of crossfire with no shields and sliver of plating between you and space-explosion, all to a pulsing, adrenaline-pumping soundtrack. And let me tell you, it feels awesome.\n\nWhile Strike Suit Zero is not as meaty in content as some classics I mentioned, it is a tremendous feat by an indie studio rivaling the look & feel of many an Ubisoft or EA game, and for the most part focuses on what lean dogfighting action it must.\n\nSo despite its occasional loose threads (the last story mission is a failure, unfortunately), Strike Suit Zero is a finely-crafted action experience that I'm glad to have discovered, and remain extremely excited about whatever the team pulls off next. Let it be said: I'd pre-order a sequel in a heartbeat.","December 2, 2013","true","9.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The missions are relatively straightforward to begin with. Like Rogue Squadron, eventually the missions start evolving halfway through—simple missions become heated dog fights as enemy reinforcements arrive.\n\nThe learning curve is a bit steeper than something like Rogue Squadron though; there are a lot of dynamics involved that the game trains you in at a good pace. This is how it's supposed to work.\n\nI definitely recommend a gamepad. I'm a keyboard user, but this is the sort of thing gamepads are built for. By the last missions, you'll be twitching and flicking buttons without hesitation or thought.\n\nOne more thing that makes this fantastic: the soundtrack. The blend of synthetica, ambients and old school woodwinds gives you something along the lines of space-age maritime music. I can't quite nail it down, but they definitely nailed the mood. Cruising towards the black fleet to the harrowing tune of a clarinet (oboe?) doesn't seem awesome on paper, but it is.","March 6, 2015","true","18.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Do not attempt to use just a keyboard and mouse to play this; the best option would be a 360 wireless controller. Even with that you may still be left with playing with the controls. Including the game has a horrible time remembering you choose to not use  inverted controls...\n\n\nThe music is decent, however I felt it was not very fitting of the game play, this is also one of the problems I have with it. While the music isn't the focus of game play they could have done so much better with which scores they choose for one. Good example of this would be the temps from eve online. Of course eve onlines music becomes pland after a while, however it takes a rather long time. Within the first 30 minutes of playing this I switched to custom music. (I also own the OST of this)\n\nThe spikes of how hard this becomes go from, not hard at all, to extremely hard.

While the graphic itself is not comparable with Crysis for example, it still is stunning how it all looks. The background, the ships and even the tracers of weapons.\n\nControls: The controls were really complicated. But after the first 2 missions you get used to it and experience how you can do anything you want. From fast barrel-roll dodging to sprint-dashing to an enemy sentry. You have to get used to the game in general.\n\nGameplay: It was absolutely lovely. Pure greatness. It's fast space-combat while you're in the middle of massive ships shooting at each other with an army of tiny ships flying around you. A great space dogfight.  I had a lot of fun playing this game, while the missions were quite monotone I still enjoyed every mission as it's kind of a 'kiting' game. Attack, when your armor is low fly away, get back when your armor is replenished. And honestly: It wasn't even boring.\nAs I got the Strike Suit, the gameplay completely changed! It was still a kiting game, but as soon as I had enough Flux (the power to be the Strike Suit and shoot with it) through my normal ship even as I had low armor I was still offensive with my Strike Suit because you had the opportunity to dash away and had a new fighting system.\nI absolutely loved it.\n\nStory: There are 5 different missions with every of them including something for the story.\nYou're a guy who has been sent in deep in space to join the forces of Earth while they're attempting to intercept the fleet. You're in an interstellar war: Earth's forces (U.N.E, United Nations of Earth) fighting against fearless enemies to protect a planet which is shortly before destruction.\nYou begin as a low-priority guard near Earth. You have an Apex Ship which can't transform into a Strike Suit yet.\nAfter an attack, Earth's command say that the enemies are intending to end the war with one decisive strike.\nThey've amassed a colossal fleet and are bringing it to Earth.\nThe story is ok, it gets you fast into gameplay.\n\nMusic: It pumps you up, isn't obviously repetitive and fits with the atmosphere and the art of fighting.\n\nEndings: There are multiple endings. You can choose which one you want. For example, the secondary objectives you choose to complete directly affect the state of Earth and the end of the game. With multiple endings, preventing Earth's destruction is your immediate concern but preserving its future is your ultimate goal.\n\nUnfortunately: The game doesn't get any of it's promised updates, which is annoying and sad.\n\nAnd all that for 19€. (18€ with the Director's Cut)\nI would definetly play it again.\nLooking forward on buying "Strike Suit Infinity" (6€) which apparently puts you in waves and waves of the decisive war.","July 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I am a sci-fi buff and I love to fly fighters (on rails or not) across striking space vistas. So I jumped in this game fairly excited.\n\nFirst the story, or should I say something scramble together that only serves to move the game forward; Humans discovered space travel, humans colonized other worlds, humans divided into two factions, humans fight...and that's pretty much it. I understand this is an indie game but the folks at Born Ready could've worked harder. A great story is usually free.\n\nVisually I found the game to be stunning. Even though most backdrops had a "paint" feel, everything was most pleasant on the eyes. Sound effects were top notch as well. Explosions, collisions, warning cues, felt meaty and had impact. On the music side things weren't so nice. A good "Mass Effect" ambient music is peppered here and there, but during most missions the music defaults to a theme build on arabic rythmns and instruments. To say that it clashed with the visual is an understatement.\n\nGameplay felt solid, controls (with a 360 controller) felt just right, though the default binds are not the best, I urge you to customize them. The screenshots might give you the feeling that this is an on rails game but it is not. There is a mission area with more than enough room to let you try different strategies. On the flip side, mission objectives are all linear and most are accompanied by a countdown.\n\nWhere things crackle is in the overarching mechanics. The game has 13 missions, each of them long and segmented. The game relies on checkpoints to save your progress and they are NOT evenly placed. On normal difficulty, the game can be hard. More often than not, once you die you will have to replay a big stretch of the mission, any sense of progression is lost and the game becomes a chore.\n\nYou can also earn upgrades for the suit, but they don't seem to make a lick of a difference. For instance you gain a shield upgrade, but in the next mission the shield is still the same lenght and diminishes at the same speed as before. Furthermore, the only way to gain those upgrades are through secondary objectives, which is fine by me. The problem is that in some missions the game won't offer any visual cues to inform you on your progress OR the secondary objectives are so hard/impossible to accomplish that you simply give up.\n\nPros :\n-Striking visuals\n-Solid controls\n-Variety of ships (you get to fly more than the suit!)\n\nCons :\n-Some gameplay mechanics and checkpoint system makes the game a chore\n-Subpar and inadequate music\n-Upgrade system is useless\n-Enough with the countdowns\n-Final mission is a joke\n-Achievements are a grind\n\nFinal note : I can only recommend this game to hardcore sci-fi shooters. Born Ready shows promise though, if they can spend more time refining their mechanics their sequel can be great.\n\nPS. The game offer VR support, If I ever get my hands on the Oculus Rift I will play Strike Suit Zero again. On VR this game should be a blast!\n\n6/10","January 11, 2014","true","13.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Truly, I thought it was too easy at first. If you're a passable shot in Wing Commander or Ace Combat or anything like that, you should be a dead-eye marksman in this. I went through the first three levels not using the lock-on function. It was only later that I discovered the game has a freaking target-lead reticle. If you cant shoot using that, don't say anything about it because you're a walking advocate for gun control.\n\nOf course, then comes the part where you get a mech. Maybe that part was easier for others. I had no idea how to use the damn thing at first. I'll tell you this much; it's not a fighter, but once you get the hang of it and get some strike mode upgrades it's hell on...legs. The Strike Suit is unbelievably maneuverable, not the slow thing some would have you believe. I became an ace with it fairly quickly just by spamming random momvement input and keeping the cursor on-track. Anybody can do that.\n\nAs for chatoic; yeah, it's chatoic. Gloriously chaotic. Ever play "Homeworld" and wonder what it would be like to be an interceptor pilot in one of those mad dogfights where everyone is set to evasive tactics? That is this, glowing contrails and all. Even so, it is not unmanageable. The "F" key will helpfully direct you to what you're supposed to be shooting at. Just use it and use it fast because you will need time to orient yourself to which side of the a capital ship or somesuch your target is actually on. An improvement to this game would be to make targets with no LOS a different shade of red.\n\nThen there's blandness,  an argument I have seen in every video review. There aren't enough varieties of enemy ships or varieties in missions. I can sorta see that; everything boils down to attacking or defending, rather than including the more diverse missions of space fighters, like attending airshows or flying to Cancun for a weekend.\n\nI jest, for there is some merit to the argument. Why doesn't the mech do more mech things, for instance. Well, for starters this began as a freeware game and doesn't have the engine for that sort of thing. For another, it's a Japanese mech so it doesn't have to make sense. It's all about awesome battles set to goregous backdrops and great music. Call me crazy, but getting those out of the way is a major step to making a decent game, so I don't regret a cent of the cost for the steam mega bundle.\n\nThat said, one of the really nice surprises in this game is not just the chaos, but the frenetic pace of the action. Hands up if you've played an "intense" game where something needs to be done "right now" and it turns out that you've got forever and a couple of sick days to do it. Not so in SS0, thank the powers that be. When told to ignore the enemy fighters and flak, it's no joke most of the time. You really do have to be quick, especially if you want the juicy upgrades.\n\nIt's not a game for everyone. If you don't like explosive arcade flight sims, you won't like this game. If you think the Strigoi Squadron in Ace Combat was too easy, you need to spend a few hours in a centrifuge to learn some respect for gravity due to acceleration, but if you're somewhere in-between I think you'll like this game.","November 6, 2014","true","43.4"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","15","24","4","0"

Just add new graphics, space mechas, a space-flight/mecha sim, and less plot and that's what Strike Suit Zero is to me (which is just as well, since the composer is the same as Homeworld's, in a very noticeable fashion).\n\nIf you don't remember Homeworld, however, I'll break it down: Strike Suit Zero is a space-flight/mecha sim hybrid with a story that takes you and a small fleet far away from home and into deep space. The objective, or plot, is to take Earth back and a new development in technology, the Strike Suit, will make it possible.\n\nThe damn thing is the Deus Ex Machina device of the game, and you control it. That doesn't mean that it's necessarily overpowered, however. The "mecha" funtion of the "suit" is limited to how much you shoot with it. Kills and general destruction grants a special 'fuel' for it to allow you to transform from space ship to mecha form, and unleash pure death. You have to conserve this great power, since your ship-mode isn't the best against all of the enemies you will face, so some strategy and tactics along the way are necessary to stay alive and complete your objectives.\n\nThe game, overall, is short but challenging. I'll say that, after a few months of picking this up, I haven't touched it much since I finished it, but it's a bit of a guilty pleasure as well. It's hard not to appreciate firing thrity-odd something missiles at multiple targets, and even harder doing the same to large-scale capital ships. And it's in space. And it has great OST.\n\nThis isn't a game that anyone can really tell you about; this game is an experience. The blend of music, gameplay, and setting makes it good while it lasts. The ending (or endings) isn't the best, but it's not worse than Mass Effect 3's, so the good characteristics mentioned prior more than make up for it.","December 12, 2013","true","12.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

There aren't many space games anymore so it was nice to have one. The presentation of the game was nice, with voice acting for important characters, and the combat was decent (even though the controls are extremely clunky).\n\nHowever, after a few hours of fun, you start noticing the many problems this game has :\n- Dogfighting is almost inexistant. It's so hard to aim, you're better off using homing missiles to blast small ships.\n- Since small ships are not much more than flies, you keep encountering middle-sized or big ships to make it an actual game, but the number of different ships is very limited, so the game soon gets very repetitive, blasting one big ship after another one.\n- Also, the arcade gameplay means you can crash into a space station of a big ship, and you will only lose your shield, which soon regenerates. I don't ask for a strict simulation, but this is too much on the arcade side. You have no fear of big ships or close fly by, because the worst that can happen  is losing your shield temporarily\n- The HUD is a complete mess. All enemies icons are the exact same red. A big ships can have 10 or even 20 icons on her, because there is one icon per gun. So unless you get way too close, you usually are never sure what the heck you're actually shooting at. You can't even make out the difference between a fighter and a gun of a capital ship.\n- The sound effects are highly annoyings. Low health ? You get a constant beeping sound. Being targetted by missile ? another slightly different beeping sound. You locking-in on another target ? ANOTHER beeping. And you have to listen to theses constant beeps very closely because you have to notice the "being targetted by a missile" sound (you have to use your EMP at the right moment to avoid it). That constant beeping is driving me nuts.\n- And finally, the checkpoints. Born Read Games said they wanted the game to be difficult. Well, spacing out checkpoints, while reloading all ammo (making it easy to choose the low ammo, high damage weapons), and refilling all health wasn't the way to go. Especially when all checkpoints are in the "dead" moments of the gameplay. Usually reloading a checkpoint means you have to suffer through 2-5 min of nothing much happening, before finally getting to the part that is actually giving you problem. More checkpoints, but no health/ammo reloads would have made the game much more enjoyable, and maybe even more difficult.\n\nI will stop that list here. There are other smaller issues, but i don't want to flog the dead horse again and again. Especially since i wanted to like this game, and actually enjoyed the first few hours on it.\n\nOn the whole, Born Ready Games had good intentions, and i know they had a limited budget, so they probably couldn't do everything they wanted with the game. However, there are way too many small things that make the game annoying, repetitive, and just a chore to finish on any difficulty except easy (which is way too easy).","May 31, 2014","false","18.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

As such, it is relatively easy to learn and control but has a fair bit of challenge and you can really feel yourself improving as you play. SSZ is also a highly focused game. Story, graphics, and sound design are all good but not great and it only has a relatively short singleplayer campaign, with no multiplayer or other game modes. However, the core gameplay is definitely strong enough to carry the game and make it worth playing. Flying along an enemy capitol ship and blowing up its turrets and fighters in a space mech is very fun and empowering, even if you end up doing it a lot over the course of the game.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it to people who like singleplayer space combat sims, especially the Freespace series.","March 31","true","8.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Having both Strike Suit Zero and Strike Suit Infinity, it feels as though they split the story mode and gauntlet skirmish mode of one game up into two separate games that should have been sold as one game at a slighty higher price. The base and DLC campaigns are enjoyable to play through the first time and total to 18 missions evoking themes that make me remember the Homeworld series campaigns. However, there is very limited replayability beyond trying a handful of different ship and weapon loadouts on the same missions.\n\nFurther, a graphics update, an additional strike suit from Infinity, and a new strike suit design were released separately to a Director's Cut edition. I understand other people may disagree with me, but I feel that these upgrades should have been sold as a DLC for this version. The Director's Cut steam page also has negative reviews noting that the developer abandoned that version as well, with new bugs introduced into that version left unfixed.\n\nUnlike Infinity, Zero is mod-able with Steam support. However, few mods have been produced for this game and the community appears to be defunct. There is no mission editor.\n\nI cannot recommend it due to the above points. It may have acceptable value if you are only looking for a space combat title to play through a few times then uninstall - even so, I would only buy it during a sale, and I would suggest that you buy Infinity over Zero or the Zero Director's Cut due to Infinity's relatively higher replay value.","May 2, 2015","false","10.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Once I hit the third mission and was given the titular Strike Suit, it all went to hell.\n\nImmediately bombarded with far more targets and action on the screen than up to this point, it was extremely hard to tell what was happening, where to go, or what to do. They give you a nice targetting arrow, but when the whole screen is constantly flashing red and the sounds of explosions are flooding everything, that little red arrow is tricky to find. So it's total sensory overload, but even that could be overcome IF the damned strike suit could maneuver with any degree of control. It cannot.\n\nI reduced the mouse sensetivity to the lowest possible settings, and still the slightest twitch of my hand had my targetting reticule flying all over the screen. I spent 20 minutes trying to get a handle on how this was supposed to work, but finally gave up. No matter what I did, the strike suit careened around wildly and utterly out of control, making it impossible to try and pursue objectives, lock onto targets, or generally have any clue what was going on.\n\nMaybe it's me. Obviously others have played and completed the game, and obviously some have really enjoyed it. But my experience was that it was impossible to control the ship, and so impossible to enjoy the game. Perhaps using a flight stick controller makes a difference, I don't know. Maybe players more expert in flight games can make a better go of it.\n\nBut, if you're like me and are a starfighter/mecha enthusiast but not an old hand at flight games, you might want to give this one a pass. I got it for $5 and played for around 2 hours before walking away. That's about the return on investment of a movie ticket, so I'm not angry, but I can't say I'm happy either.","February 17, 2014","false","2.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The only "tactic" in this game revolves around the Strike Suite, a contrivance that technomagically charges itself when you destroy enemies. A mechanic that once aquired evaporated any verisimilitude I may have had towards the experience.\n\nFor all its polish, the mechanics of the combat left me dissatisfied and wanting for more.

I am sorry I waited so long to play this game. I bought it as a bundle and the game sat on my inventory collecting cyber dust for several months. It is a great standard space shooter. If you just want to get better at dog-fighting, this is your game. If you are looking more of a space sim with trading and stuff, this is NOT your game. However, the game is very good at what is does. The battles go from easy to hard in the blink of an eye. You will find yourself fleeing away from enemy fleet laser cannons and turrets quiet often.  Contrary to popular belief, I found the controls of this game to be very good and responsive. I can see how people who are not very good at dog fighting can argue that the controls are bad. Don't listen to them. The game is fast pace and YOU need to be fast, YOU need to be responsive. I found myself switching between weapons and third/first person mode CONSTANTLY, just so I could get the shot I wanted for the easy kill.  The game has bright colors, great music, and explosions...lots of them!!\n\nStrike Mode\n\nI loved the concept of Strike mode. Basically, as you progress along you get a new ship that’s has the ability to transform into a mean robot looking beast that takes out everything is its path. The best thing about it is that if you are not into that sort of thing, you don't have to use it. Simple!\n\nIn short: The game is very good at space combat. It is hard (hard=good) with good controls and I'm yet to see a bug or crash.\n\nOnce again, great Indie space title.

With your superior firepower, the game quickly becomes an arcade shoot'em up as you take down endless waves of enemy fighters and capital ships. There are the odd stealth or escort missions, but generally the gameplay suffers from a lack of variety. Performance upgrades to your ship can be earned by achieving optional objectives as an incentive to replay missions, but unless you're into maxing out achievements, I did not feel that this was a compelling enough reason to revisit missions. The missions themselves are linear - so if an objective is failed you simply have to restart from a previous checkpoint.\n\nThe backstory of Colonials vs Earth, alien artifacts and AIs had a lot of potential, but this was not fully explored. The enemy is simply a faceless evil armada hell-bent on the destruction of Earth while your rag-tag fleet are the good guys standing in their way. What prompted them to this extreme course of action? What atrocities did Earth commit to warrant this genocide? Nothing is explained. The characters are equally forgettable. While the voice acting is fairly decent, character development is non-existent: they are simply there to give you orders.\n\nWith better variety, pacing and story-telling, I would have considered this a great game; it certainly falls short of my childhood favourites. However, as the product of an indie studio, this is still a slick and polished product that is short and fun if you're looking for your fix of gratuitous space battles. And giant robots.","January 1, 2014","false","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They literally took every concept I hate from all the 90s games and put it in it.

Not many people seemed to have the same problem with me so you can say it may be just be on this but things seemed a bit too sharp for me.\n\n\nGeneral input: Recommended if you love space action and flying a ship into battles.\nDo not let teh final mission take down the average experience from the game.\nDo buy the Strike Suit Infinite for unlimited battles and lots of fun.\n\nCheers\n\n\nPS: sorry for crappy grammar, i did this review really fast.","August 15, 2013","true","20.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

The gameplay is phenominal, it's like playing the balls of god- if they were deep-fried and required a gamepad. The visuals are very flashy, suprisingly bright, and very pleasing to look at; despite not being "up-to-par" they definately deserve some praise, because I've never seen so many ♥♥♥♥ing light trails. Not even in Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack is a very calming, yet tense J-Pop-esque compiliation of themes that give me eargasms, and when combined with the sound effects, will make you spaz out in a pool of your own urine. The story sucks. There's nothing that could redeem it, really, read a synopsis. It sucks. Luckily, you'll be so immersed, that you will care about every character anyways, two-dimensional or not. Also, the A.I is pretty great if you ramp it up to hard, other-wise you might find it a peice of cake. HOWEVER difficulty is insane if you want the ideal upgrades on hard, requiring borderline suicial amounts of replays to accomplish.

Although the Mecha designation might not be the best here. First of all you are the only who can transform from a normal space ship fighter to a mecha which is much more powerful, however also more stationary. And there is only ship capable of transforming and you don't even have access to it all of the time. Most importantly perhaps is that your time in the Mech mode is limited, you can transform as soon as you gather a little bit of energy (which you can do automatically and very slowly over time, or quickly by destroying enemies), but you also quickly expend that energy simply by firing on your opponents. It seems that the only way they managed to balance the game is by limiting how long you can stay in the more fun Mech mode.\n\nThe targeting system also isn't very helpful, and there is no overview of what kind of enemies you're fighting. So the only way for you to get an overview of the situation is by actually looking around. That becomes very problematic in the later missions when you're tasked with protecting your fleet and you've got multiple enemy cruisers coming down on them, with your main objective being to destroy the beam cannons which do massive damage to your fleet. However as there is no overview there is no good way to be sure that you've actually neutralized the biggest threats. Unless you know for a fact how many of each ship is out there, which of course you'll only learn once you've failed the mission and that is simply not good game design.\n\nBackground music for the game is very nice, however it can become quite repetitive as there isn't much variety there.\n\nThe story itself is very generic, but still passable and kept my attention to the end (which comes quite quickly though), which is more than most other similar games can do.\n\nAll in all, the game isn't anything special but it's fun to play, at least through its short campaign.\n\n6 / 10","August 14, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, this ship is awesome, as you can transform into a flying space-mech and unleash huge barrages of swarm missiles, taking out large numbers of enemy fighters in one fell swoop.\n\nSome of the later levels get very hectic, and it can become tough to keep track of the battle around you. Capital ships can be annoying as they are bristling with many different turret types, and locking onto and destroying the correct turrets can be finicky.\n\nStory is passable, but nothing special in the slightest.

I don't want to say much about the final mission at the risk of spoiling something for those who might want to see for themselves.

I like hard games, but i like hard games that are fun while they are being hard. This game is not. It's really unfortunate because the graphics are really cool and i haven't played a game that made me feel so much like i was in a space opera since TIE Fighter or Babylon 5: I've Found Her. But this style of game has dated a lot, and Strike Suit Zero emphasizes the worst parts of the genre (combat) while neglecting the parts that made it good (storyline, dialog, wingmen, flying around massive space stations in awe...)\n\nI could overlook the fact that your wingmen shoot blanks and your capital ships just float around waiting to be destroyed by insanely slow-moving torpedoes, if it wasn't for the cheesiness of being tasked to single-handedly take down enemy capital ships in a puny fighter that never stops flying forwards. Nevermind being able to fire thrusters to strafe around your target - you can't even come to a dead stop. It makes the whole game feel like Rebel Assault or some other oldskool rail shooter, except for the fact a turret will take you out in about 0.42 seconds. And if you do manage to somehow waste your target, don't worry, you won't get any time to enjoy the scenery, because the mission will either immediately end, or (more likely) another three capital ships will drop out of warp to blast you back to a checkpoint half an hour ago.

In light of this, screw Metacritic.\n\nSSZ is a straightforward, arcadey space combat game with a twist. Being able to transform into what's essentially a Gundam is a great spin on the genre, and you get a real sense of power when you do; casually swatting away swarms of enemy fighters and missiles like they were nothing. Yet it balances this power with an energy bar of sorts, the more enemies you destroy, the more the it charges, making you swap between the two forms often, which keeps the pace of the action high and stops it from degenerating into constant dogfights.\n\nStrike Suit Zero is a pure fun. If you like streamlined, action oriented space games, this is easily one of your best options available. It's a simple beast, but it's also a fast paced, satisfying, and damn good looking game.","May 22, 2013","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example, you’ll see the large torpedoes and “no need to dodge” countermeasures from “Starlancer”, you’ll remember the flak cannons and ship beams from “Freespace 2”, and you’ll find a Karan S’jet clone. I believe even the missile types are copied from “FS 2”.\n\nWhat distinguishes this game from the others of its kind is the ability to turn into a mech and fire spread missiles at multiple targets. If you’re a fan of mecha anime, this will be pretty familiar to you. It takes some time to get used to this system. However, once you master it, you’ll be fighting like a real “Macross/Robotech” ace, transforming between mech and fighter in the middle of dogfights.\n\nYou should be warned that this game is also more arcade-like than usual. No power management, no radar, no shield convergence. When you fly a bomber, you have an infinite amount of torpedoes. When you restart from a checkpoint, you get a full ammo reload and hull repair.\nThe story is pretty basic. Colonials want to destroy Earth and that’s all you know about them. There’s nothing about their ideology or personality. There’s no communications from them whatsoever throughout the game, not even a “Surrender or die!”. Enemy units don’t have names, not even the cruisers and carriers.\n\nMission design is the game’s biggest flaw. When you’re attacking enemy fighters and your flight leader says “ignore the fighters, focus on your objectives”, what she means is “enemy fighters have infinite waves, so don’t bother”. Sometimes you have to take out flak cannons before the bombers come in, sometimes you don’t. Sometimes the objective is to destroy the cruiser, sometimes you have to protect the bombers which will do that for you and it’s mission failed if they get destroyed by those infinite waves of enemy fighters. You’ll see so many enemy ships throughout the campaign, that you’ll wonder if Earth ever had a chance to win the war in the first place. On defense missions, you’ll learn to love checkpoints.\n\nIt’s a fun game. Looks easy at first and it only gets hard when you start fighting the Black Fleet. When you master the strike suit, you’ll love flying it. However, if you played classics like “FS 2” and the X-wing or “Wing Commander” series, it’s likely that you won’t take this game seriously.\nFor example, when I did the bomber mission and realized I had infinite torpedoes plus a ton of missiles for self-defense, I remembered my experience as a TIE Bomber pilot and the bomber tutorial in “FS 2” and I actually laughed.","August 14, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is very mindless - the story is a excuse plot (In a war between EARF and COLONIALS, ♥♥♥♥ got real and now it's up to YOU to stop the destruction blah blah) with about four characters in all, but it's not about the story. It's not about being thought out and tactical, it's about you in a super ship that can turn into a robot suit for a limited time and murder everyone in the immediate area. It's about your headphones being a blurr of missile beeps, low energy explosions, objective chatter and explosions all at once.\n\nIt's also a game that (harmlessly) takes the ♥♥♥♥ out on you if you don't meet it's rather the rather strict score requirements of its medals/ranks.

Reminds me a bit of Battle Engine Aquila, that I used to play when I was just a kid. Played it for 5 hours now and I'm at 51% through the campaign, but missions are getting harder and take longer to complete them.\n\nGraphics are good (1920x1200, graphics options maxed out), but not outstanding. The engine handles the big fights with lots of ships and explosions at the same time very well, with almost no framedrops. Would be nice though if the background had a higher resolution.\n\nControls are very intuitive, but there is quite a learning curve to use the ship optimally. I see some people complaining on the web about (lack of) checkpoints, but there are plenty in my view. About 2 or 3 checkpoints in every mission (missions take 10-30 min), you can't manually save however. Storyline is not that great, but who cares, you get to blow up fighters, bombers, frigates and sometimes even cruisers, and lots of them! You can also fly in realistic in 3 dimensions, meaning you are not stuck in a sort of 'plane' that some space games have.\n\nPersonally I like the soundtrack that comes with the game, but that is of course very subjective.\n\nOne thing irritates me bit though, the game has a lot of very loud explosions.

Strike Suit Zero manages to provide you with a fast and frantic space combat, either on 3rd person mode or cockpit mode. It will probably remind you of early space games on the PC market. The game takes place on a raging conflict between the Colonists and the United Nations of Earth (U.N.E.) where you fight alongside the U.N.E. forces on a struggle to save Earth from total destruction and uncovering a hidden mystery about an alien ship that was found on one of the colonies. Visually, the game is stellar, providing you with total immersion during each fight, specially during massive fleet battles between carriers and cruisers with tons of explosions and projectiles. Now, the soundtrack is absolutly great it really reminded me of the old days when I used to play Homeworld 2 and Strike Suit Zero actually made me feel like I was piloting one of the fighters from Homeworld because the setting is so similar and I'm pretty sure it was one of the inspirations. Other than that the story at first might not be all that great but on the last missions it starts to get interesting and it will tickle your curiosity. The combat does an amazing job, it feels extremely satisfying both when using missiles or rockets or when using your main gun, probably the best fighting sections will happen with the actual Strike Suit Zero. I have one complain about this game however, I found the final mission extremely hard and frustrating and I fould myself raging, it does not feature any kind of enemies but what it does feature is a corridor "racing" segment which ended up with me going against the walls 95% of the times. Other than that, this was a total blast to play and I highly recommend it, it is definitely one of the best space fighting games I've ever played.\n\n","September 21, 2013","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's it. There is a story, but it's not very good or long.\n\nThere are 4 space ships. They get unlocked throughout the missions. You get new weapons the same way.\n\nYou are always moving forward, but you can slow down a bit when holding S and speed up when holding W. You shoot and aim with mouse. You have armor (your HP basically- depleted means death), thruster (short speed up - the max speed you can achieve) and shield (your second HP bar - it regenerates when not taking damage; depleted means that your armor can be damaged).\n\n3 difficulties - easy - should be medium if you ask me; medium - this is hard;  hard - not trying this one.

I am not a fan of these space games so it might be me.\n\nWhen you complete a mission, the game shows you your score and gives you a medal, a new weapon and an upgrade if you have completed the challenge.

"destroy all torpedos shot at the carrier"- you are supposed to defend the ship called The Carrier, but there are small ships shooting at you and the carrier.

Then history apparently decided to move on and the genre has been lain dormant for years. Strike Suit Zero is the debut from indie studio Born Ready Games and gives ample reason for both nostalgia and anticipation.\n\nDevelopers have clearly studied the genre classics but I did not see Strike Suit Zero as mere retro but rather as classicism. All the lessons learned from the past are condensed into a clear, timeless form. There is no extra weight anywhere. No side paths are taken nor excess features added. You can shake and batter the game all you want but nothing will come loose.\n\nThis principle extends to the writing as well for there is no characterization and virtually no lore. I enjoyed being spared expositions and lore dumps but on the other hand missed the sense of history or touches of everyday life. The game world is elegant and pure but cold, almost metallic, and this will not appeal to everyone.\n\nThere are thirteen missions in the campaign and most of the criticism towards the game have been directed at the level of difficulty. It has to be said that many missions required complete restarts and in some cases replaying earlier missions for missed upgrades. Whether or not this is a bad thing is up for debate. I enjoyed the challenge and the general mission design where things escalated in a logical fashion. There are typically two checkpoints per mission and restarting from one will restore both hull and ammunition which makes things more manageable. The titular Strike Suit is powerful to say the least but requires skill to master. The missions are so intense and tightly knit that a precise execution of the objectives is always required.\n\nFor a Kickstarter title I was continually stunned by what I saw and heard. The soundtrack is the equal of any recent sci-fi game and was composed by Paul Ruskay of Homeworld fame. Even better are the fantastic visuals. Seeing the screen lit up by capital ships' beam cannons and dozens of fighters and bombers fighting for survival is spectacular to say the least. The potential for screenshots is great indeed, especially given the various backdrops ranging from misty nebulas to a destroyed planet. Voice actors sound calm and clear throughout and fit the atmosphere admirably. Developers clearly believe in their work and have been very active with the community, posting on the Forums, adding free mod tools and patching as needed.\n\nGiven the fact no one can jump out of themself and think as a bodiless ghost objectivity is a hard thing to achieve. Accordingly I cannot say how Strike Suit Zero would feel for those unfamiliar with the genre. On one hand the game almost expected that I already knew space combat beforehand. Weapon and targeting systems seemed familiar and so did the process of supporting capital ships in major engagements, et cetera. On the other hand there are no serious post-millennial competitors out there at the moment. Strike Suit Zero is like space in more ways than one: cold but beautiful in a way that appealed to my personal tastes very much indeed and will more than likely do the same for anyone wanting to embrace the void for the duration of this gaming experience.","November 9, 2013","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player plays as a reformed fighter pilot who is re-commissioned to the front lines in a desperate suicidal struggle to stop the rebel onslaught against Earth, along with their new and mysterious weapon that is literally ripping holes through entire fleets and worlds.\n\nWhile you have very little interaction with the enemy faction, what are incredible are the believable archetypes of the allies and friends you make along the way. You will care very much about the allies you rescue and that rescue you from the perils of interstellar warfare. With themes from several science fiction settings and ominous overtones about the rise and fall of mankind, there is plenty of depth to be excited about as you meet new characters and face new challenges.\n\nThe gameplay is magnificent and convincing; once you get ahold of the strike suit, you go from being a regular pilot hanging on to life with sheer grit to a space hero like unto those in anime of this genre, hell-bent on keeping your friends and comrades alive through each and every encounter. You will hang turns, glide around gigantic ships and launch attacks so devastating that afterwards you can't help but jump up and roar with righteous vindication. To that end, the protagonist and the enemies are so quiet that you are left space to imagine you are any kind of hero or anti-hero you like, the plot ambiguous enough to let you have your own adventure while still shaping the events and circumstances you fight your way through. Are you a grizzled space cowboy back for one last ride? Or are you a bloodthirsty convict, with nothing left but a war to fight? It's up to you to impose your personal motivations on the main character. In spite of or perhaps due to these intentional gaps in information, the story telling, the sound, the visuals and the music are all clearly a labor of love and do exactly what they're intended to do: Let you have your own robot space fighter fantasy.\n\nAre there negatives? Yes, a few. The game is too short. The director's cut is oddly paced and undercuts the original vision of the game. The combat is samey and the upgrades are extremely difficult, impossible in some cases, to obtain without replaying missions later on, which greatly pads out the playtime with replay. However, as an Indi title and one of the best games so far this millennium, all of these negatives can be completely overlooked. There are plenty of modes and versions for you to satisfy your desire to dogfight and ace your way to victory, and ultimately all add up to satisfying content. Never mind how amazing some of the mods are for this game.\n\n11/10. If you like arcade shooters, sci-fi, anime, space odyssey, warfare, dogfighting, or just stupidly impressive visuals, play this game. Strike Suit Zero is a fantastic time.","December 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Cockpit view is nice, and the graphics are good enough albeit nothing special. The difficulty is a bit high at times, especially if you want to get the Optional Objectives. Once you've unlocked the Strike Suit, the gameplay changes DRAMMATICALLY. It feels so empowering, so great to be liberated from the normal movement of a spaceship.\n\nThe soundtrack is also pretty good, especially when it includes vocal track by KOKIA (one of my most favorite Japanese singers).

For me, I absolutely love it.

The player plays as a reformed fighter pilot who is re-commissioned to the front lines in a desperate suicidal struggle to stop the rebel onslaught against Earth, along with their new and mysterious weapon that is literally ripping holes through entire fleets and worlds.\n\nWhile you have very little interaction with the enemy faction, what are incredible are the believable archetypes of the allies and friends you make along the way. You will care very much about the allies you rescue and that rescue you from the perils of interstellar warfare. With themes from several science fiction settings and ominous overtones about the rise and fall of mankind, there is plenty of depth to be excited about as you meet new characters and face new challenges.\n\nThe gameplay is magnificent and convincing; once you get ahold of the strike suit, you go from being a regular pilot hanging on to life with sheer grit to a space hero like unto those in anime of this genre, hell-bent on keeping your friends and comrades alive through each and every encounter. You will hang turns, glide around gigantic ships and launch attacks so devastating that afterwards you can't help but jump up and roar with righteous vindication. To that end, the protagonist and the enemies are so quiet that you are left space to imagine you are any kind of hero or anti-hero you like, the plot ambiguous enough to let you have your own adventure while still shaping the events and circumstances you fight your way through. Are you a grizzled space cowboy back for one last ride? Or are you a bloodthirsty convict, with nothing left but a war to fight? It's up to you to impose your personal motivations on the main character. In spite of or perhaps due to these intentional gaps in information, the story telling, the sound, the visuals and the music are all clearly a labor of love and do exactly what they're intended to do: Let you have your own robot space fighter fantasy.\n\nAre there negatives? Yes, a few. The game is too short. The director's cut is oddly paced and undercuts the original vision of the game. The combat is samey and the upgrades are extremely difficult, impossible in some cases, to obtain without replaying missions later on, which greatly pads out the playtime with replay. However, as an Indi title and one of the best games so far this millennium, all of these negatives can be completely overlooked. There are plenty of modes and versions for you to satisfy your desire to dogfight and ace your way to victory, and ultimately all add up to satisfying content. Never mind how amazing some of the mods are for this game.\n\n11/10. If you like arcade shooters, sci-fi, anime, space odyssey, warfare, dogfighting, or just stupidly impressive visuals, play this game. Strike Suit Zero is a fantastic time.","December 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's more of an arcade/action game, with level-based progression. However, just because it's not open world doesn't mean it's a bad game. In fact, it's really cool!\n\nGameplay is fast, control is so smooth and works well both with mouse-keyboard or gamepad (I prefer gamepad though). Cockpit view is nice, and the graphics are good enough albeit nothing special. The difficulty is a bit high at times, especially if you want to get the Optional Objectives. Once you've unlocked the Strike Suit, the gameplay changes DRAMMATICALLY. It feels so empowering, so great to be liberated from the normal movement of a spaceship.\n\nThe soundtrack is also pretty good, especially when it includes vocal track by KOKIA (one of my most favorite Japanese singers).  You can get the Strike Suit Zero Mega Bundle cheap these days, so I recommend you buy the bundle altogether.

It appears you are just a pilot that is participating in a war and you act on mission objectives given, there is nothing more than that.\n\nGameplay\nYou control an array of planes depending on the given mission and you shoot down enemy units in a dog fight. You have 2 sets of weapons: The main gun and missiles. The main gun does consistent damage on the enemy while missiles does large amount of damage but needs time for them to reach their target. There are additional variations of weapons for the 2 main set of weapons. In my opinion, the weapon balance seems okay as every weapon has its pros and cons.\n\nThe controls are easy to learn but hard to master, easy in the sense where you can get used to the controls fast but difficult to completely avoid evenmy fire through evasive manuvures.\n\nThis game is playable with a mouse and keyboard.However, there is one major annoyance over the control is the fact that the mouse sensitivity of every machine you use is different, so everytime when i am required to use another plane in a new mission, the first thing i had to do is to go to the settings and adjust them. What should have been done was either to make sure that mouse sensitivity is consistent in every unit or make seperate options for each units.\n\nExperience\nEngaging in an epic fight in space was an awesome experience especially in the first 3 missions. In fact those were the best times i had in my entire playthorugh. I loved the shooting projectiles of the main gun, i loved the cluster missile movement and i loved how enemy interceptors get shot down.\n\nSwitching into strike mode is also amazing because they deal a ton of damage and the firing of rockets at multiple targets is very satisfying. The best part is that you can instantly dodge missiles and projectiles by just double tapping to do a short dash.\n\nWhile i loved the experience of shooting down enemies, i really hated the mission layouts to the core. After enjoying sweet dog fighting in the first 3 missions, the rest of the game was essentially a speed run and I hate them in general. You have to complete your mission within a time limit before your capital ship explodes and you fail your mission. More than half of the play time clocked were spent retrying the mission only to fail again. I don't mind failing a mission because I got shot down, but failling a mission over something that you have little or no control over really pisses me off.\n\nAnother thing that I am extremely upset about is that the target system in this game is inflexible. They only target on the objective and completely ignores all other targets. This completely defeats the purpose of having ' target nearest enemy'   button when it continues to target a carrrier miles away when I was flying right beside enemy torpedoes. Due to that, an attempt to even delay the destruction of the capital ship was impossible.\n\nA game that was initially enjoyable suddenly became stressful and irritating to play to the point that I took months break twice from the game.\n\nFinal Words\nTo me, the game experience is mixed, while I loved one thing, I hated other things even more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pandandroid/recommended/209540/","pandandroid","pkpanda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pandandroid/","217 products in account","Strike Suit Zero (SSZ) is a frustatingly beautiful game; the personification of a game with excellent gameplay marred by horrible enemy variation and an outlandish story. You are a pilot of a fleet taking off to exterminate an alien threat. The game's namesake ship however isn't even obtainable until the third mission - and even then you are charged with taking other ships such as the interceptor (a variation on the starting ship) and a bomber (which was actually pretty cool to operate). The aspect of the game that makes it most difficult is the combat: I want frentic warfare - not a jumbled mess. The dogfights are engaging if only for a moment; taking down capitol ships is an exercise in bullet/missle-sponges; and using the strike suit is like drunkingly blasting ships. Plus it leaves you more vulnerable to attacks - which makes no sense because you have to garner flux to use it and equipping (transforming) the suit should make you more of a bad ♥♥♥. Instead it makes you a sitting duck that relies on wobbly shooting (granted, lock-on firing is available). The story actually has a good conclusion but everything before it is wonky. At some random point there is a grand coupe de tat that is massively overlooked because you are too busy trying to master the controls to even pay attention to the dialogue.\n\nThe game's greatest weakness is that it doesn't flaunt the suit! Let me free fly with this piece of machinery. Make it more controllable. Make it worth garnering flux! Sadly, the game falls flat for me, and beating it was a months-long mission whose only vincidation of knocking off one more game off my protruberent Steam library.","July 12, 2014","false","9.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Since I play most of my games using the latter, I don't know why I initially tried to shoehorn the game controls to the former.  The only thing I rebinded were plasma shot/missle selection and single/double shot toggle to the scroll wheel and mouse button 3 respectively.  Then I lowered the sensitivity of strike suit mode to match that of the ship.  After that the gameplay opened up and I must say that it is now smooth like butter.  Nothing is more satisfying than whizzing around a capital ship in strike suit mode and stripping away all of its turrets leaving it as a defenseless husk ready to be taken down.  Anyways, the story is not anything worth writing home about, but it serves its purpose in moving the game along.  The backdrops are beautiful and the gameplay works for me after tweaking some of the lackluster default bindings.","December 6, 2013","true","14.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/R7X3/recommended/209540/","R7X3","R7 Adamant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/R7X3/","396 products in account","So let me begin by saying: If you enjoyed the space combat in "Freelancer" you'll probably slide right into this without a hitch.\n\nI did enjoy freelancer a lot, but the combat wasn't the only thing in the game. So that's where the similarities end. Strike Suit Zero is entirely combat missions. That's it.\n\nShoot the baddies in space, fulfill the requirements and get an upgrade to your ship's stats (which really don't seem that noticable, max ranked shields feel about as sturdy as rank 1) and as you check off missions in the list you will get new weapons.\n\nThere really isn't any customization, and upgrades aren't that big a deal. Some "upgrades" come with a cost, such as using up more energy for a better gun... but you can't really upgrade your energy -on demand- so you're going to choke after firing 5 or six shots.\n\nYou have about four ships to choose from barring the purchase of any DLC (Strike suit- is butts outside of strike mode, Fighter- basic ship, more boolets/missiles than strike suit's basic mode, Interceptor - a little mosquito, Bomber - infinite slow as dirt torpedos, fires ping pong balls for bullets, decent amt of missiles)\n\nThe eponymous "Strike Suit" only becomes available after three missions of flying a basic little fighter craft around, and comes with it's own kind of annoying mechanic: a "Flux energy" bar, which is powered up by blowing crap up, You can then expend this flux energy to go into Strike mode: a robot suit, instead of pursuit mode which is your base crappy ship which has less armaments than the starter fighter ship. Strike mode lets you actually start killing things and operates like a dream.\n\nReally they should give you some kind of option to play with an infinite flux bar, because the strike suit is basically where all the fun lives. You can instantly track targets with a press of a button, you fire cool dancing missiles that wreck enemies, and you can -STOP MOVING- which is probably the MOST IMPORTANT PART OF STRIKE MODE. If i could put my ship engines on full stop the way strike mode can hold position, I WOULD.\n\nStrafing runs are crap, but all the ships except the strike-moded, flux using strikesuit, are forced to do strafing runs and it is garbage. In Freelancer you could -gasp- STOP YOUR SHIP and sit there FIRING AT THINGS. It even comes with it's own built in downside so you don't need to balance it with "stop fuel" or something ridiculous, because YES you're a sitting duck BUT you can focus fire those annoying stationary battlecruiser turrets and such.\n\nThere are a LOT of stationary targets you're expected to either burn all your flux energy on or do a zillion strafing runs at.\n\nGraphically it FEELS like everything is at 1/2 scale. Like I'm playing with minatures or something. enemy ship models could stand to be increased in size by about 1.5x to 2x.\n\nReally if there was a way to use points from missions to upgrade my ships further (add more guns to the underpowered pursuit mode of the strike suit) a button to mash for -FULL STOP- on any ship so you could sit and fire like a turret at a stationary target, and a few more weapon options (energy missiles, some kind of missile without ammo aside from flux) this might just scratch all my space ship itches.\n\nIs the tagline "Space combat reborn" accurate? No, it's freelancer style space combat without some of the key moves (cut engines & drift, stop) and without any real customization (you get a energy gun, a machine gun, and pick a missile type.)\n\nAs it stands, Strike suit zero isn't a bad game for what it is: a short space combat mission-y romp.\nIs it worth the current asking price of 20 bucks? Ehhh... Get it on sale/bundled or something, there's not that many missions.","January 22, 2014","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

There are moments when piloting elegantly and unleashing the variety of weapons in your arsenal becomes extremely difficult - and this is completely forgetting about the ability to rapid transform into a flying combat mech that can wipe out entire fleets with missile barrages and cannon fire while dodging incoming missiles.\n\nCons of the game?

On top of the absolutely useless targeting system, the redundant (and pointless) HUD elements and lack of control customization, controlling this thing is just an absolute mess.\n\nYes, they finally patched-in the ability to re-map the controls but not all of them. Dodge is still hard-bound to "double-tap a movement key." So when I have all my movement bound to proper control axes, dodge is physically impossible. I can't "double-tap" my flightstick to the left. Also: the Strike Suit can't roll.\n\nBottom line: consolized beyond playability. Not a PC game. Absolutely do not buy.

It has pretty backdrops, some fun and exciting music, and the promise of a robotic mech spaceship to annihilate enemies. But the gameplay is so frustrating that playing it is a chore, and a frustrating one at that.\n\nThe basics combat system is good enough. It's fairly easy to get the hang of picking off enemies and sending missiles in every direction. In fact, Strike Suit Zero feels the best when it has you fighting against dozens of enemy fighters, honing in on enemies to build up to the moment where you can transform and unleash hell. But that's a small part of the game. At least 50% of the game is attacking larger stationary ships, taking out cargo, or blowing up turrets, all of which is so boring or frustrating that it brings down the little bit of fun the dogfights provide.\n\nTo make matters worse, there is a constant barrage of turrets, cannons, and other non-evadable damage that not only steadily drains health but keeps the screen in a disorienting panic that's less exhilirating than it is confusing. Many missions, especially the incredibly tedious ones that involve picking off every turret from a large cruiser, turned into me going for an attack, then flying aimlessly while my shield recharged before trying again. Rinse lather repeat.\n\nIf you're looking for your fill of space dogfighting, I don't think Strike Suit Zero is your best bet. There are many older games, and even some very recent ones that are starting to fill that hole better. If you're dedicated to playing every space game out there, you'll probably have fun with it, but otherwise I'd sit this one out.","January 3","false","4.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It is like Freelancer except that you can't go wherever you want, and you can't take the missions you want. I was looking forward to using the strike suit, but that is also disappointing. In strike suit mode all you get is more damage to your normal guns, missile spamming abilities, auto-aim (if you want it), and the ability to dodge incoming attacks. Dodging in strike suit mode actually seems less effective against missiles than using the deflect ability in normal flight mode :(.  Strike suit mode also runs out very quickly when you try to use a lot of missiles, and then you are just back to normal flight mode. Most of the levels are just fighting waves of enemies and blowing up large carrier space ships, which gets old fast.

Little thought was put into what makes a game fun rather than frustrating. You will most likely spend half of the game trying to accommodate its awkward control layout and the other half regenerating your shields.\n\nThe controls aren't at all natural. It will take a few levels until you learn to adjust to the clumsiness of it all. Once you do you'll immediately be hit with a completely different control scheme as the "Strike Suit" mechanic comes into play, turning your space ship into a powerful mech warrior. The transition between control schemes is jarring and hard to get used to, I'm not sure I'll ever really be comfortable with the switch.\n\nThere will be times when the enemy A.I. will play dirty and seemingly cheat. They are incredibly accurate and agile, with the ability to stay directly out of your line of sight no matter how fast you turn. They can manage to fire directly at you at a 90 degree angle from hundreds of metres away and hit every shot. They will also often fly in groups, sometimes four or five abreast, in order to take you down. Meanwhile your team mates are miles away fighting their own one-on-one battles.\n\nWhen the time comes that a mission requires you to carry an extremely valuable payload with a disadvantaged vehicle, you will often have to "lone wolf" the entire mission. On the other hand, when you're in a capable enough vehicle, you're often tasked with protecting similar ships in similar circumstances. For some reason when it's your turn there is no one around to help which is incredibly unfair as you're left to pick off the enemy one by one with a less than capable ship when it shouldn't have to be your job.","May 14, 2014","false","5.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I got fed up right after the initial training segment.\n\nI tried using an Xbox 360 controller as well as keyboard and mouse and, even with customizations, I couldn't get comfortable. The problem is that the left\right movement doesn't behave like you'd expect. You would expect the you'd go left when pressing left and right when pressing right, but your ship goes into more of a barrel role which leaves you upside down and completely disoriented. I know this is in outer space so it won't control like, say, StarFox, but I have to believe there was a better way to do these controls than this.\n\nIf you are willing to suffer through this, or somehow manage to get comfortable with the controls, then I'm sure you could have fun.

Graphics, gameplay and the controls in particular. The space combat can be fun however it can get a little tedious and frustrating (for me in particular, being an angry gamer) at times.. All these problems all just combine for an average space combat sim in my opinion. Also the game itself honestly is not good enough to be compared to other games of its genre specifically in ways of visual appeal/graphics, after all isn't space meant to be a "beautiful enigma"?.. e.g Star Conflict is free to play (although some things must be payed for) however the controls and visuals are far superior than SSZ and for me (Star Conflict) "destroys" SSZ in the field of which SSZ professes to be the best at: Combat.. Strike Suit Zero has a good story and can be entertaining at points however those are the only positives I can state about this game.. If you are to get this game.. get it on sale..\n\nP.S: This is my opinion don't rage at me if I don't have the same viewpoint as you.","December 15, 2013","false","2.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Whoever did the game balance doesn't know what they're doing. Maybe they used to make board games? I'm not sure. But the regular ship takes forever to build up one volley of shots. This means taking out 20 fighters (a common objective in the first 3 missions) can take about 20 minutes. Why would they do that? Restrictions are fun! Let's restrict everything!\n\nLike the Strike Suit. You'd think, "okay, cool robot form that's even in the game title: Of course you should be able to change that whenever you like, right?" Wrong. You have to destroy debris and enemy fighters to 'power it'. How does that even make sense? Shooting in the Strike Suit turns into Motion Blurr City, which is extremely laggy. There's also no lead targets in Strike Suit mode, so good luck hitting anything with primary fire. The suit itself seems terribly underwhelming. Its best attack when you first get it is a volley of missiles. Not very exiting, and doesn't make you feel powerful.\n\nThe game was advertised when it came out as if this was a successor to the Zone of the Enders series. No. Its just a cheap powerup gimmick in a space sim with a standard engine (think Star Wars: Star Fighter on the PS2, but not as easy to control or as intuitive). The balance is abismal. The story seems interesting, but every time you think a level is going to end you get "wait, we've got 50 more fighters inbound" and it just makes me sigh. I gave up after 10 minutes of the Strike Suit being seeming utterly useless and unable to kill even one turret on an enemy frigate.\n\nMaybe I'll come back to it one day and find out something I missed, but man does this game make me want to cry. Look at my name. How disappointed do you think I am?","January 15, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

From all the space shooters I have played this one is the worst. The game looks pretty, has great music, and seems to have a decent story, but the controls and everything in between are terrible. With a controller the flying is on the right thumbstick, Not sure who thought that was a great idea but let that set the stage for the rest of the crap playability. The dialog is so low its practically muted, meaning you need to crawl through setting until you adjust the audio to where you can hear it.  This game is a classic case of how developers build a world but are clueless about making it enjoyable for players, from the audio, to controls, to the junk ship you ship, this game is a waste of space.\n\nGameplay fatal flaws:\nAlso being a 3D shooter, there is no distance to target over the lockon icon for the enemy you are tracking, and their so small but the icon stays the same size its impossible to tell when their right on top of you.  There is a distance thing with a picture in the lower left but I cant look at that while chasing these  mosquito enemies.\n\nThe enemies suffer from the syndrome of them flying all over like their hopped on drugs with no pattern or logic to what their doing.  Its like those sniper games where for no reason enemies run back and forth in place while sniping you from across the map with their guns while you with a sniper rifle are helpess.\n\nYour ship is soooOOooo slow until you beat the mission and unlock the other ships.  HEY DEVS! how about just making it fun to begin with?  Picture a Volkswagen bug chasing a Ferrari and you get this game. This is a game where there are other ships but you cant access them until you beat a map, which means playing the crap way then later hey you can have fun, no thanks, your game sucks.\n\nThe nail in the coffin for me was the shooting mechanics, to fire a missle its right bumper meaning you must stop firing your machine guns to fire a missle.  What modern plane would be designed so terribly that only one weapon works at a time, this is the future right, I mean their in space.\n\nRating: 0/10 Value: $0.00","July 18, 2013","false","2.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

It's pretty cool in concept, but the execution was shaky. I've had to rewrite my review multiple times because I'm not sure how to feel about this game.\n\n-random difficulty spikes to the point where the game is just cluttered with unnecessary bullets and explosions (and they don't pull off the "crowded battle scene" that often, but when they do, it's pretty cool)\n-controls are awkward, but thankfully are rebindable\n-the strike suit, which is the draw of the whole game, is a gimmick that only lasts 10 seconds, and has a pretty poor targeting system, which means you'll be darting about not hitting anything, though once you unlock a few upgrades, it becomes decent\n-might just be my computer, but I experienced insane slowdown even on the lowest graphics settings. I won't consider this a point against the game, because I've had slowdown issues before\n-battles are luck based, depending on if you hit the tiny area that you're supposed to, when fighting a bigger ship. Apparently you need to hit weakspots which may or may not be marked for your convenience, but shooting the turrets does some damage. Targeting system is also broken, as in you normally have the option to aim towards the closest enemy, or a mission objective enemy. Thing is, you can't just target them. You have to cycle your targets until you hopefully get the one you want, like the cruisers and carriers. It's a gambit, so you take what you get.\n-game is 90% escort missions, and your friendlies are thin as paper,\n-last mission is a pain in the port, and I won't even spoil it.\n\nIf you have to try this, get it on sale. I'm talking less than 5 bucks. I still recommend it against my previous criticisms because it tried to be a cool mech game and gave us something to remember, and I was thoroughly challenged. After all, it's better to deal with a challenging game than one that holds your hand the whole way. As long as you get it on sale, you won't regret it, because the game does deliver to an extent. Had I paid full price, however, I wouldn't be as forgiving. Especially once I got that darn last level. If you play through this game, and/or you already played through it, you'll know exactly what I mean.","December 29, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This whole game comes together and it’s simply a great work of art. Dog fights, strike mode, blasting capital ships, and getting high scores. Doing this and having a blast is what it’s all about. This fills the void of my desire for Ace Combat for PCs (I’m talking about a good Ace Combat mind you).\n\nStrike Suit Zero is entirely a campaign. The story itself isn’t stellar, but makes the combat feel real and each mission has some weight to it. There’s a great sense of an epic fight when you’re in the midst of a fight between capital class ships and hoards of fighters. As a player you aren’t some overpowered-one-ship-destroy-everything-and-do-anything since you have to rely on your allies to help fill the void in your weaknesses. On the flip side you can greatly assist your allies by targeting specific objectives and hitting the enemy where it really hurts. Probably a great example is if your capital ship is in danger from enemy beam cannons you can snipe out the beam cannons on the enemy capital ships. Another good one is sniping out AA turrets on capital ships so your bombers can take them out quickly and safely. The campaign does a nice job of mixing up what you need to do so it’s never a stale series of mission.","June 20, 2013","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty cool in concept, but the execution was shaky. I've had to rewrite my review multiple times because I'm not sure how to feel about this game.\n\n-random difficulty spikes to the point where the game is just cluttered with unnecessary bullets and explosions (and they don't pull off the "crowded battle scene" that often, but when they do, it's pretty cool)\n-controls are awkward, but thankfully are rebindable\n-the strike suit, which is the draw of the whole game, is a gimmick that only lasts 10 seconds, and has a pretty poor targeting system, which means you'll be darting about not hitting anything, though once you unlock a few upgrades, it becomes decent\n-might just be my computer, but I experienced insane slowdown even on the lowest graphics settings. I won't consider this a point against the game, because I've had slowdown issues before\n-battles are luck based, depending on if you hit the tiny area that you're supposed to, when fighting a bigger ship. Apparently you need to hit weakspots which may or may not be marked for your convenience, but shooting the turrets does some damage. Targeting system is also broken, as in you normally have the option to aim towards the closest enemy, or a mission objective enemy. Thing is, you can't just target them. You have to cycle your targets until you hopefully get the one you want, like the cruisers and carriers. It's a gambit, so you take what you get.\n-game is 90% escort missions, and your friendlies are thin as paper,\n-last mission is a pain in the port, and I won't even spoil it.\n\nIf you have to try this, get it on sale. I'm talking less than 5 bucks. I still recommend it against my previous criticisms because it tried to be a cool mech game and gave us something to remember, and I was thoroughly challenged. After all, it's better to deal with a challenging game than one that holds your hand the whole way. As long as you get it on sale, you won't regret it, because the game does deliver to an extent. Had I paid full price, however, I wouldn't be as forgiving. Especially once I got that darn last level. If you play through this game, and/or you already played through it, you'll know exactly what I mean.","December 29, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's offers a level of immersion that other space opera games lack. This is a heavy action-oriented game and the story is not merely a vehicle.  Controls are not complex and only several keys are required and the game doesn't dump a rediculous ammount on you, forcing you to stretch your hand all accross your keyboard. The plot is not pointless too. It will fool you into thinking it's a total linear story line. So SPOILER ALERT: at the very end you have a choice.\n\nCombat is very satisfying. Ships are graceful, fair, and not clunky to handle. Controls are simple, easy to operate, and convenient. The story surprised me as stated above.\n\nIf you like mecha games such as armored core, military themed areial combat, space opera, then you will love this game and it's sequel Strike Suit Infinity.","May 30, 2013","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed switching targets and managing the priority of threats as they came up, as well as ensuring I was using the right weapons at the right times... it was a lot to think about whilst in the midst of a space war.. and I must admit it was really engaging. Got me very much in the mood for Freelancer, another game I have never finished, which has similar controls... ableit isn't involving huge capital ships blasting away at one another in an overarching space conflict like SSZ. The graphics and sound are perfect and it's a well put together game.\n\nI can't credit it with originality though, the music seemed to be from Homeworld, the way the capital ships duked it out with huge laser beams streaking between them.. really felt like Freespace, the controls seemed to be taken from Freelancer like I've said, the unflappable naval officers seem to be ripped out of Nexus - The jupiter incident and the narrative.... inspired by them all I'd say.\n\nStill! A good game and enjoyable, if they do a sequel I'd certainly keep an eye on it and pick it up at the right price.\n\nThe Heroes of the Fleet is an enjoyable DLC revolving around simulations of key battles, mainly one's that were historically defeats for the Earth forces you pilot for, all of which took place within the main story line however the protagonist wasn't part of them. . I liked the narrative twist and enjoyed the fact they'd even *put* a thread of story throughout 6 stand alone DLC missions. I think that's commendable.\n\nThese level's are hard and I found my self on the edge of my seat during the last level in particular, fun times.","November 18, 2013","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/209540/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A dogfight space-sim. As pretty alright as the soundtrack is and as pretty as it looks it's not a very big game, the story's not exactly the most engaging out there, and there are only 13 pretty-short missions to go through. The mission objectives themselves are all generally the same protect-this & destroy-these missions so it can be repetitious.\n\nWhen it comes to the base gameplay they work and control great. The combat can get pretty intense the more enemies you're up against especially when suddenly your targets are large fleets themselves with guns covering practically every surface its got and the sudden priority is to take out the things that fire back.\n\nSurviving involves you keeping your ship's armor (health) and regenerating shield up and as far as I know there's no way of repairing your ship's armor without reloading a checkpoint or getting it repaired when told in one particular mission. The reload-checkpoint-to-recover-everything deal looked to me like an exploitable mechanic of sorts even though there aren't very many checkpoints throughout the game, especially the later missions with their longer mission times and limited amount of checkpoints.\n\nEach mission has an optional objective you can do that will unlock an upgrade but each one are just shared stat upgrades for all of the ships you have. What you're to do and what you can unlock are shown in the mission select screen upon preparing for the mission chosen. New ships and weapons are unlocked through progress of the missions.\n\nAfter a few missions you'll eventually unlock the "Strike Suit" ship which basically transforms into a straight-up mech (Strike Mode) if the "Flux" bar it comes with is filled enough through received or given damage. It's able to move more relatively freely in the three dimensions its got, has a very capable auto-locking targeting system on chosen targets within distance, and can target & lock-on to large numbers of targets for use of the barrage of the seeking missiles it can fire. The Flux bar starts to drain upon use of Strike Mode's firing capabilities but if used efficiently the Flux bar can prolong its usage without transforming back to ship mode.\nKind of surprisingly the Strike Suit you use is the only mech in the game. No ally or enemy has anything similar although the mech may as well just be a temporary ship with a few more capabilities.\n\nThere's not a whole lot else to this game outside of the well-done space-dogfighting.","November 23, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a space shooter through and through.  There is face paced action and great jet/"mech" form combat.  The premise of the story is pretty basic but the graphics are nice and crisp.  There is a decent difficulty curve to the game at first and you can adjust it.  There's also the ability to upgrade your ships by means of completing challenges in each level.  This kind of adds a certain difficulty as well because you have to pay attention to what you're doing.  The player also has to select their loadout at the start of each level and based on what they will be facing, you have to be calculative as to what is ultimately chosen.  I got through the game at a decent pace around 10-12 hours with 13 missions total, which is pretty good for a game in this genre.  There's also a scoring system in the game which attributes to the player getting service medals.  The higher the performance in the level, the better the medal awarded.  If you can pick this game up around 10-15 bucks, it's a pretty good deal.  I don't think everyone should pay the 20 it is at now for regular price because there are many other games better suited for that change, if you're going to cough it up, and not everyone appreciates this niche of gaming.","May 28, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it does not end there, there is full support for any type of control method (Mouse+Keyboard, Gamepad, Joystick+Keyboard, HOTAS) and the button mapping is really intuitive (just be sure to select Joystick+Keyboard when playing with a HOTAS). However, when it comes to controlling ships, there's not much to choose from. Being a recruit you'll start with a standard fighter then shortly after you'll unlock the Strike Suit and further down some other 2 ships bringing it to a total of four ships to choose from, which is not much. But the game being named Strike Suit Zero, you already guessed what the main ship will be. It's main feature is that is can transform into a Transformer like mech and fire lock on missiles and heavy caliber both using Flux as energy, this Flux can be regenerated over time and be destroying enemy targets. So yeah, it's pretty badass. But the game does not let you be badass for long as the didfficulty of missions ramp up very quickly and the ally AI is utterly useless, forcing you to always be at your best to triumph. The old school difficulty also applies to the ranking system, if you do as you are told you might get a medal, but if you do everyones job you'll earn silver or gold. Keep in mind that there is Platinum above and since you've already won the battle to yourself there is not much left to do!\n\nAnyway, besides its frustrating difficulty Strike Suit Zero is a fantastic experience and a worthy one if you want to prepare for StarCitizen later this year (press time). With it's challenging but rewarding gameplay, this is a game that I recommend.","February 21, 2014","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Remember when IGN gave Godhand a 3 when everyone else gave it a 7 or 8? It's kinda like that. I'm not gonna spend too much time on this, but the reviewers that gave it a low score did so because they are inept at playing anything harder than Mario. ''It's too hard'' was the MAIN complaint, and it's pathetic because it's not.\n\nAnyway, think Star Fox 64's 'all-range mode', but with a lot more enemies. You get 13 missions with an unfolding plot, and upgrades along the way that are unlocked by completing optional objectives that present some difficulty, but hardly the difficulty the ♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ reviewers say it posseses. You're given objectives in the middle of the mission, but it boils down to killing ♥♥♥♥ and blowing up big ships. Each mission varies up the scenario to avoid repetetiveness: protecting a fleet, taking out a ship in particular (or protecting it), taking out incoming torpedos, loss of missile systems.\n\nJust a tip: press the camera button (default is 'C') to go into first person. You have to do this for both your fighter and the Strike Suit, otherwise you're in first person in fighter mode and third person in Strike mode. It makes the fighting a lot more intense and increases that sense of inertia.\n\nIncredibly fun; highly recommended; intense dogfighting on dogfighting action; buy it now.","October 4, 2013","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game just isn't well designed, and mission 12 fully expressed that to me.  The weapons you get are limited in selection throughout the level.  The objectives and things you do rarely change and deviate from a formula they repeat every other level or 2.  It's basically defend X, attack X, or attack turrets on X to then get to attack X afterwards.\n\nWorse yet is on larger vehicles you're supposed to destroy you get little in terms of visual or auditory feedback that you're actually doing decent damage yourself, or if it's just your friendly ally ships.  When the objectives change, the game will do a poor job explaining what you actualy need to do, and point out targets that don't remotely matter to actually finishing it.\n\nThe game just does nothing remarkeable outside your strike suite can lock on, and let you paint multiple targets to fire a large missile barrage.  Fun for the first few times, but quickly becomes a tedious activity, as you'll use it a bunch to ween down health on ships with inflated HP.","February 16, 2014","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Came into it relatively blindly. Had just done a revisit of some of my older favorites from the Wing Commander series, and was looking to jump into something similar that made use of newer technology, and SSZ happened to be on sale on Steam that day, so I made the purchase without really knowing what I was getting into. Infinitely happy that I did. The controls take a little getting used to, but the game eases you into them by giving you what's essentially a tutorial mission, followed by a few missions that are pretty light on difficulty and present you with basic forms of each fighting scenario, for example squadrons of fighters you have to take down, a capital ship you have to protect, etc. Once you get used to the key placements it's all pretty straightforward in that regard. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular both in their smoothness running and in presentation. I'm playing on a fairly decent, but not cutting edge machine, and I've experienced very few framerate issues, really only dropping slightly when so much is happening on screen that it's more than my brain can process all at once either. The sound and music are just as good, really fitting the atmosphere of the game, helping to enhance the feeling that you're taking part in massive epic space battles. There's also a good amount of replay value added in the form of mission medals and stat upgrade unlocks, that I know have me revisiting mission after mission to try for higher scores and get the unlocks/medals that I want. The only thing even remotely negative that I can say about the game is that it's pretty light on plot. The majority of the plot is communicated through text that you get both in mission briefings and post-mission reports, along with some cutscenes that take place during missions, but at times it's developed so little that I found myself scratching my head when something big happened, feeling like I didn't really know what was going on at all. But at the same time it's really not the emphasis of the game. The fast-paced large scale beautifully rendered space battles in amazingly atmospheric settings is. So basically if you're looking for something really plot heavy, this may not be the game for you, but if you're looking for a straight up space battle simulator and can live without having much of a plot to go along with it then you won't regret the purchase.","February 3, 2014","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Indeed, SSZ seems to borrow many elements from Tachyon, including most of the mechanics, feel, and weapons.  The graphics in the game are a bit underwhelming, looking more like a game from the late 00s, rather than the 2010s.  Still, for an independent title that was funded through Kickstarter, SSZ is definitely worth your time.  The main draw of the game--the mech transformation--is actually the least fun, in my opinion.  I greatly prefer the starfighter mode to the mech mode.  But, if you are looking for a no-frills space shooter that calls to mind the golden age of the genre, then this game is certainly worth that money, especially if you can get it on sale.","December 14, 2013","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Looks beautiful when in the game, but to get there, I had to set my main monitor to the Oculus Rift resolution of 1280x800 to play with the Rift.  Otherwise you end up with a small window in the upper right corner that does no good for Rift viewing.  Once in the game the menus are readable, but only if you keep your head very, very still.  Then when you think you have everything figured out, you try to tweak the little options in your menus, but ....can't figure out what controls to use in menus, can't use joystick apparently, so you're stuck taking off  the rift to try and see the keyboard, but standard keys do not work.  Had to escape out by doing a ctrl, alt, del because nothing else would let me.  I ran just the game without steam, but cannot use your Rift if you do that.  So I just went in to change all my controls to something I know, and now I'm going to try all of this again.  The main problem is probably my choice of controller, which is a Saitek X52, and when a menu pops up that says "hit button 30 to continue" I have no idea which one they are talking about.  I tried them all but nothing got me past the menu, so we'll just see what happens next.  This game has soured my mood and I"m just about done with it.**  Edit**  After a much needed break, I returned to the game and got things configured to my liking.  The little issues are still there, like having to set my main monitor to 1280x800 but that is do-able for right now.  The game is very nice looking and responds well with the Rift and my joystick.  I changed my recomendation to YES, because its a good game to add to your library if you own an Oculus Rift.","December 13, 2013","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now imagine that all of that comes together in an orgy of frenetic 3d-space combat, beautiful, vibrant graphics, a challenging AI, a good selection of ships/mecha and weapons and a soundtrack reminiscent of the musical stylings of Talvin Singh.\n\nBottom Line : If you love your twitch gaming, but also want an atmospheric, challenging, not to mention stunning, 3d space shooter with an engaging story and an AI that'll keep you on your toes, then look no further.

It is perhaps the best game I've played which integrates the mechanics of transforming a plane into a humanoid mecha in sace.\n\nIn its completed state I would say that it is more like a proof of concept than a full game. The game is quite short, with only 13 missions, and no multiplayer.\n\nThe difficulty curve of the game increases rapidly, but this is due to difficulties with completing the objectives/targeting the correct enemy. Yes, targeting is quite a nightmare, early in the game when there are fewer enemies, SSZ's targetting system works flawlessly. However as you progress later in the game where enemies swarm down on your fleet, it becomes an uphill battle to find the crucial enemy targets and hunt them down before they destroy your capital ships.\n\nHowever, when everything works smoothly and you seamlessly integrate pursuit (plane) mode with strike (mecha) mode to hunt down targets, you will feel like a complete badd ♥♥♥ ace out of Macross.\n\nTLDR/\nIf you're dying to fulfill your fantisies of being a valkyrie pilot from Macross try SSZ then go ahead and buy the game, I look forward to Born Ready Games continuining with this IP to make more and more awesome games. They need to work on the targetting system and multiplayer!","January 17, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only played the first few missions, so maybe it gets better, but what I played was slow and dull. The controls are at best confusing and at worst vomit inducing (weird use of the left analog stick). The only objectives you ever seem to get are "shoot the guys" and "protect the big thing from the other things." They seriously ran out of ideas two missions into the game.

I am a fan of mech anime and an even greater fan of Star Wars, so this game was everything that I could have ever hoped for. Gameplay-wise, the controls are smooth to the point where you wouldn't even know that this is an indie game. The missions are a pretty decent length, with action over at every moment. I can't say that I really feel for the characters, but that wasn't what I bought the game for. If you are hoping for story, do not come any further, However, if you are hoping for action packed, literally explosive awesomeness, come much further! The battles in this game are spectacular. Instead of just shoting the capital ships in any random spot, the game urges you to go for many of the weak points and weapons that bristle of each of them. As for graphics, this may not be The Last of Us, but the graphics are good enough to make for a beautiful game at every moment. The backgrounds are spectacular and gorgeous, with vibrant shades of colors, the best probably being the shades of purple and blue. When it comes to the soundtrack, Paul Ruskay and Kokia di an amazing job, with the ambiance of the game enhanced tenfold by the fastpaced songs. This game is definately worth the price, as well as the counterpart, Strike Suit Infinity.\n\nI have not bought a PC gaming controller, so I have no idea what the difference in playability between the two formats are.","January 4, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Heard some people mention that they found it boring after a while, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  The game itself is stunning both in the visual and audio department.  The movement and reactions are all very fluid, the enviorements look awesome, and the visuals are just very satisfying in general.  Having your vision whited out from fighter explosions is always a cool effect.  The soundtrack sounds professionally done, the main song features KOKIA who has done vocals for other video games and anime series.  Sound effects are also very well done, and make destroying things in your transforming machine of death all that much more fun.\nThe story wasn't exactly anything special, but it sufficed.  I'd say that was one of its few lacking points.  It ran on max settings perfectly fine except for one point in the story where there were literally things exploding EVERYWHERE, and it started to get bogged down, otherwise it was fine.\nVery happy I picked up this game, would be awesome to see a more developed sequel come out eventually, as it would be a shame for such a great concept platform stop here.\n\nEdit: Just figured I'd mention it took me about 10 hours to finish.  Not sure if any of that was the game sitting open during breaks, but I'd say at least 8.5 of those hours were in game blowing ♥♥♥♥ up.

To put it simple, It's exacly as GUNDAM SEED, just made into a game. You will notice that the captaplut is the same design :P\n\nThe missions are a bit light on text content but all is voiced. Although I believe by mission 5 you will be skipping most of them. The plot is also weak, which makes me think they did not put much time into the writing, which for this game, i'm completly fine with.\n\nAs for the combat, it certainly needs polished. The fight can be caotic and if you are not familiar with your mouse sensativity you will find free aim completly unplayable. The lock on ability also needs more polished when in Striker mode, mostly tied to the free aim feature. Be aware that using the guns(rifle or energy) i did not find any trouble with it.\nAs for striker mode and persuit mode, it feels swift, DIFFERENT(really important) and balance. On Striker Mode(humanoid, GUNDAM FUN) you feel overpowered like you should, you can simple auto target everyone with Shift and gun them, dodge enemy fire, etc. But the limit you have with it, making that fun end a little bit early ends up balancing it and making hardcore a really challenging difficulty (Although i would like more of that mode). Notice that the multiple lock on feature is very bad, u need free aim and won't detect enemies that are there. It fail completly compared to something like Zone of the Ender, so much that you wouldn't use it at all almost. As for persuit mode, It feels different, both on the weapons you use(you have more range of weapons in this mode) and the fact that you can thrust away from situations that might turn way too bad.  Here i didn't had much to complain, it feels like a fighter should feel. The space bar is perfect to change mode btw.\n\nCombat is caotic and the camera doesn't help. Then again, i like that part because it feels real, and having both 3rd person and cokpit views is a plus. The targetting system needs a bit polish, but i find the weapon selection limited. All weapons so far feel different and choice does matter, both guns and missles. But Only 2 buttons to cycle through either guns or missiles isn't enough. I would like to bind my weapons to 1-5 or similar and change them that way.\n\nAs for the UI, I don't actually like it, but it does the job. I would change many things, but those that I feel that pass personal preference and became somewhat damaging to the player are the fact that your weapons are display through text. Each should have a little image, a machine gun and a rail gun, a Rocket and a Seeker missile, for exemple, that would allow quick recognition of the weapon selected. This doesn't affect guns too much(your aim changes acordingly) but the missile selection is harder than it needs to be.\n\nLastly, regarding the aim i would like to see priority targets more distiguish. The game targetting is somewhat good, but it 3D icons suffer from the same problem games like BF4 and others. Its hard to target exacly what u want quickly or while dealing with an interceptor or changing targets.\n\nTo Conclude, I found this game alot of fun. The gameplay is fast, challenging and each feature feels different. Although there are not that many types of targets(don't expect 5 types of inteceptors, 10 types of carriers, like in ZotE), the missions are sufficiently different and the form you tackle a interceptor squad, or a carrier or a full on base with carriers and squads, while protecting your bombers, feel very well made.

There have been many but VERY few manage to capture the scale, scope, and heart of those Mecha-Space Operas and as Space Sims died out over the past 10 years I gave up hope of seeing a great Space Opera game. Until I saw Strike Suit Zero during the Flash Sale.\n\nStrike Suit Zero isn't a TRUE space sim in the sense but the arcade style it promotes actually meshes well with the Gundam/Macross styles. Swarms of missiles flying everywhere, ships exploding, pilots screaming out death cries as their ships fall apart around them. The action is fast and intense and after babysitting you for ONE mission, SSZ kicks it into overdrive and then into crazy what the hell how do I beat this mode. HUGE thumbs up for SSZ.\n\nWhile I would love to see some version of Multiplayer emerge, the MOD tools are freely available for someone to attempt it, the single player is excellent and the story very thought out. The music sounded familiar to me as I played and as I did more research discovered it was composed by the same guy that did Homeworld. (A FANTASTIC Space Opera RTS in it's own right.)\n\nBUY THIS GAME!","December 26, 2013","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you love air combat sims, maybe you'll like this too.\n\n\nOh, and last question for developers.\nWhy didn't i have the Artbook? even though i have all the DLCs (i bought this game in humble bundle). the Artbook DLC was supposed to be... free?","February 26, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the main criticisms were with the control scheme and with the length of the game. Personally I got used to the controls quickly on keyboard and mouse, and if you have a controller they are supposedly better. They are also very customisable if you don't like the default system. As for the length, the game has a lot to offer for its price in my opinion, and at a reduced price you can't complain! Missions are a good length (though the checkpoint system can be rather punishing on harder missions) and it is an arcade style game in the sense that you get points for everything so replaying missions for platinum medals is encouraged.\n\nThe other main criticism was that it wasn't enough like some other space flight game that the reviewer liked. Personally I don't see how this is a valid criticism for a reviewer to make who is supposed to be reviewing this game and not one that is over ten years old. This is its own game, go watch some gameplay if you are undecided, don't presume it will be like x-wing because thats what you want it to be like, you may be dissapointed.\n\nIf you like bright flashy space combat and a game that rewards players that learn the mechanics and uses them instead of expecting it to be like that space game you played in 98 then pick it up!","October 20, 2013","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I really do. But I can't. While it is fun to play, there's a few poins that, in my opinion, reduce the fun significantly.\n\n+ Gameplay is fun (most of the time).\n+ Graphics and sounds are great.\n+ Mouse/Keyboard controls are responsive and intuitive.\n\n- Playing with controller is difficult. I have an XBox360 controller for windows. The left stick is for rolling the ship (pretty useless), the right stick is for gearing. I'd rather have it the other way round. Since you also shoot with the right hand, I play the entire game with the right hand. And there seems to be no way to change that. Thus I resorted to mouse and keyboard.\n- You get additional fighters during the game, and you get a "choose your ship" screen. However, even if you already have other fighters, you can't choose freely. Most of the time, you're stuck with the Strike Suit.\n- The Strike Suit is annoying. You play it in pursuit mode most of the time, meaning it's basically a mediocre fighter. The standard fighter you get in the beginning has more firepower. When you magically charged your Flux bar by killing enemy ships, you get a short moment of the Suit's "glory". The Suits cannons are useless and effective only against enemy fighters. When attacking a capital ship's turrets, it likes to target turrets that are on the other side of the ship (and thus can't be hit) or the ship itself (for which it has way too little firepower).\n- Attacking capital ships is hard, even in easy mode. You get barraged with plasma cannons, beam cannons and flak, which can tear you apart within seconds. Which is why I never made it past mission 8. The bloody carrier is too much for the flimsy Strike Suit. Especially since there are no other friendly fighters, this it focusses all of its attention at me.\n- I'm not exactly fond of vocals in background music.","March 2, 2014","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A complete lack of checkpoints throughout every mission I've played so far is also quite baffling and will lead to many ragequits.

However, if you're more of a single-player type person, this point need not apply to you.\n\nSecond reason: Does not offer a demo. At least what I could find.

First, it was my clumsy fault that I didn't notice that this game didn't support multiplayer. Some of you may remember playing a little Microsoft Studios game called Freelancer, which was an amazing spaceflight game. If you're looking for a game like that, this isn't it. I completed the first mission, and sadly to say I got kinda bored; too bored in fact to finish the second mission.\n\nOverall, the game and its graphics are nice.

First, it was my clumsy fault that I didn't notice that this game didn't support multiplayer. Some of you may remember playing a little Microsoft Studios game called Freelancer, which was an amazing spaceflight game. If you're looking for a game like that, this isn't it. I completed the first mission, and sadly to say I got kinda bored; too bored in fact to finish the second mission.\n\nOverall, the game and its graphics are nice. I wish I had a nicer graphics card to take advantage of the wonderful effects I could see in the trailers. However, the gameplay is very repetitive with little reward.","December 13, 2013","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Remember when IGN gave Godhand a 3 when everyone else gave it a 7 or 8? It's kinda like that. I'm not gonna spend too much time on this, but the reviewers that gave it a low score did so because they are inept at playing anything harder than Mario. ''It's too hard'' was the MAIN complaint, and it's pathetic because it's not.\n\nAnyway, think Star Fox 64's 'all-range mode', but with a lot more enemies. You get 13 missions with an unfolding plot, and upgrades along the way that are unlocked by completing optional objectives that present some difficulty, but hardly the difficulty the ♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ reviewers say it posseses. You're given objectives in the middle of the mission, but it boils down to killing ♥♥♥♥ and blowing up big ships. Each mission varies up the scenario to avoid repetetiveness: protecting a fleet, taking out a ship in particular (or protecting it), taking out incoming torpedos, loss of missile systems.\n\nJust a tip: press the camera button (default is 'C') to go into first person. You have to do this for both your fighter and the Strike Suit, otherwise you're in first person in fighter mode and third person in Strike mode. It makes the fighting a lot more intense and increases that sense of inertia.\n\nIncredibly fun; highly recommended; intense dogfighting on dogfighting action; buy it now.","October 4, 2013","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game just isn't well designed, and mission 12 fully expressed that to me.  The weapons you get are limited in selection throughout the level.  The objectives and things you do rarely change and deviate from a formula they repeat every other level or 2.  It's basically defend X, attack X, or attack turrets on X to then get to attack X afterwards.\n\nWorse yet is on larger vehicles you're supposed to destroy you get little in terms of visual or auditory feedback that you're actually doing decent damage yourself, or if it's just your friendly ally ships.  When the objectives change, the game will do a poor job explaining what you actualy need to do, and point out targets that don't remotely matter to actually finishing it.\n\nThe game just does nothing remarkeable outside your strike suite can lock on, and let you paint multiple targets to fire a large missile barrage.  Fun for the first few times, but quickly becomes a tedious activity, as you'll use it a bunch to ween down health on ships with inflated HP.","February 16, 2014","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has more stuff and it claims to have a "restructured campaign" which, theoretically, means no more terrible final mission. Get it instead.\n\nThis game is one thing. Fun.

I repeat, do *not* buy this game if you don't have a gamepad. You will not enjoy it. If you do, though, it's an amazing game that takes Transformers, Gundam, and space battles and bashes them together with big piles of explosions, lasers, missiles and everything else that makes those three things awesome.\n\nThe learning curve and the difficulty curve are extremely similar, so you end up dying once or twice per mission (unless you don't have a gamepad), which can get annoying since the checkpoints are rather sparce, but, despite all that, it's an extremely fun game.\n\ntl;dr: Much fun. So explode. Wow. (Use a gamepad)\n\nEdit: Admittedly, the last mission is... out of place. Loads of precision flying... which isn't that bad, except that you have to ride the throttle the entire time in order to not run out of time. That's not to say it ruins the game, one... out of place... mission does not change the rest of the game, and it's not like the mission isn't fun... well... unless you don't have a gamepad, but it's not like you'll make it to the last mission if you don't have a gamepad.

Also, the strike suit itself is pretty damn cool, shooting out tons of missles a la macross.\nAlthough I must admit, the controls are pretty wonky. Not being able to flip around or do a quick 360 or anything like that is pretty annoying, not to mention the overall awkward control scheme you need to get used to. Voice acting and story is also pretty mediocre, could've used definite improvements there.

Some of them ask you to complete a secondary objective of some sort. However, many of these objectives go against actually doing well on the mission. Very often, when I replayed the mission to get the secondary objective, I ended up doing far worse rating wise then I did just playing the mission normally.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic dog-fighting, large-scale, space combat game and well worth the price of $20. Even better when it's on sale.","December 22, 2013","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really enjoyed switching targets and managing the priority of threats as they came up, as well as ensuring I was using the right weapons at the right times... it was a lot to think about whilst in the midst of a space war.. and I must admit it was really engaging. Got me very much in the mood for Freelancer, another game I have never finished, which has similar controls... ableit isn't involving huge capital ships blasting away at one another in an overarching space conflict like SSZ. The graphics and sound are perfect and it's a well put together game.\n\nI can't credit it with originality though, the music seemed to be from Homeworld, the way the capital ships duked it out with huge laser beams streaking between them.. really felt like Freespace, the controls seemed to be taken from Freelancer like I've said, the unflappable naval officers seem to be ripped out of Nexus - The jupiter incident and the narrative.... inspired by them all I'd say.\n\nStill! A good game and enjoyable, if they do a sequel I'd certainly keep an eye on it and pick it up at the right price.\n\nThe Heroes of the Fleet is an enjoyable DLC revolving around simulations of key battles, mainly one's that were historically defeats for the Earth forces you pilot for, all of which took place within the main story line however the protagonist wasn't part of them. . I liked the narrative twist and enjoyed the fact they'd even *put* a thread of story throughout 6 stand alone DLC missions. I think that's commendable.\n\nThese level's are hard and I found my self on the edge of my seat during the last level in particular, fun times.","November 18, 2013","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't say that I really feel for the characters, but that wasn't what I bought the game for. If you are hoping for story, do not come any further, However, if you are hoping for action packed, literally explosive awesomeness, come much further! The battles in this game are spectacular. Instead of just shoting the capital ships in any random spot, the game urges you to go for many of the weak points and weapons that bristle of each of them. As for graphics, this may not be The Last of Us, but the graphics are good enough to make for a beautiful game at every moment. The backgrounds are spectacular and gorgeous, with vibrant shades of colors, the best probably being the shades of purple and blue.

Some of the main criticisms were with the control scheme and with the length of the game. Personally I got used to the controls quickly on keyboard and mouse, and if you have a controller they are supposedly better. They are also very customisable if you don't like the default system. As for the length, the game has a lot to offer for its price in my opinion, and at a reduced price you can't complain! Missions are a good length (though the checkpoint system can be rather punishing on harder missions) and it is an arcade style game in the sense that you get points for everything so replaying missions for platinum medals is encouraged.\n\nThe other main criticism was that it wasn't enough like some other space flight game that the reviewer liked. Personally I don't see how this is a valid criticism for a reviewer to make who is supposed to be reviewing this game and not one that is over ten years old. This is its own game, go watch some gameplay if you are undecided, don't presume it will be like x-wing because thats what you want it to be like, you may be dissapointed.\n\nIf you like bright flashy space combat and a game that rewards players that learn the mechanics and uses them instead of expecting it to be like that space game you played in 98 then pick it up!","October 20, 2013","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

From the aircraft to manning the strike suit and transforming into the mech was stunning. The controls and maneuverability is an interesting up take. This is one of my first space sim game. The game however pretty much focus on the strike suit. Pretty much why they called the game "Strike Suit Zero" in the first place. Well, the other 4 aircraft can be fun and I wish they tailor the missions for them.\n\nFor a game that uses flight concept, I wish they could do a little bit more. The allowance to have some flight team with us would be awesome. It would also be nice to have a dogfight mechanism. Currently, it's pretty simple. You just chase around and shoot.\n\nThe Raptor DLC is another version of the strike suit and seems pretty okay but the use of flux is too draining. It is a close-ranged strike suit. Maybe it should be re-adjusted a little bit. The mission can get a little bit draggy with the cutscene. And for the final battle, wouldn't it be nice to see massive fleets from two sides with lots of interceptors / fighter aircraft fighting.\n\nIt's a good game nevertheless. I'm really a fan of flight sim. And I hope there are others upcoming games like this.","January 31, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a kickstarter project, this game is really polished.  The controls feel really good once you get used to them.  I am playing with a 360 controller for PC and now I wish that all my old experiences with space sims were with this type of controller.  The dual joysticks really work well for giving you yaw.  I really like that they have different ship types and didn't focus exclusively on the Strike Suit.  Playing the Bomber or Interceptor was really enjoyable and added more variety and depth to the missions.  It was kind of nice that they control how much time you can spend in the mecha form, but I think if they would of balanced that form better, there wouldn't of been the need.  I just have a hard time with it being a sci-fi genre and them saying you need to charge the suit by shooting stuff.  Why not just have it be a thermal cool down thing or something.\n\nThe story isn't overly exciting, the main character is just a name, although they are trying to manufacture a bit of a story with him.  The story doesn't add too much depth to the game, other than serving as a minimal segway to different types of missions.  But the gameplay is really fun, and the graphics are really beautiful.  It feels really amazing when you barrel role over to the underside of a capital ship after making a turret run over the top.  It really feels like you are playing in one of the epic sci fi movie battles.  I don't think I have had a game get this right before.\n\nIf you are into the space combat sim genre, check it out.  The mech suit transformation is what this game brings to the table, along with updated controls, graphics and sound.  It makes me wish these guys had a license to redo wing commmander or tie fighter, they just need a few new writers.\n\n\n\n\n","December 31, 2013","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game’s controls proved to be highly intuitive; it’s relatively easy to pick up, and the ships (be it fighter or mech) were an absolute joy to pilot. Once the Strike Suit is acquired, much of the challenge revolves around the careful management of flux energy, which is replenished upon successful kills, and expended when utilizing the high-powered weapons in strike mode. The story does an adequate job of tying the missions together, and even has a sufficiently interesting twist at the end. As to be expected from the genre, combat is potentially repetitive, but the game mitigates the problem by intensifying the challenge significantly as the campaign progresses, with enemy attacks becoming ever more relentless.\n\nThe game's balance does leave something to be desired however, especially with regard to its roster of ships. Once the titular Strike Suit is made available, there's little in the way of incentives to warrant the selection of other ships. Furthermore, only generic information is provided on unlocked weapons and ship upgrades (granted upon completing mission-specific challenges). Without stat-related information, most of the weapons unlocked over the course of the campaign seem pointless. i.e. It's hard to justify the choice of heavier weapons when they incur penalties (like reduced projectile velocity) without delivering a discernible difference in dps.\n\nGraphics-wise, there's nothing revolutionary here. Nevertheless, it is a step forward as far as space combat sims are concerned. The game maintains a pleasantly minimalist (if somewhat Tron-esque) aesthetic. Each faction's vessels feature sufficiently distinctive designs with a good balance of details, and a number of missions are set against surprisingly breath-taking planetary backdrops. The bloom lighting effects can get over-the-top at times, but on the whole it fits the game well. If I were to nit-pick, some of the shortcomings would be:\n- completely static HUD portraits\n- inconsistent attention to detail: absurdly, some large objects like comms relays and shield generators attached to installations disappear without leaving any wreckage when destroyed\n\nThe game isn't perfect, but I personally find that it brings enough to the table to be a worthy addition to the genre. If you've been on the hunt for a new space combat simulator, this is one heck of an exhilarating ride that you wouldn't want to miss.","January 1, 2014","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Heard some people mention that they found it boring after a while, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  The game itself is stunning both in the visual and audio department.  The movement and reactions are all very fluid, the enviorements look awesome, and the visuals are just very satisfying in general.  Having your vision whited out from fighter explosions is always a cool effect.  The soundtrack sounds professionally done, the main song features KOKIA who has done vocals for other video games and anime series.  Sound effects are also very well done, and make destroying things in your transforming machine of death all that much more fun.\nThe story wasn't exactly anything special, but it sufficed.  I'd say that was one of its few lacking points.  It ran on max settings perfectly fine except for one point in the story where there were literally things exploding EVERYWHERE, and it started to get bogged down, otherwise it was fine.\nVery happy I picked up this game, would be awesome to see a more developed sequel come out eventually, as it would be a shame for such a great concept platform stop here.\n\nEdit: Just figured I'd mention it took me about 10 hours to finish.  Not sure if any of that was the game sitting open during breaks, but I'd say at least 8.5 of those hours were in game blowing ♥♥♥♥ up.

You absolutely NEED a gamepad/joystick and some gaming experience because this game requires some ability to be able to effectively play it.\n\nThat being said, I can continue now with my considerations about the game:\nI've grown in a generation with lots of fantasy and mistery around intergalactic dogfights with Starwars, Starfox, Gundam, Battlestar Galactica, etc etc. and as a game I've set a minimum mark for every game that featured dogfights + space: Starfox 64 (the DS one is good, but not THAT good).\nSince then, I believe, I've lived in a limbo. There's been, of course some games that filled some of that gap like BF3 with it's cool dogfight, but nothing like that.\nWell, you may fire at me as many apples as you want but, for me, this game has set another mark for spaceship dogfight.\nIt's more deep, more consistent, more beautiful, more realistic (control and weaponwise) and it has a playable gundam.\n\nNow to the game's basics:\nThis game is about control. You need to understand and get used to it. It can be hard and punishing first, but after you get the hang of it, it'll all start to feel right and interesting. The story of the Strike Suit Zero is about a fight between Earth and it's colonies and you play the pilot of a new prototype fighter developed by the earthlings: the Strike Suit, a Fighter that can take the form of a Gundam for a limited time. Before the missions take place, you can (and it is recomended to) customize your weaponry according to your ship capacity (the standard strike suit has 2 slots for machine guns and 2 for missiles).\nThe game counts with a good voice acting (but not as deep and engaging as of the Starfox's) and during the mission you'll hear a lot of conversation to keep you informed of what's happening and what you have to do and you're pretty much free to do anything (knowing that by doing anything but the mission's goal may fail the mission :P) and fly anywhere, vertically, horizontally, etc.\nThe game is very dynamic and you'll often find yourself in a situation that you'll have to be aware of many factors (e.g: torpedoes being fired at your capital ship, fighters on your tail, enemy capital ships firing at you, mission targets, missiles being fired at you, etc etc... all at the same ♥♥♥♥ing time) and that may be a little difficult for people who aren't used to this type of game.\n\nThe good:\nSSZ can be a little punishing for mistakes and that's good, I miss that in games. I miss that sometimes, decisions need to be made and you need to be cautious about your actions (at the same time that you need to be fast while you make your decision; The game is gorgeous, you'll often find yourself more focused into looking at the scene than on your objective; It let's you deal with situations creatively and I mean it. It's not the false creative (as in Trine), you'll actually end up having to formulate some sort of plan of action on a mission after you've failed a few times (even more if you're aiming for mission achievments which rewards you with a ship upgrade); The creators of the game said they have plenty of content ahead of us which will keep the game running (still waiting for multiplayer co-op); Not so dumb AI. Look, the AI isn't good, but I've seen worse and it can, sometimes, challenge you, so, for now, that's good enough.\n\nThe bad:\nYou'll have to pay for replayability. The game has no replay (unless you count achievment as scorehunting as replayability). To work this problem around the devs launched Strike Suit Infinity which costs almost half the original game's price and that's, uhh, not fair; The Strike Mode needs some tweaking, because while it has the function to lock-on multiple targets for your missile barrage, you'll end up in a situation where you try to lock an enemy and the game won't let you; The AI is dumb, at least dumb enought to let you shoot them down without little reaction. You'll face 2 kinds of AI in the game: The Elite and the "commoner", the Elite is actually kinda good, they can mass ♥♥♥♥ you, react when you tail them, bother you while you try to execute your mission etc, but that's not good enough, it could've been a lot better; in-game communication isn't so engaging. As I've said before, Starfox has set a mark and, at least at character communication, this game falls far behind to it. The voice acting is good, but you don't feel that immersion as you do with Starfox so you may feel a little betrayed :/\n\nTl;dr:\nLike dogfights? Buy it.\nLike cool visuals? Buy it.\nLike balanced difficulty in games? Buy it.\nLike indies? Buy it.\nSummer Sale? Buy it.\nWinter Sale? Buy it.\nYou have no money? Wait for the last 2 lines above then buy it.","January 23, 2014","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAlmightyOS/recommended/209540/","TheAlmightyOS","TheAlmightyOS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheAlmightyOS/","138 products in account","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was FreeSpace2. This Space Combat Sim became arguably the best in the genre. Sadly, when FS2 came out in 1999 the Space Combat Sim genre was slowly dying. It was the last of an era and no others that came after could hold a candle to it. I played thousands of hours on FreeSpace 2 and the various fan made mods for over a decade, all the while wishing for someone to come revive the genre with a game worthy of FS2's legacy. And it wasn't until 2013 that my wish came true with the release of STRIKE SUIT ZERO.\n\nSTRIKE SUIT ZERO -\nCONTROLS -- The game gives Space Sim enthusiasts the ship control they crave while giving the casual player easy mouse control. After the first mission I was digging around in my closet for my old Saitek x36 Flight controller. Mapping controls was easy enough, but be careful if your rudder is messed up. Axis Z is hard coded to menu navigation and could make mission and craft selection a pain. I would hightly suggest turning up your X/Y Axis sensitivity as the default setting makes your fighter move like an overloaded freighter.\n\nGAMEPLAY -- The missions feel like those from FreeSpace, my meaning being your not the focus of the fight. Epic battles are being waged around you. You are only a small cog in the machine, as it should be. You have specific objectives assigned to you while other units perform their duties. There are only four ships to chose from in SST, but I did not find the selection lacking. They were easy to customize to my flight style though the use of weapon load-outs (which remind me of the load-outs you could pick in Freespace, just with fewer choices). SST adds its own interesting twist to the genre with the "Strike Suit", a craft that has the ability to transform into a mech like something out of an anime. At first I thought this was going to be a cheesy gimmick-like easy button, but I was pleasantly surprised. The strike suit mode was not overly powered and did require a decent amount of skill to use effectively. You have to charge the strike suit though "FLUX", which can be gained by dishing out damage or less so though damage received. Your weapons in Strike Mode use up FLUX and once it is used up your ship is reverted back to interceptor mode.\n\nCONS: The game is woefully short. I would have liked to see multiple campaigns and possibly a co-op mode. Also, you have no control over your wing-men. In my honest opinion that would have made the game better for me. However, this is just nit-picking. The game is awesome.\n\nAnyone who has played FS2, I highly suggest this game to you. When Born Ready boasts that SSZ is "Space Combat. Reborn" they are not just talking out their ♥♥♥. They delivered on that promise. Check it out.","March 17, 2014","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Combat proves a generally enjoyable experience and there are challenges and difference in ship design/loadout that create enough variation to keep things going.\n\nThe story is incredibly basic and at times makes little sense, there are no real twists and turns during the game that make you feel "woah, I didn't expect that" and I am left with a feeling like the story had only just started and there is much more left to be told as two key moments are left somewhat hanging, including the ending I got. I also am left feeling half the villain on a train-track ride of a game, forced down one path.\n\nHowever, I still would recommend the game if you can get it cheap. It sated an urge for some space action and although it has its flaws I still thoroughly enjoyed the experience and if the studio that made it manage to keep going I would be keen to see what they come up with in future.\n\n\n\n","February 8, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found the controls a bit clunky but aside from that the only thing that continually frustrated me was the inability for me to lock on to the specific target I wanted. The brief in game explination hardly covers the use of the system adequately and knowing where those torpedos are when the entire screen is filled with explosions is quite difficult at times. All that aside I would recommend this game but wait and get it on sale. It is not a $20.00 tittle I feel it missed out on much needed development such as character development, story depth, and scenario design. Unlike what I've seen from the rest of the reviews I had no issues with the checkpoint system incorperated they were well placed and the entire point was to make sure you werent just throwing out a million rockets willy nilly so you would have the required resources to beat the end of a mission segment and reach the begining of another checkpoint. All in all the checkpoints did not hamper me in fact they were an asset once I figured out how they were placed and I knew when it was okay to waste what I had to make it to the next checkpoint after which it was acceptable to die and get more special weapon ammo and armor.","March 4, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like the combat part of Freelancer (one of my all time favourites) and it's done very well.\nThere is a degree of customisation, which is nice.\n\nSome of the checkpoints are very long, so if you die at certain points you can expect up to 20 minutes of replaying before you get to where you died, which can get frustrating at times. This isn't all bad though, as it makes you more careful and not just recklessly charging into 20 enemy ships just to see if it works.\n\nVaried optional objectives that unlock ship upgrades are also present. These are really fun to go for an are appropriately rewarding if you complete them.\n\nAlso, the last mission is utter nonsense, but it's only 10 minutes long so it's not a too big of an impact.","May 9, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This whole game comes together and it’s simply a great work of art. Dog fights, strike mode, blasting capital ships, and getting high scores. Doing this and having a blast is what it’s all about. This fills the void of my desire for Ace Combat for PCs (I’m talking about a good Ace Combat mind you).\n\nStrike Suit Zero is entirely a campaign. The story itself isn’t stellar, but makes the combat feel real and each mission has some weight to it. There’s a great sense of an epic fight when you’re in the midst of a fight between capital class ships and hoards of fighters. As a player you aren’t some overpowered-one-ship-destroy-everything-and-do-anything since you have to rely on your allies to help fill the void in your weaknesses. On the flip side you can greatly assist your allies by targeting specific objectives and hitting the enemy where it really hurts. Probably a great example is if your capital ship is in danger from enemy beam cannons you can snipe out the beam cannons on the enemy capital ships. Another good one is sniping out AA turrets on capital ships so your bombers can take them out quickly and safely. The campaign does a nice job of mixing up what you need to do so it’s never a stale series of mission.","June 20, 2013","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty cool in concept, but the execution was shaky. I've had to rewrite my review multiple times because I'm not sure how to feel about this game.\n\n-random difficulty spikes to the point where the game is just cluttered with unnecessary bullets and explosions (and they don't pull off the "crowded battle scene" that often, but when they do, it's pretty cool)\n-controls are awkward, but thankfully are rebindable\n-the strike suit, which is the draw of the whole game, is a gimmick that only lasts 10 seconds, and has a pretty poor targeting system, which means you'll be darting about not hitting anything, though once you unlock a few upgrades, it becomes decent\n-might just be my computer, but I experienced insane slowdown even on the lowest graphics settings. I won't consider this a point against the game, because I've had slowdown issues before\n-battles are luck based, depending on if you hit the tiny area that you're supposed to, when fighting a bigger ship. Apparently you need to hit weakspots which may or may not be marked for your convenience, but shooting the turrets does some damage. Targeting system is also broken, as in you normally have the option to aim towards the closest enemy, or a mission objective enemy. Thing is, you can't just target them. You have to cycle your targets until you hopefully get the one you want, like the cruisers and carriers. It's a gambit, so you take what you get.\n-game is 90% escort missions, and your friendlies are thin as paper,\n-last mission is a pain in the port, and I won't even spoil it.\n\nIf you have to try this, get it on sale. I'm talking less than 5 bucks. I still recommend it against my previous criticisms because it tried to be a cool mech game and gave us something to remember, and I was thoroughly challenged. After all, it's better to deal with a challenging game than one that holds your hand the whole way. As long as you get it on sale, you won't regret it, because the game does deliver to an extent. Had I paid full price, however, I wouldn't be as forgiving. Especially once I got that darn last level.

Couldn't do anything robot-y like rip parts off ships or fistfight dinosaurs.\nDidn't feel like I was in space - fighters perpetually move forward & nobody takes advantage of inertia & lack of atmosphere.\nRepetition - "go blow up X thing" can get old fast.\n\nI wouldn't pay the regular $20 for it, but if it goes on sale, I'd say check this one out.","December 7, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
