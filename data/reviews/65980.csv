And in many ways, they're correct. But there's a slightly more insidious truth to the statement as well.\n\nStart up Civ V with all of the DLC expansions and play through a game. It's well-balanced, deep, intricate, and takes a good amount of effort and understanding to make it work. Now start up Civ V WITHOUT any of the DLC expansions.\n\nDrastically different game, isn't it? Suddenly the balancing is gone, the depth has disappeared, even the use of culture points is different. You're playing something that seems... unfinished. Unpolished. Broken. It's not the full game yet.\n\nThat is what I feel is happening with Beyond Earth. It's not just the standard glitches and problems that every launch title ends up having, it's that people are comparing it to Civ V with the DLC, and not Civ V as it was when it initially came out. And it's an unfair comparison.\n\nBeyond Earth is not a bad game when judged on its own merits. The graphics are clean, the tech tree is deep, the bugs (both literal and figurative) are not overwhelming. There are definitely aspects that need work; the interface is drastically in need of an overhaul, the civilopedia is missing critical information on some of the structures, some things are never explained at all, and there are graphical glitches here and there among the prettiness. But unfortunately it's never going to be judged on its own merits. It's going to be judged against Alpha Centauri (which, let's face it, people are viewing through rose-colored glasses) and against Civ V.\n\nHaving said all of that, though... the fact that we're going to be forced to wait for DLC in order to have a great game instead of merely a finished one does not lend itself to much of a positive review. So even though I still feel that Beyond Earth is being unfairly maligned, I cannot in good faith recommend purchasing it in the form it is now. At least not at full price.\n\nWait until the next sale, or even better wait until the first DLC and then get them both on sale.","October 28, 2014","false","70.9"," 4,197 of 4,574 people (92%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","92","197","4","52","76"

While it tries to take its cues from 1999's fantastic Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri (SMAC), it lacks all personality and spark that made SMAC special.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it just never gets out of second gear.

They didn't even bother to rewrite the flavor text.\n- The affinity system.  It tries to organicly grow your culture in the form of a pure human, cybernetic singularity, or human/alien hybrid civilization.

The way the game plays and the interface are mostly the same and it has all the same windows (diplomacy, economic overview, etc.). Most of the changes are on the surface level: gold has been replaced by energy, social policies by virtues and archers by rangers.\n\nThe main shortfall of CivBE is that is has no character/personality. The maps and menus look bland and your opponents are completely interchangeable. Another thing that's missing is context. You know about Hiawatha and the Iroquois and what a lighthouse is, but you don't know who Élodie is and what a xenomass well does.\n\nAll in all, this would have been a GREAT mod for Civ5, but as a standalone game it doesn't compare well to it's bigger brother.\n\nIf you didn't play Civ5, play that instead.

I also had played a bit of alpha centauri, so I was interested to see where this game would go.\n\nThe Good:\n- Some of the issues with 1UPT have been solved. I am still not a fan, but floating units helps you siege cities easier, which as somebody who has 500+ hours in civ (playing emperor/immortal)  I appreciate this greatly. This effect comes in more late game.\n- Cities don't get built instantly, which is great. I think we can all agree that it is annoying when you are 1 tile away from a settler who makes a city right before you get to him, and now suddenly, you have to come back with an army. Instead, they have an outpost, which is far easier to assault. This prevents the computer and other players from making low-risk, high reward cities all the time. They have to actually consider where they are building this outpost and defending it.\n- The Tech web is very unique, and doesn't really force you into one direction. (although skipping out on spy tech at the beginning is truly shooting yourself in the foot)\n- This game has FAR MORE depth than civ V did at release, and still more depth than CiV V after Gods and kings.\n- Aliens are interesting in that they can be passive, or aggressive depending on how you deal with them. (This could use some more fine tuning. (Simply having Green, Light Green, Orange, and Red as aggression markers is not enough, give us more tiers, we need to be informed of exactly how much they feel aggressive to be able to act accordingly)\n-Tier bonuses within the Virtue tree allow you to go accross the tree as oppose to just choosing one, and being forced to stick with it.\n- The spy system is far more relevant than in Civ V, and cannot be ignored completely. This could be improved further though. (They could give you more choices of what to do)\n- The three different ideologies are awesome, they all go in their own path and have their own playstyle. Unfortunately, in Multiplayer I inherit the Ideologies of my allies, which makes no sense to me. I think there should be an option to turn this off at least.\n- Runs almost as well as Civ V.\n- The technology announcer is a woman, unfortunately this means Civ Guy's voice is gone. So you don't get to hear him tell you "You have discovered COMPASS" Kinda sad, hehe, but I love the woman's voice even better.\n\nThe Bad\n-Totally uninspired maps. It seems like the concern here was that players wouldn't be able to understand that a land is fertile unless it is a green grass land. Come on Firaxis, I think we are smarter than that, or else I don't think Civ would appeal to us.\n- The landscape is completely like a re-colored Civ V, and is far too afraid to venture into sci-fi at all. It tries to hard to provide us with an easy way to understand the game from the first time we pick it up, and make us feel at home. Unfortunately this causes the land to look incredibly bland, and the color pallet is horrid, it is green, purple, and brown.\n- Both of these issues come from the conservative approach that they seem to have take for this game, Make it easy, simple to understand. They were afraid to take risks, FAR too afraid. Look at alpha centauri, they were bold when they made that game, that game had personality; which leads me to my next point.\n\n- I play this game, and I don't really see any type of personality to it. It is a blank slate, just  a video game on a screen, no story, no basic theme. They tried to give you the idea that you lead your own future, but instead it just feels like they didn't give the game any spirit. (Maybe adding more themes for each ideology, and unique buildings would give you more of a feeling that your nation has become unique. ( A good example of this is Civ V, when you played civ you feel like nations strive for glory, and we look at the accomplishments of civilizations. In Civ BE it feels like you like land on a planet, and they tell you. OK, go tell your story. (that's it...)\n\n- Teching up in the beginning is VERY SLOW. It pick ups rather fast once you get to the mid late game. But at the beginning, MY GOD, it is slow. I usually play standard on CIV V, but this feels 3 to 4 times as slow when it comes to teching. Maybe the way the game was designed required this, I myself am not sure if I buy this.\n\n- The 1 UPT, although somewhat improved, is still an issue. This issue could be solved if they allowed siege units to fire above hills/forests. I guess they forget how to do that on the way over to Alpha Centauri... Seriously, I understand the distinction between Realism, and gameplay. But let my damn artillery fire 3 tiles away, even if it is for reduced damage. This will open up options for people, maybe let you have elongated sieges. Whether this is for gameplay purposes, or realism purposes, i don't get why artillery fire only 2 hexes away in the beginning.\n\n-Religion is gone. I for one understand why this isn't in the game YET. But it needs to make a re-appearance, this was an aspect of the game that gave Civ V depth. This may have been cut because of the 1/3 rule they have at firaxis. From game to game,they removed 1/3rd of the freatures, and replace 1/3rd. They are so afraid to overburden us with features, but guess what Firaxis? If you want us to stay fans of your game, you have to add a bit of depth(as our mastery increases), or else your fans get tired of your games.\n\n- The map packs aren't distinct, i can't really even remember which one looks like when looking at the map list. I know they have to consider balance when making maps, but these maps have very little to nothing unique about them. At least change up the color pallet, make us feel like we are on a different planet. I just feel like we are on a different version of the same planet every single time I play.\n- The wonders make no sense, and aren't even drawn out. It's like they expect you to fill in the colors with your mind. Just have one of your awesome artists draw up something futuristic and awesome. We don't need to fill in every single part of the game with our imagination, give us a base idea or image to work with. Not the quickly drawn up blueprint of a wonder that wasn't even explained properly.\n- There is very little Alien diversity. I think there are about 4 aliens, and they are the same 4 in every single map. (2 water aliens for a total of 6) Still, it isn't enough, they should vary, they should be part of the equation when you start the game.\nThe suggestions\n\n- Give us an intro for each victory, that would be awesome, and help build the "story" that Firaxis wants to help build in our minds.\n-Give us more uniqueness for each Ideology.\n- Provide us with more ideologies in the long run.\n- Bring back religion, and add some depth to it if possible. (Find a way to make it work.)\n-Please...Please, please... re-work the maps, they look terribly boring, the color pallet is horrid, and they are the opposite of inspiring.\n-Bring some scifi into this, give us farmable deserts, habitable mountains, ocean cities, floating cities. Give us something original, ANYTHING. Make us dream of the future. I believe Firaxis can achieve this while keeping the game balanced.\n- Bring randomized aliens into the game. Have a type of alien species that spawn randomly at the beginning of the game. Depending on what it is, you can adjust your strategy.\n- Extend the benefits and possibilities that you have when you go beyond level 13 of an affinity. Let it change our civilization even more, and maybe give more benefits.\n\nAll in all, the game is good, pretty good, but not great. It needs something more, and it needs to be daring.\nThe hours speak for themselves : Civ V (500 hours) Civ BE 54 hours\n\nI recommend this game based on the fact that this game is good enough, and I believe firaxis can fix most of their faults. I doubt they will fix everything though, only time will tell.","March 19, 2015","true","210.5"," 883 of 1,030 people (86%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","86","883","1","33","16"

I still wouldn't recommend it based on the poor creative direction.  The game just needs a lot of extra seasoning.  I can't lie, I've been playing it a lot lately, and it's just damned solid mechanically, and despite the similarities to Civ 5, it actually plays a lot differently on the meta strategy level.  None of this couldn't be done by very creative modders, however, and the real meat of a AAA game is in the art budget, of which BE clearly had very little.\n\nI've been looking forward to this game for months.  So this review hurts to write.\n\nAs a HUGE fan of science-fiction, Civilization, and the Civ 5 engine, I feel obligated to write this review.  It is very, very hard for me to not give this game a general recommendation.\n\nLet me preface it by saying it's not going to be bubbly fan-squealing, or one-dimensional vitriol.  I have legitimate issues with Beyond Earth - serious ones!\n\nDoes that mean I'm not playing it?  No, it doesn't.  I'm enough of a nerd to love the game despite its failings.\n\nHere's the rundown:\n\nThe game takes to the Civ 5 engine like a duck to water.  Yes, a lot of the various aspects of it are transparently reskinned (energy is gold, happiness is health, etc.)  A lot of the mechanics, such as diplomacy and trade, are just flat out identical to how they are in Civ 5 and its various expansions.  Is that a bad thing?  I don't think so, because Civ 5 did a lot of things right.\n\nLet's just condense this.  It's a great base game.  It's a game that I can play and enjoy and then think "wow, I can't wait until this gets expansions and becomes truly amazing."  In that sense, it reminds me of Civ 5 at release, way back when.  I liked Civ 5 at release.  But it didn't grip me.  That all changed when Gods and Kings came out.  The vast majority of my Civ 5 playtime is post G&K.  I suspect it'll be the same for Beyond Earth.\n\nUnfortunately this is just how Firaxis seems to do things now.  They release a really solid, if bare and vanilla, base game for the flat fee.  Then they release thirty dollar expansions that are AMAZING additions.  They wouldn't do it if it didn't work.\n\nHere are some things I just can't excuse, though, and I think really detract from the value of a full-price purchase:\n\n- Very little automation.  I have no problem with micro-management.  But when that micromanagement becomes clicking my poor old fingers into early arthritis just to refresh trade routes, I get irritated.  It was annoying in BNW, it's annoying here.  And where are city governors?  This game should have improved upon Civ 5's shortcomings, not just reskinned the whole thing, annoyances and all.\n\n-Graphical glitches.  Units getting stuck in the upgrade windows and plastering over each other.  Visual artifacts.  Etc.  Will be ironed out.  Not game-breaking in the least, just annoying.\n\n-Sound glitches.  Sometimes when achieving a new affinity level, and a new technology, the quotes stutter or lay over each other, or jostle for priority.  It's distracting and annoying.\n\n- Boring leaders.  I like Kavitha a lot.  But I play as her, so I don't get to see her much.  I have to be subjected to all the boring, rigid, starched sads that run the other factions (except for the PAC leader, she really gets into it sometimes).  Alpha Centauri had strong, charismatic, intriguing characters for the individual factions.  The leaders in this game seem sedate compared to them, and especially compared to the colorful, bombastic characters littered through Civ 5.\n\n- Boring factions in general.  Half the fun of Civ 5 was having your own special war and peace themes as a civ.  Identifying with the strong personality and values of your chosen civ, etc.  There is very little to attach to in Beyond Earth, because all of the leaders are relatively sedated and dull.  They don't even get unique backgrounds or music.\n\n- Limited visual representation of technology progression.  It's there, sure.  Clothes on your fellow leaders change.  You can see some cybernetics later.  I haven't seen what they look like at the maximum affinity level (18), maybe it's extreme.  It would be cool to be able to look at your own leader and see how they change visually as you progress, but you can't.\n\n- Boring-as-♥♥♥♥-wonders.  Each wonder in Civ 5 had a dramatic quote, a beautiful piece of art, and its own brief symphonic score to herald its completion.  In Beyond Earth we get some dull, lifeless blueprint picture, no real musical cue, and a simple quote.  I also can't see them on the landscape like I could in Civ - no wait, I can see some of them.  They're just hard to catch sometimes.\n\nAll in all, the game just lacks polish and TLC.  And that's what separates a AAA title for $50-60 from everything else.  You expect a certain level of polish and refinement, and a lot of that comes from attention to detail in the art and writing departments.  You progress through astounding leaps and bounds of technology, yet the sense of impact from those accomplishments is minimal thanks to the slashed art, music, and writing budgets.\n\nSo, in terms of just artistic polish, the game is a huge disappointment compared to every other Civ title and Alpha Centauri.  It lacks the personality and charm Firaxis usually brings to the table.  What gives?\n\nI don't know.  We can only really speculate.  But it's sad, and ultimately, kind of kills the experience for me.\n\nI only recommend this game to hardcore Civ fans who just love a good strategy romp.  It's still fun to play.  It just isn't very satisfying in the end.  To everyone else, I say just avoid it until the first expansion comes out and the price drops, unless you truly don't care about art, or character, or music, and only want the numbers and the game itself.\n\nHopefully in the future we'll see more victory conditions, religion mechanics, psionics, another affinity, new factions, new leaders, better art,  better music, better expensive non-gamey stuff that publishers hate to fund.\n\nHopefully.","October 25, 2014","false","248.6"," 1,865 of 2,224 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","865","2","9","83"

This time the "story" takes place after you launch the rocket in Civilization 5 to search for a new place for humanity to continue it's living.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/65980/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","Writing a negative review for a Civilization game is something I never thought I'd do.  I was even someone who defended Civilization V at release due to the benefits of hex tiles and no unit stacking far outweighing the drawback of somewhat simplified game systems.  In this case however, they have taken the simplification to absurd levels and made a game so 2-dimensional, I simply can't believe that Firaxis produced it.\n\nI suppose I should start with the positives, though there's only one.  The social policy system from Civilization V has been rearranged so there are 4 policy trees each with 3 tiers and upgraded with tier and tree bonuses.  Putting a certain number of points in a tier across all trees, or a certain number of points into a particular tree will net you an additional bonus.  It's still a very static system though, and makes me miss the customizable government system from Alpha Centauri.\n\nMoving onto the negatives we have just about everything else.  The classic tech tree has been discarded in favor of a tech web which is meant to provide the player with more freedom in how to progress in the game.  What it actually does is scatter related technologies all over the place making it very difficult to locate what you're looking for.  The sense of freedom also feels rather false after playing for a while as you are forced into researching specific technologies to keep up with your opponents, deal with aliens, and persue your chosen victory condition.\n\nBarbarians in regular Civilization games have of course been replaced with aliens.  You might expect an interesting alien threat with a lot of depth like the mindworms from Alpha Centauri, but instead we simply have a constant annoyance that requires significant military technology to deal with (one of the things removing freedom from the tech web.)  All alien types appear at the very beginning of the game including the very strong siege worms and they will just move around killing terraforming units and settlers.  They rarely attack military units but are very strong in the early game and will always win if they do until you have invested in military technology.  If you kill a lot of them or attack a nest without destroying it, they will become much more aggressive but that is the most depth you can expect from them.\n\nThe AI has been significantly downgraded as well.  In order to promote a wide range of playstyles, Firaxis removed all personality from the leaders, basically turning them into cardboard cutouts.  For some reason they still created a number of factions and are planning 4 more for the first expansion even though the choice of leader has no impact on gameplay.  Diplomacy has taken a similar hit, somehow managing to have even fewer diplomatic options than Civilization V.  The leaders are so passive you can play through an entire game without a single one declaring war on you, even after rubbing elbows with aggressive territory expansion.  No more late game warmongers like previous Civilization games, and no more interesting leaders.  It does however seem to fit with the lack of style in the rest of the game.  There is no  sci-fi UI and sound effects like Alpha Centauri and no interesting technology flavor text (the game uses uninteresting quotes from the new cardboard cutout leaders.)\n\nA "quest" system was added which initially sounded like a promising new way to mix up gameplay by giving players different goals.  Unfortunately 95% of the quests are the same thing: You built a building for the first time, pick one of two miniscule bonuses to permanently apply to all copies of that building for this game.  Half the time I didn't feel like there was even any choice since even after taking every single health bonus possible, including all offered in quests, I could barely keep the value positive even with a small empire.  The system has a lot of potential, and maybe it will be realized in expansions, but at this point it is pretty useless.\n\nI'm undecided on the new affinity system.  In essence each of the 3 paths embodies a specific philosophy which can affect diplomatic relations with other players and provides different units.  You earn affinity points mostly by researching specific aligned technologies in order to unlock more units and persue the affinity-specific victory condition.  While it does result in unit differences between players, the unit variety provided to each player is quite small and I'm not convinced that it actually results in any meaningful differences from a gameplay perspective.\n\nIn summary, this game is one huge disaster.  I don't think even 3 expansions can save it, especially if they contain the miniscule amount of content announced for the first expansion.  I know some people are going to vote my review down because I only have 5 hours played, insisting that I haven't explored the new game mechanics well enough, but when a game leaves THIS BAD of an impression and is lacking ALL the features we wanted from a new sci-fi Civilization game, no amount of additional time is going to improve my understanding of the game enough for me to want to play it again or to recommend it.  I never thought that Firaxis could lose my trust but here we are.  Go play Alpha Centauri, it's 10x the game Beyond Earth is.","June 25, 2015","false","5.4"," 584 of 684 people (85%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","85","584","684","12","2"

In this light, the game feels lackluster and incomplete. It has none of the boldness that characterized the changes made in the step from Civ4 to Civ5, and most changes are superficial in nature. Worse yet, despite being so evidently a spin-off of a larger, more developed game (because let's not forget that Civ5 has two expansions under its belt by now, which hugely improved its scope and depth), Beyond Earth adds too little of its own to the Civ formula besides aforementioned superficial changes. Affinities are merely a replacement for Civ5's late-game Ideologies; the tech-web is structurally different and at first glance the most intriguing change, but navigating it devolves into a race for affinity points. The unit customization feels tacked on, barely even replacing Civ5's more complex promotion system.\n\nFor something that can count Alpha Centauri among its forebears, which remains the benchmark for the 4X genre in science fiction, Beyond Earth simply falls short of achieving orbit.","December 27, 2014","false","7.7"," 762 of 909 people (84%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","84","762","909","38","2"

Either wait for the inevitable expansion packs or don't bother with it at all.\n\nThe Long Haul\nI'm going to preface this with a disclaimer - I play civ for it's multiplayer, and the perspective I'm writing this review from is a multiplayer one. As such I'm leaving out a lot of core single player complaints (such as it's poor ai) in order to touch more on the multiplayer aspects of the game.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe sci-fi atmosphere is rich and enjoyable\nThe evolution of your unit and city aesthetics as you gain affinity points is interesting and adds some much-needed visual flair to the game\nThe concept of being able to choose from a variety of bonuses for your civ as opposed to each one having a specific set of them is nice and (sort of) opens up multiple approaches to your starting strategy\nThe Bad\n\nThe game looks, feels, and functions more like a total conversion mod or an expansion pack than a full release game\nThe factions lack a sense of identity, and would all sort of blend together were it not for the fact that some are very, very poorly balanced in relation to the others\nAlso, there are only 8 of them.\nThe nonviolent victory conditions lack variety (two of them are almost exactly identical, one just being easier than the other) and are far too simple to accomplish to really present much of a challenge\nTrade routes are extremely powerful, so powerful in fact that they more or less completely mitigate unhealthiness debuffs\nThe health system is far too lenient, and strongly incentivizes infinite city sprawl strategies. It simply does not penalize you enough to make you care about being unhealthy\nTIle improvements take an incredibly long time to build, making things like the terrascape and biowell, improvements that would ordinarily be amazing, ultimately a waste of time in most scenarios since they can take almost a tenth of a game to complete\nEven something as simple as cutting down a forest takes 8 turns on quick speed, which is completely absurd\nAlmost every wonder in the game is pointless to build - they simply don't produce meaningful enough effects to be worth it, particularly in the case of some of the late game wonders\nWhile the aliens at first seem to be a threat, they ultimately don't amount to much more than a slight annoyance and take enormous amounts of punishment before they ever get upset with you enough to outright attack your settlements\nThere is virtually no unit variety whatsoever, outside of affinity upgrades\nRuins are enormously strong and being lucky enough to find the right ones can net you free virtues, free affinity levels, and even skip over part of a victory condition\nThe Ugly\n\nThe UI is god awful and, in many cases (such as the city screen), is totally unusable if you aren't zoomed in nearly all the way due to just how enormous and clunky the buttons and graphics are\nWithout turning on yields it is extremely difficult to tell certain biomes apart from each other (particularly on the fungal map type)\nJust in general the overall visual and colour schemes the game went with are very dark and muddy, it's hard to distinguish many different resources and tiles from each other and, if you're visually impaired or have any form of colourblindness, you really have no option but to keep tile yields on at all times\nMultiplayer is riddled with bugs and dysynch issues, most notable of which being that half the time when you resynch or have to reload a turn, some players will lose techs or buildings and be totally unable to reacquire them (the most common example being a player losing the computing tech and then being unable to build a spy agency for the rest of the game, even losing the one they built if they already had one)\nPlayers are completely unable to spy on capitals that have landed before them, and in some cases even if captured the player is still unable to place a spy in their newly-acquired city\nSettling on any resource tile will remove the resource that spawned there. As a general concept this is less than great but in practice what this means is that if you decide to land your capital on any tile other than the center one being suggested to you, there is a very high chance that you will settle on top of a vital titanium or oil node, costing you greatly in the early game\nAffinity units are absurd. If you rush down your affinity techs and get your first units out before your opponent does you will win, absolutely no question. You can just slam them into cities at very little cost and virtually anything short of a city shot won't even scratch the paint\nCovert ops are broken, particularly in the case of the ARC faction since they recieve a bonus to spying that renders it impossible to stop them from building intrigue in your cities early on even if you have a counterspy present. Intrigue can be built up extremely fast, far faster than you'll probably be capable of defending against if you didn't rush down your spy agency. Operations at the highest level of intrigue have a much higher chance of success than they should, meaning that even if you have a mid level spy trying to initiate a coup d'etat in an enemy capital that has a counterspy present, you will still probably steal the city\nThe questing system as it stands is extremely random and leaves games more up to chance than skill. Being lucky enough to get your extra trade route from your autoplant quest the next turn instead of 30 turns later, or getting 2 easy affinity quests in a row while other players get the much longer ones (or in some cases, broken ones that are uncompletable since the city it spawns for doesn't have the resource it requires) can and very often does decide games\nThe resources, bonuses, virtues, and quest descisions are all very poorly balanced and don't seem to have been thought through very well. Many are just objectively better than their counterparts, resulting in standard builds that no one deviates from and making diverse strategy in multiplayer games difficult to impossible\nThe purity affinity is heavily imbalanced early game, offering the best bonuses early while also having their first affinity unit only require titanium instead of their affinity resource, making battlesuit rushes a very real possibility and severely limiting interesting strategies and styles of play\nStations are a joke. Not only are they not useful to trade with since internal route benefits are so much better, but they also appear in the worst places possible. More often than not I've found my capital flanked in every expandable direction by stations, forcing me to invest in early military while my opponents are free to expand as they please\nThe Last Word\nThere's plenty more I could talk about here, but I only have so much space to write this. Ultimately, the game is a barebones, poorly thought out mess. The overall design philosophy behind the game seems to have been "hey wouldn't this idea be cool in a game?" instead of "how can we make this idea work in a game?", overall resulting in a sloppily balanced, short-lived, and unsatisfying spiritual successor to a much better game that any long time fan of Firaxis' work will be wholly dissappointed by.\n\nBeyond Earth is truly a product of it's time: a game that was released in an unfinished state in order to justify the purchase of patchwork dlc that will eventually make it a whole product. I personally detest this trend in modern gaming and I hope that sometime soon we'll see a game released once again that doesn't ask us to buy it twice in order to have a complete experience.","November 13, 2014","false","32.3"," 737 of 893 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","737","893","6","13"

Most of the time I don't bother contacting the other leaders but just blindly accept their proposals. At least there's a little more to it now. Still not my cup of tea. There seems to be too many optoins without any of them being overy substantial.\n\n- graphics: the sea is really nice.\n\nProblems:\n\n- wonders: are still horrible. None of them really are wonderful. Their effects are for the most part, minor.\n\n- map: too busy. There's so much on the map it's very often hard to see your units.\n\n- resources: there are too many resources. It's hard to keep track of what does what and why I need one over the other. None of them really seem special. I prefer Civ V's limited number, although they started to throw in more near the end just for the sake of having more which I didn't agree with. BERT could have done much better to have fewer resources but make the effects more substantial (needed for more buildings/units).\n\n- buildings: way, way too many buildings. This woudn't be a bad thing but they have many of the same effects (one will offer 2 health, another will offer 1, another will offer 1 health and 1 science). I'd prefer fewer buildings but with more substantial effects.\n\nConclusion/short review: I applaud the efforts of the Devs/Firaxis and mainly bought the expansion out of loyalty and a wish to support Firaxis. I was hopeful but it's not the game for me. After 7 hours of play I've deleted the game. I'm now waiting for Civ VI. Certainly, a few of the things from BERT could be incorporated into VI like diplomatic capital which I thought was interesting.\n\n\n\nI really tried to like this game but I have to give it a thumbs down.\n\nShort review:\n\n- the game lacks personality.\n- the leaders are bland.\n- diplomacy is worse than Civ V\n- colour palatte/graphics make it hard ot distinguish tiles\n- buildings are boring and non-descript\n- wonders are underpowered and unimaginative\n- there are better games out there (Endless space, endless legend, Gal CIV III (when it comes out).\n\nDon't buy it.\n\nLong review:\n\nProblems:\n\n(1) Leaders: It's certainly been said before, the leaders are boring. They have no personality. They're animations are basically the same as well.\n\n(2) Diplomacy: Civ V's diplomacy was a huge stepdown from Civ IV but what made it passable was the excellent leader animations which made the model tolerable. With BE, you have the exact same diplomacy from V but with bland leaders.\nThey had a real opportunity to make this game stand out but they decided to add in feature after feature rather than refining what was there. One common complaint regarding Civ V was the diplomacy but it seems the Devs here could really care less. Too bad. Great diplomacy could have rescued this game\n\n(3) Graphics: Certainly the graphics are different than what you see in V but they are ultimately forgetable and very frustrating. The biggest complaint I have is it's impossible to tell what some tiles are without hovering the mouse over them. On some planets you'll have purple tundra which looks very simlar to purple grassland which looks similar to plains. ARRGH.\n\n(4) Too many buildings: I think what ended up happening is when they were making the game the Devs realized you run out of things to do quickly since the game isn't very deep. Hence, they added more buildings to give you something to do with your cities rather than just allocating them to wealth, research, production. The end result is you get building 1 which give 1 health, and building 2 which gives 2 health and 1 science, and building 3 which gives 2 health and 2 science. None of them are interesting or something you'd b-line a tech to get because it will help you. They are all forgetable.\n\n(5) Wonders are horrible: Wonders in every Civ game were something that ultimately could give you a good boost. In BE they are basically slightly more powerful verisons of the normal buildings you'd already build but they cost 5-10 times as much. I don't even remember the names of any of them. Again, they're forgetable.\n\n(6) Victory conditions are too similar: Three of the 5 conditions are pretty much the same: Build special building, then in 30 turns you win the game if you remember to click the buildling every turn (yes, this is a simplification but that's pretty much it). Again, forgetable.\n\nReally the entire game is: forgetable. There are other games I'd try before spending any money on BE. Endless space, despite it's shortcomings really had more charm and gameplay. Endless legend is way better.\n\nIf you doubt my review, check out the latest game play stats. Despite getting a huge patch a day ago the number of players hasn't jumped beyond 6200. Civ V, 4 years since release, is still at 35000.\n\nFiraxis dropped a rare bomb here. I truely hope that the Devs who worked on this don't play any significant role in Civ VI.","December 9, 2014","false","52.9"," 638 of 772 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","638","772","9","6"

With Beyond Earth, the first play through was OK, but every time I start a new game I lose interest by turn 100. No matter what faction or abilities I choose or affinity and victory conditions I pursue, every game feels exactly the same.\n\nI come back to the game every few weeks to try to learn to enjoy the game (I would like to get my $60 worth of play time out of it) but am unable to stay hooked.

I'm a hard-core Civilization fan.  I've played Civ since the franchise was first launched.  I've literally logged hundreds of hours playing Civ 5 and all its DLC in Steam.  I also feel as though Alpha Centauri is still one of the best computer games ever made.  I've been looking forward to Civilization Beyond Earth for months.\n\nThis game is such a terrible disappointment.  And I'm going to be as constructive as I can be in my criticsm.\n\nI hardly know where to begin.\n\nFirst of all, Wonders of the World are completely nerfed and uninspiring. There are no video sequences upon completing one.   There's no sense that youv'e actually accomplished something by building a Wonder.  Even more galling, from what I've seen (and I've already played the game over 12 hours just this weekend), Wonders don't even matter much.  Most Wonders seem to give palty bonuses that are on par with a single city building.  Literally.  I mean, c'mon!  If building the sci fi equivalent of the Pyramids is no different than building the sci fi equivalent of a Granary, what's the point?\n\nThe Civolpedia is awful.  The help screens are appallingly unhelpful.  They don't link to one another.  It's not easy to understand what's going on in this game, and the "help system" makes it worse.  The prose of the "backstory" is dense and confusing, without any dramatic hooks to tie in a narrative, and make it interesting.  Even as a veteran Civ player, I was floundering trying to figure this game out, and the help system was about as useful as calling Comcast on a Saturday afternoon.  After about half an hour *just trying to figure out the Civolepedia* I started to drink.\n\nThe Affinity system makes no sense.  Why "force" me to adopt certain affinities just because I research technology in a certain order?  Why not give me the choice to engineer my society through meaningful decisions, in terms of Affinities?  Even more perplexing, how can I be a "humans first" "Gaia loving" "I am the Borg" society, ALL AT ONCE?  Affinities should be mutually exclusive.\n\nThis game is boring.  I played for over 200 turns and no one attacked me, other than some random aliens.  No one offered me any interesting challenges.   I'll admit, I tend to be a peaceful builder type, but to play in a world where no one goes to war, and where I don't feel the need to attack other factions or pump up my military to prevent being conquered... what's the point of that?\n\nThe health system (a.k.a. "happniess") is broken.  Until you unlock certain late game techs, or build many, many special terrain upgrades, it's basically impossible to have more than 3 or 4 cities.  Yes, you read that right.  Forget infinite city sprawl, this game punishes you for trying to found or conquer more than about 3 cities for the first 150+ turns.  Absoultely abominable.  Dumb.\n\nFiraxis, I'm one of your biggest fans, but I feel like I should get my money back on this one.  If a developer were willing to e-mail me, I could offer about 20 helpful suggestions on how to fix this game, but until then, no one else should bother buying it.\n\n\n\n","October 26, 2014","false","52.5"," 1,319 of 1,699 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","319","1","2","33"

Trade routes require excessive micromanagement, the quests are one dimensional, there is no surprise or story around the Aliens (e.g. more powerful units), the Aliens do not become aggressive quickly enough, the factions and leaders are bland and alike strategically, the victory screens are appallingly lame, the differences in the various worlds are very minor (opportunity lost to add massive replay value by having unique features on each map), the Diplomatic AI is inept, there is no story beyond the intro movie, and there are no Colony Governors (so it can become quite micro intensive on large maps).\n\nI'll play it plenty regardless because I enjoy 4X so much. But for those that have limited gaming budgets, the game represents appalling value for money.\n\nThis game really is just a reskin of Civ V and feature wise we've gone backwards from a Brave New World. We'll need at least one expansion just to get to Brave New World level. There really is no excuse for this given it's the same engine.\n\nSecondly on Steam the game cost is US$90 in my region (Australia) with the price set by the publisher. Yes you can go elsewhere (e.g. OzGameShop) and pay about US$50, which is what any avid gamer would do, but more than a few casual gamers will spend US$90.\n\nYou put those factors together and it's clear that management at Firaxis are focusing on milking the cow.  I would rather they had a vision for the future of 4X games and led the pack. Ironically, a focus on leading the pack is likely the better long-term business strategy anyway.\n\nAs Devildog said in the eXplorminate review:\n\n"despite many cries of frustration from fans and well documented examples, leads me to believe that they’re both incapable and unaware of how much we hate these things."\n\nhttp://www.explorminate.com/civilization-beyond-earth-review/\n\nUnless you are a huge fan of 4X games and Civ, I do not recommend this game.

I also consider myself a fairly experienced turn-based strategy player with hundreds of hours on record. Coming from almost 400 h. of playtime with Civilization V, I was really excited and looking forward to this new entry to the legendary franchise. I even pre-ordered the title with the hope to spend several hundred hours immersed into the game. I'm also a huge fan of sci-fi setting for videogames as it usually offer more room for innovation and interesting game mechanics.\n\nSo, what's my take on Civ BE? I think it's a solid stand-alone turn based 4x strategy game. And I want to emphasize the word "solid" here. It's not great, it's not innovative, it's not complex... It's just solid. To put this in a different way - if you are new to this type of games, you should probably give it a try. On the other hand, If you're long-time Civilization player, you should pass on this one, at least in its current state.\n\nWhat are my main points of concern with this title? What can be improved and why I believe this game is unfortunately inferior in many ways to its predecessor (Civ V + all expansions)?\n\n1. Lack of content, polish and personality  (i.e. units, cut-scenes, factions and their back story, )\n\nThe game feels empty and tiny when compared to Civ V. I've put around 30 hours into it and I can confidently say that I'm bored and won't be coming back anytime soon. There's not much stuff to keep me entertained for a long period of time. It lacks replay value because you will always end up in identical scenarios no matter how differently you want to approach the gameplay.\nIt's been mentioned multiple times, but the lack of personality behind the so-called factions / sponsors is surprising. The only significant difference between them is their "special ability" bonus, and that's it. There's no back story, lack of variety in buildings / units, nothing that you can feel identified with or attached to. They feel empty and meaningless and become annoying after just a few hours of gameplay.\n\nAre you expecting to see a cut-scene video after completing a huge landmark project (50+ turns) to get one step closer to victory? Nope.\nBut there's surely a small animated piece when you finish building wonders, right? No, you're out of luck here as well...\nWell,  there must be a small video when you finally defeat your foes by making first contact with an ancient alien civilization that no one has ever seen before!? Sorry, but no.\n\nEverything in this department feels extremely unfinished and rushed out of the door.\n\nThe game lacks immersion elements and starts feeling generic very quickly. There are two possibilities: either Firaxis consciously made the decision of removing / "simplifying" these components for the sake of saving development time / money. Or alternatively, they will sell it at some point in form of DLC. Or likely both... Which would be kinda sad.\n\n2. Let's just say that the UI isn't great.\n\nI'm not sure who took the decision to make the UI as minimalist as possible, but in my opinion it didn't turn out well. Let me list a few reasons here:\n\n- Tech tree / City view feel unfinished and outright inferior to Civ V. All icons look the same to me. There's no color icons which make it hard to distinguish between different technologies / buildings. After 30+ hours of gameplay, if you showed me any icon from the game (either from tech tree or city view) I wouldn't be able to recognize any of them.\n\n- Omission of basic info, like: which building you just finished building in your city (HELLO Firaxis!?), lack of strategic view, lack of full list of cities / units / trade routes under your control,\n\n- Victory progress for different players is extremely difficult to understand and follow because this information is not presented in a visual way.\n\n- There's no possibility to know how to get, say an "Emancipation" victory beforehand. You don't know what technologies you need to research, what buildings you need to build or what you have to do with these buildings once you finish building them.\n\n3. RIP World Wonders.\n\nI love building World Wonders in Civ V. It just feels so satisfying and rewarding every single time. Many players base their entire strategy around building Wonders. The whole experience is so "Civ - like" and different in every game.\n\n"Beyond Earth" removes this experience all together. We still technically have them, they just feel meaningless, weak, empty and lacking any significant impact on gameplay. You can't tell a World Wonder apart from a normal building. There's a short pop-up with something I wouldn't dare to call "animated piece" that you will instantly forget. Not sure why Firaxis decided to go this route, I guess they couldn't figure out a good way to integrate World Wonders within a deeply futuristic setting. It's extremely disappointing though.\n\n4. The AI has identical issues to Civ V, maybe worse.\n\nEverything about AI feels like Civ V all over again, just in a bad way. It's as dumb as ever, all the meaningless diplomatic choices, weird decision making, cheating on higher difficulties - it's all there. Even dialog lines are the same, just feels a bit less meaningful due to lack of personality in each of the faction's leaders. Combine this with the fact that every game you play against the same exact factions (due to lack of variety), it becomes old / boring very quickly.\n\n5. Quests are boring.\n\nThe quest system is kind of broken. It doesn't matter which faction you play, or which affinity you choose, be sure you will get the same exact "grindy" quests, no matter what. After a few hours, you will start skipping through them without reading or caring about them. On paper, quest system should add a layer of variety and deepen your engagement with the game, but it just fails completely to do so.\n\nIt's not all bad news though. This game has potential and I'm sure with some patching love and a few expansions it will become better, maybe even great. It's just that I personally feel disappointed and was expecting way more out of this new entry to the Civ franchise.\n\nSome things I like about the game:\n\n1. The new orbital layer is promising. It has interesting potential and adds a different dimension of strategy and potential development to the game. But as with several other features, it feels a bit unfinished / unpolished.\n\n2. Overall I like the affinity system as it offers three distinct paths to your development. But again, as with orbital layer I don't think it's fully explored yet.\n\n3. The Aliens have meaningful impact on the early gameplay and definitely play out better than their barbarian counterparts in Civ V. That said, they become irrelevant pretty quickly as their Level doesn't scale according to your development. Unlike barbarians (Barbarian marine anyone?), Aliens become obsolete after you get your first affinity upgrades.\n\nSumming up, Civ BE is a solid stand alone 4x strategy game IF we don't compare it to its predecessors. If you are new to this genre and like sci-fi setting, I could recommend it.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to any Civilization fan / player nor someone experienced with this type of games. Just continue playing Civ V and wait until patches / expansions come out. Firaxis has some history of making great expansions and improving their games. I hope they will do the same with Civilization Beyond Earth.\n\nFinal review score: 6/10","October 27, 2014","false","76.3"," 583 of 751 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","583","751","0","2"

I'm contantly asking myself 'why should i care?' and the mid-to-end game even has me clicking next turn without making any moves, something that would never happen in the previous Civ games.\n\nI wonder if 2K/Firaxis realise the shortcomings of this game have nothing to do with polish (it looks good!), ui (still quite allright), the concept (it's Civ!) or the mechanics but rather with it just being uninteresting.  I do not feel as if i'm a representative of (a faction of) planet earth fighting for a new place among the stars to continue human civilization.\nThe ingredients are there but it just doesn't come together.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dangry/recommended/65980/","dangry","Mostly Harmless :/","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dangry/","678 products in account","With Rising Tide's release it's back to being hard to recommend Beyond Earth again. The winter update improved the base game a fair bit and made it more enjoyable to play but then Rising Tide came out and kind of threw a lot of that progress away, and introduced a mix of good and bad ideas that will require further balancing. Rising Tide has significantly changed certain aspects of the game for the better--water settling/tile development is huge--but the balance is completely out of whack again.\n\nThe pacing of the early game is completely random now. With the amount of resource pods and expedition sites whoever finds the most can boost a crazy amount in the first 50-100 turns. Single or multiplayer, you're going to want to spam explorers and rush anything (3 Prosperity virtues, 2 levels of Supremacy, and a building quest) that can net you more expedition pods early-game because of the insane boosts to culture, production, science and energy they provide. On top of that there's the possibility of discovering Relics in each expedition which in turn can be spent to further boost culture, science, food, and production or saved to be used for unlocking Relic Buildings and Wonders, some of which are incredibly broken. Internal trade routes are back to being broken, especially with Al Falah and a specific Relic Building, and certain Relic Wonders are completely broken.\n\nHybrid Affinities are kind of a dead end, you still have to chase a specific Affinity to get its victory wonder. Even though the Affinity victory condition has been pushed to Affinity level 15 (up from 13), games are roughly still 200-300 turns long. Beyond Earth games are 200 turns shorter than Civ V on average. There's an early-game, a mid-game, and then the game is done because someone trots out a victory wonder. There's no late-game in Beyond Earth where late-game techs, wonders and units get a chance to shine. So Rising Tide has changed how you play the early-game you're ultimately still playing the same limited "end" game. Build some wonders and turtle or go for domination.\n\nThe way Affinity experience is acquired now is a mess. Previously neutral tech branches that everyone will research over the course of a match now provide multiple Affinity experience. You will easily end a game with multiple levels in multiple Affinities without even trying. It's even possible to get every Affinity leveled up to 18 before the 300th turn and basically have access to every unique Affinity/Hybrid unit in the game outside of what you've locked your generic units into being. It's also worth noting that not every unit in the game gets a Hybrid Affinity variation and there's no Hybrid Affinity City art. Cities and armies in Rising Tide can be a hodge podge of every Affinity and Hybrid. In Beyond Earth vanilla you had to focus on an Affinity and chase those techs in order to be able to hit your victory condition in time, now everyone just sort of has access to everything. Going Harmony or Supremacy and expanding aggressively early? Don't worry, now you'll likely be able to build a Gene Garden (lvl 2 Purity health generating building), without even trying you'll likely have the necessary Affinity levels. Health has gone from being a constraint to a basically a non-issue with everyone having access to everything in conjunction with the new orbital unit that you can access fairly early on top of all of the health wonders in the game now.\n\nThere's simply so much in Rising Tide that needs to be addressed with later balancing patches. Certain Factions Unique Advantages are insanely powerful if not outright broken, while others border on being useless. The warscore and peace negotiations are kind of busted as of now. The old diplomatic system was completely gutted from the game but in some respects it was better than the new diplomatic system that was added in Rising Tide. There are more kinds of aliens but they are less of a threat. The list goes on and on. While it's nice that Firaxis have committed to doing balance patches, it would have been better if they did a public beta first. Discover all of these balancing issues that their own internal testing somehow missed and address them before releasing the expansion. Instead it's another mess, further frittering away what goodwill people may have left.\n\nI would recommend Civ V Complete or Endless Legend over the current iteration of Beyond Earth and Rising Tide. Later patches may change this, again, but for now Beyond Earth is a mess.","October 22, 2015","false","469.7"," 175 of 208 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","175","208","5","3"

This review is also available in video format below for your convenience.)\n\nIt's been fifteen long years since Sid Meier has given us the opportunity to conquer the cosmos with Alpha Centauri.\n\nSet 600 years into the future where the earth is on the brink of destruction. The nations of the world send some of their best and brightest into space as a last ditch effort to colonize another planet. With an uncharacteristically utopian view on things, many nations have combined and cooperate with one another. For instance, Australia and Polynesia merge to become Polystralia, America, Canada, and Mexico become the American Reclamation Corporation and the entire continent of Africa becomes the African Union to name a few examples. These alliances take to the stars to begin anew on the wild frontier of alien planets.\n\nUtilizing the core of Civ V, Beyond Earth is a turn-based strategy featuring hexagonal tiles on a grid without unit stacking. The terrain offers benefits in the same way its predecessor does. Mountains are impassible, hills provide extra defense, and rivers are difficult to cross. You start the game by picking a plot of land to build your first city, while each of the tiles offer different bonuses, such as food, production and energy.\n\nAfter founding your first city, you’re able to explore the alien landscape, searching for resource pods and artifacts for your explorers to excavate. It's here that one of the games’ first alterations comes to light: quests. Players will be given quests to complete and choices to make that help dictate the evolution of your civilization as well as providing additional buffs and bonuses.\n\nDiplomacy is alive and well among these new colonies allowing you to trade with other civilizations, and you have access to all the diplomacy options seen in Civilization V, as well as the inclusion of favors which can be cashed in on later trades.\n\nThe Alien life-forms are the game’s equivalent to barbarians albeit a lot stronger. They are however not as aggressive and will generally leave your units alone unless they happen to path towards a tile you’re occupying. This changes throughout the game though based on the Affinities you choose. Also if you go out of your way to attack an Alien or approach a nest, they will become hostile for a few turns. Certain bonuses and abilities make it worthwhile to actively exterminate these pests but later in the game that can become a diplomatic blunder with civilizations that are more sympathetic to alien life.\n\nThe Affinities are by far the most unique feature to Beyond Earth. They allow you to specialize your Civilization with a specific ideology. Players who follow the Harmony path will have players synthesizing with their new planet and the alien life that inhabits it. Supremacy takes a page from the cyberpunk playbook with a focus on augmentation and improvement through technology. Finally there is the path of Purity, which focuses on retaining humanity and destroying anything that threatens that. Not only do these Affinities grant you special units and buildings, but they also change the way that other civilizations react with you. Think of it as being on-par with Religion or Political Doctrines from other Civilization games.\n\nThe technology tree is also non-linear in this, allowing for you to choose any number of paths which allows for a lot of variety between different civilizations. It did seem like there were a few very specialized paths that were far superior to the others though, as you generally want to amass whatever Affinity you’re going with quickly, as it will immediately upgrade your troops without the need to do things manually like the past Civ games.\n\nThis is where the differences in Beyond Earth end though, as everything else is simply re-skinned from Civilization V. Happiness has been replaced with Health, Gold has been replaced with Energy, while food and production remain the same. There are also a lot of things that don’t really make sense, such as having the technology to colonize another planet without having anyway to unveil the map. You’ll uncover the mystery planet much the same way as your primitive warriors will back in 4000BC like past Civ games. The tech-tree also has some inconsistencies such as having to research Physics, Chemistry and Computers despite the game taking place in the year 2600.\n\nAll of the units function the same way as well, with the majority of units being melee along with a few ranged, naval, and air units. The fact that naval technology is used at all is a bit strange with hovercrafts only being unlocked late-game. One would think the majority of units would be flying in a time like this while the few air units in the game function exactly the same way as jets from previous Civilization games.\n\nThe world in general feels exactly like past civ games, with no option to move on to other planets and what’s worse is that the game seems to have lost any charm or personality that was apparent in other Civ games. Leaders like Genghis Khan, Gandhi, and Montezuma are all replaced with overly polite, boring politicians. None of the civilizations displays any semblance of personality or is anyway memorable. Having a few alien civilizations would have been a great way to add some personality to the proceedings.\n\nEspionage has also been completely buffed and is now nearly game breaking, as spies are now able to stage coup-d’états and take over other civilization’s capitals without any resistance. Should you take a capital, the AI civilizations barely seem to react and will still not declare war on you.\n\nIf you were expecting this installment to not have bugs, you would be sadly mistaken as the multiplayer is still barely playable. You’ll constantly be faced with disconnects and crashes where you’ll have to re-host the game. You could of course continue the game and have your friends rejoin you, but that will be at the cost of the AI temporarily taking over their civilization and rerouting all production, scientific research and virtues. Even when playing single player, I faced the odd random crash to my desktop which had me frequently reloading auto-saves.\n\nThe game also feels a lot more tedious when compared to past Civilization games as you'll have to babysit trade convoys and orbital units every few turns.\n\nUltimately, Civilization: Beyond Earth feels like a mod or scenario for Civilization V. It doesn’t stray away or do anything innovative enough to warrant being a standalone title. While the non-linear tech tree, quests and affinity system are welcomed, they allow for some unbalanced combinations. Beyond Earth is also missing many features from past Civ games such as Corporations, Religion, and Great People. Having more meaningful interactions with aliens would have been welcomed as well but the game feels like it was inspired by Sid Meier watching the movie Starship Troopers.\n\nBeyond Earth isn’t a bad game; it just fails to meet the standard set by past Civilization titles and can feel a lot more tedious in the process. We suspect that like its predecessor, Beyond Earth will improve immensely with the addition of expansions but as of now, any cravings you have for space exploration might be better satiated by taking a trip to the theater to see Interstellar.\n\nThis review is also available in video format:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ZDLDyqckq7o\n\nPros:\n+ Affinity system welcomed\n+ Has that one more turn syndrome\n+ Great Soundtrack\n\n+/- Could improve with DLC\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer is buggy and almost unplayable\n- Lacks originality, feels like re-skinned Civ V\n- Doesn't have much personality or charm\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","November 17, 2014","false","77.2"," 462 of 602 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","462","602","0","22"

Unfortunately, it feels like an inferior Civ 5. Cities, units, combat, and geography are mostly the same. That's fine, but what's not similar to Civ 5 is typically worse.\n\nIMO, the tech web is a mess. I understand that it's now non-linear, and you can't research everything, but it's so clunky and disorganized that I often feel like I'm just researching random things that I don't even need. I see something I want but it's 5 techs away, with 100+ turns of research required, so instead I research some smaller thing that doesn't help me at all.\n\nAliens replaced barbarians, but again it feels clunky. Befriending them seems great, but more than anything they simply get in your way. They keep spawning infinitely, and so if you don't kill them off they overrun your space, especially on a small space like an island. If you do kill them, then AI players hate you, just for defending your space. Civ is a game about expanding and placing cities, is it not? Barbarians worked in 5 because they were annoying but rewarding too, whereas aliens are annoying, take up space, and get you denounced by AI players.\n\nThe interface is crap as well IMO. It's designed in a "futuristic" style, but it just comes off as busy and user-unfriendly. Hell, for the first two games I couldn't even find the Trade Overview screen because they did such a good job of hiding things instead of having everything displayed at once (but still cleanly) like in Civ 5. Some things are too big or too small, and like I said, things aren't clear, they're hidden for some reason.\n\nAltogether, it just feels like a less interesting Civ 5 in space. For me, I can sink hours at a time into a Civ 5 game because the tech race is so fun, competing for wonders and grabbing that good area before your neighbour does. In BE, there's no tech race, because everyone does their own thing, except on top of that, tech in BE seems quite disorganized. Instead of racing players for space, you're racing annoying aliens that don't stop spawning, and also get you known as the BE equivalent of a "warmonger". Not enjoyable.\n\nTLDR, if you haven't played Civ 5 (with the DLCs), then do that instead. If you have, well maybe you should just play it more. That's what I've been doing.","December 29, 2014","false","16.0"," 376 of 486 people (77%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","77","376","486","25","0"

Civ 5 is currently the most popular game in the franchise, and as such, I'll be comparing Civ BE to it.\n\nPros of Beyond Earth:\n*Building wide (many cities) is viable, and even preferable. "Health" replaces happiness as the population limiter that was in Civ 5, and it is much much easier to deal with. For starters, health is more of a spectrum. There are bonuses to having extra health while the penalties for negative health are less intense and more gradual. I've always enjoyed being very expansionistic in the Civ games and was disappointed that this is less accessible in Civ 5. If you enjoy playing wide, ruling a vast empire, and have a thing for manifest destiny, Beyond Earth will certainly fill that more than Civ 5.\n\n*Combat and tactics is the best it's ever been. Civ 5 made great progress in removing the ability to stack units, but my biggest complaint about it is the lack of unit diversity until around the WWII era. In Beyond Earth, you can get your infantry, cavalry, ranged, siege, air, naval, submarines, etc. all relatively early in the game. In Civ 5, you're stuck with only about 3 unit types for over half the game. There are also several special units for each "affinity." Each unit can be upgraded with different promotions selected as you level up your affinity. There are also sattellites that can be launched. These orbital units range from simple solar collectors that give you extra energy (gold) on the affected tiles to lasers that can bombard cities from space.\n\n*Affinities. These are essentially the ideologies Civ 5 added in it's Brave New World expansion. You have one of three affinities to choose from which will dictate how humanity will progress through the game. Purity focuses on perfecting the human form. Supremacy merges humanity with machines. Harmony merges humanity with alien life. Your affinity can affect win conditions, unit types, available buildings/wonders, and diplomatic relations. It also functions as a great narrative device.\n\n*Tech web. In Civ 5, you start in the ancient era and research technologies through a tree. In Civ BE, you start in the near future at the center of a tech web. The end-game techs are on the outside of the web, but you still choose which techs you want and when you want them. Though this can be a lot to take in, this does allow much flexibility in the way you build your empire.\n\nYou may have more things you like, but these are the large selling points for me.\n\n\nCons of Beyond Earth.\n*Few victory conditions. You have a choice of domination, contact (similar to science victory), or an affinity-based victory. Though I personally go for domination victories regardless of which Civ game I'm playing, it is nice to have more options. Civ 5 allows you domination, cultural, science, and diplomatic victories, all of which have a fairly deep way of obtaining them. Beyond Earth basically has a domination victory and two separate science victories. (Your affinity victory will be largely dictated by your science and production.)\n\n*Culture is shallow and there is no religion. Religion was added to Civ 5 via the Gods and Kings expansion. Though there was no religious victory, religion could influence your civilization greatly and influence diplomatic relations as well. Culture exists in the way of virtue trees, similar to the social policies of Civ 5. These virtues are well-worth gunning for which does add value to culture, but there is no way to "win" with culture. Focusing on culture would allow more virtues thus resulting in a stronger civ, but again, you can't win on culture alone anymore.\n\n*Civ leaders are relatively stale. The passive buffs to each civ are interesting, but the personalities of each leader are pretty dry. Honestly, I think the biggest reason for this is that they are not representations of historical figures. Rather, the leaders are entirely fictious. This makes it more difficult to develop and flesh out an impressive persona. I find the leaders and their dialogue to be just as animated and dramatic as previous games in the series. The difference, however, is that when meeting Genghis Khan in a Civ 5 game, I have historical knowledge to draw on and it helps bring the character to life. Meeting the leader of Space Africa, I only have what I experience in-game.\n\nI've also left out several aspects of Beyond Earth that others may enjoy. The Pros listed are simply the reasons that bring me back to BE. The game gets a bad rep, but there are things about Civ 5 that make me want to play it, and there are other things about Civ BE that make me want to play that instead.\n\nAt the end of the day, Civ 5 is the deeper game. There are more victory types allowing in different ways to focus on building your empire. All yields are critical in Beyond Earth, but not all of them result in victory. There are more leaders to choose from in Civ 5 as well. Despite this, I keep finding myself coming back to Beyond Earth. Both games feel different to me, and I highly enjoy playing them both. I personally have always loved having a massive army and empire while fighting wars with other superpowers. That experience is a rarity in Civ 5 whereas it's a promise in Beyond Earth.\n\nI've left any mention of the Rising Tide DLC out of the review as I have not had ample time to play it. These are all my assertions on the base game. If you like civ, outer space, and are looking for a new experience then give Beyond Earth a shot. It's worth the price tag, but sales never hurt either. If you want someone to play with, go ahead and add me and I'd love to join in!","May 6","true","114.0"," 124 of 141 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","124","141","3","2"

If you absolutely love Sci-Fi world building, then you will have fun with this.  This game fails at anything beyond that.\n\nBalance:\n-You are given the illusion of "choices" but there is generally one best path to take with very minor differences in what technology, virtues, affinities, and units you need.  Taking any other route is impractical even in a friendly game.\n\n-Tech Web is full of requirements, not options.\n\n-Lack of tailor-made units:  You get 2 promotion options for individual units no matter how high the unit gets in veterancy.  One is healing damage (which increases the amount healed based on veterancy) and the other is a 10% combat boost.  Any other additional abilities are applied to all units of that type based on affinity.\n\nReplayability:\n-Affinity-exclusive units are only minorly unique.  All other units that change based on affinity are more for aesthetics than strategic prowess.  The statistical differences are below minor and almost not even worth mentioning.\n\n-Stations (City-States):  One station will always want to spawn near you around the same point in the game.  You are always guaranteed a station to work with.\n\n-Civilizations' abilities have minor impacts.  You will notice the differences in civilization abilities for the very early part of the game,  but, as with other aspects of the game, these differences fall off not long after.\n\n-No Unique Units/Buildings:  It doesn't matter what nation you play as.  It is more simple to just identify the different civilizations as "red team" or "blue team" and so on.  Affinity-exculsive units try to pick up this slack, but fail at it due to the game's static nature.\n\n-Absence of luxury resources further takes away from a civilization's unique role on the game board.\n\n-Replayability is practically non-existant.\n\n\nBeyond Earth is it's own machine that follows it's own set of rules.  The player is just one cog in that machine.  If these rules were not made and enforced, the game's balance would fall into shambles because there are very few ways to succeed and stay on the same level of the other civilizations on the board.  It lacks the true freedom of choices that are provided in Civilization V.

I was addicted to CIV I as a kid, played CIV II A LOT when I was in college, then Civilization Call to Power which was also pretty good. I did play CIV III a bit, but went quickly on to CIV IV which I played for years and years and years, with all official expansions, and installed and played A LOT of community mods, some of which were absolutely fantastic (thinking of Fall from Heaven II and Caveman2Cosmos and sooooo many others). I played CIV IV Colonization and throughly enjoyed it as well in its relative simplicity.\n\nThe Civilization series altogether are the games I played the most in my life. Every new version that would come out was better than the previous, more complex, more accurate, more fun.\n\nThen came this trend of the past few years to simplify games, make them more mobile oriented, more mass consumable by people who play for 20 minutes then buy the next game.\n\nThis trend is extremely noticeable in CIV V and also on CIVBE. Even the expansions of these games only bring back concepts that were included in previous versions of CIV, sometimes even on the basic "vanilla" ones. There is almost nothing new in these two games with few exceptions (like the tech tree in CIVBE, which is still only tiny when compared to CIV IV with Caveman2Cosmos mod)\n\nI bought CIV V Complete and played some hours, then didn't even bother and only tried CIVBE during a free weekend, and I say with my decades of experience with Civilization: go play CIV IV, install all mods, try them. Then you will never even want to look at the newer versions again.\n\nCall me old fashioned... but I do wish Civilization would go back to its roots of being among the most accurate and complex games around.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tykrane/recommended/65980/","tykrane","Poochie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tykrane/","51 products in account","I haven't reviewed anything before, but considering my love for the Civ series, I felt like I should leave some feedback.\n\nYes, you're aware that the game is just a repackaged Civ 5. But the biggest change I've noticed is its loss of charm. A lot of the enjoyment from the past Civilization series came from its conglomeration of historically-prominent faces, all brought together to rescript human history. There was always something charming about each playthrough, whether it be Ethiopia seizing Seattle and Boston from the United States, the Iroquois researching flight before the 1500's, or Alexander's typical crash and burn just a few turns before reaching diplomatic victory.\n\nBeyond Earth is a different story, and it's one that I've had a hard time getting myself to care about. Although the premise of "a thousand years into the future" itself may be a much tougher sell than literal human history, what has ultimately pushed me away has been its lack of character building and dialogue. Yes, I understand how ridiculous that sounds, but outside of the economic/skill perks of each faction, there hasn't really been much of a discernable personality from leader-to-leader, and as a result, to quote every girl I've ever asked out: "I'm just not that interested." About halfway through each of my four playthroughs, I reached a point where, outside of winning just for competition's sake, I didn't really care too much about the outcome. There's no Gandhi to hate, no Queen Elizabeth to fend off until you research submarines. From time to time I did have some interesting interactions with the AI, one instance being when the nearly-cyborg Slavik leader stole my capital with a spy, but ultimately there isn't much happening between myself and the leaders I know little-to-nothing about to fuel those "one... more... turn..." feelings from the previous games. "Kavitha of the Kavithan Protectorate has denounced me?" u wot m8? That doesn't have much significance to me. It's like saying "Leaderperson of the Red Team has denounced you." There may be some backstory to each of these factions/sponsors/leaders, but after 40 hours of play, it hasn't really made itself evident, and the most I can say about each leader is along the lines of "yeah, he's the African guy, he grows headphones throughout the game, and he hates it when I kill aliens."\n\nAnd continuing on that, it may be my lack of "affinity" for science fiction, but most of the time, I don't understand what I am researching, or what I am building in each city. I understand the effects, but outside of +7 science, I don't know what the hell a "Cynosure" is, and I don't care enough to find out. It's just not the same as building the Eiffel Tower, but that's not entirely the game's fault. What is the game's fault is that there just isn't much new to gameplay mechanics, and a lot of the issues of the previous games still linger, including:\n\n- Confusing/unintentionally nonsensical AI interaction: In the past games, you'd get some flak from other leaders for settling too rapidly or too close to their borders, but it seems to have amplified in this game, to a pretty unenjoyable degree. in 3 out of 4 playthroughs (the fourth being a 1v1 duel), I immediately received requests to stop settling in "lands considered our own" after settling only my second city. Didn't matter in what direction or where I settled, it happened every time. The bipolar one-turn shifts from "friendly" to "denouncing" still happen as well, still often for reasons unexplained, still leaving me wanting, at the very least, some sort of explanation.\n\n- "Difficulty": The "difficulty" problem seems to still be there, as playing on harder difficulties doesn't actually make the AI smarter, but just gives them boosts to offset their stupidity. I remember feeling a little disappointed after winning my first game on Deity, not just because of that "Well, now what?" feeling, but because I didn't feel like I had beat a better opponent, just an opponent with more stuff. You know those ghost trials on Mario Kart? You know how every one of these games is called Sid Meier's Blah Blah Blah? Maybe it's too difficult to make AI smarter, but it'd at least be cool if we could actually try to beat Sid Meier's score in his own game, or have an extra element of competitiveness.\n\n- Annoyances as opposed to challenges: Still somewhat in the same vein as "difficulty," a lot of the aspects of the game which are supposed to be "challenges" are just kind of more time-sucking annoyances. For example, about 150 turns into my most recent game, a 1v1 duel, I moved my entire military into my opponent's territory to take over for domination. As a sort of penalty, the game sprouts up a couple alien nests, forcing me to spend another few turns to change production so siege worms (and, no, they weren't spy sieges) don't destroy the resources I need. "Quests" have been introduced to the series, and while some of them have been beneficial, they fall into two categories: click one of two boxes and see what you get, or take 30 turns doing this-this-this-and-this just to find out that you get *this*. And although aliens pose a more dynamic challenge than the classic barbarian, after your empire has reached a certain size, doing things like defending trade routes is still just a time suck, one that isn't worth the loss of probably 1-3 trade vessels over the course of the game.\n\n- Multiplayer/Online: I haven't played an online match yet. Because I haven't been able to find one, and when I have, I am either kicked before joining or receive an "error when joining session". The general point here is that Civ has never had proper multiplayer support, something that would have made a new installment of Civ much more intriguing. I see so much potential with Civ online - the random people who join games can often turn out to be much more enjoyable than your standard random gamers, and facing 5-11 people with the same basic start is a much better challenge than trying to beat a stupid computer compensated with handicaps. It might be too early to judge on this yet, but just the fact that I have to go into multiplayer and find a room created by a host, and not on a dedicated server, is enough to tell me that the problem hasn't been fixed yet.\n\nThat's not to say that, on it's own, it isn't a solid game. Anything built on the mechanics of Civ 5 should be pretty enjoyable. But as the next step in the Civilization series, I am disappointed. And with the question coming down to "do you recommend this game?", I'd have to say no. I would (and will) recommend Civ 3-5 wholeheartedly as some of the best games ever, but as far as I'm concerned, this should be considered more of a $10 expansion to unlock after completing a science victory in Civ 5. In the meantime, I'll be waiting for a true Civ 6, and hopefully you and I will be able to play a full game online without the damn thing crashing.","October 25, 2014","false","42.1"," 925 of 1,298 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","925","1","0","25"

Nah....\n\nHonestly finishing my playthrough in Civ:BE has to be one of the most bland experiences i had in a civilization game. It was mostly just "city building" and getting to know the new techs etc, while searching through the ugly UI for infos.\nAh yes, and clicking tedious trading routes again and again, as well as always the same stupid diplomatic null messages of some very generic leaders, which were already annoying in CiV.\n\nI had no war or any great interaction with other civs (except against those pesky aliens, which always pop up if you leave some empty space - which is unavoidable on the "borders"), the AI just kept begging me, mixed with the occasional dennounciation (hopping from friendly to guarded back and forth).\n\nEmpire building is limited due to the "health" factor (was happiness in CiV), which annoyingly begins to deteriorate already after your second or at least third city.\n\nMuch is similiar to CiV, but with a worse overview for the player or/and less variety.\nFor example you only have around five standard unit types, mixed in with up to three or so special types for your kind of specialization. The units also get small extras for your "affinity", blocking the other types at the same time.\nThe affinity specialisation also contributes a big part to which victory condition you can fulfill.\nSadly these conditions (as is much of the whole techtree) are hard to differentiate and just have a bad overview imo.\n\nThis is especially sad since the affinity, combined with the quest system and the possibility/requirement to focus your tech research are the main new gameplay elements imo. There also is a new orbit view in which you can use different satellites, but i honestly found them mostly useless.\n\nSo, in the end, you have a CiV 1.5 in space, with a terrible UI and interface, a few new elements, many old ones (sadly also the annoying ones).. and - for me at least - much tedious work, instead of fun gameplay.\nWill keep watching this game (especially if the modders, once again, can rescue a game), but can´t see me playing it again in the near future.. which really is a shame for a civilisation game.\n\nps: yes, and the ai movement still sucks too...\n","October 27, 2014","false","12.6"," 484 of 675 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","484","675","2","13"

Here are my opinions after 78 hours.\n\nThe main thing I have against this game is it'd linearity despite its attempts to spread the tech tree and offer more varied victory conditions. Its all basically research a few things to improve research generation, then rush 2-3 techs into your main vicory based techs to start building a tedious waiting-game based wonder. This may have been balanced if the AI was made to attack when you're about to win, but it just placidly sits by and lets you win without a struggle, even as global announcements state that "X has built Y!!!", they dont react.\n\nTrade based research generation is very unbalanced, especially in harder modes where the AI has tech boosts. All I had to do was build as many cities and trade vessels as I could and not build too close to my opponents. There is a basic building that makes your trade vessels immune to aliens, allowing you to have far too much energy ($) & research. The negative health (sort of like civ 5 happiness) effects of spamming cities is negligible compared to the benefits of more trade vessels, and once tech gets good enough, you just buy all the buildings with your hoard of money to abruptly fix all health issues.\n\nI won on Apollo -the hardest difficulty- on my first try of it, without anyone declaring war on me.\n\nThe game does suffer from not having the bulk of human history as flavour, but that may have been remedied by adding more "sponsor" based flavouring, the logs and encyclopedia were actually very well written, but the game just does'nt present it in either an easily legible or interesting fashion.\n\nI'll check it out after a patch because based on Firaxis' prior games, I know they can make this work, but as it currently stands, I cannot readily reccomend this game. -Nov 13 2014","November 13, 2014","false","78.4"," 238 of 321 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","238","321","0","0"

It wouldn't run on my desktop for the first 2 months (it ran great on my laptop, but it doesn't have the power to have the graphics turned up), until they released the major patch a couple weeks ago. But the major patch didn't really fix any of the issues I had with it except making it take a lot longer to crash.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is that it's the Civ V engine, but while Civ V had an amazingly simple but effective interface, BE has a neutered, confusing UI, and beyond that, it's missing a lot of the informational tools from Civ V. Like, all of them. There are no advisors, there's no way to see how you're doing compared to the other players beyond score, which is a fairly useless metric. Trade Routes are completely jumbled, with no way to sort them properly to see which ones are best. And the thought of being able to combine the various starting benefits to make your own civ turns out to be much better in theory than in fact. I have no idea what civ I am in any given game, because I really don't care. The benefits don't really change the way you play the game at all.\n\nOn top of all of that, some of the stuff that Civ V didn't do as well as Civ IV, like diplomacy, is even worse in BE. Most of the time, I forget entirely about the other Civs. There aren't any "luxury resources" to give you some motivatoin to trade with them. I have no idea what Favors might be able to do, but I've never been able to get one anyway, so that doesn't matter. Wonders are utterly useless. Not only are most of them no better than a regular building, but you also have to research a tech that does nothing but let you build the wonder in order to do so.\n\nThe one thing they did that's way better is improve the espionage stuff.

I love science-fiction and all things robots, genetic manipulation and space. I'm a true disciple of strategy games and especially of the turn-based variety and quite the veteran of many, many rounds of “Alpha Centauri”. I've been very hyped\n\nThis said as introduction I'd first like to say that I like the design of Civilization 5, although I consider it a seriously dumbed down game, up to the point of it being the mentally handicapped little brother of its predecessors. But is it fair to use such harsh words? Maybe I should come to peace with the fact that Civilization 5 just isn't the same as the other games and in certain ways it did improve. Despite being dumbed down it isn't an easy game to master when you face human players that operate with the same meta as you. So it didn't get boring too quickly.\n\n“Beyond Earth” kept the best of Civilization 5 (nonstackable units are debatable) and added a whole bucket of goodness to create a truly amazing game with an atmosphere that puts your mind at peace, while focused on the task that lies before you: survive on an alien world.\n\nI love the addition of the affinity system which visually expresses the philosophy you embrace, which means you either play as Col. Quaritch, Robocop or Ray Kurzweil. Additionally you can select virtues divided into might, prosperity, knowledge and industry (basically a different sort of social policy system, but improved as it rewards both beelining as well as grabbing many boni from one section, or combining sections as well as tiers... and so on). I'd wish for “hybrid” affinities that let you embrace 2 main affinities for special units, but I don't see the developers doing that anytime soon. One can still embrace 2 affinities, in rare cases it even pays off (for example the Prime version of the Aegis mech of the purity affinity [Humanity ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!] needs 10 purity affinity and 3 supremacy affinity [resistance is futile, puny meatbags!]. I found out that for units it pays to have up to 5 affinity levels of a secondary affinity, however affinity influences much more than just units, so I'll have to experiment around a bit. I for one enjoyed going Purity as my primary affinity and Supremacy as my secondary affinity in my first game.\n\nBeyond Earth added quests, better neutral city state mechanics (called stations now), better barbarian mechanics (b-but aliens aren't barbarians! They are different! Yes they are. This makes it better, dear reader. That's what I talk about!), better victory conditions and it feels much better writing possible future history, instead of reenacting history in the most ludicrous ways (nuking ancient Egyptians as Gandhi!). AND SPACE COLONIZATION! Is that nothing?\n\nLast but not least you select your colonists' loadout: that is sponsor, equipment and type of colonists. This is a very great addition as it lets you customize your starting conditions in a more unique way than in Civ 5, adds the feeling that you have more control and ownership over your colonists and allows different strategies instead. We'll see more than a couple of viable strategies that will be quite different to each others. A bit irritating is the fact that the sponsors do not include a Northern European race. Sure, Russians are Caucasoid, but so are some North Africans strictly speaking. I'll play the French for now. What I am missing is a member of one of the Nordic, Anglo Saxon and Germanic race. It is quite likely they'll send people to space, although the developer might have wanted to show us a grimdark future where mass immigration replaced the European people almost completely with the grand daughter of Marine Le Pen leading the last Front National enclave of the French into space. Who knows.\n\nApart from this the personalities and background of the sponsors don't appeal to me. They are quite bland persons. That said it allows the player to use his imagination more. Still given how fleshed out the characters are, one could imagine them to be at least a bit interesting. Yet they are not. The most important issue however is balance. So far I believe all sponsors have their viable ways of working well, so as of now I think Firaxis did that one well.\n\nI could drone on a bit more but this is lost time that I could have used playing this game!\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes, I do. The atmosphere is just great. The scifi turn-based strategy genre is quite sparsely populated so even a game with some imperfections would get a rather positive review from me. I think Beyond Earth actually earns the good vote. It's not actually a breathtaking game, but while it looks like a small step for the turn-based strategy genre, it is a great step from Civ 5.\n\n7.5/10 – It's okay.","October 23, 2014","true","25.5"," 671 of 961 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","671","961","3","15"

The Sponsers don't have any personality like in previous Civ games and their bonuses feel fairly Lack-lustre. Affinities are cool, especially how it changes the architecture of your cities and have cool unique units who's aesthetic reflects the sponsor's primary affinity, but otherwise feel fairly similar to eachother in terms of abilities. The fact that i can get all the affinity bonuses for each affinity in a single playthrough feels a bit unvaried and cheap to me, turning a mechanic that should spawn personality and individuality for a particuluar Civ in a playthrough, instead allow players to form this souless, homogenous glump with no distinct trait; it's bad enough that the Civs (or Sponsors, i should say) already have no personality, but the affinities just turn that into a soulless void. Otherwise, mostly everything else feels like Civ 5, which is good; but then again, i'd rather play Civ 5 if i wanted to feel like i'm playing Civ 5.\n\nFor Civ veterans who own every bit of DLC for Civ 5, i'd just recommend sticking to that, IMHO. For\nnew-comers to Civ, Beyond Earth is a fine introduction to Civ. Similar mechanics to Civ 5 make it a good stepping stone for those that may look at getting into previous Civilization games. Overall though, Beyond Earth feels a bit empty for me. Perhaps in a later patch or DLC they may add stuff that will bring me back into it, but otherwise, i'm sticking to Civ 5 for now.","November 19, 2014","false","37.8"," 142 of 185 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","142","185","0","0"

In this game its just ,you won. Yay.

It is CIV in space, so far fair and fun enough but there is nothing there to keep the interest burning. The alien planet is interesting in the beginning but quickly becomes plain. The small stories (quests) are entertaning and spark ones imagination, for a while.\n\nIt is simply CIV in space with earth resources such as marble and bananas swapped with potatoelike tubes and firaxite. Without the history of real earth, which supports CIV on Earth, the game quickly feels like a generic CIV. The current storyline and tweaks compared to CIV on Earth is not enough to keep it afloat.\n\nIf this was created by modders for free it would be really impressing.

The only problem is pretty much every single review or interview before and after release brings it up. The diplomacy is simply cut and pasted from Civ V. There is a complete lack of effort. If you fire up Alpha Centauri the sounds are awesome you feel immersed. When you play this there is no bond to it the factions have zero personalities. You will see lines like, "Once bitten twice shy." I can't recommend this to anyone. If I had any recommendation it would be to not buy this until all DLC have been released and you can pick it up for $5.

It lacks any of the historical connection that Civ 5 has, which means the technologies are very generic.  I've never been faced with such a disconnected choice, like, do I want the generic +1 health or the +1 power building.  And half the Wonders I could not even tell what they were supposed to be at all, other than their stats.  The units suffer from an excessivly generic issue, as well.  In an attempt to simplify the various unit types, you upgrade existing units throughout the game.  Unfortunately, this leads to questions like "What was the Arbiter again?  Was that a boat, a melee infantry, or rocket artillery?"\n\nAs many have said, they retained so much of Civ 5 game that it feels like a reskin of the base game.  While that is not in of itself a bad thing (Civ 5 is great, afterall), they kept too much and what they did change, they made only modest advencements, leaving us with a overpriced, bland, generic sci-fi reskin of a popular game.","November 21, 2014","false","14.0"," 144 of 194 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","144","194","0","0"

It is basically a mod of the last Civ release with little added and a lot taken away. There is really no challenge in the game, no... point. You don't ever really have any sense of purpose to the missions and goals other than the fact that it is what you are supposed to do. The game basically becomes a single line path to reach a research goal ahead of everyone else and win. There is no creativity or flexibility in it and ultimately no real purpose. The final end screen sort of sums up the whole game - when a side wins, it just dumps you out of the game. No summary, no evaluation of your performance, and if it is not you who won, no information on who did win. The conclusion is as dull as the game. It seems that even the AI itself is bored and just couldn't be bothered.

Much like Civ 5 upon release, this game is not finished. I have no doubt it will be improved upon with the future expansions as there are some great ideas in here that could be amazing with a little bit of TLC.\n\nRight now, this is very much a spin-off of Civ 5 as opposed to a sequel. Many assets from 5 were reused (mainly the hill and ice tiles). The biggest problem though, is the lack of strong civilizations. Being set in the future, all the leaders are fictional and not memorable at all. The only one I ever remember is "that guy who looks like John C. Reilly". The civs abilities aren't very memorable either, as the "create your own" civilization at the beginning of a game just makes it feel like everything is homogenized.\n\nThere are a few positives though, the new tech tree is very fun once you get used to it. The need to constantly upgrade your militairy units is gone thanks to a new affinity based unit promotion tree. This leaves you with just the basic unit types which you can specialize as the game progresses. The new policy trees are great too, incentivizing both branching across multiple trees and focusing on one.\n\nI think the most important fault of BE is the victories. Other than the Domination-esque victory of capturing all capitals, the others are just sitting around and waiting, making for a really boring Next-Turn button simulator.\n\nIn conclusion, wait till the expansions come out. BNW and G&K really improved Civ 5, and I have high hopes that the same will happen for BE. Until then, just buy the complete addition of 5 if you want some Civ.","January 2, 2015","false","8.9"," 127 of 171 people (74%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","74","127","171","12","0"

Since then, I have been a dedicated fan on the series, and in fact all of firaxis' works since then. I even played that facebook civ, which was surprisingly good (except for the constant puzzles). Yet.. this is the first civilization game for which I have felt compelled to leave a review..\n\nAs much as it pains me to say, this Civ release does not merit a full title price tag. In terms of gameplay, Civ:Beyond Earth does in fact feel like a glorified mod of Civ5, and not the best one either. The new sci-fi graphics and sound are very nice and well done. Graphically, the game looks much better than civ 5, even though this may not be apparent in screenshots.. however this is not enough to cover up the fact that the core game underneath it all is quite boring.\n\nThough the affinity and starting condition customizations seem like a huge step forward for the franchise, they actually take away all sense of identity for individual players. The AI civs have been axed even further due to the fact that they have a lot less dialogue and options of interaction. The lack of technological ages and culturally themed buildings also detract from the sense of character that the game has. The overall result of the gameplay changes in Civ Beyond Earth make the game feel like a mad dash towards a specific goal. This is very different from the epic, multi-staged journey that civ fans expect. I found it very hard to become attached to my civ, or to care much about winning, as the game quickly becomes a "assign production and trade routes, end turn and repeat cycle." The devs on this game admit to being fans of Endless Space, and the game actually suffers from the same major flaw.. of being extremely well polished, functional, and pretty, but utterly devoid of character.\n\nThe flow of the game feels very bland, especially in comparison to the brave new world expansion for civ 5. Being on an alien world provides the game developers with a virtually unlimited number of interesting scenarios to throw at the player, thanks to decades of accumulated fiction that can be drawn upon. Instead, the game presents all of that intrigue in the form of a box of flavor text each time you build a new type of building.\n\nAmong some other missed opportunities that are uniquely available to the setting of beyond earth which were missed are.. Under-water or subterranean settlement, more robust and fleshed out space units, natural wonders and catastrophes, sci-fi themed luxury resources.\n\nAll in all, this game was a letdown, and quite overrated. Lets hope Civ6 brings a more memorable experience to the table.\n\nEDIT: The AI's aggression needs to be fixed. They are far too passive. I have played 3 games and the only war I have been a part of thus far was one of my own making.\n\nEDIT2: The game lacks a victory summary.. of any kind. What is up with that??

As a life long fan of this series, this is the only Civilization game i have played which was simply put: not fun.\n\nThe game is incredibly easy yet annoying.  It also feels cheaply done.  Whoever was in charge of this project has seriously hurt the value of the brand here by putting out such a poor product under an acclaimed series.\n\nI just did my first playthrough (normal difficulty) and won.  Not by a small margin but the faction in 2nd place was earning around +20 energy and 60 science per turn at the end.  I was earning +250 energy and well over 400 science per turn....(and this was net of my workers building the most expensive terrain upgrades possible).\n\nI was never attacked.  I never witnessed an attack except that the other countries would randomly send 2 units to attack a 3rd party post.  No, they never destroyed it despite the countries having massive militaries lying in their borders.  They just randomly attacked them and then withdrew.  This was all the action i saw....and i never felt threatened.  I read reviews of the AI's passivity before playing so I spent next to nothing on military units early game.....and nobody ever attacked me.\n\nThe aliens.....there is essentially no point to them.  You leave them alone and they will leave you alone.  I had one worker (who was travelling far outside of my borders) killed.  That's it.\n\nTrade routes - you will have nightmares about these.  They say a boat owner's two happiest days are when he gets his boat....and when he gets rid of his boat.  It was great when I realized that i would have an endless supply of energy (gold) from my trade routes but then.....they just wouldn't leave me alone!!!!!!!!  Every 20 turns you will be asked to scan through a MASSIVE list of every city know to the futuristic human race to pick out the most attractive trade route.  Now multiply this by the number of cities you have and then times 2 again (some cases 3).  This is essentially what you will be doing for most of your time in this game.....picking damn trade routes.  By the end of the game, you will wish you never had them.\n\nAffinities......terribly executed.  I went the alien / xenomass route (i cant even remember the name) and it just feels totally pointless which one was my dominant affinity as i ended up having high levels in the other 2 with access to most of their units.  In no way did my affinity dictate my style of play except that i had to hunt for more xenomass strategic resources.  Essentially each affinity leans more so on one resource but other than that - they all get their own graphic and name for troops which are mostly the same.\n\nThere are many other problems with this game but you get the idea.  Obviouslly there was a severe flaw in the project team overseeing this.......what a shame.  This feels like an early beta for a game as it has such massive obvious flaws in the AI, game balance and enjoyability.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/illrigger/recommended/65980/","illrigger","Illrigger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/illrigger/","371 products in account","After spending quite some time with CivBE, I have come away feeling disappointed.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game is not different enough from Civ 5 to be all that interesting if you have played it. While there are some fundamental differences (the web tech tree being the biggest change), it's essentially still the same game. If you were bored or played out with Civ 5, it won't take long to get that way again with CivBE.\n\nSecond, while the endings in Civ games has always been one of the weaker points of the game (I've been playing them since Civ2), this one takes the cake by not only being lackluster, but now also confusing. There is simply too much of the game's story buried in the help section (which you have to manually go and read). Descriptions of the three "paths" you can choose from are not well presented, progression in them suffers from a lack of narration, and  the special victory conditions from them are a complete mystery if you don't wan to go into the help files and read what they are. There's an almost complete lack of immersion in the story, to the point where you can actually accidentally progress to the faction victory and not even realize you had done so if you are just working on building your civ. In contrast, this games's spiritual predecessor, Alpha Centauri, has voiceovers throughout giving flavor to the techs you are building, and interludes that pop up explaining the story progression of the game, giving you a clue you were heading in the right direction for a win. CivBE is a decided step backwards in storytelling.\n\nThird, the actual tech and units in the game are boring and unappealing. Wonders are just stat bonuses with random fururistic sounding names - nothing to make them feel wonderous happens at all when you build them. Combat units are just the same as their Civ5 counterparts with different names. In Alpha Centauri, each unit and wonder felt like a unique item, with a purpose. You could customize each soldier or tank with new armor, weapons, and abilities - each unit could be unique, or you could spend the money to upgrade them. In CivBE, you literally get to choose between two options when you upgrade a unit, and all units are automatically given that change - no matter how far away they are on the planet. Your units aren't even color coded to your nation, leading to confusion when invading enemies move into your territory. It's boring, and it's badly designed and implemented.\n\nLastly, the game is buggy. You can read threads here about how many people have crash issues, or can't run the game at all. I personally have to run the game in a window because my 120hz monitor isn't supported by the game. Not even a "windowed full screen" mode like most games have these days - an actual window mode with a title bar. Given the game is basically Civ5 with a new skin in most ways, for bugs like this to make it into a retail release is inexcusable. Any decent  amount of QA would have found some of these bugs, and it's readily apparent that another month cooking would have done wonders for CivBE, but as is the case in so many games this year, getting the game into stores before Christmas was obviously more important to Firaxis than delivering a game that actually runs. To make matters worse, we are several weeks past launch now and there has not been a single patch released.\n\nThis game has not just made me sad about the state of games today, but has actually made me vow to never pre-order another game that has a launch date after September 1st. The game devs have no reason to deliver a good game experience to us unless we stand up and let our dollars do the talking.","November 14, 2014","false","26.5"," 142 of 196 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","142","196","0","0"

Please, do yourself a favor and save your money, at least until it goes on a 40% off sale.\n\nThis game does not have a soul like most Firaxis games do.  I just cannot get invested in the characters.  I feel like I'm going through the motions of Civ:BE but am still thinking of Civ V.  I feel bad because I so wanted to fall in love with Civ:BE, but it is just a shell of a game.\n\nI have a bunch of little issues with the UI, especially the diplomacy screen.  Can they not incorporate InfoAddict to the game?  I want to KNOW everything I have and the other trades I'm engaged in before saying yes to an offer.  Currently, I have to decide blindly because I haven't memorized it all.  Come on, Firaxis!  Just add a little button in the corner to give us access to this!\n\nI cannot recommend this game currently though I so want to.  I love Firaxis, but this game again is a shell of a game without a soul.","November 5, 2014","false","8.9"," 168 of 238 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","168","238","0","0"

Unfortunately the effort fails, and fails big time. There are so many holes and short comings in this game, that it's hard where to hard start. Don't get me wrong, the game has generally good mechanics and is visually appealing, but overall it just maybe good, but definitely not a must-pay-game.\nThe biggest drawback is balancing. The game is way, way too easy. In any Civ game before I didn't dare to play the highest difficulty level. Not so in BE. I skipped two or three levels inbetween and played my 4th game at Apollo and won it easily within 180 turns.\nCurrently trade-route-spamming is the most effective way to win/dominate a game. With 3 traderoutes (Auto Plant!), the bonuses you get from trade routes are eclipising any early or mid-game buildings you use in a city. And the boost is enormous.\nThe AI is just too passive. Even on Apollo level it rarely attacks, and if so its forces are too weak to make a prolonged and effective attack work.\nThe aliens, while interesting at the start, soon lose any appeal and become cannon fooder as soon as you build your first affinity specific unit.\nNo proper feedback. I just build a unit or a building, but where?? I have to check the logs to find this information??\nNo in-game videos. I build a wonder, just a textbox. I won the game, just a textbox, and so on ..Would I recommend this game? In the current state (first version; unpatched) I would only recommend it only to the die-hard Civ  fans, and even for those the long-term motivation is minimal due to the lack of balance and challenge. Maybe 6 out 10 would be a fair rating, imho.","November 30, 2014","false","96.7"," 114 of 155 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","114","155","0","0"

The aliens were supposed to be meaningful and interact with your advances on the planet but all they are is a slight speedbump. You can commit genocide on them and they still will not change their stance towards you. The aliens don't scale in power and very soon you can crush hordes of them with a single of your units. VERY disapointing.\n\nThe tech-tree, or rather tech circle, is a very nice change but suffers from balance issues. The units available to the sponsors (equivalent to the different civs in CIV V) have atrocious scaling and in you are a single level behind you'll get steamrolled. The AI is dumb as dirt and is incompetent at every turn.\n\nThis "game" is just a deluxe mod to CIV V but Firaxis charges you as if it was a new independant game. The mechanics are all the same between the games. In CIV you have happiness here you have health, but mechanically it's ALL THE SAME.\n\nThis game has potential but that potential will probably come in DLC where Firaxis will force you to get a "complete" base game but charging you EVEN MORE money. The game is basically in late beta and is just a nice mod to CIV but costs just as much as a new retail game. Firaxis really dropped the ball here.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/65980/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Beyond Earth (BE) doesn't feel like a Civ game. Sure it has many similar features & mechanics, and you'll know most of the basics from the first turn, but numerous other changes just don't sit well with me, feeling unbalanced & unintuitive.\n\nFor many Civ fans, winning their space victory and seeing their rocket set off for the stars always left you wanting to continue the journey, one day. There was Alpha Centuri off course, but BE is not AC. BE is set about 500 years into the future, a dying Earth, the remaining civilizations (conglomerates of existing nations) reach out to the stars in hope of survival.\n\nOne of the first issues you will encounter is the new tech-web. Not necessarily a bad concept, when there is some logic behind the progression. In Civ, this is natural, as a player you understand the significance of your technological advances (its intuitive, part of our collective human history). In BE where there is no basis, no lore, no previous history created to help the player understand where you are starting from at turn one. Most of the sayings, names, wonders or civilizations for that matter hold little meaning or interest.\n\nTechnologies for the most do not seem to have any logical steps once you step out the inner circle (few that are familiar like Computing, Chemistry etc.) of the tech-web. It's symmetrical, not organic and although you appear to have so many more paths to potentially explore, in practice I found I just wanted to get the affinity ones primarily as fast as possible to get various bonuses/buildings but most importantly military upgrades. Tech-web is bland & overall is very hard to follow. You will revert to always using filters to make any sense of it all.\n\nMilitary Units now upgrade rather than becoming superseded. I really like this idea, although I don't like the implementation. Your upgrades are seemingly tied to your affinities, along with requiring certain techs to build some units. These steps up in strength can make a huge difference and when all your units instantly upgrade. You can have a war turn instantly on you! It’s a flaw (or perhaps a limitation); these steps should be more gradual. In Civ, this happens as you cycle through and upgrade new units into your military over many various iterations. In BE, there might be 4-5 main iterations over a game per unit type. This can represent significant stats improvement to receive automatically which seems to widen later in the game. Unit upgrades should be far greater in frequency considering the limited number of unit types and should involve other techs, not affinity related too (maybe more minor improvements but still help players keep pace if exploring other parts of the tech-web). Going a smaller arsenal also should have a high level of customisation than simply choosing the affinity. Affinity is also tied to your victory conditions adding further to its importance.\n\nI did like the aesthetics & more intense colours used in the alien landscapes and thought the musical score was excellent (so was the intro video!). UI was good in places (liked the colours again), but confusing in others. It seems BE is almost a stats free Civ & other management features seems very cut back to almost non-existent. This simply adds to the confusion when you cannot assess how you are tracking. All feels a bit dumbed down really, even further than Civ V. Feeling less strategy, more plain luck at times. Please bring back the stats!\n\nBE is also cut back in other respects, such as no more intros for leaders, no more wonder videos or cool narrators. Diplomacy, is none improved from Civ V and the generic leaders have no personality. Doesn’t really matter much of the time anyways as games mainly turn to war (seems after 500 years nothing’s changed :lol:). One little hex of Miasma clearing can turn your friendly neighbour to the brink of war. AI flip-flop consistently and there is little you can do to avoid it, making it a better approach just to avoid them all together where you can or go strong and wipe them out.\n\nAliens on the planet are an improvement over barbarians, but still not terribly intelligent (or aggressive). Worms are cool!\n\nAlthough the health (happiness from Civ) is less penalising if you go in the negative, I have found it harder to keep in the green. Depending on your tech choices you can find yourself very limited in improvements to counter expansion. I would have liked to see both health and happiness included as different measures, and more flexibility to manage your cities. There are more improvement options for your workers which is nice, but being the future, I would have liked to see options to better evolve your landscape.\n\nSatellites (Orbital Layer) are another addition to BE. This could have been a really awesome feature improvement. In practice, I found myself using it very little, as often you had limited choices in launches, and they don't seem to stay in orbit very long for the turns used to build. I would have loved to seen this fleshed out further, options for upgrading satellites to make permanent or increase coverage. Using Miasma killing satellite can send you to insta-war too, so I found myself avoiding using it.\n\nAnother annoying feature in the late game is having to keep setting your trade routes every few turns. You have so many to manage too it becomes incredibly frustrating!\n\nBE has bravely tried to be something unique, introducing some new mechanics to the well-established Civ world. Some of it is interesting enough to experience a few times, but overall this world feels generic, unbalanced & frankly uninteresting. Too much of what makes Civ addictive is lost in BE and I come away feeling a bit dirty about it all, especially knowing the premium price charged (should add overcharged for us Australians at approx. ~$80USD) for what is at most an expansion in terms of real content.\n\nFor me, this is the biggest disappointment of the year, but Firaxis are known for good after release support, so I am desperately hoping some balance patches and more content might make this more enjoyable. As a big Civ fan I will keep my eye on future progress, but at this stage, in its current state, I don't see it holding my interest for many more turns.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","October 29, 2014","false","25.0"," 261 of 388 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","261","388","0","16"

It's a leech.  When it's asking for help, it's only trying to slow you down, or rope you into a conflict.  When they declare war on each other it's most often ineffective.  They send a few piddly units at each other that end up dying in miasma.  Mostly war only serves to mess up your economy.  They can expand so many more cities than the player, due to negative Health not affecting them.\n\nNegotiations go pretty much like Civ5.  If the AI 'likes' you, then you'll get a better deal.  The worse deals they offer, the closer to war you are.\n\nThe AI doesn't understand how to use the tech tree very well.  Often you can tech to certain upgrades, Harmony, etc, and just power curve crush everyone.  Sometimes the AI will randomly bumble into a crushing upgrade, and maybe will knock you around a bit, but don't worry just build a lot of miasma, and it'll die trying to get to your cities.  Or permanently "Fortify until healed" off in some forest somewhere.\n\nThere's nothing glaringly wrong that I've found.  No soul crushing bugs to stop me from enjoying.

It's not a terrible game by itself, but it's just a reskinned Civs5 that took 1 step forward and 2 steps backward. It added a few little nice things like the tech web, removed things they shouldn't have, and created a really basic system that doesn't have much depth like Civs5 did because apparently the game was too confusing to play(?).\n\n-Military Unit promotions are dull, bland, and quite boring. The way affinity works with upgrading them looks cool at 1st because the units look different depending on the affinity path you choose. But it's just a simplified unit promotion from Civs5. You only get 2 options when the upgrade comes up. Where's all the dozen other promotions I could give my unit? Where'd that go? Why is it that a particular unit is always going to have the same promotions when built? I liked it when I could have multiple rifleman with different roles. One played the medic, one had huge defense, and maybe one had really good offense. You can't do that anymore. Every unit of that type now plays 1 single role. *KILLS* it for me.\n\n-There's almost no unit diversity. For example, there's only 2 different naval units in the entire game. Really? ...Really?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n-Wonders are kinda meh. Not as many at all compared to V and most of them don't do much.\n\n-The endgame is boring. No real units to look forward to, nothing changes. Plays like it does early game for the most part. Your turns also start to become unnecessarily tedious due to a few annoying things that I hope they do fix. One, being the trade routes. In this game you can get about 3 trades routes PER city you own. So once you start running a dozen cities or more, most of your turns you're going to be constantly reconfirming what that damn vessel/convoy should be doing. Again, and again, and again~\n\n-The "Civilizations" or Sponsors I believe they call them are ♥♥♥♥. They barely have any unique bonuses, no special units or buildings, and there's only 8 of them to play.\n\n\n\nSo OVERALL: Skip this and go buy & play CivsV if you haven't. It's cheaper and you get more content. Win win!","October 29, 2014","false","32.0"," 85 of 116 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","85","116","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chromakode/recommended/65980/","chromakode","chromakode","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chromakode/","110 products in account","I find myself sitting down wanting to play a game of Civ: BE, but deciding not to because I think it'll play out exactly the same way as my last few games: a bland time countdown victory quest and a little "you won!" popup. Frankly, Civ BE's endgames are boring to play, and further undermined by not being very interesting in general.\n\nIt pains me to say this because overall, Civ: BE is so damn cool. It has the seeds of everything I and others have ever wanted from a contemporary Sci-Fi Civ. The super powerful abilities/upgrades/buildings, the intriguing aliens and resources, and general feeling of optimism and discovery makes for a super appealing game environment. While promising, the game we have today is disappointing, with poor replay value. It's fun to play and look at, yet deeply unrewarding.\n\nMost of the flaws in the actual game have been well described by other reviews -- the mechanics that have been added to (what is more or less) Civ V are at best shallow, and at worst broken and cheesy. Affinities are undifferentiated score-based research paths rather than defining philosophical differences. Trade is *extremely* overpowered but amounts to boring micromanagement. Quests are repetitive interruptions that don't vary much per game, and the storytelling is rather bland. The orbital layer seems very cool, but after playing with it a while, it tends to just amount to another repetitive micro situation, combined with the fact that it's annoyingly difficult to shoot down other satelites (which creates the incentive for everyone to spam cheap sats -- you'll never be able to actually fit in that planet carver usefully). Add in the standard Civ V issues (abuseable AI, weird diplomacy) and even the wins feel kind of hollow.\n\nI did have some fun "un-terraforming" the planet as Harmony affinity for a while (since the miasma becomes a buff rather than a penalty), but the orbital layer is cumbersome and the AIs didn't do anything intelligent about it.\n\nOverall, the biggest flaw IMHO is that the endgame is dominated by research / planetary wonder quests, and there is very little I've been able to do to stop one of the 5 other players from completing these if they're decently underway. Because of this, you have to rush the science win every time (and sometimes due to random chance you'll get a really unbalanced early quest win off the bat) and then build your military.  My typical game ending is a time-countdown win with little interaction with half the civs, or a loss on the other side of the planet that I can't do anything about. It makes the whole thing feel rather inconsequential.\n\nPerhaps in 6 months this game will live up to the promise it deserved, but for now, I wish I had my hours and excitement back.","October 28, 2014","false","27.5"," 123 of 178 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","123","178","0","0"

Real sad.  Base game is alright, though.\n\nUpdated 12/12/15\n\nThe new expansion did not meet expectations.  6/10 cannot recommend.\nGo play Civ 5.  Rising Tide made me feel as if they don't want me to play this game anymore.\n\nThis is an old review based on the base game, so I'll keep it relevant to that but I warn you:  if you enjoy playing 4x strategy games, stay away from this one.  It's not headed in a reletively good direction.  Take this review with a gigantic grain of salt.\n\nSid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth is a game seemingly intended for veterans of the 4x strategy genre and not Civ fans  directly .  I believe this ultimately hurt the game, but it does not detract from the gameplay if you are prepared for it.  The game does differ in a lot ways to Civ 5 in many ways and has many different mechanics in terms of how to allocate your time and resources, but it is also similar in some aspects.\n\nWhen I first began playing this game as a sort of newbie to the series starting from Civ 5, I did not find this game very engaging and I felt like the game was lacking in a lot of ways that made Civ 5 such an outstanding title (if you include dlc).  It was not until I had played and understood a more complicated 4x strategy that I began to play more about this game (specifically Endless Space).  Now that I do understand more about this game, I'll attempt to explain some of the more basic elements.\n\nMechanics\n\nAffinities:\nAffinities are basically the freedom/order/autocracy of this game, just much, much more important.  Affinities are what define your civilization.  There are three kinds: Harmony, Supremacy, and Purity.  Affinities affect how other civilzations react to you and what sort of victories you can achieve.  Delving deep into an affinity is necessary to win certain victories and is beneficial towards your military, as units grow in power as your affinity strengthens.  The more you develop into an affinity, the more your civ becomes like that affinity.  Your actions quickly become louder than your words as you and the other civilizations advance into their affinities and you will find friends and foes alike based on nothing but your ideology.\n\nScience:\nProbably the most important thing in the entire game next to affinities.  The science web (yes that's web, not tree) comes in two parts: branches and leaves.  Branches are the basic parts to a technology that allow you move further into the web by researching them.  Leaves allow you to speciallize in a tree. Unlike branches, you can't progress further into the web by reasearching leaves. Leaves, however, often offer better benefits than the more generalized branches do.  Unlike Civ 5 where the science tree is linear and you must keep up research in order to progress as a civilization, you can pick and chose exactly what technology will help you the best for what you are trying to do.  As a new player to this game and games like this, that's a lot of choices to pick from and it can get confusing at times.  It's important to understand what victories there are, what victory you want to pursue, and decide on researching technologies based on what victory you want.\n\nVirtues:\nLike previous Civ games, culture is also an important aspect of the game.  Culture allows you to obtain virtues which provide boosts to your civilization.  There are 4 virtue trees: might, prosperity, knowledge and industry.  Delving deep into a tree will boost combat, food, production, energy (money), science, culture or health based on which trees you chose.  Once again, this game provides with the choice of what virtues you want to pick, and how you want to allocate them.  If you chose to speciallize in a tree, you will get unique benefits the more you put into that tree.  If you chose to go into multiple trees, you get unique benefits generalizing into the same level in each tree.\n\nSpying:\nSpies provide nice, one-time bonuses you your civilization ever so-often.  Spies can establish spy networks, siphon money, steal science or even call giant siege worms to wreak havoc on another civilization's city.  Spies, although not vital, are very helpful to your civlization's goals.\n\nAliens:\nYou can make aliens friend or foe - it's entirely your choice.  The harmony affinity allows you to be at peace with the alien life on the planet and even use them against your foes.  Supremacy and Purity, however, could care less about the aliens.  If you don't wish to make the aliens friends, they quickly become nuissances that must be dealt with from time to time.  Keep in mind, though, that attacking the local wildlife can put you at odds with other civilizations bent on protecting and preserving the alien life.\n\nMiasma:\nSome of the most annoying stuff in the game.  Miasma covers certain land tiles on the map and it slowly deals damage to units that end their turn on it.  You can get rid of the miasma by researching the right technologies and using workers or satellites, or use the miasma to your advantage by delving into the harmony affinity allowing them to instead heal your units for the same amount every time a unit ends their turn on it.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe only reason I could recommend this game before was because I thought the DLC would fix some of the issues I had with it.  Now that I am thoroughly disappointed, I can say this game is not something I will be enjoying for awhile.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nGame is okay.\nPut time in and you might like it... or hate it.  Probably hate it.\nOn the surface, kinda boring/lacking potential.\nRising Tide is garbage.\nReminds me of a one world Endless Space.\nThe DLC made me hate this game.","June 11, 2015","true","39.7"," 135 of 198 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","135","198","4","3"

If you look at my profile you will see at time of writing I am closing in on 1000 hours played of Civ 5. I bought BE on a whim as I got just a little bored of it's "big brother". I am writing this just as I near the end of my first game of BE. A game I will likely never finish. I knew in advance this game had mixed reviews and disappointed many. I assumed it was simply due to how polished Civ 5 was. It isn't. This is simply a bad game.\n\nRather than go on expendiing further major effort writing about a game I greatly dislike, I am just going to list a set of bullet point reasons why I didn't like it. I urge the reader to avoid this game. If you are tempted, buy Civ 5 instead as it is FAR superior and should be obtainable much cheaper to boot.\n\n1. Miasma. Clouds of poison gas that appear at random all over the map. Units lose 10% HP if they end their turn on it. On average about 1 tile in 3 has it. It adds nothing to the game but frustration and limited unit movement.\n\n2. Personality free leaders. I could not work out who was where or who was denouncing who. They are all faceless. Same goes for the Wonders. Boring. Irrelevant.\n\n3. Bland happiness mechanic. It's called health but it's happiness really. Since luxury resource no longer exist, there is no trading with others. You just build the happiness buildings you need to keep yourself in the green. Also there is simply no point in trading with other leaders or keeping them sweet as they basically have nothing you want or need. Don't think I opened the Trading screen once.\n\n4. Too many featureless resources. I could not remember what did what or what was important. It's easy to understand Wheat / Iron / Oil in Civ 5 but Firaxite / Tubers / Float stone? Doesn't work.\n\n5. Poor rendering of the map. The oceans are too dark, making them look unexplored when they are explored. The goddam Miasma is really hard to see.\n\n6. The tech web. I hated it. It's just too arbitary and few of its entries actually mean anything. And this is coming from someone who really embraced the Skill Tree in Path of Exile! There are far too many buildings to build and many of them seem very very similar in function. They lack personality, just like the leaders and the resources and the Wonders, making it hard to care about them or remember them.\n\nYou know what, I had about 10 other things to list but I've lost interest.\n\n3/10 - Avoid","May 10, 2015","false","19.4"," 76 of 103 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","76","103","2","0"

I meant £30 full retail game that doesn’t fix any of the issues Civ 5 had. It still suffers from slowdown in late game despite having less factions, the NPC’s still offer utterly insane trades and still throw down whenever they feel like it but all gang up and accuse you of being a murdering despot when you strike first. The end game is still plodding and monotonous and all the AI factions act exactly the same ei: build as many cities as possible as close to you as possible and then declare war no matter what you've done to them in the past.\n\nTo be fair there are some new features, the rampaging Dune inspired worm is quite nice, until it decides to just move back and forth between two tiles next to your city so you have to spend turn after turn pecking away at it before you can even leave home.\n\nAlso I love how the other civilizations chew me out for attacking the aliens that are harassing my trade routes, random enemy spawners are people too after all! This might have made sense in Civ 5 where you could make the claim your oppressing a local tribe or whatever, but here you are clearly under siegie by mega cockroaches that have eaten all your workers and the other hippy Civ's are telling you to coexist or they'll come over there and murder you.\n\nI just don’t understand how Firaxis can release the same game twice and not fix any of the key problems with it. Why, when I’m being asked to join a war with another faction, can I not check out who it is they are asking me to fight? I can’t remember which faction their stupid space name represents and even if I could surely I’d want to look at their territory and size it up first right?\n\nIf you've never played Civ 5, and its on sale, you might enjoy this game, after all it is Civ 5 in space and Civ 5 despite its flaws is fairly addicting.

It's that it's BORING.\n\nA big part of that is the utter failure to introduce or substantially differentiate any of the factions beyond their in-game stat packages.  It's like if you were a baseball-card collector, and Topps decided to put out a series where every player stares lifelessly into the camera for a mug shot.  But hey, since all the effort went into doubling the amount of stats you get on the back of the card, that's what you really WANT, right?\n\nBeyond Earth adds some extra complexity, sure.  You'll quickly find that the Tech Web is something of a headache to navigate, for one thing.  The flavor text becomes meaningless as you irritatedly ignore it in favor of scanning through stats, stats and more stats to try and figure out the best path for your strategy.  Which you won't likely be able to formulate on your first play-through, as there are umpteen different routes to take and few of them are particularly intuitive.\n\nSo on my fourth play-through, when I finally felt like I had enough of an idea of what I was doing to complete a full game,  I'm cooking along and all seems to be well and I've won the two wars someone else picked with me and I'm managing cities and SORRY YOU LOSE.\n\nWait, what?  Yep, there's a screen pop-up saying someone else won.  Doesn't say who, or how.  The game is just over.  I am, of course, invited to play "one... more... turn", but what's the point?  No fanfare, no cutscene, not even the zoom-out to show my ruined civilization that Civ 5 has?\n\nNope.  Not a sausage.\n\nAll in all, the game mechanics are --- not bad.  I'm used to playing much more complex stuff, like Hearts of Iron.  You can fumble your way into figuring pretty much everything out.  But make no mistake, it IS fumbling about and the Civilopedia isn't much help.  Worse, the atmosphere of the game is BLAND, with even the aliens coming in a limited variety of flavors  but nonetheless seeming to have more characterization and motive than the human factions.\n\nSince I CAN'T get a refund on Steam (that I know of), I can only hope the modding community saves this game with a healthy dose of creativity.","October 27, 2014","false","31.0"," 238 of 367 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","238","367","0","1"

I cannot recommend this for it's current price because the only real difference... actually I don't think there is a real big difference, actually yeah the tech web is a substantial change to the game just not big enough. Culture isn't nearly as useful as it used to be because, the lack of a culture victory, and the benefits from the trees you go down in the culture menu don't cause much change in tactics unless you go down basically the growth tree which will keep you aflout on your health. Also something to point out is why allow yourself to become friends with aliens when you ARE going to wipe them out, even when you pic the Harmony tree you will find yourself killing off nests and the AI demonstrates that. The aliens have no real use to them as allies it basically just means they won't attack you but that isn't much of a problem when they are laughably weak. The outposts you trade with in my opinion are just wasted space, the AI is horrid, it's very buggy, and the only thing that I found enjoyable is that I found it fun to play wide instead of tall when I am the kind of player who always plays tall.

A building you can only get through having an improved resource of Firaxite near the city.\nDue to the changes in city founding, I was unable to settle 3 new cities, buy tiles, try to improve the resource and purchase the buildings before someone else beat me.\n\nBut what the hell - I hadn't been told I would need any of this stuff until the last minute! Firaxite hadn't even been required before then! Why would I need obervatories if I have hyper computers and deep space telescopes already! This isn't fun at all! And it isn't obvious either.\n\nGameplay should be streamlined. I shouldn't have to guess about what does what and conditions for victory shouldn't be so obscure. It ruins immersion beyond being bad design - otherwise the description in this case would say (3 ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE VICTORY PATH X) But anyone with a mediocre level of sensibility would see that sort of display and realize it only really reveals the bad design behind an idea.\n\nI know it's fun to explore and try new things in terms of designing games and telling stories, but the players shouldn't be left feeling confused and frustrating unless you're making a game that aims to achieve solely that function. In which case I will likely call you an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and probably never play your game.\n\nEither way, this game has some fun qualities but it doesn't grasp me as something unique - something that really made me go "Hmmmmm" like Civ V and IV.\n\nI hate to say it, but I think there are much better outlets for entertainment than this game. I have to give it a 4 or 5 out of 10.\n\n\n*Update*\nAnother problem with the game seems to lie in the questing system.\nThere seems to be this peculiar bug during which I've had objectives come up that simply aren't possible such as asking me to build a petroleum refinery in a city which has no oil located around it for 5 tiles in any direction. This indicates poor testing AND implementation of the questing system.\n\nThese features should have been tested more rigorously to achieve the effect of actually being fun.","November 8, 2014","false","128.6"," 157 of 239 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","157","239","0","6"

Early units are extremely underpowered, preventing you from trying to establish early dominance. Trade AI still (20 years later) leaves you scratching your head at times. In addition, the ugly terrain keeps you from being invested in fixing up the countryside and making it feel civilized. The inability to easily select a member of a set of stacked units make some tasks difficult.\n\nA few bright spots in this otherwise lackluster offering:\n- The tweaks to building output via the quest decision path is a nice touch.\n- The concept of the satellite layer is nice\n- The entire premise of the game is solid\n- Rapid expansion of civs (a la Civ 3) fits the game's premise nicely\n- Due to the tech web, almost every game will play differently\n- Espionage now has more tangible rewards than it did over the previous Civ games\n- The "barbarians" of the alien world present a real threat early on, which would be expected on an alien world.\n\nOverall, I'd say just stick to Civ 5.

Maybe it will be better with addons but right now the game is rather shallow, bland and imbalanced.\n\n- The game factions are bland, they lack any personality at all and all feel the same. This is subjective though, but I don't like the game lore a single bit. I don't understand why they had to go with "Earth nations" inspired factions.\n- The trade route spam is required for victories but is very tedious. The trade UI compared to Civ5 is lacking: your previous route does not get highlighted properly, you cannot sort the trade routes by yield or science or other stats. Your cities have 2 basic trade routes, with Autoplant quest you can get 3 so it a colony with 5-6 outposts you'll be managing 15-18 trade routes and all the time you'll have to scout the unfriendly interface to find the best one. It's very tedious but if you don't do it - you feel punished.\n- Affinities do not shape your civilization TOO differently, they just unlock new units and give them some bonuses. That's pretty much it.\n- Diplomacy is pretty much non-existent, the AI is too passive\n- Aliens are glorified barbarians, they can be dangerous early on when expanding but the building Ultrasonic Fence does not allow them to enter your territory so once you have that done in your city they are even weaker barbarians. Your explorers can get immunity from aliens by going 1 tier into Purity and you can easily snipe their nests with explorers.\n- There are no religions in the game, no ideologies, no world congress, no golden age periods, no Natural Wonders. Alpha Centauri had them but Civ: BE does not. You do not feel that you're truly shaping a new society on a new planet.\n- Quests are same pretty much every game. Game designers also call "Constuct buildings, wait a few turn, pick 1 bonus out of 2 for these buildings" a quest. It's a missed opportunity.\n- The wonders in the game are kinda uninteresting. Some of them feel really disappointing like a late game tech wonder that gives you 5 science. And that's it. In Civ5 some wonders were amplifying or enabling certain strategies in certain situations, same was for Alpha Centauri where some wonders were really powerful. In Beyond Earth some wonders are strong, some are weak but in general I feel they are not balanced enough and lack meaningful though.\n- There is no victory screen. There is no Hall of Fame.\n- Victory conditions for different affinities do not feel distinctive enough.\n\nSome of the things developers did right though IMO:\n+ The music is great\n+ Tech web is a great idea but requires a bit of polish and balancing. Right now it's too easy to slingshot to strong techs with some sponsors but in general it's nice\n+ Espionage system I feel is better than in Civ 5, it's not as tedious and allows for some really fun stuff other than tech stealing or election rigging.\n+ Social policies (Virtues) can be developed both deep and wide which allows for some interesting gameplay.\n+ Lots of different improvements, Orbital layer for sattelites to give temporary buffs over tiles\n+ The game has a good feel of actually exploring the planet.\n\n\nI don't agree with the vision developer had for the game. They tried to develop a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri but they missed the most important aspect of Alpha Centauri: it's a rich sci-fi story told through turn-based strategy. Here they have a turn-based strategy with story being a mere afterthought. Hopefully addons and patches will change that in future. All in all I wouldn't recommend this game right now. It feels rushed and unfinished. It should get more patches, more polish and more DLC. I'd recommend to buy it if you see it with a nice discount and wait for DLC's. Civ 5 eventually got good, maybe this game will too.","October 27, 2014","false","16.9"," 215 of 336 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","215","336","0","0"

I can do it peacefully, or battle my opponents. I can coexist with aliens, or wipe them out. I can pick from five different victory conditions to pursue, each with interesting advantages and disadvantages.\n\nOn the downside, starting positions can still be extremely unfair, just like all the previous Civilization games. I can start one game in a large expanse of prime territory, with no adversaries nearby; and I can start another surrounded by aliens, with my expansion blocked by canyons, mountains, and other factions. This can make for very interesting variety, but it can also be very frustrating. Oh, and diplomacy can be just as annoying as other Civilization games.\n\nOverall, the great things about the game offset the bad, at least for my enjoyment.

It feels like Firaxis wanted barbarians with character but instead just made wild animals that keep running in front of your headlights. The aliens didn't feel a part of the game unless you wanted to exploit them later. They just acted as speed bumps that deprived you of vision and map control.\n\nThe Civs or "Sponsors" were faceless pupperteers who came in random specifications and meant that you couldn't read your enemy or plan ahead.

List is long and horrific. Hilariously overpowered Trade routing, utterly inactive aliens (think of really passive barbarians) that also to top it off does not evolve so late game you = Titan, them = lowest level unit which is also passive.\n\nSpying can literally take the capital cities from people and decapitate them outright, you can steal in the tens of thousands of currency even if the AI has 2k at most, in fact this is so broken I ran a game where I solely got income from spying and bought every unit and building outright, who needs production right?\nNo ICBMS in the future, no mass destruction weapons of any kind, no bombers, no subs, and no long range battleships to force players into different reactions, total unification of units.

That mechanic is broken, so you can only launch the game play it and hope to god you finish the game before you would otherwise have to save or you’re boned, also hope you finish before anyone else crashes since you cannot load that would be an automatic restart.\n\nThe game looks beautiful but it is an illusion. The gameplay is wrecked in its current state and only the most fanatic fan can possibly defend the title in its current shape.\n\nHopefully like Civ 5, this game will dramatically improve when patches and expansions hit but for ponying up a premium for this triple A title is a joke in its current state.\n\nAlso the "response" from developers has left a lot to be desired.","October 29, 2014","false","81.9"," 119 of 181 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","119","181","0","1"

I would recommend this game, but with reservations.\n\nBE is alot like CIV 5, in that it started out well but left people who had been overwhelmed by the complexity of CIV 4 confused.  BE is a good base from which to start, but it screams for expansions, in many of the same ways CIV 5 did.  One's navy consists of two boats....sad, but similar to Vanilla CIV 5.  The terrain needs pizzazz, some really weird alien shiznit or vibrant colors to jazz it up.  Also, rather than having the aliens behave pretty much like slightly differentiated barbarians, add something like GRAVEMIND or a massive hive system which plays into the affinity system.\n\nThat much being said, I enjoyed the new additions.  The affinities are different, though I feel like they could use a little something extra, perhaps an enhanced sense of exclusiveness.  Most of the reviews on here ignored the new orbital system, which is probably the best innovation in the game.  The auto upgrades were also nice, as they saved tons of shekels and time.  Plus I really like the vast array of new tile upgrades you can set your workers to build, though some appear annoyingly late and few are affinity specific.\n\nSo overall, I like and continue to play this game.  However, I REALLY look forward to DLC because it still needs work.  Is it a beta realeased early, an insult to gamers, or Gaddafi in programming form? No.  Is it the most brilliant game ever made? Not Yet.

But other game mechanics just don't exist (yet, I'm sure they will add DLC for them later). Religion, culture wars/tourism, great works, great people, and world congress all do not presently exist in BE and have no replacement mechanics. The number of military units is less than those found in vanilla Civ V as well.\n\nThe tech web is probably the greatest concept of BE, but I didn't understand why until I actually used it. It allows players to diversify and focus on wonders other players will never even attempt to go for, and it rewards players that focus on one "branch" of the web as opposed to Civ V where everyone was researching the same techs and fighting over the same wonders all the time. In BE you can research only the branches of the web you want, and games can end long before all of the tech web has been researched.\n\nUnfortunately, the tech web by itself isn't the game. For all the beautiful graphics and (much appreciated) game optimization done, it feels like there is less game content here than there was in the original Civ V at its launch. There's only 8 "civs" but most of the original V AI was carried over with all it's idiosyncracies and inability to win without ignoring all the game rules. The AI itself is not as dangerous either, and presently seems to be bugged so that it will only ever use ~20% of its forces at a given time. Any Civ veteran will be capable of beating the highest Apollo difficulty AI in a straight up normal game on any map 1v1 once they understand BE's mechanics.\n\nCiv BE is a good game in of itself, but I'd suggest waiting for a steep sale or the inevitable steep discount when major DLC gets released. The single-player AI will make for an unsatisfying challenge for Civ V veterans and the multiplayer will only lead to a hopeless waste of many hours per failed game.","November 30, 2014","true","102.5"," 190 of 303 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","190","303","3","0"

Game is very disappointing. Feel like i got excited over a game that had much more to offer but failed to deliver. Read the reviews, there are many pros and cons.\n\nPros-\nif you're new to civ then yes, it is a great game. Satellites provide a interesting mechanic along with the virtue system. Tech web is interesting but ultimately it is linear. Choosing your starting options is a great touch which will allow for more strategic gameplay. exploring is a little fun since you have to send your explorer back to a city to restock its module to excavate.\n\nCons-\nDoesnt really matter who you start out with, most starting choices are useless. Aliens are weak and feel too passive. You have unit classes : land melee, ranged, armor, artillery, ship,and plane....as you grow in affinity they upgrade into stronger versions. Makes combat a little boring because you cant really have a diverse army. AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ still. Trade is OP. Most game mechanics are taken from civ5 and i'd honestly rather play it than BE.\n\nOverall it is a vanilla civ5 to me. Would have liked to see affinity unit upgrades more diverse like purity gets boosts geared toward offense, supremecy gets slight offensive/defensive, and harmony toward offense or something like that but in the end all units of each tier are the same no matter which way you go...just the skin is different. BE still has a long way to go. I would recommend you wait til the game gets more interesting because right now its really not.

This game simply lacks the charm of extraterrestrial exploration. It's not easy to pinpoint what, exactly, is wrong with it: maybe it's the lack of AC's narrative elements that popped up after each significant achievement of your faction. Maybe it's because we have nations again instead of factions. Or perhaps it's because the aliens are not menacing at all - once you've researched some basic upgrades, you can steamroll over anything but sea giants, and those are pretty passive. So BE basically boils to good old faction vs. faction warfare.\nPlus, compared to AC, this game is very simplistic. Domestic policies with special bonuses and drawbacks? Not anymore! Because all players love Civ5 culture advancements that are strictly positive and boil down to "+5% to military unit strength", right? Of course, option to design your own units is also gone, as well as psi-combat. Everything is as simplified as possible.\nAnd the most baffling design decision of all involves affinities: they are not mutually exclusive! So you can be a human purist who aspires to become a half-alien hybrid while modding himself with cybernetic augmentations to high heavens. And of course, descriptions (for example, in diplomacy screens) never acknowledge how ridiculous this monstrosity is.

I don't like it. All the problems of the base game havent been fixed and therefore cannot recommend. It also managed to be released with bugs and worse balance thant the base game.\n\nEdit: Even after 2 patchs the game is still shallow. Patches are very slow to come, some easily fixable issues aren't fixed and the patches have brought their lot of bugs and poorly thought changes.\n\nNot recommended.\n\nI have played around 80 hours of this game and after playing multiple times on max difficulty (Apollo), I can safely say that I would not recommend the game in its current state. I've finally managed to break my personal record with a turn 145 standard speed victory with Harmony due to the massive amount of oversights the game has.\n\nRight now a ton of features are imbalanced or broken which is very problematic in a strategy game. Let's list them here:\n-Trade routes are either too numerous, too strong or both. The ability to spam cities just to increase trade route that will imediately pay for themselves is fundamentaly broken. Their strength belittle a lot of other mechanics making them the only real strategic purpose.\n\n-The mechanic supposed to slow expansion doesn't work and is ineffective (health). The panalities for expanding are laughable in comparison to the benefits. The system to get health is anyway badly designed as this is a global ressource mostly acquired through local bonuses... this makes it very hard to get positive without investing virtues. But at the same time it's very easy to stay positive since you can spam local health until you reach each city threshold.\n\n-The main strategy due to those two previous points is to just spam cities and trade routes. But trade route interface is horrible making the only relevant strategy a hassle to play.\n\n-The UI is worse that the previous game. For no reason. The scales are wrong, colors are terrible and the iconic way of representing buildings units and technologies is lazy. It's very hard to know at a glance what an icon represents. It's a shame considering the wonderful art design of Civ 5.\n\n-The terrain tiles are very hard to distinguish at a glance from one another, especially in fungal maps. You can activate Tile Yields or play with a mod to help for this though.\n\n-The 3 affinities were presented as 3 very different objectives but they are basically all a form of a science victory. Just get the required techs, build the wonder, wait and win. Exit, culture victory, diplomatic victory. Now you have Domination, 3 science victories and Contact is basically a luck victory if you find the right artifacts....\n\n-The game is incredulously easy to beat even on the hardest difficulty. The AI is pathetic, not agressive enough and still awful at fighting wars.\n\n-The spy system that was advertised as deeper than civ5 is weak. It takes way too long to use the additional options from spies unless you use an exploit. And even it's not very interesting.\n\n-Favors, advertised as a way to manipulate AI ended up falling flat. It's only purpose is to exploit the AI to get many loans of gold.\n\n-A quest system is in the game but some quests are bugged and many decisions in them are just stupid bonuses that never feel like a choice due to the terrible balance of the options.\n\n-No civilization leaders, lack of soul. No leader introductions with voiceovers, barely any context.\n\n\nThere are some stuff I like:\n-Combat animations and unit models\n-Outpost mechanics\n-Artifacts\n-The tech tree and virtue tree\n\nBut that is it. And sadly the rest make it an unworthy challenge for any strategy fan.\n\nIt's really with astonishing wonder that they got so much stuff wrong after 5 years of civ5. A game that was heavily copied to get this one.\n\nIf you have never played Civilization 5, please buy Civilization 5 Complete instead of Civ:BE. It's a way more interesting product. It has some issues but you will find a lot more appealing than this one. If youre a fan of Civ5 but are a little bored this may entertain you for 50hours or so but be warned.\n\nThis review was made with v1.0 Maybe some patches will fix some of my issues... maybe.","November 19, 2014","false","131.6"," 38 of 49 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","38","49","0","0"

I enjoyed my time with it so far, and I believe it's a solid addition to the 4x genre.\n\nYet, it has drawn a lot of criticism from gamers. I think the main "problem" of Beyond Earth is that it carries the legacy of not only one, but _two_ immensely popular games (Alpha Centauri, and Civ 5), and it cannot really pull ahead of either of those.\n\nBE borrows most of its mechanics directly from Civ 5. They just got renamed - "happiness" became "health", "gold" became "energy", etc. Most mechanics of the Civ 5 expansions were not included in BE, which is a problem for many Civ 5 players, who tend to think that the expansions were what made Civ 5 enjoyable. BE does try to add some new things: The tech web allows very flexible research strategies. The victory conditions are new ideas, fit the setting, and are mechanically solid. The "orbital layer" adds tactical depth (but seems underused). So the innovation _is_ there, but only in some details, so veteran Civ 5 players will still get the feeling that they "lost" the Civ 5 expansion content and are basically playing an elaborate mod of the Civ 5 base game.\n\nBE borrows most of its _setting_ from its spiritual predecessor, Alpha Centauri. It can't use the exact same setting due to legal issues, but the parallels are obvious. Unfortunately, the setting is BE's weakest point. Where Alpha Centauri featured interesting characters, an overarching story of the planet's exploration, and a clash of ideologies that permeated every fiber of the game (down to leaders providing voiceovers with ideologically colored, well written comments about researched technologies), BE feels surprisingly bland in that regard. It feels as if the devs didn't even try to flesh out the setting, but just took some civs from Civ 5 and reskinned the leaders. Coincidentally, there is currently another 4x game on the market (Endless Legend) which has its strengths exactly in the lore and atmosphere aspects, which makes BE's shortcomings in that regard all the more obvious.\n\nUnfortunately, BE also fails to correct that one major flaw of "Alpha Centauri" - the weak AI. The game sticks to the "one unit per tile" paradigm from Civ5, and the AI still can't handle it. The AI is incapable of positioning its forces efficiently, it doesn't read the terrain well, and it still cannot plan ahead simple movements. I've seen units being sent into certain death because the pathfinding insisted to send them through miasma tiles when other options were available. I've seen the same unit going back and forth a dozen times when I simply opened or blocked a passage. I've seen AI units sitting uselessly on the same spot for ages. I've seen the AI sacrificing a dozen planes to my interceptors instead of using the "sweep" mission just once. I've seen an AI from another continent first sending a colonist to mine, then settling there without sending any units, and then (after I conquered the outpost) asking for peace and offering me one third of their empire: a full-fledged city on their continent, that I hadn't even discovered yet, so I posed no threat to that AI whatsoever.\n\nThat said, if you strip away the legacy of Civ 5 and Alpha Centauri, then BE is quite a decent game. It still has complex gameplay (just don't focus on what was "lost" compared to the other games), it still has an interesting setting (just don't focus on how SMAC's setting was much more enticing), it does bring interesting new things to the table. It _is_ very enjoyable as a 4x game, the mechanics are solid, and it's not as bug-ridden as new 4x games tend to be.\n\nSince the game itself seems decent, BE's "not being able to escape its legacy" issue would probably not be much of a problem _if_ the game were priced accordingly, at perhaps 30€. With an initial price tag of 50€, though, I think people started focusing on what BE is not, instead of appreciating what it is. Coincidentally, it's on sale for 30€ now, and I believe that it's worth that. It would probably have received a much warmer welcome if it had been offered for that price from the start.","January 17, 2015","true","115.8"," 46 of 63 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","46","63","0","5"

If you're expecting something revolutionary and different then you might want to wait for this one to go on sale so it's comparably priced to a DLC or an expansion and continue to patiently wait for Civilization VI, which Beyond Earth is not.\n\nIf you want a solid 4x game with great graphics, a gorgeous color palette, beautiful map terrain and cool resources, immersive music, an interesting premise, and chock full of sci-fi references, then you'll probably enjoy this. I can't stop playing it, I just want to test out all the new victory types and see what all the units look like after upgrades attached to each of game's the three affinities. Even though much of the game -- from the UI to the AI -- feels familiar, there's enough that's fresh that you have to pay attention to the details. And I keep finding myself pleasantly surprised by the new stuff I discover.

Once you accept that though, the tasks you can do become a nice little addition to the game and a way to earn extra bonuses while you're playing.\n\nOn the down side, the end-game tends to drag a bit, and some of the victory conditions have "false summits" in which you think you are almost there but then find out that you have to have to jump through hoops for another 50 turns in order to actually win.\n\nI wish there were some more statistical and information options for those of us who like to really delve deeply in our strategy games and think things through completely before committing to a path. I also wish there were more incentives to cooperate with the other colonies, like science and economic boosts for signing cooperation agreements. I'd have liked more emphasis on science, perhaps via the ability to enter into research agreements through diplomacy or the ability to trade techs like in earlier Civ games.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the fact that I played the game for over 40 hours in less than a week speaks to its value, at least in my eyes. It's not perfect, but it's a lot of fun and it definitely has that "one more turn" factor that makes it a solid addition to the Civ family.","October 28, 2014","true","78.1"," 335 of 556 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","335","556","0","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/65980/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","I remember a news feature on a guy who has been playing a game of Civilization 2 for the past ten years. The world had been reduced to three factions, each in perpetual war and every single turn over a hundred nuclear devices would be produced and detonated. The game was a total stalemate and the planet had been reduced to an uninahibtable ball of dirt.\n\nBeyond Earth proposes the outcome of the end of the world. Beyond Earth picks up right where the science victory (or the nuclear holocaust) has left the planet. The world has suffered a horrible man-made calamity and now the people flee to the stars in order to find a new home. You take control of a sponsored faction. Make planetfall on a planet with an above average sustainability and you begin to colonise.\n\nBeyond Earth essentially is just Civ 5 with a very elaborate reskin, but there is more to it than that. The standard Civ games retell the journey of mankind through the ages. Beyond earth explored the unknown; the final frontier, and with it come some new considerations. For instance, your faction will need to make decisions regarding the local wildlife, refugees from less fotunate factions and most importantly: the local wildlife. Unlike earth, where the occasional barbarian would kidnap your workers, the planet pays host to a remarable menagerie of extra terrestial horrors. From the small wolf beetle to the awe inspiring siege worms; your military's first task will be to control the monsters, before you seek to undo your fellow humans.\n\nBecause you're in the future now you'll no longer be inventing things like the wheel or dynamite. We're taking gene splicing and nano technology here. The tech tree has been refurbished into the tech web. Your choice for military R&D might eventually lead you away from sustainability or prosperity or vice versa. You can choose your own technological agenda.\n\nEventually, you'll have to decide how the human race will proceed. The game introduces an affinity system. You can pursue Purity, Supremacy or Harmony. Each affinity brings its own boons. As purist, you'll maintain humanity the Warhammer way; by shunning any and all foreign and alien influences to your technology or biology. It paves the way for incredible weapons and amazingly polarised world views. Supremacists fuse their bodies and minds with machines. The result is an efficient human race that seeks to remove any and all inefficiencies. Even if that means getting rid of biological components all together. Harmonists seek to use the new world and its bounties to their adavantage and eventually evolve to be at home in the hostile world. Each affinity comes with its own special victory. The purists claim the new world as their own, while the supremasists travel to earth to upgrade the people there. The harmonists transcend humanity as collective hivemind with the planet itself. Each victory requires a vastly different approach to resource and tech management, as well the application of your forces. The supremacists need to sacrifice their troops to subjugate the population on earth, while harmonists will want to keep their assets close to defend their cities before transcendence is achieved.\nNaturally, you can still just destroy all your enemies like back in the olden days with military might. Or you can go for a more peaceful solution and attempt to make first contact. The new world is open to any and all options.\n\nThe whole newness is what makes this game so different then. It still works the same; turn based, resources, explore, dumb AI who can't value a deal. However, everything is new and looks differently. It is really hard to come to terms with unknown and in the first few games you play you'll be wondering if you're doing it right. In fact, even after a few turns you're wondering why the AI has such a great health record and why your cities are dying from disease and malnourishment. The game also lost a tick in its pace. Somehow it feels slower. Between the many new technologies, you won't notice much of a change until you reach a certain level of affinity. It makes your actions seem useless and it kind of ruins the game as it slips into its fourth quarter. The late game units are a blast to use when you can, simply because of their insane proportions, but it takes too long to get them, and you won't have much time to use them.\n\nAll in all, Beyond Earth is very familliar, but at the same time so outlandish and new that you'll feel like you're exploring new worlds. It's a nice change of pace when you're fed up with racing to build pyramids and stonehenge. The aliens allow for a more active use of your military than in regular Civ and that is a nice step up. However, the crash in pace might turn some people away. If you like Civ and sci fi, then this is certainly for you.","January 10, 2015","true","45.0"," 187 of 304 people (62%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","62","187","304","32","0"

For example, the virtue system is a bit better than the Civ 5 civic choices, but instead of city states, you get stations which are only good for trading with.   The enemy AIs have no personality.  This is NOT a remake of Alpha Centari, not by a long strech.  At best this is nothing more than a mod for Civ 5.  The AI is just as dumb and the diplomatic AI makes no sense whatsoever.  You might as well not even have diplomacy.\n\nThe Ugly:  If there was an Alpha Centari mod for Civ 5, it would be a better game in almost every other way.\n\nIf you like games like Civilization and do not own Civ 5, then buy it with all the DLC for less money than this game with no DLC.  You will get a much better game.  I sure hope they fix this game and make it good, but as it stands in its current state (I am not talking about bugs, but game design), its garbage.

I don't know why I would recommend any game for that purpose, though.\n\nTechnical problems:\nTrade routes have an arbitrary and obscure value determination.  Trade routes are still clunky to renew.  Trade routes received a total redesign after complaints of absolute imbalance ....  resulting in their being arbitrary and strange, and will continue to spiral into weirdness without some solid sense of what they're supposed to even be.\nThe affinity quest bug persists.\nUnit combat is fundamentally imbalanced.\nWonders do not even do anything.  This is not hyperbole - they literally do not function.\nTitanium is imba.\nMiasma continues to defy the interface, forbidding intuitive options like "wake when miasma starts killing this unit."\n\nAesthetic problems:\nYou don't love the planet, you don't love the leaders.  You don't even love your own civ.  You cannot care less about what's going on.  The alien taming is a novelty, not enjoyable.\nHealth dominates the entirety of the virtues decision tree, strategically speaking.  There is nothing but Prosperity into Colonist into health virtues.\n\nIf you want to roleplay.... roleplay with what?  The leaders aren't psychotic (as much)... but they still can't express any personality because there's nothing to express it in.  There is no diplo interaction.  This game has no luxes so there's just one -less- thing to pretend to mutually support each other about.\nAnd the irony being that the entirety of gameplay involves building, as rapidly as you can, an industrial complex that exploits every hexagonal inch of the planet's surface... because that's all there is to the game.  There are no subcity elements to contend with.  No sustainability problems.  No corruption or empire contentment.  The affinities actually have no natural animosity for each other, the A.I.s just act like they do.\n\nSci-fi is cool.  4X is cool.  And Civilization maintains its certain style of branding that comes through in the tone of things, in the character designs, in the  look-and-feel of the advanced gameplay elements - the "wow cool" of the components that comes from the designers' enthusiasm.

Don't really understand why, when Civ fanbase is the most patient fanbase I know.\n\nThe most egregious example, is the lack of support of HDTV's, or the now infamous "120 Hz resolution problems", a problem that doesn't and didn't exist for ANY other Firaxis product.\n\nMy review in just one sentence : The game had a lot of potential and it is evident that developpers had ambitious goals with the title, but when playing the final product, one can't help but feel as if large parts of the game  got hacked out or never finished.\n\n\nI'll elaborate on that :\n\nFor example, there are a lot of technologies and it is fun to explore them, but some technologies only offer one building and an affinity boost and nothing else. It feels  as if a part of the team did their job and the other didn't.\nAlso, speaking of technologies, the "Tech web" or technology tree is non-intuitive and is nearly impossible to spot out wonders (unless you look closely at the cost of the building).\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, there is a severe lack of polish (again, this adds to the feeling that BE was rushed) with very few voice over work, lackluster wonders, boring Diplomacy interface and lackluster victory screens.\n\nAlso, it seems that some mechanics were rushed (the favor and intrigue mechanic) and didn't reach their full or intended potential. The "favor" mechanic for example, is basically a new currency when trading with an AI. It should help you force trades that would otherwise be impossible or very expensive, but in the end, a favor point basically amounts to about 50 energy. That's it.\n\n\nI hope future patches or expansion packs will help Beyond Earth reach its full potential, but everyone that has pre-ordered the game, like me, are left dissapointed and most of all frustrated that this game wasn't given more attention/money.\n\nDON'T BUY, wait for a better game and get the (inevitable) GOTY/definitive edition or whatever... and NEVER preorder.","October 26, 2014","false","62.8"," 115 of 182 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","115","182","0","1"

The graphics looked good; I liked the music a lot. But after some turns (about 100 or so) I realized there was NOTHING NEW about this game. For me it is a HUGE DEJA VU of Alpha Centauri.\n\nAfter being such a succesful game programmer, I really expected Sid Meier and Firaxis to turn up with something NEW; something innovative; something we hadn't seen before. I didn't expect this cheap program recycling. Because that is what it is, disguised in some modern graphics and sleeker design.\n\n- The aliens are boring. They're more of an obstacle on the road you just need to get rid of.\n- The landscape isn't very "beyond Earth". Except for some exotic resources, boring alien insects and fish and a greenish fog, I don't see anything "beyond".\n- What's with the resource pods? What the hell? Is that all the game designers could come up with for this "beyond Earth" world?!?! How boring and unimaginative! What about some alien technologies hidden in artifacts? Or strange ruins of civilizations long since disappeared? Nooooo: resource pods, abandoned outposts and bones. That's very, very "beyond"...\n- I got HUGELY irritated by the stupid, moronic, illogical and backwards "diplomacy" in the single player game. The diplomatic behaviour of the other faction's "AI" is erratic at the very least. Wars are declared, condemnations are spoken for NO apparant reason but some random algorithm. The "forgiveness" in the diplomatic area when it comes to covert ops is extremely one-sided and highly undervalued compared to the "AI's" blatant and ongoing incursions despite made promises or demands. It is highly unbalanced, illogical and stupid. There is nothing "I" in the AI...\n\nThis will probably be the last time I ever spend money on a Sid Meier's recycled game.

I was NOT as big of a fan of Alpha Centauri as many of the other games, but I was really excited nontheless. TL:DR: I went back and forth multiple times on whether or not to give this a positive. If you're a fan of the series, buy it, you'll have fun, but be a little disappointed. On the other hand, some newcomers to turn-based might be able to stomach this.\n\nObservationsFirst thing you'll notice when you download this game is the size - only 2-something gigabytes. That will be nice for those without a solid internet connection.\n\nUnfortunately, that size hints at one of the biggest problems I have with this game.  There seems to be a general lack of quality artwork. Dating back to Civ 2 (my first, which I played when I was 9) I loved the animations, music, and artwork associated with technologies, wonders, and ultimately, victory. (Probably a bigger deal as a kid) Games back then made up for the inability to create kickass graphics with awesome animations, graphics, and audio as rewards along the way. Age of Empires 1 was the same way.\n\nNowadays, the work goes into nice 3d gameplay, but the artwork, lore, and music just aren't there. The older Civ games put tons of time into writing beautiful descriptions and background for each technology and game concept. In BE, it's mostly short blurbs. Technology has no real artwork.\n\nWonders are even worse, only having some vague blueprint thing and short clip of text. I have no idea what I built most of the time, and the bonuses are spotty and generally uninspiring.\n\nVictories are similarly lacking in artwork. The glorious travel to Alpha Centauri featured in all the other Civ installments is replaced by a quote and kind of crappy artwork. This is especially sad since the authors had so much potential to work with. Some compelling storylines with clear conclusions would have also been nice.\n\nPositivesThe world itself is beautiful, done much better than Alpha Centauri in my opinion. It was a joy to play in. Units are designed well, and it is bright. Alpha Centauri's interface was always a little dark for me.\nTutorial system - Yeah yeah, a little annoying at times, but I thought the click-through tutorials that pop up were really well done, and might help casual gamers get past the initial curve.\nUnit progression - I like that units aren't just obsoleted, but that they are carried through the game and automatically upgraded. The unit experience system is MUCH better in BE; they split out the experience system from V and made the more impactful decisions global\nTech Tree - The tech tree in Beyond Earth is less linear than any that I've seen, and it gives a lot of freedom for advancement. My strategy is usually to go balls-to-the-wall science, and get an age up on my competitors in order to blow them away with modern technology. Not so straightforward this time around, and I like that.\nCivilization concept - Instead of civilizations with their own bonuses, the player chooses their 'race' based on the technology choices they make, and gain unique units as a result. I think I like it, but at the same time, it was an easy way for them to get out of making a lot of quality art. Reminded me of Planetside 2.\nIntrigue  - I  liked the diplomacy concept. Stealing tech is actually pretty useful. I wish it would show the tech popup when I discover a technology by stealing it though.More NegativesThe diplomacy was lame, characters were downright uninspiring. I never got offers for anything other than 'favors' from the AI\nThe trade system has some cool concepts, but my biggest gripe is that it seems WAY overpowered. Close to the end of the game, I could build a settlement literally anywhere and have it capable of building almost any unit in a couple turns. There was also never a good reason for me to trade with one of the outposts or another civilization.\nWhen I play $50+ for a game, I expect replay value. One way that the older civs achieved this was with a high-score system that would berate you for how crappy you were. I miss that. No such mechanic here. Tell me how bad I am!\nThis probably won't affect most of you, but as someone who has been gaming with Eyefinity (3 monitor setup) for the last few years, I'm getting really tired of companies calling a game 'Eyefinity approved' and slapping an AMD logo on it when in reality they have done nothing of the sort. It plays fine with Eyefinity (and I imagine nVidia Surround) but the interfaces are on the far left and right. So I'm always looking back and forth. It would have been SO easy for them to allow the UI to be centered on the middle display.ConclusionOverall, I enjoyed it, but I'm not about to go play another game right now. I would recommend that you all buy it when it comes around for $10 this summer, then give it a play-through.","October 26, 2014","false","38.9"," 117 of 186 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","117","186","0","0"

The game is far more tactical, which will please long-time strategy game players. The alien worlds are gorgeously detailed and provide new challenges to players. The integrated quest system serves to highten your game experience by giving you opportunities to mould your civilisation beyond the endless build, expand, build gameplay of previous Civilization entries, thereby allowing a great deal of customisation. Alien life is complex enough to be pleasing and genuinely terrifying if you don't keep an eye on alien nests.\n\nDiplomatic functions are exactly the same as Civ V's, which is not a surprise given that BE is built on the same engine - there are some expanded functions but nothing inherently noteworthy. Future expansions might play with diplomacy a bit but for now, if you've played Civ V, you know exactly how to run the diplomatic system.\n\nThe Virtue system works incredibly well. Gone are the nine policy trees - you now have four, called Virtues, but they are divided into three tiers, and completing each tier gives you significant bonuses. This allows the game to acheive a far more interesting level of complexity than Civ V's policies. You can choose to max out a Virtue tree, or mix it up a bit depending on needs. Each tree is as viable as one another, so gone are the days of maxing Patronage to secure an easy win.\n\nThe technology web, so highly touted by Firaxis, is implemented well. Each technology has high strategic value, and Firaxis did well to incorporate Harmony, Supremacy and Purity points throughout the tree. You don't need to research everything, and in fact can research any branch at any time - no need to wait forever for that one technology that will confer that bonus you've wanted since turn one.\n\nThere are some slight graphical issues, but those will be fixed in an upcoming patch. Tiles can and will flicker occassionally, which gets annoying, and the only way to fix it is to save and reload the game. It's not a huge deal though - the rest of the game is beautifully polished.\n\nDon't be surprised if this is the AAA game of the year. 10/10.","October 23, 2014","true","64.5"," 291 of 484 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","291","484","0","5"

From the announcements, it was supposed to be a SMAC spiritual successor. What we were given is a re-skin of Civilization V with lackluster writing and shoddily-coded stubs instead of new features.\n\nHere is a short list of most annoying problems.\n\nAffinities, one of the core elements of the game, are poorly thought out and implemented. There is nothing that prevents you from trying to max out all three of them, but the AI will only count the highest one and chastise you for your choice even if you have more points in their chosen affinity than them. Other than that and requiring different resources, they don't change your gameplay too much. Harmony doesn't make you more at tune with the planet; in fact, you will probably kill more aliens than ever, because their nests tend to spawn on Xenomass which you need for your units. Supremacy and terraformation don't upset aliens one bit and one of the first bonuses you get actually make them never attack your explorers, Beyond the flavor, all three paths to victory are pretty much the old Spaceship victory.\n\nAliens are a non-factor. They will rarely ever attack your units and won't go through your borders most of the time. Once I were taking potshots at the siege worm with ranged units for about 30 turns and it seemed content to just wander around and mind its business. I'm not sure why they are even in game, because they certainly don't hinder or help the player in any way.\n\nBraindead, passive AI. It doesn't explore too well, expands quite slowly and doesn't even try to compete for resources. It also doesn't engage in any meaningful diplomacy. Three leaders will repeatedly pester you with cooperation and open borders treaties, speaking the same line every time. The rest will almost never interact with you except to complain about some random things (like removing miasma from your own city or exploring Progenitor ruins beyond their borders which they didn't touch since the beginning of the game). Sometimes they also ask you for free stuff. They will rarely, if ever, go to war. When they do, they tend to never send enough units to even make a dent in your city. You can spend an entire game just sitting in your corner of the world and researching technologies, never having to fight anyone.\n\nBlandness and bad writing. Building a wonder usually gets you something that looks like a technical outline and +x to Production/Science/Food/something else. Leaders are devoid of any character whatsoever and you won't get any information about them without actively searching for them in Civilopedia. The devs promised the characters' appearance will change with each path and it kinda does - they wear slightly different clothes. The factions are: Space Russia, Space France, Space USA, Space Brasil, Space China, Space India, Space Australia and Space Africa. There are 5 different ways to win the game, except that 4 of them are pretty much the same one but requiring different techs and buildings.\nTo sum it all up, the game simply isn't worth $50. I could maybe justify buying it for this price if it actually had decent, but unpolished content that needs a few patches and maybe an expansion to fully shine. The main problem with Beyond Earth is that it doesn't actually show much potential - the new core features simply don't work out and the poor quality of the game content suggests it was done on a budget. It's better to wait until it's cheaper.","October 27, 2014","false","19.4"," 95 of 149 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","95","149","0","0"

There is nothing "beyond" about this game. Damned near every feature that one expects from a Civilizations title is inexplicably missing in this itteration.\n\nAnd there is absolutely no reason for it.\n\nWhat Firaxis has offered is a stable late-beta "demo" game for $49.99. As a finished product. There is so much missing that you can't help but notice them and mention to yourself that you'll see 'em in the later "expansion" DLCs. Which means this lackluster game was purposefuly made, as is, to be geared towards taking more of your money just so the player can have the things that have been expected and seen in past Civilizations base games.\n\nI no longer trust this company for producing good product. Xcom showed us the direction they're going and Beyond Earth confirmed it.\n\nOther game companies out there (notably Iceberg Interactive and Stardock Games) are producing better, prettier and smarter strategy games for fractions of Firaxis' production costs. These same companies also have a history of providing quick updates and extra material free. Their DLC's of the past have always been expansions of already well crafted games.\n\nAny Beyond Earth DLCs will not be expansions, but finalization of game mechanics and artwork that should have already been in there.\n\nThe game is bland. It has next to no honest replay value. There is no "push" nor needful purpose for finishing the game. Consequently you'll find yourself quickly bored.\n\nThe AI is more or less a joke, their drive-by diplomatic messages become incredibly annoying and are quickly nonsensical in most contexts that they're delivered in. The AI's use of military units on the harder difficulties are a study in confusion, especially accounting for the fact that there aren't that many unit variations.\n\nFaction choices (Civilizations) are appalling. They're not distinctive. The larger maps will leave one or two factions out in the ♥♥♥ end of nowhere. Adding more factions to counter that means having clones, which will definitely knock immersion.\n\nAbility choices that are used to set apart your factions from others really don't accomplish the job. Too many choices aren't good ones, compelling the player to choose from the same set. So you'll be seeing the different factions making the same variation of choices you do in multi-player.\n\nThe story enters with a whimper and then quietly dies. But that's okay because you barely notice its passing anyway.\n\nI told myself and I told others that I wouldn't be getting this game on launch. They really dropped the ball on Xcom but I figured, "Hey, it's a Civ game...there is no way they'd screw that up!".\n\nI was wrong. To my vast sorrow.\n\nThis game is a blatant cash grab. You'll be required to purchase DLC's for the many, oh so many, features they purposely left out.\n\nGoodbye, Firaxis.","November 9, 2014","false","875.6"," 53 of 77 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","53","77","0","2"

There are a lot of little things done wrong and I’ll try to hit on a couple as concisely as I can, addressing people familiar with Civ5.\n\nOne of the problems is your opponents don’t start the game on the map, they drop in randomly at later turns. The same is true with this games version of city-states called outposts. So when you’ve explored at little like other Civ games you start to think about where your second city will go, but it’s extremely unlikely you’ll get to put one there without a fight because of outposts popping up. Instead of just worrying about other nations building a colony unit and grabbing the land you wanted, you have to deal with that plus cities and outposts popping up literally anywhere. All Civ games are random, but this adds a dynamic randomness that is just annoying.\n\nAnother thing is the map is filled with “miasma,” which is green fog that damages units. It makes the game more tedious exploring and colonizing especially with the large amount of aliens (barbarians) floating around. You can also gain the ability to make this miasma not harmful to your units. But, even when your units are immune to it your automated workers will still clear it from tiles when it can only benefit you if your opponents aren’t immune to it. This just shows a lack of polish they were starting to gain in the series.\n\nEven little things like the quotes when you gain technology or build wonders aren’t as good. In the games where the quotes were tied to historical figures they were a lot more interesting. The made up quotes try to be funny or show personality but are mostly just stupid and don’t add to the flavor of the game.\n\nAnother issue is all the buildings have secret abilities that you don’t know until you build one. Like you get to pick between two resources that all of the buildings of this type will produce. If you knew that ahead of time you might have chosen what buildings to build in a different order. As it is there is just more things to remember for the next game if you want to get good and play the game smart.\n\nThe fluid technology paths just add to the sense that you’d really have to play the game a ton of times to make good choices on which order to do your research.\n\nIt’s not complete crap, but it compares poorly to other Civ games in pretty much every way it is different.","June 15, 2015","false","45.6"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","33","43","0","0"

In theory, it is really cool.  I like how you can shape your playstyle and it is reflected in your units/buildings/victory type.  However, it really becomes apparent that if you are going to go for a specific victory, you really need to know that right at the start.  It doesn't really allow for adaptive gameplay.\n\nMilitarily, I find that it also makes the game suffer.  The biggest advancements come from seeking a specific affinty right from the get-go.  Choosing a research becomes a game of "Which _____ would be quickest" just to get a (devastatingly good) unit upgrade.  Again, you become really locked into what you choose right at the beginning.\n\nCiv 5, I felt, was completely polished by the last expansion; and it's kind of a shame that they didn't apply everything that was learned from that to this addition to the series.  Leaving out certain things such as the religion system or U.N.

It's easy to praise and speak highly of something, but to give a fair and honest overview is another thing entirely.\n\nThe leader choice, although not particulary very important, is limited. Seeing the same couple faces every game is a bit of a letdown, but not a real detriment. The look and feel also is very similar to Civ 5. It feels like a glorified reskin when it comes to the basic look of the game.\n\nOn a neutral standpoint, the game is also very challenging. If you are coming here from Civ 5, prepare to be overwhelmed. Though I personally find this to be a good thing. A high skill ceiling means it will keep you entertained for many many hours to come.\n\nNow, onto the sugary bits. The most shining thing this game offers is its customization. It's as if they took Civs system, stripped it down to the bare bones, and gave the players the ability to customize their Civ to the T. You can be a focused empire or a hybrid empire and it is quite effective. The tech tree is overwhelming, but golden and offers so much creative freedom. Every game you will pick and choose the flavor of techs that matches your situation best. Mix and match to achieve what you deem worthy as the perfect Civ.\n\nSome say this should have been a Civ 5 expansion. I disagree. It has it's own standalone atmosphere, and offers one of the most flexible and robust tech trees i've ever seen in a 4x (And I'm a huge Endless Legend/Space fanboy). The music is also delicious, and the game flows very smoothly.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

All the voice acting is done by one person regardless of who the quote comes from.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED. I AM VERY SAD I SPENT ANY MONEY ON THIS.\n\nINTERFACE\n\nThe interface is extremely lackluster, with very poor choices about how to navigate through menus. Even the menu design itself looks boring. All the icons are flat puesdo-gray scale images that would look better on a mobile app than in a AAA game. The trade route interface does not sort to maximize by science, energy, food, or production (as it did in Civ 5) and every 15 turns you have to renew each trade route, which becomes a huge time waste when you have 4 trade routes per city in the mid to late game. Trying to send people through the earth domination gate requires you to send military units one at a time for ~20 turns or so. This is a super frustrating experience.\n\nThis bad UI is pervasive throughout the game. If you highlight the technologies based on a certain type, you can't select anything else but the ones you've filtered by, so you have to go back and unclick it.\n\nMoving a spy around requires multiple clicks through submenus when it should just be a single one.\n\nThe workers seem much, much stupider than the ones in Civ 5. I've seen them get stuck multiple times while multiples are automated near each other, and they will bankrupt you with the -6 maintence improvement if you don't watch them. They also don't proiritize maglevs at all, which are just railroads from Civ 5.\n\nSatilletes\nThis is probably one of the most interesting, and equally dispapointing parts of the game. The satilletes come so late in the technology tree, and have such limited effects, that there are no interesting choices in boosting your production with them. You also can't stack them in any way.\n\nCombat\nThe combat is actually less interesting than in Civ 5 which is pretty painful. I don't know how you take a step back here. There are less units, and you can only upgrade them by researching one of the three foundational systems, and then you upgrade all of them exactly the same way.\n\nResearch\nThe web tech tree is definitely a better setup than the linear one from Civ 5, but because of the three paradigms, it's much less expansive than it looks, you're virtually forced to pickup useless technologies because they happen to have a paradigm increase on them, which is super frustrating.\n\nMISC\n\nWonders have no visible improvement on the city. Energy and health are just money and happiness. The three paradigms of Adaptation, Purity, and Improvement are super boring.

However, this game just doesn't live up to the hype or the reputation that they have worked so hard to build.\n\nWhere to begin with this game. I think the most obvious and perhaps worst aspect of this release is that it is such a thinly veiled clone of Civ 5. I feel ripped off paying $50 for what amounts to little more than a reskinned game from 2010 with a cool intro video. Sure, its fairly pretty, but its so unbelievably dull. I'm baffled that with a concept as fantastic and well-loved by fans they couldn't think up anything even slightly more engaging. There's no wonder videos (static pictures only), no dynamic cities that show the buildings they contain (already done for Civ IV), no interesting AAA voice acting for the tech tree, and paltry number of playable civilizations that differentiate the game exactly not at all. Unit design is also absent, with a very linear affinity-based upgrade system that is extremely unsatisfying next to the fully custom unit design system in Alpha Centauri, which made unit design a combination of economic, technological, and strategic considerations. While trade routes are a cool and immersive idea, they are done so poorly here that I wish they weren't included. Having to reassign these units every few turns makes my blood boil.\n\nThis game was hailed as a "spiritual successor" to Alpha Centauri, but it shares nothing with the original, it's a obviously a functional game, but if you already own Civ V I highly reccomend you just keep on playing and wait for someone to do a real remake, which is what everybody was praying for, but sadly sometimes Sid Meier answers prayers with a resounding NO!\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to go play some Alpha Centauri.","October 29, 2014","false","87.7"," 45 of 65 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","45","65","0","0"

Not worth $50 at all IMO. Plain and simple, the game is boring.\n\n-No matchmaking or anything so you have to play against AI which really isn't that well done. I'm not sure what the devs really expected here... I can't see anyone playing against the one(?) difficulty AI for all that long. If this game had some sort of matchmaking it might be a bit more replayable but the archaic lobby system doesn't offer much in terms of a PvP experience.\n\n-No real attempt to immerse you in the game. Textures, audio, cutscenes, are all average at best. Experience just feels stale and unimportant.\n\n-Going back to my first point there's no real campaign and overall there's just a lack of content and things to do. The "quests" are all shallow and unfun. You're basically playing the same game over and over again against inadequate AI.\n\n-Little bits of innovation here and there that really don't do much to enhance the experience. It's not quite a Civ 5 reskin but what it does try to do doesn't really accomplish anything.\n\n-As far as strategy goes there really isn't any. Just a bunch of meaningless choices. They try to make the game seem "complex" but if you can see through the abitrary number crunching and superflous tech trees then you realize the game is relatively simple and rigid.\n\nOverall just feels like a game that knew it could ride on the name it had already made for itself. Clearly the devs weren't very interested in making this title and it showed. Really just a lack of effort IMO. The game isn't completely terrible but it really isn't worth the $50 and you can find much better games for much less. Save your money, this game isn't anything special, and that's probably being generous.","October 29, 2014","false","20.5"," 53 of 79 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","53","79","0","0"

Just played a game with Vostok (medium) difficulty .\n\nPros:\n- I rather like the unit system. Upgrading the units with affinity levels creates immersion. With a little bit more love it would be great addition.\n- Quests and victory conditions are a good innovation. I like the way you progress through them in several steps.\n- Strategic resources. I find the affinity related resources a good idea. Creates some strategic levels for the game.\n- Wildlife feels immersive.\n- Affinities. Although the factions are bland, the affinities are not.\n\nCons:\n- Game is short. Just finished the first one in 10 hours. Thats bad for a civ game.\n- Wildlife is too weak. By midgame you just overrun them with no consequences attached. Don't know if this one scales up by difficulty levels.\n- The AI doesn't seem to mind you winning the game. It would be great if by the time you start progressing in the victory conditions, the AI would react in some way. This feels like a lost opportunity to create more content to this game. Perhaps something that was cut off to make the deadline?\n- There is no city specialization. Not even on the level of Civ V. You just build everything everywhere. This makes for a bad strategy game.\n- Contact victory seems to be too easy.\n\nGrade for the current state game with the pricetag of 50 euros observed: 7-\n\nI had a nice (second) game of Warlock 2 going on, which I plan to return to. CIV: BE can wait for the huge content patch or DLC. And I will be very wary of paying the full price for that. The DLC content notes will be read with a magnifying glass and I will still wait for the early adopters to rate it.","October 27, 2014","false","10.8"," 76 of 119 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","76","119","0","0"

After playing the game for about 11 hours I grew tired of a Covert Ops bug (where you cannot redeploy your agents, and this is a known bug since October and hasn't been fixed up to now.) There is also a lot of unneeded micromanagement that is simply driving me crazy. Having to reassign my trade routes (to the same route they were already doing even..) every so many turns and that for every single trade route. Also having to redeploy my satellites to the same positions every so many turns. And having to build the same type of buildings in every city every time and time again.\n\nThe game is really lacking some proper macro management tools like:\n-Auto redeploy trade route check mark.\n-Queues for city builds (set up your own preferred queues and let the city follow one of your setups) or even a mayor who can auto build the things for you.\n-An option do auto replace a satellite when the old one comes down or even some option to relift it higher in orbit at a cost.\n-An option for your workers to upgrade all your roads. (Instead of having to do that manually.)\n\nI'm also missing some chances they had to make it more fun, perhaps some real terraforming where you can change the actual terrain, lower it, raise it and so on.\n\nBasically the game is a lot of fun, but it could be so much better, but with all the unneeded micromanagement there is now it's simply not my type of game. I will probably pick it up again though after a few patches and perhaps some dlcs if those bring the game to a more complete package like civilization.","January 18, 2015","false","11.7"," 39 of 55 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","39","55","3","6"

Has already been said, and I second this, but Civilization Beyond Earth is basically 'an extension of/to Civ V. . . .  Civ Beyond Earth could have easily been a simple $20 MOD to patch Civ V!  Why is it so tough to find corrective patches to the gameplay of Civ Beyond Earth......  Having purchased and downloaded the game through STEAM, I am not sure that the issues I am having are related to missing input through the online download - as apposed to having a physical PC CD copy. . . . . . . .  Every time I have run and attempted to play Civ Beyond Earth ((Which has completely ruined any excitement I once had to play it)) the land masses are spattered in a rainbow-like pattern as if it were meant to be looked upon with 3D glasses....  Another hindrance in playing the game for more than 2 friggin' turns is that all of the sudden the 'Next Turn' button does not work.... Click - Click - Click - CLICK of the mouse button to function THAT option. . . . . . . .\n\nHave to turn the game off and re-run it for it to work........  But this continuously happens...  And I cannot find a patch for these issues!!  As for Civ Beyond Earth, If somehow I am able to play it for more than 2turns the only enjoyment I expect to glean from this is my own Sci-Fi minded personality which will allow me to find other enjoyments of this game beyond its dated game play!  There is nothing futuristic about this game, isn't it 2014/15.......  There are games like WOW or even Call of Duty which depict fantasy worlds and are FAR MORE Graphically detailed; isn’t that the point of PC gaming that there are more components to assist with and providing in delivering an Avatar world like landmasses…????!!!  Civ Beyond Earth is very Cartoon-like, and maybe I feel this way because of my current rainbow-3D like lands, what is this a 5bit game – Nintendo gaming provided a more well-thought out detailed graphics experience than this current Civ game!\nI have always felt it would be cool if from Civilization V, that once a player reached modern times in the gameplay that the Civ world would be invaded by Aliens that each country would have to thwart off the alien foes ~ or something to that affect.   I mean, the intro to Civ Beyond Earth makes you believe that you start out on Earth in a depleted state, as to the reason for humans needing/wanting to leave Earth…  I thought that you would get to choose where in the galaxy, you the player, would be able to determine where to explore.

Also, workers don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about your economy at all on automated mode, and will just build whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want because #yolo.

I like the idea of going in different directions in technology to have a different outcome at the end of the game, but it just leaves you with major holes in your technology, which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and prevents you from doing very important things (like having a basic flying unit).\n\nThe quest system?

Honestly I really don't want to say this but a lot of those who said that this should be a paid scenario for Civ 5 are 100% correct. This game is essentially just a reskinned civ 5 with a few added gimmicks (tech web doesn't count, all thats changed on that front is its no longer a linear path from left to right) and some minor changes here and there.\n\nSo lets begin with my first irk, the factions. Normally in a civ game you'd have all the historical factions from every era like the Romans, French, Vikings etc with their own unique bonuses, units and city layouts. Well that's certainly not the case here with Civ Beyond earth. For example you have the Slavic Federation and the ARC (American Reclamation Corporation), now you'd expect the buildings and units to look like futuristic Russians and Americans right?, well you'd be entirely wrong there. All units are exactly the same with no visual difference (even the special upgraded units are the same for each faction) or stat changes from start to finish, making the experience of choosing a faction completely pointless as they are exactly the same.\n\nWhat makes this even worse is that during the custom game set up screen you are literally given the faction logo and a paragraph of text to help you decide the faction you want to play as, but seeing as they're all the same anyway there isn't any point in deciding a faction beyond choosing the one with the name that you like.\n\nThe only true addition to this game is the affinity system with its three selections to choose from. The latter being Harmony which allows you to acquire alien units, Supremacy which turns you into a robotic cyborg race and Purity which gives the middle finger to everything non human. This is where all the visual changes take place and the higher you go up an affinity the more your faction changes, but that is also pointless as all the factions are the same anyway and will always have the same units as you meaning choosing an affinity is purely a cosmetic choice.\n\nThe aliens themselves do add a bit more of a challenge as opposed to the barbarians of old, being more of a mini faction that you have to deal with and will become stronger the more you play. But even they are just as easily dealt with just like the barbarians as you can simply put up force field barriers that repel all aliens, regardless of strength, from as early as turn freakin 50. One of the most reported strongest aliens during the early game stage, the seige worm, was easily dealt with as I simply put up barriers in all of my cities and had them shoot at the worm until it was dead, and all it did was move back and forth trying to get to my units just behind the force field, making what I thought was a terrifying enemy into more of a simple pest that is just as easily swatted away as the barbarians.\n\nHonestly I could go on but right now I'm too tired from all the bland dullness that this game is emanating so I'll just wrap this up with a final verdict. Don't buy this and just stick with Civ 5, wait for mods to come out and for the price to drop before even thinking of buying this. Whilst it's not a game that's on par with horrible games like Big Rigs or Air Control, it's so incredibily dull and bland that you'd be better off playing those games instead, just so you don't end up falling asleep after only 200 turns.\n\n\nSo with all that the final score is:\n5/10\n\nCome back in a month or two when all them smart modders make this game worth £30\n\nP.s Might write a full review once I play a bit more (god help me on that one) and post it on youtube so this score isn't final for me.","October 24, 2014","false","7.7"," 156 of 260 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","156","260","0","3"

It's basically a mega mod for Civ V.\n\nHad this been a $25-30 title and advertised as a modified Civ V then I wouldn't feel so robbed by it. As it stands I'm just really, really disapointed.\n\nI see a lot of people hoping that this game might get better with future expansion packs but I have my doubts. The core game is a stripped down Civ V experience. In order to make this game stand on it's own they would need to introduce some very unique game mechanics to capture the feeling of taming an alien planet. One would think said mechanics would be in the launch title, right? So if they didn't bother with getting creative at launch why would they get creative down the road with an expansion? Let's face facts, any expansions this game gets are going to be modified versions of GK and BNW.\n\nAt this point I'm wondering if Firaxis does not have the capability to give us a successor to Alpha Centauri. You could feel the passion the devs had for AC with each game you played. But this game? This game right here is completly devoid of passion. The world leaders are lifeless and generic. The aliens are Starship Trooper knock offs. And the wonders! Seriously what is with the wonders? In Alpha Centauri you were treated to a full FMV with an epic and long quote from one of the faction leaders. Here? You get a picture of a bland blueprint and a sentence from the same VA that's been reading all the other quotes in the game. Prime example of the total lack of passion and life in this game.\n\nTrying to cash in on the demand for the next Alpha Centauri experience was a pretty low blow from Firaxis.

To sum it up\n\n-aliens are either a good time waster or a death sentence. They essentially act like barbarians in CIV V, so really they feel like a cheap reskin. The only difference is that they now kill workers instead of capturing them, which means no rescue missions and more risky early expansions. which brings me to my next point\n\n-Takes forever to make the most basic tile improvements, and there isn't even any good tech or wonders to speed things up. If you lose your workers to aliens or miasma, well it can be difficult to replace\n\n-the miasma mechanic, while intresting, is in my opinion a little backwards. Miasma limits overall growth and the technology to get rid of it is pretty high up.\n\n-All these factors severly limit growth. It honestly feels like the game mechanics have been made to limit how fast people can expand to make the game feel "bigger" than it actually is,\n\n-Most maps are generally smaller than their CIV V counterparts, they only feel big because it takes forever to grow and expand your empire.\n\n-You only will honestly use like 4 units in your army, of which will generally be infantry, artillary, tanks, and maybe some aircraft. Generally the game feels bland on account of this. The only upside is that when you can tailor the specs (only once) of said units to fit your playstyle and any following units of the same variety will share similar stats. This game be good or bad depending on the circumstances and the AIs playstyle.\n\n-resources have been reworked, and while each provide ertain bonuses some will lower your "happiness". This does include some strategic resources, such as oil. The main faction resources which are used to more advanced units however are left alone. They however are fairly rare considering how important they are, and maps can determine your affinity rather than you, which is kinda a buzz kill.\n\n-production, food, energy, and other tile bonuses increases are late game tech, and are generally pretty time comsuming and resource intensive.\n\n-The CIV BE AIs are all most likely related to Ghandi in some way. It generally feels like the AI is dumber than CIV V and far too aggresive. There isnt even that much insentive to make allies in the game. The small maps cut down on travel time, allies are generally unreliable or too aggresive, and resources are somewhat limited and without fair trade your only real option is to take it by force.\n\n-Even if you fight, it honestly seems too easy, and the AI unit spams are so laughably weak it's pathetic. There is no strategy, and the game mostly taxes you rather than buff the AIs on higher difficulties. A good killzon will murder any army of theirs and this only gets worse when you get better artillary or orbital cannons.\n\n-the victory conditions are kind of..dark..in my opinion. In CIV V you could win the game by uniting humanity thorugh cultural domination and skillfull diplomacy, martial prowess and empire building, or expanding upon the stars as a paragon of science and prosperity. In CIV BE each affinity gets its own victory conditions and you either go full on Borg and invade earth to assimilate everyone (supremacy), stick tentacles in unsavory places and become a giant hivemind blob (Harmony). or copy that movie avatar and kill off all the aliens how earth can repoulate on the new world (purity). It really doesn't feel like your forging your own destiny like you did in CIV V, and this really cuts down on the rollplaying and immersion. You cannot be the enviromentally friendly borg, the non racist starfleet, or the mechanized and technologically advanced Na'vi.\n\n-In some cases the affinity system is terrible. Your units will not evolve until a certain threshold is reached within your given affinity. This means you can't research multiple affinities for their bonuses no matter how important they are to your playstyle as this will ultimately mean you WILL be out teched even if you have beter and more technologies than your enemies. I've had a game where I went heavy eco/science and still had tier one marines even though i could spam ubers.\n\n\n-the UI is cheaply made and poorly optimized, and don't get me started on the tech tree. You can’t tell what’s a unit, wonder, or whatever.\n\n-said wonders are awefull...hardly worth the time to build.\n\n-racials are useless unless HEAVILY modded. vanilla races hardly matter, and there are no unique units or strategies you can really employ.\n\nThe only saving grace for this game is STEAMs wonderful mod community, who has more common sense and talent than a team of professional game designers; seriously they could have built on CiV 5 but no. They even had the lore friendly setting of the space race victory, imagine if you could import saves from Civ 5 to BE and play as you country in SPAHSE.But now...you have generic continetal flavoured nations with barely any unique flavours instead.\n\nAll in all im giving this a (5) on a scale of (10), The game feels far too simplistic and the lore, art, and design are somewhat subpar at best and unoriginal and boring at worst. For its price, i would not recommend it except if it was on sale . It honestly feels more like a dlc to CIV V than its own standalone game. And as for my own opinion, i am highly dissapointed in this game and barely find it fun without the use of mods. It honeslty had great potential but it fell disastrously short of all expectations, even compared to vanilla CIV V. All in all a dark day for Civ players everywhere.","November 10, 2014","false","37.0"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","36","51","0","0"

Firaxis apparently didn't learn a damn thing from their vanilla Civ V launch or listen to any complaints about the issues in G&K/BNW.\nThe AI feels barely functional just like Civ V vanilla's release.\nFiraxis showed phenomenal ability to make their own idea as terrible a possible - if with CivV you had to deal with 5 or so TR now you have 3 per city, you have to manually reassign EACH an EVERY of them; why is there no 'automatically continue this trade route' option?!\nDiplomacy somehow managed to become even worse than in CivV, which is achievement on its own.\nThe AI looks to be completely unchanged from Vanilla Civ V, despite the glaring deficiencies that AI had. Much of the text in the game is carried over verbatim from Civ V, such as diplomacy and alien alerts, with just words like "gold" substituted for their BE equivalent. Voice acting is extremely limited; take for example the AI condemning you. Now, I can understand that Civ V didn't have voice acting for that at release, since it wasn't in the game. But BE has no excuse. Or how about the tech quotes from the various leaders? SMAC had them voiced by the actual faction leaders, which helped flesh out their personality, but instead it's just the same base voice.  Virtues, like quests, seem mostly to be free bonuses you get to choose every few turns more to disguise the fact that you aren't doing anything else but click 'end turn' and movement orders than to actually progress the game.\nHalf of the wonders in the game are totally useless and they wouldn't even be good if you would double their yield.\nAnd trade routes are so good that nothing else in the game really matters. if you would half their yield they would still be op. So i really have to asked: how can this be released in that state?\n\nPOSITIVES:\nI really do like the new feel, and I can see the huge potential that this game could have, especially with the orbital layer.\nTech web is cool, great for having a more varied approach to the game.\n\nOVERALL:\nI'll play BE again, a bit here and there, mostly waiting to see what the mod community is able to do with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/recommended/65980/","Mittsies","Mittsies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/","72 products in account","Civ:BE is a very similar experience to Civ 5, adding very little to better the series and missing many opportunities. I don't think the game is terrible, but it's definitely sub-par in my opinion. The base game is good, but the current content is underwhelming and bland. I will briefly go over all of the new features and changes to the game that improved the experience, and those that hampered it.\n\nThe Good\n--------------\n[Web Tech Tree] Giving players more freedom in their technology choices creates for a much more open experience. The 'late game' technologies are just a few nodes away if a player chooses to go straight (usually not a good idea though). Civ V's linear tech tree was ok, but your options were severely limited and you often ended up with a similiar path each game.\n\n[Espionage] Spying is actually interesting now. Whereas in Civ 5 the espionage system was just a fire and forget kind of system, the new spy system feels much more involved, allowing you to have a lot more control over what you do - from siphoning energy (money) from the enemy capitol or potential overthrowing the city and claiming it for your own. Yes, you can steal cities. I've done so in the past by rushing the technology with the Russian's free tech bonus and it is hilarious.\n\n[Satellites] Not a real complex system, just a nice little addition to the game. Basically you place a stationary unit that affect a grid of tiles under it for X amount of turns.\n\n[Expeditions] Right away your Explorer unit can dig up artifacts from satellites and other things much like an archaeologist from Civ V. This adds a neat extra thing to do early game.\n\nThe Bad\n--------------\n[Technological Progression] The tech tree might have improved its layout, but as a player I felt very detached from the world. I don't even know what I'm researching 90% of the time. What the hell is Alien Ethics? What kind of upgrades can I expect from something like Field Theory or Transcendental Math? Why do I need to research Physics and Engineering? I mean it's so far in the future, shouldn't I already have a really good grasp over those? As I get more and more research, I don't feel any progression. In Civ V it was VERY obvious, as your people went from cavemen to a more civilized and culture people ... but in Beyond Earth it feels so cold and lifeless, nothing I do has any real visual impact on my faction.\n\n[Quests/Decisions] A new system which allows you to make small decisions throughout the game. Do you want +1 Food, or +1 Energy? +5 unit healing or +1 Science and Energy? As well as things like "Be nice to the bugs, or eradicate them (affects affinities)". These are soon forgotten and very inconsequential. By the time you reach the end of the game, you'll have more or less forgotten about your choices as they have such an incredibly low impact on the game. This system is good conceptually but was executed in a very boring way.\n\n[Wonders] Unexciting and bland. Even the "you completed the wonder" message is lame, unlike Civ V where it felt like a huge accomplishment, wonders in BE are just a major let down. There also seems to be a serious lack of variety with them, but maybe that's just me.\n\n[Factions] Not only are the wonders boring in this game, so are the leaders, factions, the sponsors, the affinities. Every aspect of customization is boring as hell. The only thing that separates each faction is a single bonus and a color scheme. All of the choices you make when you start the game (and there aren't many choices, to be honest) are unexciting. Do you want to start with a worker, or a soldier, or maybe you want pioneering for free? Civ 5 offered a couple of unique units/buildings/tile improvements and a few unique abilities that would really set each race apart - but everything feels so samey now. I often forget what faction I picked in Civ BE... that was never the case in Civ 5, where I was constantly reminded of what civilization I chose.\n\n[Religion] No religion? They could have at least added something in its place, like politics or some kind of alien cult-worshiping stuff. Religion was one of my favorite aspects of Civ V and BE feels like it's missing a huge chunk of variety because it's gone.\n\n[City States] Their new version of city states are just a building that you can do a trade route with. Basically the same thing except they don't offer quests.\n\n[Affinities] You level them up linearly from 0 to 13, you occasionally pick some unit upgrades, and there's a few bonuses like "Aliens won't attack your Explorer" and "Units take less damage from miasma." The unique units even feel pretty similar across all 3 affinities. I was really hoping there'd be like an additional social-policy/tech-tree thing to choose how to customize how the affinities affect my faction, but that's not the case. The Affinities don't add much to the experience.\n\n[World Variety] This is one of the most lack-luster elements of the game. There's virtually NO variety for planets in this game. I've played most of the way through 5 games so far and started about a dozen different new maps and I must say every planet looks really similar. I was hoping for some crazy randomization, both visually and mechanically, but instead I got a bunch of boring Earth-like planets. Where's the color? I want some planets with bright, deep color palettes. I want to see worlds with extreme weather like lightning and sandstorms, planets with no oxygen, more variety for wild life. Why is every indigenous alien bug species exactly the same for all worlds? I guess every single planet other than earth is inhabited by a race of mostly-passive gigantic green bugs.\n\n[Neutral Aliens] They do nothing, usually. Even if I attack them every turn for a long time they don't get mad at me (I've played on both Apollo (8) and Gemini (6) difficulty so far). Then there's the siege worm which is just a minor nuisance that is unkillable until much later into the game, kind of like a natural disaster. I don't think it adds anything to my experience, it's just stupid. There's also ZERO variety in aliens, as I've mentioned above in world variety. Everything is a stereotypical "bug race".\n\n[Computer's AI] The AI is completely brain-dead. Even on Apollo difficulty, which apparently just makes them cheat, the AI does nothing to thwart my efforts. With just a small army of infantry/rangers/artillery supported by a couple of mid-game units I can wipe out all of the AI with ease. They will ask me "please I beg of you, give me this resource things aren't going so well", and when I try to accept they angrily decline and say "I MUST ASK FOR MORE". That's like I asked you for a cookie, and when you tried to say "Sure" I was insulted that you were offering me only a cookie and not milk also. The only way to make Civ:BE a challenging single player experience is to give yourself a major disadvantage by modding the game or purposely stacking the odds against you.\n\n[Micro-Management] Automation AI is still terrible. It will constantly make bad decisions when prioritizing tiles, so you gotta manually pick each tile yourself if you wanna be effective. What's worse is that the game stops notifying you about a new citizen after the 5th one per city. Why is there no option to turn that back on? Also they've done nothing to add more depth to the game since Civ 5. It's the same old "allocate citizens to tiles, choose production" route. I was really hoping they'd get more creative with what you can do but maybe they were worried it would confuse new players?\n\nThe Ugly\n--------------\nThe game will rely on DLC to feel complete.\n\nSince I know the game will be another DLC/Expansion-pack circle-jerk, I cannot with a good conscience recommend this game to anyone but hardcore Civ-Fans. I don't think I wasted my money, but I am definitely disappointed. I'll probably continue to play the game until I'm sick of it, but I just wish they did a better job.\n\nRating: C","October 26, 2014","false","19.1"," 66 of 105 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","66","105","0","5"

AI, diplomacy, city management, unit management and function, among other things, are nearly identical, which would not be so terrible if CIV5’s weak points were not copied to a dot as well (yes, including the broken/cheating AI).\nThe unit customization we were promised is almost comical. Landscape is repetitive. The different factions are virtually identical to each other. Aliens are boring and pretty much pointless except as hindrance at the beginning of the game before you get better tech. City states are just trade posts now with essentially no function and are 99% irrelevant to the gameplay. They did rework espionage nicely though and the orbital units/layer are nice, but not very varied. They could have done a lot more with it!\nUI is not great... They should have taken some cues from games by Amplitude Studios when it comes to that… it doesn’t feel like it belongs in 2014 at all. Also what's up with end game? The screen tells me that I won or lost and I’m back at the main menu. No recap, no score breakdown, no map, no ranking, not even a reason WHY I won or lost...\nIt is at least relatively stable and free of any major bugs based on my experience. Some small bugs and one crash so far after ~14 hours of play. Others have not had such luck however from what I've read?\nHaving already played games like Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Pandora First Contact, Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations, Sins of a Solar Empire, and Endless Legend I was really hoping for a lot more (they were not exactly pioneering the genre here), especially with all the hype and promises.\nBeing a huge fan of the Civilization games and CIV5 I was immensely excited for this game and even pre-purchased it, which I have never done before for any game… and whew! What a letdown. Really tried loving the game, but I just can’t force myself do it. I like it enough, it’s a good start, but it’s entirely unfinished. Would rather just play CIV5 or fire something up by Paradox Interactive. EU4 here I come! BE, sorry, but you were a waste of money. Should have waited for the 75% off sale. It needs the equivalent of what Gods & Kings and Brave New World did to CIV5 ASAP.

The information bar at the top of the screen is tiny yet cluttered.  The grid itself is ugly as is the fog of war.  The game itself is just so dark.  It's like being in a room with no windows and the only ligthing coming from an old 30 watt bulb that's been dyed blue (or yellow depending on the map).\n\nWhat first seemed an interesting twist, the tech web is difficult to navigate and read.  Maybe after you dump 40 hours into the game you'll remember what upgrades are under what leaf and branch, but I grew sick of trying to find where that stupid tech was that let me harvest float stone (or whatever I was looking for at the time).\n\nThe game does a really terrible job introducing the new quest mechanics, and at no point did it ever explain victory conditions.\n\nReligions and culture trees have congealed into a bland, overly condensed and boring set of 4 cultural trees you can advance down.\n\nLeaders/states have no personality, aliens are little more than window dressing for each planet, and jeeze what an ugly planets they are.

Despite taking place on a bizarre alien world, the setting feels quite lifeless and dull. The leaders and factions have zero personality. The quotes (that might give some insight into their personalities) are bland and generic and all voiced by the same actor. It's like they took everything that was so flavourful and unique about Alpha Centauri and turned it on its head.\n\nOther than this, the engine is almost identical to civ 5, albeit less polished and balanced. The affinities are an interesting innovation. The AI presented very little challenge (I was able to win my very first game on the 2nd hardest difficulty without much difficulty). The tech tree is diverse and seems to be based on 'Endless Space' to a large extent. However, it's quite hard to learn what each tech does since they all have baffling (albeit generic) sci-tech names like 'gene harmonics' and 'alien splicing'. Again, unlike previous Civ installments the tech advancements provide very little colour to the world.\n\nThere isn't much else to say about this game really. If it was a free fan-made mod for Civ 5 I would call it 'impressive'. However, considering how expensive it is it's hard not to feel dissapointed and a bit ripped off. Perhaps I'm holding it to a higher standard than most games since it's part of the Civ franchise but I don't think that's unreasonable.

That being said, I hate to be the first one on here to admit it, the game honestly feels like a slimmed down version of Civ5. Now if you don't have Civ5, by all means buy this, you will be telling yourself "one more turn" for the next 8-10 hours. However, as we have seen with games like BF Hardline it has become popular with companies to release games that seem like expansion packs for full price as individual games. Beyond Earth feels like one of these games as you could easily replace the barbarians in civ5 with the aliens, swap out the color pallettes on the maps, and increment the technologies more while putting them in a new format. While many things have changed in small ways, some key components of the previous game are missing such as religion, artistic backdrops (for the NPCs), or any sense of story or meaning in the world to separate it from being "Alien planet game #252". On the plus side the Affinities and satellites are both welcome features, however, I can't help but thinking that for $50 there could be more or at least more deviation from the previous title.","October 23, 2014","false","14.1"," 548 of 962 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","548","962","0","27"

In civ5 you could have serious advantages of going for a tall type gameplay with few large cities. This is no longer an option, due to the insane amounts of mfg+food or sci+energy you get from trade routes you just need as many cities as possible. It is not hard to keep up health, which just has to be below 20, even above for a while is fine.\nI managed to get a size 1 useless tundra city at 60 base mfg, in size 1! I don't see the point to removing the global limit of trade routes and even so, the issue is that the output should be lowered to 1/4th of what it is now.\n\nThe ais are more useless than ever. It may be partly because they don't know how to abuse the trade routes, but it seems silly that even with all the cheats they get in apollo they are still super easy. They have always been quite bad at the civ5 combat system and you have always been able to win over a large force with a few ranged units luring them out, but now you can easily totally overpower them in everything from science to amount of units or whatever you like at the same time.\n\nSince civ1 there has been a linear tech tree that gave you somewhere between 1-8 tech options, usually a lot less than 8. Now you can easily end up having 20+ techs to choose from at one time. I guess this is something you could easily get used to in time and strategies will come up, but what is the point of making it such a grid of messiness? It's just a bit larger than my screen too so I have to move around it on the "minimap" to try and get an overview, and I am not really wiser on it after 4 games.\n\nHope these things gets fixed in a patch soon and I really think the game shouldn't have been released like that. Just because you have the ability to easily patch things does not mean you should release half finished stuff, just look at the steam reviews and how fast they are going downwards.","October 27, 2014","false","22.0"," 75 of 122 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","75","122","0","0"

Best points - orbital system is very cool, fungal worlds looks really good.  Good points - one unit per hex similar to panzer general, and of course Civ V, different unit looks between factions.  Bland - leaders are all the same in diplomacy.  Bad - affinity level has huge affect on units, I think this was just a poor design decision so save complexity (say versus the actual technologies selected having a direct affect on units, regardless of affinity... I think scrapping the idea of affinity would have forced a more complex game, but adding it in made it easier for the development.  Also bad, trade routs... wtf why did we go from a workable number of routes (in Civ V) to 2-3 PER CITY, its ridiculous, and managing that many is boring at best and annoying at least.  More bad - AI is really stupid.  Several times I've seen the AI leave a low heath unit right next to my counter-unit for an easy kill... or an enemy ranged unit sits right next to my armor (akin to archer moving next to enemy cavalry) DUH... they have no sense of tactics at all.

The orbital units and affinity add some additional choice and depth but then the lack of a religion/culture spread system takes that away. Without religion and culture pressing at your borders, you can just coast on through to victory so long as you stay friendly with your neighbours. Diplomacy is very basic, there are no research or production agreements. There are no great people or golden ages, each turn is a lot like the last. This game is crying out for some expansions so until then, I can't fully recommend it.\n\nMy two biggest dissapointments are:\n\n#1 The lack of artwork for wonders. All you get is the usual quote and a basic blueprint style view of the wonder. The artwork in civ5 gave a lot of context to the wonder built and made it seem like a real achievement. There's some great artwork at the begining of the game, I was hoping for even more. Some cool sci-fi artwork would bring the player closer to the world that firaxis has created.\n\n#2 Lack of a cinematic or even unique artwork for victories. When you win the game you get a larger view of the artwork used in the victories list. I was really hoping for something new as a reward for winning the game. A full cinematic is not even required, I would be happy with a few cool images with a bit of narration over them.\n\nCONCLUSION: No for now, wait until they release an expansion and bundle it with the base game.","October 29, 2014","false","21.4"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","0"

I did read the negative reviews. Then I played the demo. Then I bought it anyway. I've now played 2 campaigns.\n\nThis is my first ever review on Steam. It is there to protect people who have a limited budget from wasting a purchase on this. (I have more money than sense)\n\nI'm such an idiot. The game is seriously lacking. It has no charm and is beyond pointless. It is little more than a bad DLC for Civ 5. There is lots of stuff in the civilopedia which you basically have no reason to ever read.\n\n1) There are 5 strategic resources and I still have no idea what 2 of them do.\n2) There are 6 real units (plus 1 or 2 extras). Basically, marines, tanks, ranged tanks, ranged marines, ship, plane (yes 1 ship. 1 plane - there is a carrier to move your planes around but it does nothing else so it's not really a ship). You don't really ever need tanks AND marines (either/or) so you just need 2 units. Period.\n3) Units upgrade constantly and  do so because you change affinity level (which it is tricky to consciously control in any satisfying way - think of it like leveling up in an RPG, i.e. you are generally always trying to do it). That means you have no control over strategy because you may have 6 useless units and then the next turn all 6 are suddenly brilliant.\n4) But you can't conquer anyway. Because happiness has been replaced with health and is incredibly restrictive over how many cities you or the AI can control at any one time (think 2/3 initially, 5 by mid game, 8/10 by late game if you put a lot of effort in). So in one play through I did 8 players on a 6 player map and 1/4 was still empty by the end (epic speed circa 400 turns).\n5) But you wouldn't want many cities because every city needs 2 trade convoys and ever 25 turns you have to micro manage both convoys (so most turns in mid game are 'unit needs orders' 'trade convoy' click, click, scroll to find 'previous route' click, click 'yes I'm sure' *repeat* x 20 units is a bit boring)\n6) I won one and lost one. Losing one everything just stops and you have no warning and had no idea why. Winning one is laborious and boring - construct this 'have I won?' *sigh* 'no' 'construct this next' sort of thing. When you win there is nothing - no cinematic, just a message box.\n7) There is literally no depth. In Civ 5 I still sometimes sing the jewish faith jingle to the irritation of my wife. I also still quote CEO Morgon on the ethics of greed etc. etc. This game has nothing. No memorable sounds, no music, no wonder videos, no throne room (yes, I'm old). Nothing. Zilch.\n8) Aliens, yes there are now basically barbarians with different units (there are 4 land and 2 sea). But luckily once you realise they only attack if you are within attack range of their nest, you can just ignore them, so they are even less of a challenge than barbarians.\n\nMostly you sit inside your borders hording useless resources you will never use, improving your cities in exactly the same way and endlessly refreshing trade convoys until one of the players wins and puts everyone out of their misery.\n\nThis is a very very bad game. I love turn based strategy, I play hundreds of hours (much to the annoyance of said wife). Unlike the launch of Rome II I don't see how patches will save this. It has no redeeming features.\n\nSorry, but if you have a limited budget then do not buy. If you are like me you'll buy this anyway.

Played Civ3 Golden Edition for days on end as a kid, and have again with Civ5 BNW.\n\nGonna be honest here, for all the hype this game got, it is really boring. I understand wanting to have a base to start fresh from on a new game, but this is a really poor start.\n\nThe corporations or whatever they are have zero personality or charisma. So from the beginning you're not that excited about starting a new game, because it really doesn't matter who you are, they all feel exactly the same and have nothing to set them apart from each other.\n\nThe UI is more futuristic looking, but again not really that aethetically pleasing, and functionality wise, not even close to Civ5 in terms of fluidity.\n\nThe terrain is actually really annoying to navigate, especially early game...which is the only time you need to navigate it really. The miasma thing is really irritating (-10 HP to unit, basically on every tile), and to be honest so are the aliens. The aliens are basically barbarians except instead of one or two near a camp, there's like 10 of them, and they just slaughter your units early game. Which isn't even that big of a deal, because each explorer can only excavate one site (ancient ruin), but it makes settling new cities early game really frustrating.\n\nThere is no surprises, you know where everyones capital is the second they 'land' on the planet.\n\nThe affinity system is interesting, for about 5 minutes. Harmony (get along with aliens) doesn't actually stop the aliens from attacking you, which i thought would be the most interesting point of deviation. Purity (kill aliens) is clearly the best, as its units are the easiest to reach through technologies and the resources needed to get them, and focuses on killing aliens, giving your units an experience/upgrade bonus over other affinities, which is huge becuase they give you a flat 15% damage boost instead of just terrain bonuses or utility.\n\nI don't know man, this game was really disappointing, I hope they still produce some civilzation packs and expansions for Civ 5 because this Beyond Earth is light years away from everything you love about Civ. I hope this review stops people from purchasing the game so they go back to producing new civ's to use in Civ5.\n\nOHHH. One good thing.

You get thrown into a world where you rule a civilization and compete, barter, go to war with and befriend other civilizations on your way to conquer the world. This is a turn based strategy game on a hexagonal grid. When all your units have taken a turn, you let the next civilization have its turn. You start with a home settlement that increases in size over time. With each settlement, you select a unit or facility that will then be complete after X amount of turns. During your turn you'll also pick a technology to research that results in new facilities that can get unlocked to build in your settlements. Its all streamlined so you don't have to hunt for the next city or unit to move, you'll already have them selected.\n\nIt looks like plenty of people are complaining that this is too similar of a game to Civilization 5, and they're right. However, it still feels like a good fresh sci-fi version of the game. The previous Civilizations made good use of historic characters, but this game lacks those characters and that personality. They still manage to put in all Earth's nations into this game without any sort of alien races. The real hurdle for me was the game crashing every time after the opening cinematic. That seems to have gotten fixed.\n\nNo matter what randomly generated world you play, its a hostile one, full of insect aliens that will oppress you. They spawn from nests, attack your troops, and cities. It can be difficult to even get out of your cities to grow and thrive. The game has a combat edge to it. There are combat troops, both melee and long range that can fight on land, water and air.  The insects are there to grind and train your troops, to give them experience, get them leveled up with selectable perks for each level.  Melee units can only attack the tile next to them, while long ranged can attack up to two tiles away. Each unit has its own movement distance and you can set up a unit to move far away and it will get there over X amount of turns without you having to move it each and every turn.\n\nEach unit has a wide array of commands, move, attack, explore, alert so they wake up if an enemy comes in range, fortify to heal themselves, and more. When you have a combat unit selected and hover your mouse over an enemy, you can see the likely outcome who will do more damage. Its a nice system.\n\nIts not all combat though, there are worker units that will gather resources and build things. Thankfully you can assign a worker to work on his own so you don't need to control him. Explorers can find and mine resources. Colonists can go out and make a new settlement as long as its three tiles away from any other settlement. It is best to have an armed escort go with them, since they aren't meant for combat.\n\nWhen a new settlement forms, it controls a few tiles around it, making that your territory. As the population grows, so does the radius of tiles. So you can connect your settlements into one big territory. Since its your territory, other civilizations need to ask for your permission to travel freely through it. They will offer you tributes for the rights and you barter back and forth with them to make a deal happen. Do you want energy (currency) each turn for their travel? Do you want rights to travel through their land as well? Do you even trust them to travel through your land? They could be setting up a siege to conquer your settlements.\n\nThe civilizations can be both nice and hostile. Some civilizations feel that your rapid expansion near their territory is a cause for concern and they'll warn you to stop. The game keeps track of your promises too. If you say you won't build another settlement, you might risk a war if you do. Then at some point the game will tell you that your promise has been kept and you can build another settlement at your leisure. Some will even warn you that you've slaughtered too many people or insects and you need to stop. Its all a delicate balance.\n\nYou can make alliances with countries, ask them if they'll go to war with another civilization. There is a lot of depth here, but some are justifiably unwilling to budge. Just because someone declared war on you doesn't mean one of your allies will help save you. There is a nifty diplomacy tab to see what is going on politically. Who is at war with who and your relationship to other civilizations.\n\nIf combat isn't your thing, there are covert ops. You can unlock the ability, build a facility, train your agents by defending your cities from spies that will steal your technology or energy. Then send your agents abroad to other cities and do the same to them. It also becomes a political issue, when agents are found or killed. Do you let it slide or declare war? Its all a way to get around combat. I did find a giant covert ops breaking bug. When an agent was idle, the covert ops panel was just black and empty.\n\nBeyond Earth feels like a race to see who can decimate the other civilizations. A tranquil, relaxing game can turn very stressful when your neighbor picks a fight and declares war. I would say the game lets you play how you want, but like other Civilization games, I felt dragged into war, bullied and unable to stop it. If someone declares ware, you can always make a peace treaty by offering them up resources or things like cities. Yep you can give them your cities, because they'll take them anyway.\n\nSettlements can defend themselves, but they'll soon get overwhelmed. Its really a competition over land. Who controls the most land. Who has the most settlements to generate things. There is a problem though. Sometimes the civilization outgrows its energy consumption. If energy consumption dips below the reserve energy supply, the units will begin to disband one per turn. This balances out the energy consumption, but makes units disappear and leaves you vulnerable. That is the risk you run having a grand civilization.\n\nSometimes there is not enough food in your cities and it will halt their growth. To compensate, you can unlock trade depots and trade convoys, then set their trade routes between settlements to distribute food, energy and resources.\n\nFor those that need goals, the game does have quests, but I found myself ignoring them to do what I wanted. Competing a quest, gives you a choice between two perks. It was always a real toss up. I never felt like any perk offered was that much of a game changer.\n\nThe game feels excessive when it comes to frills. There are civilization perk trees, technologies to unlock and even troop upgrades. The upgrades change every troop of that type. You even get to select a permanent perk for that type. The choice and the random worlds make for huge replay value. The excessive frills are useful for marathon games. You'll always have something new to unlock thousands of turns into the game. With different difficulties and different sizes of planets to inhabit, one game could go on forever!\n\nBeyond Earth is still a good game, its just like Civilization 5 and its expansion with a sci-fi twist. I would have appreciated alien races other than insect fodder.","January 18, 2015","true","4.5"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","29","42","0","0"

Gave it a 'recommended' but in a way just barely, mostly due to the price.   Essentially, this is a CIV 5 overhaul.  It is more of a really big expansion than a whole new game.  It does contain some elements and terminology from the olde SMAC, which was one of my all time favorite games, but it lacks a lot of the social interaction and wit:  "... don't go; the drones need you, the look up to you."  I am not sure what some of the other reviewers are referring to as bugs, it seems rock stable and runs fine.  The soundtrack is pretty good and the graphics are upper middle class ;)\n\nThe tech web (instead of tech tree) is  not as intuitive as a standard tech tree and is a bit cumbersome.  There is also less depth in some of the interface, information and management in a lot of areas, particularly compared to civilization IV, which , IMHO, was the best of the Civ game.  So as an upgrade or expansion of Civ V, this is great, but it should have been $20-$30 tops, not $50.","October 26, 2014","true","55.4"," 129 of 222 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","129","222","0","0"

While the game is good, it's not different enough (yet) from Civilization 5 to warrant purchase in my opinion. I am of the full belief that this game will at some point be a game worthy of individual purchase, and will follow a formula similar to Civ 5, in that it will have very good DLC that make the game considerably better. But, for the time being, unless you've invested 500 or more hours into Civ 5 and desperately want a slightly different Civ feel, I'd recommend sticking to/purchasing Civ 5 and it's DLCS.\n\nI should mention this game, like Civ 5, has a great Workshop community creating mods at an ever increasing rate.\n\nEDIT: The most recent DLC, Rising Tides, does make the game a bit more enjoyable, completely reworking the way diplomacy and war works, as well as adding somewhat mobile floating ocean cities.

If you have that expectation you will be disappointed. If you have not played and loved Civilization V in the past, there is a strong chance you will may not like this game. This is a turn based strategy game, which means that this is not for everyone.\n\nFeatures/Gameplay compared to Civ V:\n\nThis game uses the same engine as Civilization V however, there are major differences in gameplay. First and most important: the aliens are not like barbarians in Civ V. Sometimes you leave them alone and they will leave you alone, they have these unofficial terroritories and if you don't go into those areas they usually will not come to you unless somebody has been ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ them off by killing them. Two important aliens are the siege worms (land) and the kraken (sea). It is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ to kill these things in the beginning to mid game unless you are near a city firing ranged.\n\nTrade routes are available from the start, and who you trade with impacts diplomacy with the AI players. Stations will leave if nobody trades with them.\n\nThere are tiles that are infected with Miasma, a poison. Depending on the type of Affinity you choose, you either destroy the Miasma (it hurts you) or spread it (it heals you). Each player chooses their own Affinity so there are inherent conflicts of interest.\n\nTechnology is no longer linear, it is now a web. Which means you can go in any direction at any time. As you gain new technologies you gain Affinity points. When you get more points your units globally upgrade instantly.  You can also complete quest and do a few other things to get Affinity points. In order to win certain victories, you have to have a ton of Affinity points. You will NOT get all the technologies in a single game. Mid to end game units are unique to Affinity.\n\nSpies are more important, in my last game I had a coup and took a player's CAPITAL from them, peacefully. (We did not  go to war). You can detonate a dirty bomb in peoples cities ,attract siege worms, steal tech, steal science, steal money etc with spies.\n\nI almost forget the orbital system. You can use these satalites to give you every advantage (economic, military, add/remove  Miasma, counter-intelligence etc)\n\nThe victory system is not so sudden. You can tell the progress each player has made toward winning. You will know early on how far ahead/behind you are and if a full scale invasion may be necessary to prevent the leader from beating you. It is easy to stop a player in the final stages from winning if you have the military to do so.\n\nMy impression:\n\nThis game takes the Civilization series in the right direction. The gameplay changes made are beyond the scope of a mod or expansion pack, this is a NEW game that goes beyond new skins and units. I love the game, it is well made, and definitely worthy of being a "civilization" game.\n\nThis is a very good guide for people are interested: http://well-of-souls.com/civ/civbe_overview.html\n\n\n\n\n","October 26, 2014","true","43.4"," 109 of 187 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","109","187","0","0"

The first of these major overhauls is the affinity system which creates a faction system inside of a traditional civilization structure. This system is effectively the evolution of the religion system from earlier civilization games and in theory is powerful and interesting. Unfortunately it isn't implemented in the most interesting way often leaving you to simply level up a faction by researching certain dead end technologies. Once more the system as it supports gaining levels of multiples of these factions at once could potentially make the diplomacy more interesting but in true fashion for the series this opportunity is missed as your AI rivals only care about your most prominent affinity in relation to their most prominent. If you have 9 purity but 10 supremacy you'll no doubt notice the negative effect this will impart when dealing with opponents with 3 purity and 0 of the affinities.\nAlso new is the shift from the traditional civilization technology tree to a technology web more common in space 4x games. This is largely a positive change though many leaf technologies (dead ends related to another technology) feel underwhelming and only relevant in relation to the affinity system.\nThe unit upgrade system has been significantly limited and also linked into the affinity system. Experience will only allow your unit a minor attack bonus or an instant heal while certain affinity break levels will result in much more powerful upgrades many of which are familiar from previous upgrade systems. Unfortunately while this system alone may be serviceable with appropriate balancing it contributes to a wide ranging problem in the game: readability. This unit upgrades each result in a unique name most of which are exceedingly bland and non-descriptive (such as phantom, cruiser, etc). This means while in a civilization game you may be able to instantly recognize a musketeer has an advantage on a spearman in Beyond Earth you will spend tons of time trying to figure out just what your opponents units are.\nSimilar readability problems are plentiful through out the game. City name plates and worker assignment buttons are so huge they can obscure units or a clear view of the resource points of each hex in city assignment. Many button positions are arbitrarily flipper from Civ V with little reason for instance the city inspection close buttons. Most technologies have no clear indicators (such as color coding) suggesting either what element they are focused on or even if elements they unlock are buildings or wonders.\nFinally the game suffers from a terrible case of misallocated funds. Rival faction leaders each feature a 3d model with multiple part/texture changes based on affinity and fairly large amount of voice acting. Wonders lack engaging artwork (featuring a pan over generic blue print style drawings of ambiguous mechanical junk) and much of the dialogue with voice acting related to affinity levels, technologies, and wonders seems like it features only one or two voice actors (which of course becomes rather tiring). Once more the writing which is obviously trying for the rather difficult tone of Alpha Centauri falls flat. While Alpha Centauri featured a mix of solid sci-fi tropes most related to the genera were somewhat were familiar with punctuated by brief flights of whimsy to justify a funny aside, Beyond Earth features largely science dumb gobbledygook with repetitive jokes many being recycled in numerous places.","October 29, 2014","false","49.3"," 38 of 59 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","38","59","0","0"

I wanted to play the most alien thing I could so I played on a Fungal world, played for Transcendance, and set aliens to 'high'. I'll compare the game to Civ 5 rather than AC since I think thats more relevant to those claiming it to be DLC-like.\n\nPros:\n-Game runs smoother than Civ5. Even in late game the game loaded turns faster which may be something to consider if that caused you major grievances on less than awesome machines.\n-No happiness. Several things simply got a 'sci-fi' name from Civ5 counterparts, but happiness being replaced with the health system is a very good thing. Large empires in more difficult settings were kind of a silly thing to do in Civ5 so this really opens the game up more.\n-Tech tree. Its more complicated than normal research in Civ5 and many of the sub-branches allow you to further your affinity that shape your civ. Its possible to go into mupltiple branches that dont link well early on, or do the opposite and go too far in one branch without getting basics from others that leave you crippled. I think there will be good metagame here.\n-Starter perks. Unlike Civ5 where you start as some thugs beating rocks together, BE lets you pick your crew types, spaceship type, and supplies you bring with you that lends to a more custom start up appropriate to a sci-fi setting.\n-Esp and Trade are the same and slightly improved from the Civ5 versions that came in DLC. The spys in BE have far more options here that can really hurt your enemies (I let out a thumper that called Alien Siege Wurms in an enemy city) and the amount of trade routes you have running rivals that of Venice without actually playing a 1 city civ.\n-Aliens. I started my game with the sensors that locate alien nests, which populate over the largest xeno pools in the game (a resource needed for a heavy Harmony Affinity) so I knew right off if I wanted to re-start the game and where I would first go for my expansions. The alien hordes themselves feel more natural in civ. They basically behave like aggresive animals and I appreciated their AI far more than 'barbarians', even on their most aggresive setting.\n-Satalite layer. I didnt get too far into satalites as some affinities might with orbital attacks but these really add new options. Some would populate un-modded areas with lux and strategic resources, another pumped down miasma (a toxic gas thats poisons enemies but heals and gives combat bonus' to Harmony civs), and this giant low orbit squid that pooped more miasma and gave combat bonus' to units down below. Its definately a good addition.\n-Late game. The combat in late game gets really fun. All your units get upgraded for free based on your chosen affinity and by the end all your 'rovers' and 'missile rovers' are hovertanks flying across the ocean. The affinity-based units, and mega-units are a huge deal. 1 turn before my MInd Flower finished I had 2 Evolved Xeno Titans (think GDR *10) wreck my enemies earth gateway while shrugging off all the stuff they were throwing at them the whole time; it was a good ending!\n\nCons:\n-NPC identities. The bonus' you get for each civ seem limited. In Civ5 you got more 'things' that defined you. You can definately shape your civ over time the way you want more in BE but by end-game you likely have your main affinity maxed and went on to others and begin to lose your uniqueness. The actual bonus' that are unique to your civ seem so marginal I kinda wonder why they even bothered putting them in. I'd have liked to see more special units/buildings or abilites for each civ that pushed them more in the dirrection of certain affinities.  One civ asked me to declare war on another by the name of their leader alone and without being able to open my diplomacy tab I was just left thinking 'who the heck is that?'. Its not like you had the same issue in Civ5 when someone asked you to kill Washington but... I'm sure I'll get used to it.\n-City States, or outposts as they're called. The game dosnt just found cities; it starts them as an 'outpost' early on that developes into a city (which by itself I think is fine). My issue is these random outposts that pop up, never turn into full cities, and pretty much act like city states with even less options. Beyond a few good trade routes, they seem to be completelly irrelevant. NPC civs attack them without issue from the rest of the world, there is no friendship meter with these people. It seems a step in the wrong dirrection and lots of wasted potential.\n-No global politics. I know this was added in a DLC, but.. considering how these people are supposed to be futuristic, and instantly connected the moment they pop into the world, I find it wierd that there would be no futuristic council when the story goes: they just left a world that HAD one. AI of NPC civs in BE is slightly better but the global politics and amount of favors we curried from city states made the Civ5 game feel more developed on a global scale.\n-No terraforming. I know know, its not AC, and I was honestly too young to even remember much about that game. I do remember the terraforming though which allowing you to + and - land and ocean, and being able to build cities underwater. A 'terraformed' tile improvement is just a really good jungle and you can do some terraforming-type stuff with the new satalites but I was kinda hoping for a little more.

I'd give it a 8-8.5 depending on much you <3 sci-fi.  I think I'll have quite a few very good playthroughs with the different affinities but I'm not sure I'll get as much playtime from this as Civ5.

There's nothing big about it compared to other Civ games.  You can specialize your units in a certain direction based on the decisions you make (making them drastically different) but in the end it really feels like those choices don't necessarily matter.  At the end of the day, you're going to make the decision to go down a tree that you have the resources to go down.\n\nThe game makes it seem as though you're going to be colonizing the galaxy, yet all you're doing is colonizing another planet that is just like Earth with some alien biology.  I was hoping for some planet jumping instead of just the same thing skinned as an alien planet with future tech.\n\nIf you have previous Civ games, I recommend avoiding this.  There isn't enough change to warrant buying another one.  I made the mistake while it was on sale and somewhat regret it.

More like Sh*t Meier's Sh*tilization: Beyond a Sh*tty F*cking Game. This is the worst game I have ever played. The fact that it was released at a $50 pricetag is a crime against humanity. Every single aspect is a failure. Boring, lifeless factions. Awful gameplay. You will be confirming trade routes 90% of the time. Combat unit strength feels extremely unbalanced and units become obsolete very quickly. Wonders in this game are nothing more than a joke. I remember there was one late game wonder that took or so 40 turns to complete, and then gave +1 food? No interesting dyamics, and an inconsequential effect. Win conditions are tedious and boring. Want to build 40 of the same unit? I know I don't. But if you do, congratulations, you can now look at this static 'you win' screen, leave the game, and play again! The game is also a graphics hog. Everything lags so much even on the lowest settings on my Asus G75. It's like they forgot to test this game at all. The new mechanics that were introduced, miasma and aliens, are simply nuisances that the player is forced to spend time to remove. It's like, here, we're going to stymie your progress until you buy this unit and get this building. It's not fun, and is absolutely a chore. You know what though? It's worse than a chore. I'd rather get up in the middle of the game and do the dishes than play this game. It's not even a game. It's a scam. It's 0/10 trash appended with the names Sid Meier and Civilization to trick suckers like myself and many others into buying it. I am writing this review to warn you not to be one of those suckers. And what's certain to come next is numerous patches and DLC to milk more money out of the poor souls who were tricked into buying this. Please, never, ever think about playing this game.

I mean this sucks even compared to CIV V, the base game of which at least kept me interested in it for the amount of\nturns it took to research everything and take over most of the map.\n\nPerhaps next time we spend a little less money and time on cut scenes and promo video clips and more on gameplay development.\n\nI pray and I hope they take an inordinate amount of time and effort with the expansions (if any) to flesh out this "game".

I also feel like some items from Civ 5 are drastically missing. Like boats, for example, there are only two main naval units. Also, wonders aren't that important anymore. It feels like building them is pretty much useless. But the main aspect that is missing is population interaction. There is no more religion, it feels like the people are just robots, you hardly notice they exist. As a cherry on the cake, the graphical aspect makes the game feel really cold and lonely.

Honestly there is some AWESOME stuff and if they fix it, I would totally recommend it to everyone. It was a lot of fun at first and they introduced some very cool elements and a cool environment. But, they flopped for a few reasons, only some of which are below. In a nutshell, it's Civ 5 with liposuction and a facelift. Unfortunately they liposuctioned out good stuff like city states and replaced them with barely-noticable "Stations" (seriously, all you can do is send them trade convoys, or destroy them for a minimal one time resource gain).\n\nPlease save your money. Here are a few reasons why:\n\nYou can't turn off time victory! I only had Domination selected and yet the game still ended when the time ran out. Time is not even an option as a victory condition. **Will not play again with Time victory**\n\nOther issues:\n-Spawning: The map is HUGE and they feel the need to land 2 of 3 other civilizations on MY ISLAND. There are a ton of islands left. Two bigger or the same size. Same story in the other Civ games, putting people on the same land or in the same area when there's a whole wide world out there.\n\nIncompetent Civs: Something that didn't change that should have was the stupidity of the other Civs involved. All I did was trade with them and they denounce me. No provocation. Then they go to war with me and say it's because of what I've done.\n\nAffinity quest choices that make even a tiny bit of sense:\nI went Harmony. I have screenshots of the choices I was given for the quest where humans went to another planet, mixed with the indigenous life, then came to mine. For some inexplicable reason, if I send them away I GAIN harmony! And when they ask to trade later, if I refuse to trade, I GAIN harmony! That doesn't mesh with harmony's philosophy.\n\nBut apparently Harmony followers are Space Racists just like Purity, only they happen to include one more planet than Purity followers. But 3 or more planets, no way, is that what you're saying?\n\nRandom Outposts: Aside from accepting trade from Stations, do they have another function?\n","October 26, 2014","false","101.9"," 41 of 67 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","41","67","0","0"

They just say NO over and over and over again. They are at war with other factions but make peace and declare and so on. I have gotten them down to their last two cities but then suddenly they have 20 units that "appear" out of nowhere wipe my troops out and then I have to start again. I can not trade as the two of them are in between myself and the other 5 AIs, so I cannot train enough troops to overwhelm the AIs without  them starting to disband as I cannot pay for their upkeep. The one had this Xeno swarm unit that wiped out 10 of my troops in nearly as many moves.  This game looks pretty but then don't judge a book by it's cover. As a single player I give it 2/10 for that load of BS game play. And at that steep price I feel that more than my wallet got ripped off. Wait until Steam offers it as a deal before buying.","October 31, 2014","false","93.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

I loved Civ 5 and for the most part, Beyond Earth plays a lot like it... Which is partially the problem. It plays like Civ 5 with less content and depth.  The new features in the game don't really do enough to make it feel any more than a mod or expansion to Civ 5.\n\nThere are only 8 factions to choose from, making it impossible to play with anymore than 8 players, even in singleplayer. You can modify the files to allow 8+ AI in singleplayer but it will only result in duplicate factions, rendering diplomacy confusing and practically unusable.\n\nThe UI is a lot less... informative than Civ 5. Many dulled, grey tones . In particular, telling factions apart on the minimap proves quite difficult with many simply appearing grey. The minimap is also way too small to make out any important details and minor feedback features such as trade route caps and "just finished building/researching" information are completely absent.\n\nAll in all, this game feels more like an unfinished expansion back or a decent mod than a quality civilization title.","October 26, 2014","false","4.3"," 48 of 80 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","48","80","0","0"

On the one hand it is an extremely enjoyable game and some of the new gameplay systems - the tech web, aliens, enhanced espionage and quests - provide a lot of depth; on the other the game lacks contextual relevance, with technologies, wonders and leaders coming across as rather bland.\n\nThis is a game I expect to see develop with the release of content patches and expansions. Obvious areas to overhaul would be the satellite system (which is currently overly gimmicky and tedious), the tech tree (it has variety but it's hard to get a sense of what to research for a balanced game) and sponsors (previously called Civs, they are few in number and extremely shallow). The interface is rather lacking, with buildings and wonders using a monotone colour scheme making it extremely difficult to see at a glance what you're constructing and what you should research.\n\nHowever, there is a lot that the game gets right. The new expansion system - whereby you must create an outpost and wait for it to expand to become a city - means that you have to be more strategic with your city placement and defence; the quest system allows you to shape the game around your play style; the espionage system allows for capturing cities and requires you to monitor your own cities; wonders are better balanced, as the tech web means players can focus on different areas with less overlap; happiness has been replaced with health and is no longer as punishing, as well as providing rewards for higher amounts.\n\nThose with an open mind and an interest in strategy games will love this. Those extremely attached to previous versions or hoping for a straight remake of Alpha Centauri will be left wanting.\n\nAny true Civ fan owes it to themselves to get this and give it a proper go.","January 16, 2015","true","54.4"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","20","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechaffinity/recommended/65980/","mechaffinity","Mechaffinity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechaffinity/","296 products in account","Over 450 hours. That's how much time I have on Civilization V. So, needless to say: I'm a big fan of the series, especially the predecessor to Beyond Earth. That said, I'm still not fatigued by the game, and I still can go back to Civ V and have a lot of fun on it. So, when Beyond Earth came out I was very excited to see what they'd do now that they're changing the setting to the future rather than the past and present.\n\nI'm going to be blunt: this is a massive letdown. This game is Civilization V if you sucked out all of its soul. This game has absolutely no personality, you don't get any of the old Ghandi and his nukes, or the backstabbing of Napoleon, or the wonder-stealing of Ramses. I've clocked up a good few hours on this game, and the leaders from this game are still yet to show any personality or do anything even remotely memorable.\n\nThis is a big problem, as in Civ V: part of what made it fun was the fact that each Civilization had a unique AI, as well as unique abilities. The abilities of those Civilizations would mean that every game would feel different, not only based on the Civilization that you choose: but the AI you're pitted against, your starting location, and sometimes just plain luck would play huge a part in how the game plays out. In Civilization V, each Civilization got its own unique ability, unit, and/or building. But, in Beyond Earth, when you're choosing your Civ, you get one stat boost, and then you pick three more bonuses. These bonuses lack any depth, it's stuff like "Get a free worker" or "Reveal minerals on the map" or "+2 culture for every city", and it's all just either boring stat bonuses or getting certain abilities or units a little bit early. In Civ V, you would get things that no other Civilization gets, and you could build a strategy around that. For example, the fact that Venice can buy City-States makes them a truly unique civ to play, and offers a unique experience. Beyond Earth lacks that depth and personality, and it really feels like hardly any real effort went into its design. The bonuses that these new Civilizations get are more akin to the bonuses you'd get from religion in Civ V. It's nice that they're there, but they're hardly game-changing. I'd also like to point out that Civilization V has a total of 43 civilizations, whereas Beyond Earth has only 8. You'd expect that those 8 would be really detailed this time, given that they have considerably less things to work on but: no. They feel like the type of Civilization someone would make if they'd just started modding Civilization V.\n\nAlso, the bonuses that you get from wonders are not very impressive. It's actually kind of hard to tell what is an isn't a wonder when looking at the technology tree, and their bonuses are so lacklustre you could easily mistake them for a standard building. On top of this, there are only 4 culture trees in this game, as opposed to the 13 that were in Civ V, and again: these trees are very boring and they offer things like "+2 production when healthy" and just really boring thoughtless things like that.\n\nThe graphics in this game are ugly, frankly. The actual models look great, better than Civilization V, in fact. But, the UI is absolutely hideous. It uses blue: exclusively. This just adds to the lack of personality here, and it also kind of makes it hard to understand what's going on on the minimap. I played as Franco-Iberia in my first game, and their territory on the map is represented with a pale blue. This made it so that on the mini-map, my territory was light blue, land was a darker blue, and the sea was an even darker blue. It was kind of confusing to look at, and it made the landmasses (as well as my land) look highly amorphous. On top of that, it looked genuinely ugly. The game's UI is like an Apple store: just a cold colourless environment. Well, colourless apart from blue.\n\nAlso, every victory type is the technology victory from Civ V. I mean, the exact same. No matter what Civilization you play as, no matter what you do, you are always doing it on behalf of advancing your technology. True, you can declare war and kill everyone, but whether or not you win is entirely based on who has the best technology: nothing else. There are a total of five victory types, but 4 of them are based on reaching the end of a technology tree. This is incredibly dull, because again, in Civilization V, you'd need different strategies to get different victory types. I could use the same strategy for every victory type in Beyond Earth. Why was there no cultural or diplomatic victory? Nope, all of the victory types in this game rely on you reaching the end of the technology tree that you've chosen.\n\nThe aliens are better than the barbarians from Civilization V, but only by a bit. They're still a massive nuisance, but there are ways to avoid them, and even use them to your advantage. For example, I built a city on a one-tile-island very close to an alien nest in the sea, and I managed to use the aliens as a defence. But, they're still mostly a nuisance, so it's not a massive improvement. They also feel kind of unfinished, as a lot of buildings seem to make it sound as though you can tame the aliens and turn them to your side, but you really can't: they will always be either hostile or neutral.\n\nAnother good feature is that the planets now have three different types of landscapes: terrain, fungal, and arid. They kind of shake up the atmosphere a bit, and it gives the illusion of variation quite well, which is a good thing. I'm unsure if they effect the resources or actual tile types, but it's quite nice playing on them (except fungal which is a nightmare because it is YET MORE BLUE).\n\nJust going back to the factions for a second, I'd just like to say that I highly object to there being no British civilization. In Civilization V I very much enjoyed playing as England and the Celts simply because I'm British and it's kind of cool to build places that you're very familiar with. Do Firaxis really believe that their European fanbase is entirely composed of French and Spanish people? There are more countries that have been completely excluded but it would take me far too long to list them all. In Civ V, they at least gave each country some kind of representation or another. For example, Italy wasn't in the game, but they instead included Rome and Venice, so they still had some representation in the game.\n\nIt's not a terrible game, but it just doesn't have the personality or replayability of the earlier Civ games. Some of the changes it makes are for the better, like the removal of barbarians in favour of aliens, and the ability to choose to start with a worker rather than a warrior. But, the idea of letting the players create their own civilizations has just made the game feel very thoughtless and rushed.\n\nPick it up only if you've somehow exhausted Civilization V and it is at a significantly reduced price.","December 24, 2014","false","16.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

What irks me about Beyond Earth is that several items that were originally in previous Civ titles (city-states, demographics, strategic view, etc.) have been removed. In addition to that, the tech tree feels awfully clunky, making you research the entire tech tree and thus every affinity, ♥♥♥♥ing up whatever affinity you had wanted to choose and stick with (you'll probably finish a game before this happens), while also having everything in the tech tree be the same color, irking me further.

The problem with Civilization: Beyond Earth is that it will be compared in one of two ways by almost anyone who plays it, one of which is a unflattering comparison to a huge degree:\n\n\n1: Against Alpha Centauri (not really a fair comparison in many ways, but understandable given that this is a sci-fi setting)\n\n2: Against Civilization V (an incredibly fair comparison, since much is reused from Civ V and a majority of players probably owned Civ V before getting Civ:BE).\n\n\nNow, let's deal with the first comparison: Alpha Centauri came out a long ways ago, pre-dates the game that Civ:BE is based on (Civ V) by a good number of years, and Civ:BE clearly was not going to have the same mechanics as Alpha Centauri. So, what's left to even draw a comparison to? Well, the sci-fi setting. Believe me, there are issues with Civ:BE, as I'll get into, but the comparison with Alpha Centauri is mostly not a fair one. That said, passing mention in interviews with those working on Civ:BE was made that Civ:BE would be a sort of 'spiritual successor' to Alpha Centauri, which may be true in one sense but in another sense was only going to encourage comparisons to AC despite the games being rather unrelated.\n\nBut the big, fatal flaw with Civilization: Beyond Earth is that it fails in every conceivable way when compared to Civilization V. First of all, if you own Civ V with all the DLC, then you have the classic 'Civilization Sequel' problem of every Civ sequel having none of the DLC features of the game prior. Even Civ V launched without religion, which, actually now that I think about it, was a standard feature at launch of Civ IV. But what saved sequels in the past was that new mechanics were brought in that couldn't be added in another expansion: in Civ V, we have 1UPT (1 combat unit per turn), among other things, which really changes combat. But then we have Civilization: Beyond Earth, and whether you call it a sequel or a spin-off, it's still the next Civ game to come out. And it does virtually everything Civ V did, with a few minor tweaks, a less-linear tech tree (that still has distinct paths for certain strategies anyways), and way less content.\n\nIf you already own Civ V and all its DLC, you have almost everything in Civ V as well as a bunch of things Civ:BE got rid of. Civ:BE eliminated different air-unit types... there's only one air unit now, which has branching upgrades that give you a choice of an ability. That's it. No bombers. No fighters. Just one basic unit. Civ:BE also back-tracked to having no melee naval units. Civ:BE also has no unique music (all music plays for all sponsors). Civ:BE also lacks unique units (no sponsor has any units that the others can't also get). Civ:BE also lacks artistic details for leader screens (very minimalistic  indeed).\n\nAdd all that to the already in-grained issue of every new Civ game losing some features from the previous games, and you have a really good game that is virtually identical to the last one that probably a majority of prospective buyers already own.\n\nEven 'new' features are not all that new: aliens are barbarians with a tiered system of aggression... affinities are basically an extension of the tech system since most affinity levels come through teching and not quests...  the tech web itself still plays out in a way where you will bee-line key techs and follow several linear paths. In fact, the tech web most-of-all is a let-down, because it's really just a different-looking tech tree you already saw in Civ V. To be fair, there are fewer pre-requisite techs for bee-lining certain things, but the new lay-out is not as different from Civ V, strategy-wise, as you might first suspect.\n\nIn the end, Civ:BE is a really good game... but is one that is likely to irritate its purchasers, as a large chunk will compare it to Alpha Centauri despite the two games being quite different, while an even bigger chunk will look at it and find it to be far less immersive than Civ V and drastically lacking in content *even before factoring in DLCs*. That's right, Civ:BE is one of the first Civ games in a long time that is virtually no better than the vanilla game before it (and Civ V vanilla wasn't even all that good). Which is ironic given that Civ:BE does incorporate some elements from Civ V's expansions (trade-routes, for one).\n\nI can't recommend Civ:BE. It's just too much like Civ V, which with all its DLC is not significantly more expensive than Civ:BE. I can easily recommend getting Civ V, but not Civ:BE. In an alternate universe where Civ V does not exist, maybe then. But the fact is that Civ V exists and does everything better, especially the artisic elements.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I like Civ:BE and will continue to play it. But not nearly like I played Civ V, because Civ V came out first and was a better game right-out-of-the-box in terms of interface and presentation. And even content-wise, Civ V had far more interesting unique elements for the civilizations than we'll probably ever see in Civ:BE.","February 1, 2015","false","187.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","5"

This is a thematic re-versioning of Civilization 5, with the same core mechanics, a change of vocabulary here and there, fantastical rather than scientific or philosophical explanations of new technology and research items, less voice over work, less dramatic score, no narrative progression or character progression, no sense of exploring a new planet and building a new civilization etc.\n\nOne of the dumbest mistake in the game has to be the setting. You leave earth and resettle in a new solar system in a new planet with EXACTLY the same civilization you left earth in. For example, the factions you are rebuilding in this new planet could be from australia, asia, europe or others (the names has been altered somewhat) segregated by geography on earth rather than idealogy, thus effectively making the backstory something like "earth is decimated and its people has to leave the planet to inhibit a new planet all together even though we are are flying off in different rockets just so we can continue our discord and differences in a the exact same alien planet even though theres clearly many different choice of inhabitable destination..." Why not fly off in ONE rocket, to inhibit a new planet as a HUMAN RACE, while exploring and carving out our SURVIVOR in a new planet with alien intelligent lifeform? Why fly to a new planet just to continue what we are doing on earth? Its like if North Korea says "oh hey, the americans chose THAT planet to settle in. Lets spend billions of dollars, fly light years to that same planet at the risk of our entire nation and continue our nuclear threat on them just to ♥♥♥♥ them off for eternity!"\n\nWell, with a flawed logic like that to start off with, I just couldnt get myself to believe that I was humanity's last hope in a new planet, the game falls quite flat in most ways since you are essentially just playing civilization on a new map, with new wordings and the occasional alien lifeforms to battle with. Sure, its still fun as a game but compared to Alpha Centauri, its science fiction story is too stale and common with little new ideas and compared to CIV 5 Brave New World, its just not as robust.\n\nIf you look beyond the new sheen and wordings, its really just a gimmicky rehash of CIV 5. If your a REALLY SERIOUS science buff (and not just science FICTION buff), then its really dissapointing because the subject matter intrinsically hold alot of potential for the stephen hawkings kind of cerebral approach. As a narrative its not Asimov, its more like some high school level science fiction story.\nI say this with a weary heart, as I grey up playing Civ 1 - 5 and almost all of sid meiers games for the last 25 years and loved every moment of those earlier games....","October 25, 2014","false","22.4"," 74 of 130 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","74","130","0","3"

There's a lot of mousing over and reading tool tips and not a lot of knowing at a glance.\n\nThe game is devoid of personality.  Your mileage may vary, but after sinking a lot of hours into it, I just don't see anything endearing in Beyond Earth as compared to Civ V.  The sponsors just aren't memorable, and don't feel unique.  The flavor text that goes along with the tech tree just doesn't pack the same charm.\n\nThe game isn't well balanced - I was able to jump from the easiest to the most difficult setting (Apollo) with no problem when I realized how easy it was for spies to take an AI capital via coup - domination victory by turn 100 every time.  There are a lot of choices in the game - affinity, sponsor, starting load out, etc - but because one choice is always the clearly superior option, they aren't interesting.  There aren't multiple ways to play so much as a right and a wrong way to play.\n\nAs many people have noted, the hyped aliens are just barbarians with a few more units and higher strength rating - In nearly 80 hours of play, winning as every leader on every map type across every difficulty setting - I can say there was never a point where the aliens were even remotely a factor in my play.  This feature falls totally flat.\n\nAll that being said, if you love Civ, or just 4X in general, I do think there is a likable game here, and I would recommend you purchase it if that is the case.  But this isn't Alpha Centauri 2, and with Firaxis having apparently already moved on to new products, the prospects of this game being "fixed" by expansion packs the way Civ V was seem bleak, so the majority of players should take a pass here.","March 22, 2015","false","96.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

Gameply isn't streamlined and after a time, you'll find yourself irritated at the turn sequence.  Combat is badly in need of balancing and the various factions really need more depth; perhaps unique units or unit enhancements. They all feel pretty much the same.\n\nThe health mechanic (aka "happiness") seems broken as well.  As your empire expands it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a "healthy" empire.  You can mitigate this by choosing nearly every quest choice to go in that direction which then begs the question, "why have the other choices?"  It needs balancing.\n\nOn that topic, the quests are a nice idea but being given a choice of quests would be better.  As it stands, you get some significant bonuses for completing them but will fail them if not completed in time meaning your game choices are a lot more linear if you want the benefit.\n\nIn a word, the game quickly becomes - boring....\n\nAll in all, a disappointment.  Fixable; certainly but it remains to be seen how it is approached.  I expect that there will be enough negativity out there to prompt some action.\n\nI have yet to run the Mantle verson of the game which I was excited to see, as I have a R9 series AMD card.  It crashes, displays on the wrong monitor and doesn't allow me to interact with the software when running.  I have had to quit out of it. I'm sure I get it to run but have not had the desire so far to tweak with it.  I note a number of people having issues with it so maybe some more testing would have been in order.\n\nOn the subject of playtesting - Had this been given to a number of long-term Civ/AC fanes to test, I have to believe a lot of the shortcomings would have been quickly apparent.  Did I mention I am disappointed?  I have been a big fan of Sid games back to the orginal Civ (DOS Version) and the Microprose days.  The orginal Civ is widely believed to be one of the most important games of all time; establishing a genre.

Do not buy.\n\nDue to the way the faction generation and affinity system works, all factions and leaders end up being completely generic, other than the ethnicity of their leaders, which is a lot less interesting than developed characters characterized by their ideologies. Tech-tree falls completely flat as generic baseline sci-fi, lacking the interesting speculation into the development of future technology that was present in Alpha Centauri, and and the combination of the two above factors makes all the tech-quotes completely uninteresting. There aren't even cutscenes for Wonders or Victory conditions. The one saving grace is the quest system, but even that could have been handled better and less predictably (Like the quest system in the Fall from Heaven mod series for Civilization 4).\n\nIn the end it just feels like a board-game. If that's what you're after, fair enough, but if you an actually good sci-fi game, go on GOG and get Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.

As a huge fan of Civ V, I cannot really recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of that game, as all you're really going to get is a re-skin of the same game, in space. It still retains much of the headaches of Civ V, and creates new ones. Victory conditions are long, drawn out and dull. Faction leaders are lifeless random schmucks with zero personality. The AI is abysmal and still cannot figure out how to play. The tech web is a massive disappointment after you realize that every game, you're essentially going to learn everything with an affinity boost to create your victory condition. Unit upgrades are basically cosmetic in nature and each affinity is nothing more than a "victory condition" and cosemetic change.\n\nEverything about this game just seems rushed out the door, and very half-hearted. There is quite a bit wrong with this game that I could go on and on about, but really there is no need. Beyond Earth is a let down in every possible way.\n\n**Edit 10/30/14**\n\nI'm still putting time into this game despite my negative review and first impressions. I'm also digging deeply into the game to find some qualities that I actually like. I'm having a really hard time finding them, but I think this game does have potential to become good...it's just going to take two major patches and some DLC...or user content.\n\nAffinities need work, and research, again like Civ V: BNW, is the most important resource. Now that your "affinity" is directly tied to research instead of your actual actions on the planet, stacking science is again the main strategy for every game. Making Affinities tied to actions, reactions, quests and how you actually handle the aliens and landscape could possibly be patched in, and I think that would go a very long way to making this game a bit more robust. Affinity unit upgrades should also be more than just cosmetic in nature. I feel like just becuase I have the third Tier Supremacy Tank, that it's no different than the third tier Harmony tank other than visual design. Their stats are identical, and the bonus you pick every level is pretty much the same, or so minor it doesn't even make a difference. These units need to become more unique per Affinity.\n\n**Edit 12/9/14**\n\nFirst major patch was released so I'm eager to see how the game plays now, but from reading the notes they still have not addressed the main issues with the game. Depite their work, Affinities are still just tied to stacking beakers, so every game is essentially the same. The only way Beyond Earth is really going to be fixed is re-working the Affinity system entirely.","October 26, 2014","false","15.1"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

If you don't read guides and etc, this game will offer you hundreds of hours of fun trying to find out what is best under different circumstances. You progress and keep progressing by learning from your mistakes on different difficulty levels. This stands apart from the sci-fi theme which you can like or, like me, dislike.\n\n\nHowever...\n\nBuild on the CIV 5 engine and the 100 turns pre-release video you'd expect this game to be CIV 5 in a different theme. A reskined and renamed game. And pretty much that's it! It is easy to relate resources, textures and names back to what they are in CIV 5. Really a somewhat 1:1 copy. I wonder how long it takes before workshop items appear that restores all to what they are called and look like in CIV 5.\n\nAs BE is being sold as a stand alone game and not as an expansion package to CIV 5, you'd expect the game to progress in terms of bug fixes, system resource hungryness, gameplay and etc. But no progression on that.\nRandom events are back from CIV 4 (or was that a mod?) and is the only additional thing. You can choose between two benefitting event options and that is the only gameplay that has been added in comparison to CIV 5. They claim to have worked on the multiplayer part, but it functions just as bad as CIV 5. Resync in turn 1, free techs being given to your opponents...\n\nSad enough it is build on the same engine as CIV 5, but they removed the dx9 and touchscreen executable. Dx9 offered way less desync issues while playing multiplayer and the touchscreen executable in CIV 5 let you play the game without the game crashing while touching the screen.\nOn the other hand they added mantle support to improve multicore performance, but hell i prefer a better functional product above mantle or a dx12 low level kind of api support.\n\n\nLooking further into the game there is some unbalance, unfinished work or too cheap reskinning ruining the gameplay.\nPlaying on marathon in turn 75 ~ 150 and I have to put my city production to work on energy or research as I already literally build every building that I researched. This is the first time in a CIV game that I can't build anything anymore in a city so early in the game. Ofcourse I can put effort in researching tech so I can build more buildings, but w00t so early in the game and nothing to do.\nThe cityproduction advisor tells me to build a building which improves the energy (gold for civ 5) output by +1 for each desert tile. But, I don't have a single desert tile anywhere near any of my cities so this building is going to cost me energy for each turn instead?\nThan the developpers crafted some awesome tile add-on called miasma (a marsh for civ 5) which gives you negative health for each turn you stand on it. By researching the correct stuff you can regain health when standing on it. A very neath idea, BUT... they did not change the code of the AI players when attacking defending. The AI idles in miasma losing health or attacks you from out miama... If they declare war you can just do totally nothing and wait for them to die in miasma!\n\nThey should have made this an expansion to CIV 5, should have worked on the multiplayer desyncs and should have added mantle support to CIV 5 instead of this unlogic split. As a standalone BE is standing in the shade of CIV 5 as it offers less content, more unbalance and the very same bugs that CIV 5 today offers.","October 26, 2014","false","36.3"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","27","44","0","0"

A modder could of done this. You most likely heard it before now you're going to hear it again. The features that the game have added are little and insignificant. They even take some features out like Luxury recourses.\n\nQuest one of the new features. Most are just killing 10 aliens, building some kind of building, getting resource pods or excavations. You get a choice usually when you build a building. All it is a chose of one befit or another. Like +1 Health (Happiness) or 1+ Energy(Gold)\n\nOrbital Layer is nothing but lunching a satellite that you wont see very much over a piece of land with give some kind of benefit in a AOE/AOI (Area of effect, Area of influence). Nothing all that special.\n\nThere is only a very small number of units. With only upgrade with your Affinities.\n\nAffinities give bonuses and buffs. These act like you ideologies.\n\nThere is now favors which the AI will give you when they want something you have and they don't have or don't want to trade something for it. You can then trade them in for Energy, recourses, etc...\n\n2. Bugs, bugs everywhere. They are so many bug that I can even begin to list them out. It could easily take up this hole review.\n\nHere's a couple, some Aliens turning invisible when attacked, and then making the Attacking animation take a very long time while you look at nothing. Quest bugged, Crashing at start up.\n\n3. Hello, Do you have a Sweet kickass Gaming monitor that can do more then 60hz?\n\nWELL THEN YOU PLAY AT 1280x1024! Oh yea. If you have a high Refresh rate you have to play at 1280x1024! Or you can play in window mode. NO! NOT BORDERLESS Window mode. Window mode. It's been TWO WEEKS since launch, and still no hot fix for it. They don't care. How does this make it pass play testers?\n\n4. Do you have out dated computer that meets recommended\nSystem Requirements with room to spare? You will get a Weird rainbow box pattern Graphical Glitch on the land when you load up a save file, or at random. This supposedly has to do with older GPUs. Even if you meet the recommended\nSystem Requirements.\n\n5. AI is still on the brain dead and weak side, or even worst. The AI never really talked to me or even went to war with each over. Maybe 2-3 time and they were very short.\n\n6. No personality in this game. Factions are bland, have no personality. They nothing different with them other than a bonuses, a color and a flag. They might as well have called them by colors of the rainbow. This game tries to tell a story with some special quest and the victories., but fails hard.\n\nTheres rumors that some features have been taken out of the game to be later resold to you as a DLC.\n\nThere isn't enough here to be anything that great. At the time of writing this I have 10.0 in this game. At about turn 200 I got so bored with this game that I did every thing I could just to my victory as fast as I could so i could end this game. Going through turns as fast I can. I still haven't finished my game.\n\nI wouldn't say walk away from this game, I would say Run!\n\n\nUpdate 2/2/15: I thought i would just give a little update about how this game has progressed. It took them a month and a half to fix their game, yet that patch even broke the game for a lot of people. That inexcusable for a AAA Dev. Most Dev have a patch within a week to fix the big bugs, and then patch the rest ASAP. It's been about 3 and a half months and there is still many bugs that haven't been fixed. Firaxis Games has been very silent on what's going on. No one knows what they're doing, or even how long it could be for a partch, if they're even working on one.\n\nPlease don't listen to the Fanboyism.

However, many of the bugs that were in the Civ 5 engine come along through space here too.\n\nEarly game is perhaps the best part of the game. You start off alone and weak, hoping to not anger the planet as you explore and get your feet wet. However the longer you play, the more you come to realize the blandness of the game. Quests are there, but they tend to only play a minor part of the game as a whole. You end up feeling you have a lot to do, but none of it really matters.

There just isn't much here to praise even with a generous eye. When the gameplay is decent, that's because it's essentially re-skinned Civilization V. The tech web is really the only innovation that changes Civilization V's core design in some intriguing ways.\n\nOtherwise, this is totally lacking in polish, in meaningful iterations of Civ V's designs, in anything that would give it one-more-turn attractiveness. The factions are dull and uninvolving, which I think explains why the designers were so eager to discourage comparisons between Beyond Earth and Alpha Centauri. The aliens are just pointless nuisances rather than a major, interesting wrinkle in the Civ formula. The game could barely give a ♥♥♥♥ about building Wonders--they get no description and their impact is buried under their incremental bonuses. The interesting endgame units often don't even come into play. The AI is fairly bad, though that's not exactly unique to this installment in the Civ series. The end of the game just sort of happens without fanfare.

This game is awesome, it just takes some time getting used to. When I played this game for the first time I felt lost, which I didn't expect after putting 350 hours into Civ 5, expecting this to be just a reskin. The game also felt so flavorless to me just like the negative reviews say, and leaders were without personality.\n\nBut when I've given the game enough time and started to understand it, I realized I was looking at it the wrong way. The game is not a reskin of Civ 5 unless you want to see it that way, and that's when you'll hate it. There are many layers to the game that gives it its independent personality and lets it walk on its own feet.\n\nThe biggest thing I'm referring to is afiinities. Affinities are the main pillar this game stands on, and it's the main factor seperating it from Civ 5. Affinities are what give this game its identity and flavor, not leaders. As you progress in each affinity, you get awesome snipets of story unique to each affinity that drives the story forward in a way Civ 5 never could. You start getting awesome unique units, buildings, and even a unique rich-in-story-and-flavor victory condition for each affinity as you tread their paths.\n\nThere are many other mechanics that make this game cool, like the sattelite layer, interacting with aliens, and artifacts. The tech web, while not beginner-friendly at all, makes for very interesting and diverse choices every single game once you are more familiar with the game.\n\nAlso the expansion "Rising Tide" makes the game even better, and the positive reviews on its Steam page prove that.

It feels like 75% Civ 5 and 25% Alpha Centauri. I played very little AC in the past, and don't remember a whole lot, but the spirit of that game is noticable in Beyond Earth.\nThose familiar with Civ 5 will have no trouble getting started in BE, requiring low in-game-advisory assistance. At first the game feels somewhat like an expansion to Civ 5, but you slowly realize that it separates itself fairly quickly with the tech-web and some of the missions/quests.\nIt's a lot of fun for a Civ-junkie like myself, but I still question the $50 price tag. There doesn't seem to be much change in the Civ 5 game mechanics to warrant a $60, but also feels much more than a $30 expansion. It also feels incomplete. Not like there are bugs of any kind, most of the errors in the game are the same that exist in Civ 5 and they are pet-peeves that could be worked on to improve stream-lining the gameplay more than "bugs". I just feel that the game was designed with limited flair and depth to make way for future DLC. Looking at how expansions were handled in Civ 5, I can see all sorts of additions to BE such as playing non-humans or a reworking of some units and the tech-web itself.\nOne thing I have considered from trying to get a broader view of the variety of quests/missions that are unique to this game is the potential for a much deeper story, something that strays from the usual Sid Meier's style, a bit more reminiscent of Warcraft 3 in how that game introduced characters central to a campaign. Your units in BE improve as your affinity levels rise, giving you some customization and beefing up their strength significantly. This makes you slightly more attached to units than previous Civ titles. While this is turn-based and Warcraft was real-time, it would still be neat to see a sort of campaign mode added to set this title apart from others, since it already seems like a hybrid.\n\nSid Meier's fan rating, despite it seeming prepped to cash in on future DLC: 8/10\nOverall rating for casual fans of turn-based 4X styled games: 7/10","November 3, 2014","true","182.3"," 122 of 222 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","122","222","0","3"

It's like Civ 5, but with completely bland leaders. It also repeats things that peeved me in Civ 5, like snapping me away from a unit I'm already interacting with to automatically put me in control of a different unit, or wasting my time by showing me somebody else's low-rank warrior fight a bug a hundred miles from one of my towns.\n\nThe new aesthetic is pretty neat. Everything is very spacey.  Your towns and units change in appearance to suit one of three general game paths that you go down. There's harmony, which is coexistance with the aliens, and purity and supremacy, which honestly seem to be the same, as I can't tell the difference between the two. One's orange, the other is red, and they're about...being violent, maybe? Or being a militaristic human? I don't know. I don't think anyone does.\n\nThe leaders? There are a small number of them, and they're meant to represent groups on earth that banded together. I.E., there's the Pan-Asian Cooperative. None of them are really interesting in any way. They have different accents, different colors for zones of influence, and have varying weak and generally non-influential powers. None of them have unique units. It's really a letdown. My favorite is one that speeds along espionage, as that seems to be the most useful. As the game goes on they have some kind of visual effect to denote the path they've chosen (they're subtle, and some paths may not even have ones, it seems), but you will never be able to see yours. That's a dropped ball.\n\nI'm new to the Civ series, and while this game is fun, vanilla Beyond Earth just isn't that good. I recently bought vanilla Civ 5, and this is just so inferior. When compared, the rulers in this one are weak and uninteresting, the wonders are nearly pointless, and the names of military units are completely unrelatable (and, by the way, the names of them change throughout the game - have fun keeping track!). Maybe expansions and future patches will make this game better. Until then, I feel like I've wasted my money...\n\ntl;dr It's Civ 5, with a new skin, the return of irritating features, and new boring leaders.","October 27, 2014","false","19.2"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","22","35","0","0"

It is very lack lustre and lacks the famous, "just one more turn" digital-crack addiction of its siblings.\n\nHad this game arrived side-by-side with Civ 5 in 2010, it might have been received better, but it hasn't really brought much more to the table than a semi-ambitious fan mod of Civ 5.

So i decided to make an own review and try to stay as objective as i can.\nSo is Beyond Earth (BE) as bad as most of the Reviews here are trying to tell you? No!\nIs it a good startegy game? Sure!\nIs it as good or as deep as Civ V+Expensions? Hell, no!\nShould you buy it? Well...\n\nThat depends on two very big and very improtant"If"s:\nFirst of all and most important:\n\nIf you like the Setting\n\nWith the expansions, Civ V offers a way deeper and more diversified experience. If you are not into the SiFi-Setting and like the imagination of a few refugees trying to colonize a new alien planet, there is no reason to buy this game instead of Civ V. There are just so many Gameplay elements missing like Cultures, buildings and units you actualy know, Religions, Unique Units and buildings for every Civ. and so on. While at the other hand there are only a few new elements like:\nThe affinity system: This is mabey the coolest inovation of the whole game: You can become a culture of geneticly modified Treelovers who want to become one with the planet" (literaly), technophile Cyborgs who want to anihilate the filthy human race, or a group of soldiers which are only a orbital deploy system (which is researchable) away from beeing the "Space Mariens" which is almost a violation of Warhammer Copyrights (just kidding).\nDepending on your research- and questdecissions (which are the biggest influence for progression in the 3 types of affinity), your Units and Cities start to look more and more like those folks and get different stats. Together with the different planetskinis, that also affect the gameplay a little bit, this system gives the game a lot of replayabilty in addition to the already known variety of a campaign which is entirely based on random events.\nAliens\nWhich are a silghtly more extensive version of the barbarians from other Civ-games, but dont expect more. They clearly missed an opportunity there.\nQuests, Decisions and Planet Exploration:\nFirst of all, there are a lot of things to explore with your explorers. This gives you especialy in times of peace sth to do appart from building new colonies, building roads, building farms, or building buildings. Additionaly there are some bigger quests unlocked through exploration, research, progress or random events. They are intresting written (not extraordinary good nor bad) and give you a little bit of roleplay. Unfortunatly all the quest work the same way: Do Sth (most of the times constuct a building or research a tech) and then a decission which gives you some bonus out of it. But its still bigger and better than the Citystate-Quests from CIv V\nAdditionaly, for every new building, there is a small decission-quest which gives you the opportunity to unlock addtional bonuses from them.All of those quests are only written down - there are no videos or even pictures throughout the whole game, which is not only my biggest point of criticism but also the second If:\n\nYou can only enjoy the game, if you are willing to read through TONS of  (at least in German language version)  very complicated written texts.\n\nIn Civ-Games, you know exactly what you are doing, when you order f.e. the Pyramids, a Knight, or a City Wall, or research the Wheel. You know these things from your live, documantaries or from history education in school. In BE we are in a SiFi-Setting with tons of buildings, tech, units, resourses and so on you don't know. They have strange names and minimalistic Icons, that tell you absolutly nothing about how they look like, or even what they do at all. Even if you have completet a wonder, you get nothing but a lousy blueprint of that building. Yes that's right no video like in Civ IV or Civ II not even a freaking picture of how this would look like - just a STUPID BLUEPRINT! When you build the Great Wall in Civ 5, you know how it looks like from thousands of pictures and videos - you even might have visited it already in reallife. Whilst in BE you have NO IDEA what youre spending your production on, when  you build the "Tectonic Anvil", or the "Stellar Codex".\nThis game would have desperatly needed videos, that show you your wonders in action, or at least big 3D-Models of all your Buildings and Wonders (like in Civ 2) in your city screen or at least some FREAKING PICTURES. But there is nothing of that. So you have 2 options: You either say: "♥♥♥♥ it" and just build strange icons with strange names only for their stats, then you're not goint to enjoy this game at all - as you just cant identify yourself one bit with your Colonies. This is why many people descripe this game as "soulless" even if the developers actualy put a lot of effort into the lore of their universe. The problem is, that the only way to "find" the soul of this game, is through the descriptions.\nSo what I recomment you to do is to read the description of EVERY SINGLE unit, every building, every wonder just everything. This is the only way to get an Idea of the lore and the universe you're in and the only way to get attached to the game. So while this is already a lot to ask from the modern gamer, who is used to have at least 5 hours of cutszence in their CoD Story Campaign. it's getting even worse:\nAll the descriptions are written from a retroperspective point of view: All, or at least most of your actions through the game have already happened. It's just written like the events in BE were based on our actual history (just like the other Civ games) and we are some colonists from the year 2400 or sth like that who are replaying their own past. While this might be a cool idea they just took it over the top by putting an overhelming number of scientific special words in their descriptions. It might be conceivable, that those words might be part of general knowledge in 300 years, but for today, you almost need a universty degree in Medicne, Biolgy, and Physics to 100% understand, what they are writing in those texts. Of course u can also get the point of the descriptions without understanding every single word, but if you're not used to a certain pretty high level of scientific parlance, you're going to have struggles to understand those descriptions, even if you are already willing to read them.\nThe decissions of how they try to immerse the player into their game are so poorly made, that i wish the responisble designer to get eaten by angry Xenos!\n\nBut if you think, that you are fulfilling both "Ifs", and are that type of player, that likes to create the biggest part of the story in his imagination and through the gameplay, just like it is needed in games like Skyrim, other Civ games or Total War games, you are going to have a lot of fun with this game. At the moment i enjoy BE more than Civ 5 just because of the Setting and the way the actualy pretty well written and described universe fuels the biggest graphics engine that exists: My imagination.\nBut if you're not a fan of the SiFi-Setting or are not that guy/girl that likes to read him/herself trough tons of text just to get a better immersion, there is no way to recommend this game over Civ V. Mabey you can check it out when it is at 10 Bucks on a Steam Sale.","May 19","true","70.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There are so many techs and one tech rarely leads to another tech in any way that makes sense. Endless Space (ES) has a nice, orderly web to it. Military tech goes up, science/industry right, growth/happiness left, colonization down. I don't even have to look at anything to know where everything is. If I want a military option, I go up. BE though, there are so many links that have nothing to do with one another. My first game had me research something that required a special resource, where was the tech for that resource? I still don't fk'n know, buried within a million other options. The Web is a horribly ugly thing.\n\nSecond; AI. The AI is atrocious. Enemy factoin explorers can't figure out how to move, so they move between the same 2 tiles till I destroy it. Autoexplore is garbage, I hit that on my explorer and it sits there till I take control of it. Civ5 had AI personalities like Montezuma or Ghandi, but BE I feel like I'm playing against the same 7 people, all of whom are completely irremarkable. To top off the irremarkable factions though, the AI is completely passive. I've tried to anger it multiple times to no effect.\n\nThird; Aliens. These things should make early game a pain. They do not. They will 1 shot an explorer, but they'll ignore my colony or the military that is murduring them into extinction. Seige worms? They are target practice. They don't "seige" anything, they sit there till I've taken the required 20 turns to kill them. Yawn.\n\nFourth; decisions. Here is something I thought BE was going to do well. My first game had me make choices, does my ___ give me extra production or food? Cool....next game I get the same exact choices to make and they all end up feeling boring. I would love to see some randomization, maybe a chance that something fk's up and my thorium reactor does something bad. but no, the same boring decisions each game. I never feel that the choices I've made actually make a difference. Some choices have you allow an invasive species to continue invading the planet or stop it, you choose and your affinity level goes up, but beyond that, nothing.\n\nFifth; UI. So, one gripe I've had with most 4x strategy games is the UI, especially the Civ games. What's worse is that Endless Space has an amazing UI. However, BE's UI is worse than I could imagine. Sometimes the "exit" button is on the bottom of the screen, sometimes It's on the top.... CONFIRM CONFIRM CONFIRM CONFIRM and, you guessed it, CONFIRM AGAIN!!!!! When I make friends, I get the same message from all my other friends talking about how we are friends with their friends....I don't like the "Let's get our names tatooed on eachothers butts and be BFFF(yes, an extra forever)" AI, much less the fact that I have to reconfirm it a million times. ES is amazing because everything I do can be done with the left mouse button or the rmb quickly, completely, and, most importantly, comfortably. This UI though, has me hunting everything down. It's fugly beyond compare.\n\nSixth; A glorified mod. That's all I can see this game as. It's Civ 5 on another planet but without civiliaztions that feel different from eachother. I didn't expect the game to be something so completely different so as to not be a civ game anymore, but I also didn't expect it to play it SOOOOOOO safe. Every design decision I see feels like the accountants decided to design the safest game they could. BE doesn't really do anything remarkable.\n\nIt's a decent game, but it's a glorified mod worth about $15-20 and not $60. And, worst of all, it's an ugly glorified overpriced mod that does nothing remarkably. I have no doubt in my mind that I will forget about BE as soon as the next competing game comes out. It's a good game, it's just a completely averge good game.\n\nFinal score: Gonna forget it within 1 year/10.","October 26, 2014","false","22.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

So when i first heard about Beyond earth i was super pumped i unfortanetly bought into the hype and it bit me in the ♥♥♥ so hard. first of all if you want a new inovative civ game you wont be getting it. This "new" game could honestly be a realy well done mod or hell they probaly could have just made this a big Dlc pack. the factions feal pointless as they offer next to no variation not to mention their are a lack of factions and unit variation in general. also unlike how you could have games of 16 in civ 5 now that number has been limited to 8 because of lack of factions i am guessing? They could have easily given each faction a unique unit and building but instead each faction gets a little wimpy bonus and diffrent color. The actual gameplay is exactly the same to civ 5 only with the new health system that in my opinon is broken and realy limits your empires growth while not even effecting the Ai.\n\n\nAmitidaly the game has a few redeming factors like the planetery wonders and affinitys and even the difrent world types are real cool. But it need way more variation and content to even be considerd a new game. Even the Native aliens which are cooler than Barbs from civ 5 massivly lack variation and loose relevence after the 2nd age , the " mighty" siege worm being killed by one tank unit and such.\n\nThey even dumbed down the mod buddy and such by removing the world builder which was huge fun for me in the last game. that realy pisses me of since their was no reason to get rid of it and they promised it in the pre release. Over all the game is ok but it dose not deserve to be considerd its own game at all. like i said eaither a good mod or big Dlc. Good for about 25 to 35 hours of fun depending of online freinds wait till its on sale to buy.\n\nOver all its a 6 outa 10 for me and it saddens me to give it that score","January 7, 2015","false","26.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Well, at least the stuff that he fondly remembers—not the Indian history lessons hammered into his brain thanks to the fear of an impending exam the following day. With Firaxis’s Civilization: Beyond Earth, however, there’s a different kind of learning to be had—you learn more about yourself as a person, or more particularly, whether you will turn into a megalomaniacal dictator with a thirst for blood, a defender of humanity in its current state of technological and social evolution, or a future-ecologist who has a curious love for all things alien.\n\nIT’S NEVER TOO LATE TO GO BACK\n\nIf anything, Civilization: Beyond Earth made me realise that it was never too late to go back; back from the ocean of triple-a blockbusters with obscene production values and downloadable content to a game that’s mostly about building stuff, indulging in a spot of faux diplomacy and spending several hours to get a minor Tile productivity bonus. This is interesting because Beyond Earth is doing the opposite as far as the series is concerned; it’s going forward. No longer constrained by our miserable little blue planet (which Firaxis foresee becoming uninhabitable in the future), Beyond Earth takes you on a journey to the stars—the story begins with a moving cut scene in which we see a father bidding farewell to his daughter so that she can find hope for us all somewhere else in the universe—a theme that carries through across the game.\n\nOF AFFINITIES AND FAN SERVICE\n\nThere isn’t much of a departure from the way in which Civilization fundamentally works in Beyond Earth—fans will be greeted with familiar visuals (which could use a sprucing up after all these years) and scenarios that require decisions to be made. While the game does allow for players to choose their own path by picking an ‘Affinity’, of which there are three: Supremacy, Harmony and Purity. Suffice to say, they’re both akin to ideologies from Civ 5, but offering military and other bonuses.\n\nWith Beyond Earth’s considerably hostile planets, armies are of utmost importance. Alien life-forms can be quite aggressive, while planets are laden with Miasma, a harmful gas that damages units over time (at the beginning, at least). Over the course of several hundred turns, I noticed that pretty much all non-military activity plays second fiddle to the might of your armies and their quest for blood. Yes, you can still achieve endgame objectives without annihilating all other human factions, but having already built up considerable forces to repel alien threats, it feels like a no-brainer to achieve your goals through might. Besides, diplomacy doesn’t always produce good results given that the AI is pretty dodgy for the most part.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\n\nCivilization: Beyond Earth is the absolute perfect follow up to Civilization V, with strange new worlds to explore and advanced societies to establish. What’s more, Beyond Earth’s sandbox allows you to really play the way you want—made possible by the flexible research tree/leaf system. The quest system gives the game much needed context while easing players into the kind of choices they will need to be making on a macro level, while the endgame is greatly affected by the path you take in terms of Affinity. On the downside, I found the emphasis on combat to be excessive—more so than previous games in the series, while the UI (despite streamlining) can still feel overwhelming to new players.\n\nMy Rating: 8/10","January 30","true","12.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Got into it around it's third iteration and loved it, as well as, 4-5 + Alpha Centauri. I went as far as buying a Surface Pro 2, just so I could have a mobile touchscreen version of Civilization 5, that's how much I love that game. Despite a long backlog, it's the game I tend to play every night after work.\n\nBeyond Earth will not be replacing CIV5 anytime soon unfortunately. The first thing that made this game a complete step backwards was the lack of Touch Support. Here is a game that is pretty much a modded civilization 5 and they somehow made it even less optimized and unable to support touch input. Despite lowering all the settings on my SP2 it quickly crashes after 2-3 turns.\n\nSo then my only option is to play on my gaming rig or stream it to the tablet. So I played through my first game on the gaming rig. While it wasn't terrible, I agree with everyone else. The AI isn't very intelligent, the leader screens are bland, aliens (barbarians) are really annoying, help is non-existent in the game or just not streamlined, it's missing things like advisor pages, etc... Health and energy, affinity and tech are all there to limit and draw out your city's progression.\n\nTo give an example of the difficulty I had with this game, I was at one point bored enough to attack another city. I could see from their defenses they could easily wipe out some of my military. But a few turns later they were begging to give me a city. Meanwhile I can't even explore the ocean without a group of Kraken ganging up on my ships.\n\nThe Tech tree is just convoluted and difficult just for the sake of saying "oooo sci-fi." Did I mention that I'm color-blind and the colors do me no favors..? Not to mention the Miasma that just seems to blend into the tiles for my eyes. I of course will parrot the same disdain for trade routes constantly bugging you for renewal.\n\nI want to love this game. I want to pretend that my disdain comes from it being different. But ultimately I feel like they got rid of a lot of the good and balance that was in CIV5. I know when CIV5 first came out there was a lot of hate and people felt there were balance issues. Hopefully the same will be said about BE and further patches + dlc will really develop this game.\n\nThis will be the last game I preorder from Firaxis, next time I will wait for a sale on HB or GMG with all of the DLC at $5-10. Especially if touch support is completely dropped.","October 27, 2014","false","4.8"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","1"

The a.i does almost nothing except makes a few cities even on the highest difficulty.\n\nThe civ leaders also lack any real kind of personality and just come off as boring. They have very few lines and practically all non-spoken dialogue is word for word from civ V.\n\nThe aesthetic for the tech web and so on is horribly designed. It is very hard to differentiate things or tell if the tech you're researching unlocks a wonder. It's all just boring as hell monochrome.\n\nThe aliens would have been a great addition if they actually would attack your cities and destroy improvements, currently they just mill around outside your borders (even without city upgrades that force them two spaces away from your cities) even if you start comitting alien jihad. Sure, they'll actively try to murder your units when you ♥♥♥♥ them off/are within two hexes of a nest, but otherwise they really don't do anything.\n\nEspionage is very fun and worthwhile in this, with you building up intrigue in cities by doing operations with your spies in them, unlocking new operations you can do within them. You also get quit a few spies to conduct these operations with, so if you wanted to focus on that you easily can.\n\nTrade routes are a lot more essential in this than in other civ games, especially since there's no max distance a caravan can travel (just need a clear route) and that you can have two trade routes in each city. The changes to them have made the game much more fast paced, since you will have quite a bit of currency to spend to directly purchase buildings/units.\n\nAll in all, I would wait for a sale and/or for the first expansion to come out to round out the game better, it just feels kinda bare gameplay-wise in some areas and has strange mechanics decisions in others (new cities being founded take a few turns before they're fully built and operational being one of them, it isn't annoying or anything, but it doesn't seem to accomplish that much in the long run). Do not believe the hype.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a few friends to play this with, this is probably the best civ to do it with to date, since the games end faster than in other entries in the civ series. Though there apparently are problems with the multiplayer, though I haven't really had any issues yet.","October 26, 2014","false","25.5"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","29","49","0","1"

There's a lot to like about it.  It's gorgeous, the combat is meaty and satisfying, the core Civ 5 gameplay is as good as ever... but something's missing.\n\nI know it's unfair to draw comparisons to Alpha Centauri, and I'm going to try to avoid doing so, but it's disappointing how BE lacks any real, impactful way to conduct diplomacy or interact with the aliens.  There's no global council/UN sort of diplomatic institution.  The addition of "favors" doesn't have much of an impact.  And even for a Harmony civ, there's no real difference in your approach to the aliens; sure, your unique units have aliens in them, but the ones on the map are still as mindless and randomly hostile as ever.\n\nThe small map sizes and the small number of civs also hurt the game.  Even a "huge" map feels much smaller than a Civ 5 map of the same scale, probably to make up for the fact that there are only a handful of civs--and those civs' leaders don't really seem to have the kind of powerful, identifiable personalities of their quasi-historical forebears.  The few snippets of dialogue each leader has only communicate the barest sliver of personality.  The ARC lady likes money, I guess?  Elodie is French?  The African Union guy is... there?  All of the techs have little quotes, many of them written by one of the leaders, but even these don't have a tenth the personality packed into, say, Miriam Godwinson's furious screed about nanomachine "homonculi" from (drink) Alpha Centauri.\n\nBut the biggest drag comes from the most boneheaded carryover from Civ 5: happiness, nee "health."  Just as in Civ 5, it's an annoying drag that forces you to spend resources combatting it.  Unlike in Civ 5, however, you can't mitigate it with luxury resources, and you can't turn excess health into a powerful golden age.  You have to either keep building and researching Health buildings--which basically negates the entire point of the game's touted "tech web" system, since you'll need every single Health structure you can get just to stay out of the red--or manually take control of your army of Workers, since their auto-build AI doesn't seem to care about Health and won't build Health-boosting improvements without specific direction.  (They will, however, be happy to build huge swaths of Energy-sucking Terrascape improvements... which also don't benefit Health, which is dumb.)\n\nThere's potential here, but this game is going to need expansions and mods before it starts to shine.  Don't buy it just yet.","October 26, 2014","false","34.2"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","29","49","0","0"

Gameplay is similar to Civ V only better. There is a lot more decision making that makes you feel as if you were actually in charge of a civilization, and the results have real, almost tangible effects on the game. I felt like I was discovering a whole new world the entire time and really strategizing my resources and decisions, whereas Civ V, I often find myself in the same worlds making the same decisions. Here, the victory combinations and outcomes are endless. My favorite component of the game are the quests. It gave me something to do and incentives to build improvements, fight aliens, go on spy missions, etc. Similar to the quests given by city-states, but self-paced (no turn limit), no diplomatic pressure, and better rewards.\n\nAI is much better. I played for about 185 turns and no one declared war on me. I also didn't feel as if someone were nagging me every two turns. There are no city-states, per-se, but there are stations you can establish trade routes with and the benefits are much better (more science, culture, etc.). No one begged me for money, either, which was nice. There was lots of room for expansion, even on the standard map, so border issues were almost non-existent, save one time I discovered artifacts near Brazil. You also get to choose missions for your spies and what they can steal (if they succeed). Alien personalities were pretty random and I had a few explorers killed, but not as much of a nuisance as the barbarians in Civ V. Never felt as if I had to constantly protect my workers or colonists, and they didn't pillage tiles nearly as often.\n\nFew drawbacks: 1.) Resources and their management. Rather than relying on the a few basic improvements/resource types (quarries, mines, plantations, etc.) there are a lot more resources (which I liked), and most of them have specific improvements that need to be discovered by exploring the tech web. Thus, resources take a lot longer to obtain, are more scarce and harder to trade, and can drastically effect game play depending on your location and what type of victory you're aiming for 2.) I was a bit confused as to how expeditions work. I did a few, but there were times I would bring my explorer to an expedition site and couldn't do anything. This could very well be a big that requires what I imagine to be a small patch, but nonetheless it was a bit off-putting. 3.)The miasma was an inconvenience.\n\nOverall, the strategic value and adventure in this game off-set these things. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys any games from the Civ series and anyone looking for a strategy game that really puts you in control. Still haven't finished the current game I'm on (I believe I left off at turn 185 which put me around 2900 AD from what I remember) or tried multiplayer, but I can't wait to see what else this game has in store.

Doesn't have the feel of progression that you got in Civilization, and it got pretty dull for me after the first game. Considering you start off with the ability to build roads, farms, mines, and generators(tradingposts like old civ) straight off the bat, and then later you are getting all sorts of tile improvements that are way better so you wind up having to build over half the stuff you allready made making you spend uncessisary amounts of time micro-managing your workers. (I've never been a fan out automated workers.) The Technology tree is, in my opinion, VERY unbalanced. Because of its web-like structure there are pretty much 3 levels beyond the middle. And when you research one of your technologies you realize that it would take around 30-40 turns to get a tech that is further away from it, so you research other techs instead while you get your science up. Not with free technologies though. With free technologies you can jump for techs that will give you HUGE advantages over everyone else. Say you research Physics, then that unlocks bionics which would normally take 60 turns to get from your position, but not with free techs. You can instantly research things that would normally be FAR beyond your reach until mid-late game. So far i've only seen a few ways of getting free techs, Franco-Iberia gives you a free tech after 10 virtues, and Slavic Federation gets one after they launch their first orbital unit. Also another way is if you put 15 points into the Knowledge virtue tree, which doesn't take long because the knowledge tree is focused on science and culture. By combining these you can gain technologies that are normally unobtainable until late-end game. Say you get 2 free techs some time during mid game and you have got robotics allready, You can then grab nanotechnology, meaning you can start building the exodus gate as soon as you reach purity 13. Using free technologies can allso be used to get affinity points quicker than everyone, and it doesn't take much to Upgrade your units into much stronger units. All you need is 6 points to get the 3rd tier Soldier giving it 24 str. where as the marines prior to it only have 14 str. , nearly DOUBLING your units strength compared to everyone elses. And once someone gets ahead in affinity there is normalling nothing you can do unless you can catch up, and catch up fast. Oh yeah and you know how in Civilization 5 you had to build any new units you got or upgrade your now-obsolite units inside your borders? Well once you upgrade a unit in this it automatically changes all of the units to the upgraded version. So you could be fighting a large group of enemys and then all of a sudden all of his men turn into super powerful Centurions (48 str.) who are literraly 2x as strong and the unit prior to them. Oh yeah, and because of that it means someone can build loads of units and then get one more point of affinity, having a much bigger army then if they built them after they got the upgrade. (Upgraded units cost much more production to build.) On the topic of affinitys I feel that purity may be a bit stronger than Supremacy and Harmony. Harmonies units abilities are that they get large bonuses for when they arn't adjacent to eachother and for being in miasma, and supremecies units get bonuses for adjacent unit to them and flanking enemies. Purity on the other hand get bonuses for attacking and defending. Their Soldier units can get bonuses when on defence and/or bonuses for unspent movment, along with the abilites to heal every turn with the Centurion. Then their tanks (instead of getting the same bonuses like the other affinities get for all of their units) get bonueses to their attack strenght and/or bonuses for unspent movement, (kinda the same but still a bit different), and with the Dragoon tanks they get 50% bonuses against cities. Also take note that their tanks are stronger than the other affinities tanks. Not saying that the other ones are bad, I just feel that purity gets move convenient abilities. And on the normal difficulty the ai are very unintelligent, taking forever to level up their purities making them very easy target mid-late game for players. Also I once played on a huge map and meet an ai whos capital was about a good 50 tiles from me who had a good location for a second city near it. Instead of settling there though, it traveled 50 tiles down to my capital and founded their second city in resource-barren location right next to my capital. Speaking of cities and resources, the removeall of happiness and replacing it with this 'health' system has, in my opinion, SEVERELY broken the ways you build your empire. Unlike in Civilization 5 where you could build many cities, just as long as you keep them relatively small until you build more buildings and improve some nearby resources to get happiness, you could have a large, vast empire of cities. In this that is nearly impossible, having more than 3 cities mid-late game you will still be struggling with keeping your health positive, let alone 5 or 7 cities. Why is it so hard to stay healthy? Because the only way to get health is through buildings, no longer is there any resourses to build cities at to make sure your empire stays in the posatives while the city grows. No longer is there any way of getting help from another Ai or Player and trade for a resource to get you out of a bad situation. All you can do is build buildings/and or raze every city that you can. In the end the customization is poor, "Choose good upgrade A or near worthless upgrade B.", honestly, who is going to choose +1 movement when you could have it heal every turn? No actual choosing what weapons, armors, chassis, or reactors like you could in Alpha Centauri. Affinities are pretty much glorified ideologies from Civilizaton 5. It runs off of the same engine Civilization 5 does which kinda makes it feel more like I paid for a overhauled version of civ 5. I could really go on a find more things to say about this game but I'm thinking I'll just end it on this. In the end this game is basicly a unbalanced version of civilization 5, feeling very slow at alot of times. I'm sorry to say this but being a huge fan of the entire Sid Meier's Civilization series I do not recommend it. If you are still intrested in getting the game for yourself I wish you the best of luck and hope that you have a better experience than what I've had. If you'r looking for a game that is like Alpha Centauri and more up-to-date then I would highly recommend you have a look at Pandora: First Contact developed by Proxy Studios. In my opinion it does much better at brining back the Alpha Centauri gameplay elements that we all love along with some newer features. Kinda a shame when the company that has been developing these civ games didn't manage to make a better sequel to their own game...","November 17, 2014","false","19.3"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

That means most of the mechanics and the tools to modify them already existed. This game wasn't made so much as it was just slapped on top of it's predecessor. With all that I at least expected that the developers could put their time into expanding the game play and adding new features but after spending the last 3 nights with it, it feels like a gutted product. I couldn't find enough to like to justify the price or the name.\n\nHere is what I found missing.\nNo religion - Now we have affinity instead. You gain levels by researching certain since paths in the tech "web". All but two of the victory conditions require you to pursue an affinity at the cost of a well rounded society.\n\nConfusing Interface layout left a lot of information hidden by default.\nNeutered Diplomatic options left you with little options when it came to protecting the new versions of city states.\n\nBoring victory conditions -You need to research a tech, gain x affinity and then construct a wonder.\nNo cut scenes for wonders/victory 4 hours of playing and I was rewarded with the same tired victory screen from Civ 5.\nTerrible wonders that take way too long to build. I saw very few wonders that actually had an impact greater then a regular building...they just took 50-70 turns to build.\n\nI'm hoping for a patch of some kind soon...I feel like I got half a game here.","October 27, 2014","false","26.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

When I bought-no, sorry, preordered-this, I played for a bit, realized I didn't know what I was doing, because of the nowhere-near-as-useful help system in Civ 5, watched the AI build wonders that I didn't know how to build because of the disorganized tech web as well as the fact that a Wonder looks like a normal building, and then played Civ 5. I really wish I waited for other people's reviews and give this one a miss. There's technically 1000 civs, no joke, but only eight sponsors, the things that would be considered actual civs. Eight's a bit of a step down from the full count of 43 with all expansions and DLC with no mods in Civ 5, plus, there's no feeling of dread if you meet a warmonger, no feeling of awesome when you meet that civ that's always your friend, and, since these are future civs, you have no idea what their personality is, especially their preferred affinity, as, it seems, that decides who your friends are. (Although these may not exist as I saw the Asian civ pick Harmony on my first full completion of the game, and Purity the second time, but since there are preferred ideologies in Civ 5, I'm assuming there probably is.) This game isn't terrible, but there are very few things that set it apart from Civ 5, and pretty much all of them have problems of their own. First, there's the tech web, which is a tech tree with less techs and higher science requirements. The tech web has "branch techs" like Ecology which usually give a couple of buildings, like your average tech from Civ 5. It also has "leaf techs" which, far more often than not, contain a level up in an Affinity and a bonus to an improvement or a wonder which does much less than one of its Civ 5 equivalents. Then there's the Affinities themselves: Harmony seeks to live in, well, harmony with the aliens and the planet, Supremacy turns your civ and its population into cyborgs, and Purity which does nothing but be human and dismiss everything else as "false." These Affinities, as said before, dictates who your friends will be, and it starts fairly close to the start. Even worse, it's quite difficult to change your main affinity, in fact, it's much more difficut than it is to change your ideology in Civ 5. None of the victory paths are familiar except for Domination, but the other ways are...odd. The Contact victory is essentially meeting God, the Emancipation victory turns all the people still on Earth into cyborgs, the Promised Land victory takes everyone from Earth to live on the new planet, and the Trancendence victory effectively makes everyone share a brain with the planet. These are more ridiculous than the Diplomatic victory in Civ 5, because there's just too many people on the planet to have one person rule over them. About the only good thing I can think of that doesn't have a defect somewhere is the Virtues, or Social Policies: Unlike Civ 5, they provide bonuses for adopting multiple policies horizontally as well as vertically. The game certainly is playable-I pretty much only play singleplayer in games in general-and I would go so far as to say it's good, even great if it was the first Civ game I played, but the first Civ game I played was Civ 5, and it's definitely not as good as that. Maybe when expansion packs and DLC come out, it'll be a pretty good game, but for a Civ game, the combination of unanimated character faces, or even the fact that their facial expression changes to anger when hostile/guarded, the slower tech speed, the lack of eras to know how far you've gotten through the game, the lack of unique units for civilizations (Affinity unique units do NOT count), the nerfing of City-States to Stations that give a fraction of what City-States gave you and the general blandness of the game (Civ 5 was a LOT brighter, as in brighter colours, as well as the generally absurd events that can take place during a game of it) leads to me not recommending this game. In the future it may be better, but for now, it is very disappointing, and currently not worth your money.\n\nTL;DR: Read the second-last sentence.","October 27, 2014","false","14.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Sure there are a few issues here and there but overall it is fun. Although many have compared it to civ 5 and argued civ 5 is better, i disagree. This game is similar to civ 5 but different enough that it has its own personality (i.e. affinity levels are how you level up your units), quests for you to do (which is new) and instead of trying to use characters based on earth history (albeit loosely) like civ 5, this game starts you on a new planet.\n\nSure that path you choose (i.e. affinity) means that pretty early on you have to decide which affinity your going to major in (as this determines which resources you will need the most). Its still engaging. In my opinion this is no different than when I played civ 5 and had historical expansionist leaders nearby to me (i had to formulate a strategy early on to decide whether i was going to woo one or some of my neighbours or go full on military myself and quash my neighbours).\n\nThis game requires similar decisions as people with similar affinity will be warmer towards you and more hostile towards you if your not. So all in all i don't find it detrimental that early on i need to pick an affinity. In general though the comparison to civ 5 (which is also a great game, but has been around for years and has had expansions and other dlc content added on over time) is not a fair comparison content wise. Civ 5 has been out for awhile and they released content that expanded the game...beyond earth just came out and people are comparing to civ 5 as it is now (not as it was when it came out..which was still damn good).\n\nThe graphics are amazing, it plays similarly to other civ games so if you have any experience with previous civ games you should be good to go after a few games. New fans to the series will face the daunting task of anyone coming into any civ games (using the civilopedia and advisors often to find out WTF is going on.\n\nI haven't played this game as much as some of the negative reviewers simply because i have bought a lot of games lol..what can i say i love games. But i can still come back to this game and enjoy my time spent here (i just have to be in the mood to play a 4x strategy title, and have the time to to so, as i like to play through a whole match in one sitting) as any 4x strat fan knows it takes awhile to go through a whole game.\n\nAll in all this game lived up to my expectations from viewing the early gameplay videos and developer videos. I read the reviews before i bought it and they recommended it too.\n\noverall i am satisfied with this game and have already preordered starships (as this game although a standalone will have some cross over play features with starships).\n\nfinal opinion...its a great 4x strat game, buy it if you like 4x strat games as there is a lot here to do, and its fun and has a good deal of depth.","March 7, 2015","true","103.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

If you have Civ V, in my opinion, you DON'T need this game unless you collect firax games. The only reason you would want this is if you have played every empire several times and you wnat something new but not too different. New players to the Civilization collection may want to skip Civ V and go straight to Civ: BE - don't. Civ V is a much more rounded game with much better AI and more choice. Ok, there are exactly 1000 different starting situations with the new set up game idea - which is very good but limited to 8 factions - but only three are really good adn meake a difference to the game. Certain factions are OP and whilst the patch fixed this, many are still always going to win.\n\nThe Ai is awful. I settled 4 cities as close to the slavic federation - the warmongers of the gaem - and they told me to stop 37 turns later. 37. Then they were still 'friendly'. i then declare war and as cities are so weak i capture all their cities within 5 turns.\n\nMicro management needs more shortucuts. if you 10 citites you can have 20 trade routes and whislt that is great, there is no key to sewnd them on their previous routes which is not needed in civ as you have only 5 or 6.\n\nI promise this is my last groan. Improvements. Tile mprovements are great in this game but they cost TOO much. Really 2 health for a petol well? then you have £2 on top of that. AARRGG. i am just in positive happieness - but i need the petrol to advance on my victory situation. then the better farms - terrascapes - cost 6 energy. If you have to settle near tundra at the start of the game YOU ARE SCREWED. Restart the game immediatly.\n\nthe affinity system is great and the fewer units makes it all so much simpler - but the affinity system is limited and it almost feels like it has been stuck at the end of the game to allow end game to be fun.\n\nI love the virtues as i felt in Civ V there were too many different paths to go down, the four is just the correct amount.\n\nin conclusion Civ: BE is a good game but has been shamed by previous civ games and after a long wait I expected more form the best stratagy game maker, in my opinion. Dont get me wrong I had fun playing but i think i prefer Civ V. I would recommend it but it is not worth he money you have to pay.

I pre-ordered this game hoping for a spiritual successor to SMAC, and it instead turned out to be Civ 5 in a dull new skin. Actually, it is not quite that either. The gameplay feels more hollow than Civ 5 somehow, which is an accomplishment considering the additional game systems they have added, such as orbital satellites. Visually too the game manages to look underwhelming compared to Civ 5.\n\nNarrative-wise, the game does itself an incredible disservice by laying bare all the major plotlines right out of the gate, inside quest/win-state descriptions. There is no sense of mystery to anything, and it really beats me why they decided to do that. What was meant to be the player's new alien world to discover, feels instead like an uninspired sci-fi B-movie reboot where nothing interesting ever happens.\n\nWhat disappoints me the most is the lack of ambition and innovation from Firaxis at this point of the franchise's life cycle. If you are looking for a 4X style game that actually makes an effort to break the mould, I would highly recommend Endless Legend instead. Those guys are actually trying out new things, building amazing worlds and factions, while Firaxis seems to be sitting on its laurels and living off Civ's inheritance.","October 25, 2014","false","3.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

In the end, it just makes me want to play Civ 5 again.\n\nGood: The map feels much more alive. I like that the aliens can be tolerated or destroyed.

There isn't a solid sense of scientific or technological progression. Thus, the implicit narrative of progress is largely lost. This is a major bummer. It just feel like you're constantly choosing the next bonus.\n\nBad: The endings are largely unuitive, anti-climactic, and unsatisfying.

See below for details.\n\nIn short: The game as a whole seems LESS than the sum of its parts.\n\nSimilar to Civilization V when it came out - Beyond Earth for now is not a good gaming experience. With time Civ V was patched and extended and became one of my favorites. I hope the same will come true for Beyond Earth.\n\nBut  what exactly is the problem with the game? For me it's two things.\n\nFirst of all the different pieces of otherwise very good mechanics don't exactly come together because of the lacking lore  of the game. The story, the different philosophies of the factions and personalities of their leaders and the overall world setting are far from complete, deep or anything but basic. And when inevitably compared to its spiritual predecessor - Alpha Centauri which had epic lore, Beyond Earth seems pretty poor...for now.\n\nAs a result the game does not escalate in scope, something that Alpha Centauri did quite well.\n\nThe second problem is the "Technoabble" used in Beyond Earth. The naming of technologies, build options etc. is "clever", but really not clear in it intent and purpose. That kind of ruins the atmosphere. It makes you feel at times that you don't know what you are doing and prevents you from clearly setting your goals in game. Going through several replays of the game you will eventually figure it out, but IMHO it should be more universal and less clever to be more enjoyable.\n\nI'm hopeful that beyond Earth will grow with time to be much better.","December 17, 2014","false","43.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I've only been playing for less than an hour because that is about as much as I can handle with this game.\n\nAfter playing for as little as I have been, here's what I can take away from this game:\n\n- The learning curve is you start out with the game turning on and then it just go right through the roof with the rest of it.\n- It's not really clear the tech paths and how they are applied to the game.\n- Yes, they do explain a few of the new features, but my issue with it is it's almost counter intutitive to what was in Civ V.\n- They put too much, too soon on the game when you first start out. When we started in Civ V, a city, a unit, some hidden ruins, some state cities, and then the other AIs. All of it pretty straightforward. Here, they give you crashed space craft, aliens that seem to be able to kill you out right, AIs who seem to be able to get the upper hand faster than you, etc. and this was all on easy, are you kidding me?!\n\nDo yourself a favor and do not buy this game. The only other game that is similar to this and more fun, IMO, is Endless Legend. It's basically like Civ V, but with a more magical theme to it along with some very interesting game play that is difficult at first, but you really get the hang of it.\n\nI'm going to try and give Civ: BE another chance and at least try to play one game, but overall, don't buy this game.

Virtue increases your borders, just like culture. Resources, strategic resources, etc.. all of it is just re-skinned.\n\nAI? I played on Apollo, not once did the AI attack me, even when I was buying land all up on their border. You get a passive aggressive message saying "I see what you're doing", but that's it. I spied nonstop on people and got caught many times, blew up their satellites, made units defect, etc... yet all I got, again, was "I see what you're doing". You want to know what BE is like? Load up Civ 5 vanilla and play it on the easiest difficulty with no AI and that's BE.\n\nWonders? When you can figure out where they are (hint, it's the smooth hemisphere icon with something under it on the tech web) are just like regular buildings with n+1 modifiers. Oh this increases the virtue in said city by 5% AND counts as a node? Why then did I spend 1200+ production on it? No wonder movies. It's an aesthetic thing, but when you grew up with AC busting out with wonder movies that made you FEEL in wonder, it's kind of lacking.\n\nSame thing with the tech. Uninspiring. There is no race to get gunpowder, or friction-less surfaces (AC), it's just clicking for a marginal improvement. And the reason for that is that buildings in the bases are underdeveloped. It's like the wonders are the regular buildings, and they just didn't do the wonders.\n\nAffinities? Good concept, atrocious execution. You get them by default for researching things. You want to play harmony but really want that gene tech? Guess what, you're bootstrapped into going purity as well (some people would call this "strategy" as I would have to balance tech with affinity. good point, Unfortunatly, it is irrelevant when I can simply research all the tech and have max affinity. So, I call it lazy execution of another layer of gameplay). Like wonders, affinities do almost nothing for the bulk of the game but give your units a different skin. Sure, there are SOME benefits per affinity. Harmony level 6 heals in miasma, but by the time you reach that level, getting +5 health from miasma is worthless. Same with all other affinities. The only purpose for their being in the game is to trigger some of the end games.\n\nUnits? SIX (I'm ignoring worker/colony). Rover, Missile, Soldier, Boat, Air, Super. That's it. Sure, you can upgrade them for a marginal improvement based on your affinity level (and you get one or two new ones based on your affinity...yaaaayyyy, but they are, again, virtually identical to what you have already), but Civ 5 at least has the common decency to give you units that vary in skill and use. Better still, AC let you design them. Here, you get SIX. Unacceptable.\n\nEnd games. Too easy. You build gates/flower and then you wait X number of turns or put X number of units through them and you win. There's no race for tech and components. There's no launching with a 1/3 complete spaceship hoping it'll make it, it's either all or nothing.\n\nGameplay: The only other time I've felt like playing a game was a job was when I was going for gold in GT and missing it by .0001 seconds. THAT is work and yet, somehow, clicking the "next turn" in this game felt eerily like that. I've never been as bored playing a Civ game as I felt playing this.\n\nThe basic problem with the game is this: Like with recent releases this game suffers from one major drawback: oversimplification. X-com did the same (but it pulled it off WAY better), Simcity 5 did it, Deus Ex Invisible war (and to a certain extent Human Revolution) etc... They all did. It seems that now days companies just want to move product. However, because they've gotten so big, they have to move a LOT of product and they are so afraid that mouth-breathers aren't going to be able to handle complex computations and thinking ahead. So, in order to appeal to the broadest base, like Fouchet in Bad Boys, they cut their product with something. In these cases it's with "stupidity". What you get then is Civ 5 in space. Literally.\n\nIn the context of complicated games being good, Civ 4 took the cake on that. But Civ 5 was a massive simplification. It's like they thought they'd streamline it and people were like WTF is this, and then they took it back to 4 with the expansions. Same thing with BE, but this time it doesn't feel like an honest mistake, it's almost like they knew from the start what they were doing.\n\nIt's unfortunate. This game could have been so much better, and what is even more galling is that it is GOING to be so much better....five months and 30$ later when the expansion comes out.\n\nSave your money and wait till this is either on sale for at MOST 30$ or they do some GOTY edition (obviously with the expansions) for 60$.","October 28, 2014","false","20.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It took 18 months in my library before I even finished my first game, just because I felt I somehow owed it to a franchise I've been playing since I was 8.  I wish I hadn't.\n\nThe goal was obviously to take the game in new directions, abandoning things such as linear tech trees, unpredictable AI, and unit obsolescece.  Credit where credit's due, those have been major complaints of the community for several iterations and they are no longer part of the game.\n\nHowever, what they were replaced with seem shallow and unintuitive.  Unit customization is just a shade of what was present in Alpha Centauri (a game which inevitably became the comparison for CIV BE), offering only two options that at times seem equally unimportant.  The tech web was a difficult to navigate and harder to comprehend mess.  The AI opinions were slim, and you can easily spend the whole game without ever drawing any opponent into meaningful conflict no matter how abusive you became towards them.\n\nNot to mention minor quibbles, like the color pallette being evocative of an oil stain on an asphalt driveway.  Or the incredibly anticlimatic "Wait timer" for victories.  Or the shifting and sometimes senseless Affinity system. Or the ... you get the idea.","May 18","false","43.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hjarg/recommended/65980/","hjarg","Hjarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hjarg/","212 products in account","First, i am comparing this game to Alpha Centauri. Ruthlessly. Why, you ask? Because Beyond Earth was called „spiritual successor“ of that game. And because Alpha Centauri is truly a pearl of a game that sets the tone of every sci-fi Civ-like game in the future.\n\nSecond, I deleted my original review and added this more improved, more poisonous and better review instead.\n\nNow, let us start.\n-	The factions. Alpha Centauri had sever distinct factions. All of them were given proper personalities, they played different, they felt different, the AI treated them different. From fungus-covered territory of Lady Gaia to industrial lands of Chairman Yang, they were all different. And the quotes! People still quote the words of all of them and remember them. In CBE, the factions lack any personality. Previous Civs had the historic figures that would mean something to you, but in CBE, there are bland characters that add to nothing, are not really different and are completely forgettable.\n-	The affinities. You can go for purity, harmony and supremacy- meaning staying human, becoming cyborg and hugging aliens. In theory. In practice, they are completely cosmetic and don’t matter much. You get some slight differences in units and cities use a bit different skin. That is all. And it is not logical- you can become purity without killing a single alien and you can become an alien-hugger harmony player and you can wipe out the entire alien population of the world without any penalty. Mostly- you can make a choice that does not matter.\n-	The aliens. They were supposed to be different then barbarians in the Civ games- and they are. Unfortunately, they are more like neutered space-alien-barbarians. Never in my game had i had one attacking my cities. Especially when there is improvement that keeps them at least 2 squares away from the city. Even in the beginning, they are a no-threat. And even if you murder them by dozens, the aliens don’t seem to mind. Not more hostile reaction, aliens taking the offensive or something. Nothing. Even though there is first level harmony affinity that makes the alien hostility to come down easier and that does basically nothing.\n-	The victories. Whatever victory you achieve doesn’t matter much. You get an uninspired pop-up text with a pretty picture saying basically „Congrats you won“ and voila, here comes the main screen. And all the victories except conquest one are basically science victories, where you have to build stuff and do some stuff as well.\n-	The diplomacy. As bad as in Civ 5. Combine that with bland factions mentioned before and the diplomacy becomes a bore. Plus, no clear view on how one faction is feeling towards the other? Are the Polynesians and Africans close or do they hate each other’s guts? No way to tell? In addition, no Planetary Council or UN-like feature where you decide global things. And the city-states, now dubbed as “stations” are even less of a value then in Civ 5. You cannot interact with them diplomatically. You cannot warn other players who are attacking the station you are trading with stop, you cannot declare war on them. Or you can declare war on them by moving your melee troop (yes, the soldiers/marines are called melee troops) and attack the station. That is declaring war- no other way. And the AI is not aggressive. Wars are few and usually end up in status quo.\n-	The planet. Looks like ye goode olde Earth, but perhaps with different skin and different kind of neutered barbarians roaming around. Terrain types are the same, terrain bonuses are the same, mountains have bluish skin. The resources are a bit different and occasionally, you see floating rocks or green goo. You feel right at home if you have played Civ 5- but is the point of Beyond Earth to feel right at home?\n-	The military. Less units then in Civ 5. One type of ship and one type of aircraft. Oh, and a carrier. No choppers, no bombers, no fighters, no heavy battleships and light destroyers. Same with land units- one melee unit, one ranged, one tank or cavalry like things and one catapult with missiles. Plus some affinity-specific units. One unit per square, soldiers and tanks are referred as “melee” units. Guess they use the butts of their guns. They also upgrade automatically when you gain affinity level- that is kind of nice. But adds to confusion- suddenly all your soldiers are called Cobras or whatnot. And the combat is quite similar to Civ 5, only you see less, because AI is not very aggressive.\n-	Quest system. Oh, the system that was going to bring the game to life! Really? Don’t hold your breath… Around 90% of the quest decisions are choosing what bonus to add to your building. So, do you want +1 health or +1 production to your new fancy clinic? Rest of them- you have to work really hard to fail and usually you get bonuses to your currently most advanced affinity. Sometimes you get to choose what affinity. And that is pretty much it.\n\nIn addition, there are minor nitpicks:\n-	When the colony produces a construction, it does not tell you what building or unit it finished- just that project is complete. If you have 10+ colonies, you cannot remember what you built.\n-	Wonder pop-ups- when someone else builds wonder, it does not tell you what it does. It makes sense when you get that someone build Sixtine Chapel, but less so when someone builds Archimedes Lever.\n-	When you build Archimedes Lever, you get a nice boring blueprint nondescript wonder screen that tells you what bonuses you get, but does not answer the main question: the hell is Archimedes Lever?\n-	Same applies to all techs and wonders and buildings. You get a name, not-half-as-good-quote as from Alpha Centauri and bonuses. To dig deeper, you have to look into Civilopaedia. Works fine for Civ 5, where for example “Gunpowder” and “Writing” or “Barracks” and “Temple” does not need further instruction, but when dealing with “Soma Distillery” and “Xeno Sanctuary” or “Alien Ethics” and “Dark Networks” in Beyond Earth.\n\nThere is still more, but the review is already two A4 pages long, so I’ll spare you. The conclusion- Beyond Earth is more like a badly done expansion pack of Civ 5 then a standalone game. It might get better with DLC/expansions, but at its current state I would suggest to wait with buying until the price drops about 75%. Or just do buy Alpha Centauri. If you manage to look behind aged graphics and terrible interface, you discover (or re-discover) a truly great game hidden behind it.\nThanks for reading!\n","October 28, 2014","false","34.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The UI is pretty miserable when compared to Civ 5.  The tech tree, for instance, doesn't really *pop* out anything except the affinities.  You get to search and hover over everything to figure out where the wonders are.\n\nAnd on the topic of wonders...why don't many of them build anything at all?  They feel very uninspiring and not very wonderful at all.  I built 3 or 4 last game and not a single one of them had a building on the landscape.\n\nThe aliens are annoying.  You go from barbarians that can be turned off or at their worst can be defeated in a 100 turns or so to aliens that are never ending, respawn nests, and harass your units ceaselessly.  Or, you can build your tech tree to focus on being friendly and adapting to them.  Who cares though?  That isn't really very interesting, and again, the lack of anything physical from this (other than alien units) is very bland.\n\nAs for the AI, it is downright annoying.  Diplomacy is one thing.  Being spammed by the competition every single turn with the exact same boring audio and requests is awful.  It doesn't take very long for their voices (especially the Asian lady) to grind on your ears like nails on a chalkboard.\n\nSpeaking of annoying, the trading is just awful.  Every 20 - 30 turns you have to reassign your traders.  They should adjust this to only needing interaction if they are attacked, the city is attacked/under siege, or if something changes with your relations with the other faction.  If you have 10 - 20 trade convoys or vessels running, you can easily expect to spend 50% of your interactions in the game just managing them.\n\nOh, another UI problem....the victory types aren't explained.  You can hover over most things in the setup of the game and get some information, but the victory types just say Domination (ok, duh), Contact, Promised Land, Emancipation and Transcendence.  I had to look them up to figure out what some of them were.\n\nThe game **could** be fun, but it really is just a slightly different take on past Civ games with less of a physical presence in the world.  Most of the things you do augment what you've already built, not build anything new.  It is very common to have the territory and your units looking bland and similar at turn 1 and turn 200.\n\nAs it currently stands, I would not recommend this game.  Civilization 5 was so well done, has so many mods, and the expansions are actually most of what this game contains.  There is no reason to upgrade, and it is arguable that this is not an upgrade at all.","October 27, 2014","false","71.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

It is monotonous and has an uninteresting interface. I would consider myself a huge fan of turn-based strategy games and i love Civilization 5. It seems as though this sequel to the rest of the Civs is lacking in factions, interesting units, fun strategy and it certainly isnt as spacey as one made it seem. It makes me just want to carry on with Civ 5. There is a lot of improving to be done with this game to appeal to me. The game needs;\n1) A better landscape - The current one is hiddeous and unimaginative.\n2) More factions - The ideas behind the ones that are there are fabulous, however they lack in being clearly more different from one another so i feel like no matter who i choose i will be playing the same stategy.\n3)The release price does not at all reflect the games value in its present state.\n4) The Diplomacy interface is unorigional and too easy.\n5) Finally, the level of difficulties are not challenging, it's almost like a game for Civ Noobs.\n\nOverall however the game will be improved in the future i hope and it has some potential but right now i would not recommend the game in its current state.","October 28, 2014","false","9.9"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Needless to say I’ve been looking forward to this for quite some time. Unfortunately, while the new setting is welcome, I really feel that a lot of what makes Civ a charming and involving game has been stripped out – the core mechanics remain similar and the new tech web is a welcome departure – but it lacks the satisfying depth of its predecessors.\n\nSomething that you begin to realise playing Beyond Earth is how much the Civ series depends on a familiarity with its historical setting to give flavour and inform your decisions. You know that Atilla the Hun’s hordes rampaged across China and consequently what he might be like to deal with; you have an idea of who Ghandi is therefore what he might play like – their histories inform their game mechanics, but there are no such cultural touchstones here. Yes, the characters that lead each faction have certain traits, but they might as well be called “blue team” or “red team” – there’s no historical contextualisation or existing character to draw from and because of that it becomes difficult to care about them.\n\nI’ve seen it argued that it’s actually the inverse of traditional Civ – that instead of having a pre-formed personality which eventually becomes more homogenised, leaders start out as blank canvasses which gradually develop personalities shaped by their tech. However, in practice I’ve seen little evidence in the writing that this is actually the case, merely that you mentally note that a faction is leaning towards one affinity and they might now shift their focus in one direction or another.\n\nAdditionally, because of the futuristic setting, it’s difficult to actually tell what you’re researching. Beyond providing stated bonuses to tiles or buildings, there’s no way to actually conceive of what the building looks like or its function.\n\nThat’s fine when it comes to basic buildings like the early trading posts and clinics but it really suffers when it comes to wonders. I know that a Bytegeist gives me a cultural and scientific bonus but what actually is it? The lengthy text descriptions do shed some light on this, but it’s hard to form an immediate connection with it in the same way that say, The Pyramids or The Statue of Liberty do. Wonders have been relegated to just expensive one-time buildings.\n\nWhile you can argue that that’s all they ever were in Civ, a hallmark of the series is how well it hides the raw stats in each play-through behind charm and personality, something which is completely lacking here. This is actually where I really miss the little wonder cinematics which are also absent in Civ V – a little video could go a long way to showing what kind of effects that wonder has (something that Call to Power 2 did nicely way back in 2000).\n\nThis also extends to culture. Yes, a culture bar ticks up a few points every turn and yes you can build things to influence it but it’s hard to see what the culture is actually representative of. Culture implies a certain diversity and identity and that’s something that Beyond Earth really lacks, especially because there are no civ-unique units or buildings. That’s disappointing because the intro cinematic actually suggests a cultural dimension which is absent in gameplay.\n\nThe designers seem to be well aware that a lack of historical narrative is a problem and have introduced quests in order to give a bit of contextualisation and direction to gameplay. However, what these mostly amount to are just “choose one bonus, this or this” or “choose one action, find out what you get several turns later”, neither of which are particularly satisfying.\n\nThe aliens are a nice idea and welcome change to the usual barbarians, but they’re still more of an annoyance than anything else. They have rather unpredictable AI – they’ll ignore units and trade caravans one minute while decimating them the next – at least with barbarians you sort of knew where you stood. Also, once your Civ has reaches a certain tech level, they seem more of a chore than anything to deal with – all they really seem to do is pick off trade caravans which need to be tediously defended. I was disappointed that there wasn’t more interaction with them.\n\nEven when you play towards the Harmony affinity which is ostensibly about integrating with the indigenous flora and fauna, there’s no obligation to keep the original aliens around and as they’re frequently in the way of valuable real estate, they just become cannon fodder. It’d be much more compelling to perhaps allow units to tame wild beasts with a certain affinity level and use them for more than just military units – then there’d be more of a trade-off between exterminating the bugs and keeping them around – and a narrative and gameplay reason to prevent other players from doing so.\n\nHere I also think they missed an option to be really creative – different aliens for different worlds or even simply different habitats (curiously, all types of aliens seem to be found in every type of terrain) could lead you to assess if it was worth domesticating them.\n\nThe way that difficulty is implemented will be a familiar gripe to fans of the series. The AI has a base level and the way that the game is made harder is by giving the AI more stuff, not making the AI actually better at what it does. It’s no more cunning at higher difficulties; it just has more to throw against you. I’m not really sure if I expected this to change in a new Civ game, but it doesn’t require you to make more creative decisions, just more efficient ones. And the bizarre and unpredictable demands of the AI  - notably the “stop settling near us complaint” – which seems to occur at the drop of a hat, seem to have been intensified here.\n\nThat’s not to say that it’s not a solid enough game – the Civ franchise has had two decades to develop and the core 4x gameplay is decent, but the inherent charm, the soul of the game, seems curiously absent. It functions perfectly adequate as a collection of systems and numbers, but it doesn’t feel like more than the sum of its parts. All in all, in feels like a re-skinned and modded version of Civ V – but actually with some features removed; the religion stat added in the Gods & Kings expansion isn’t present here; you can’t win a cultural victory and the lack of diversity of units and buildings is disappointing.\n\nThat makes it hard to recommend even if it’s not actually bad per se but it’s certainly a much shallower, homogenised game and a much less satisfying game experience.","October 28, 2014","false","17.2"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarinn/recommended/65980/","sarinn","Sarinn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarinn/","182 products in account","I have over 1100 hours in Civ V, and over 40 hours in Civ: BE. As of today (30/10/14), I have finished all victory types except domination, and am working on beating the game on the highest difficulty.\n\nFirstly I would like to say this game is *not* Civ V. It looks like like Civ V, has many features like Civ V, but it is *not* Civ V. This is also not Alpha Centauri. Much like XCOM, Civilization: Beyond Earth  is a spiritual successor to SMAC. It brings to the table many new features, many of the things we loved in Civ V, and a few things that need improvement.\n\nThe biggest difference is the new Tech Web. No longer are we confined to a linear path of building, but now we can branch out as we see fit, adapting to our enviroment, and investing our sciences as needed. This is a breath of freash air from Civ V, where going through the Tech Tree was almost formulaic. This allows for each game to be different in how and what you build, as well as allows you to quickly change plans should the need arise, and focus your efforts elsewhere.\n\nUnfortunatly, the Tech web is not intuitive. Since Civ V is about history, even those who know little about the past still have an idea what Metal Working would be, or what a unit called "Knights" are. With Civ: BE, as this takes place in a sci-fi  setting, we now have techs like "Transcendental Math" and "Genetic Mapping". Figuring out all the new techs, buildings and units are a simple search in the Civopedia, and though I enjoy reading through the lore and learning about these, I do not believe many have that kind of patience. Most would want to just jump in the game and play.\n\nAliens replace barbarians, and do a good job. More dangerous than the barbarians, at lower difficulty levels they are hardly a threat, but at higher levels they spawn frequntly, and you cannot easily avoid killing many as you have to clear them out in order to expand. This causes the aliens to become more aggressive to you, and if you're not careful, you may find youself not only fighting the AI Civs, but the aliens at the same time.\n\nQuests have been added to this itieration in the Civ franchise. Unlike Civ V, where we already know the stories and history of the civilizations, we do not have that with Civ: BE as it takes place in the future. Quests add a neat narritive to the game, and rewards for doing them are minor so as to not cause an imbalace, and can even be ignored should one choose.\n\nThe AI is no different than Civ V. To many players it poses some challenge, but to long standing Civ players, the AI is about as smart as a wet towel.\n\nWorlds are colorful, and Firaxis did well in making the planets feel alien, and the music in the game is nothing short of brilliant!\n\nThe three aspects you can build your civilization around (Harmony, Purity, and Supremacy) are all unique, add great bonuses, and there's no penalty for putting points in more than one. I persnally encourage people to branch out, as even lower level bonuses are amazing. Much like the tech web, this allows for a different, less linear play style than Civ V did.\n\nHowever, Civ: BE does have it's problems. Automated pathing for Explorers often leave them moving back and forth between two tiles, and automated workers will prioritize the best possible thing to build, which costs energy, so if left to their own devices they will quickly drain your economy! In the last game I just finished playing, I had a mine built on a hill, and when I discovered one of the mineral resources, it did not add the mineral to my total, allowing me to use it, nor could I overwrite the old mine with a new one.\n\nMuch like Civ V, after a few patches I have no doubt Civ: BE will be just as polished as Civ V. If you have played Civ V, and are looking for something different, this would be a good choice. If you're new to Civ in general, save your money for now, and invest in Civ V's Gold edition, where you will have a more polished game, DLC, and two expansions for cheaper price.\n\nCivilization: Beyond Earth will not replace Civ V, but it is a good game to go to when you want something a little bit different.","October 30, 2014","true","49.6"," 56 of 102 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","56","102","0","1"

I could nitpick, but the two worst are:\n\n-The AI is possibly even more idiotic than Civ 5. It ignores potentially game changing actions by the player, gets upset over random trivialities, and is generally poor in its approach.\n\n-Trade routes are a big part of the game, and if you tend to play large maps and like expanding (like i do), you will end up with dozens. The trade routes are way too powerful to not fully utilize, and having to reassign one or more trade routes at the start of every turn just kills the feel of the game. I abandoned a recent game because of this issue. The AI was active for once and was down to two very large AI nations. I had also grown quite large in the end game (well over a dozen cities). I just couldn't deal with reassigning multiple trade routes at the start of each turn. Scrolling through the dropdown of countless possible routes, selecting the correct route, and confirming the same route as before was just boring me as I had to do multiple every single turn.\n\nI am ready to play something else until the gameplay is cleaned up.","November 9, 2014","false","47.5"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

I have been playing Civilization since the original. I have 770 hours played on Civ V. Also, I didn't start playing BE assuming it was going to be exactly the same as Civ V. Just like when Civ V came out, there is a lot of pushback from people who don't like Civilization changing. BE does many things well, but it does things differently than Civ V.\n\nPros:\n- Tech "web" makes game progression much more interesting. Tech is much less linear and you can specialize if you want to.\n- Aliens are done well. I feel like they updated this part of Alpha Centauri well. Miasma tiles play an important tactical role in combat, and Harmony players can use them to their advantage.\n- Unit upgrades aren't tied directly to tech. I think this makes the game more interesting, as you have to choose between techs that will upgrade your troops and others that might unlock more buildings, etc. Units can also be upgraded outside the tech tree through quests, and you there is a degree of customization to the upgrades.\n- Espionage is improved from Civ V with more stuff for spies to do. You can even have spies add to a project that helps your cities instead of spying.\n- Lots of choices for tile improvements, with powerful ones costing upkeep. Tech allows customization of improvements as well.\n- Setting is cool, although the game could use a few more terrain palettes for variety.\n\nCons:\n- There aren't enough 'civilizations' to play as. This is inherent in the setting, as they have to make up every sponsor instead of just drawing from history. But there does feel like a lack of variety over Civ V.\n- Stations aren't done well. These serve a similar purpose to city-states, but they only function as trading partners. However, they always seem to disappear, either from neglect (they just seem to die out), or from other people attacking them. There is no way to enter into diplomacy with them, so you can't defend them from other players.\n- The game is a little too easy to play against the AI. The non-linearity of the tech web allows you to upgrade your units faster than the AI does. Since they balanced trade routes, this isn't quite as bad.\n\nOverall, it is a great game. Is it as good as Civ V? Currently, probably not. There are still updating it, with much needed balancing being done (e.g., wonders have been much improved). But that doesn't mean you shouldn't play it. If you haven't played Civ V yet, by all means, I would say play that instead. But if you want something new, this is a great addition to the Civilization series.","March 24, 2015","true","140.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I kind of forgot about it, but I recently noticed there was a DLC out, right about the time I was looking for something new to play, so I figured I'd get the DLC and give this game its rightful chance.\n\nI can't give you a thorough review yet, but I can tell you that at least so far (10 hours in), this game feels just like the previous games in the series, or at least like Civilization 2-5. I've never played the first, so I don't really know what it was like. I'll get to the specifics after spending some more time playing, but generally, it's pretty much what I was expecting, and what I suppose anyone who's ever played a Civilization game before should expect.\n\nAnyway, I know this game wasn't received as well as the last couple of Civilization games, and honestly, if there's a good reason for that, I haven't found it yet. I'm writing these very lines after forcing myself to stop playing, so I could get some sleep before a long day tomorrow. I could have otherwise easily kept on playing for a few more hours at least.\n\nMore info to come as soon as I feel I have a good enough grasp of the specifics, especially in comparison to the previous games in the series.\n\nUpdate (14h+):\nWhile my general opinion of the game hasn't changed much since I started playing, I figured I'd share what I now consider to be its biggest flaw, which was also mentioned and discussed by many other reviewers. While the formula hasn't changed much since Civilization 5, the game's main backstory theme has, and in my opinion, it has changed for the worse. Up until Civilization 5, the series, at least for me, was about history, culture and progress. While Beyond Earth is also about progress, it lacks the other elements. Sure, each faction has its own history and culture, but those are totally alien and meaningless to me, as they're not an important part of the game, and I feel no urge to learn about them. If Civilization 5 was based, loosely as it was, on some true historical background, Beyond Earth is pure fiction in that regard. Some people may find this futuristic theme curious and refreshing, but I, for one, would rather have it the way it was before.\n\nHaving all that said, as of now, there's no other strategy game I'd rather play. Not even Civilization 5, which has my highest playing time count (500h+) on record ever since I installed Steam.","January 30","true","18.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This is a civ5 mod, nothing more.  I'll take it apart in pieces though if you care to read on!  I've been playing the Civ series for over a decade, so I'd like to think I know what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm enjoying this game.  It's fun.  I'll probably play through it once or twice.  But at the end of the day, this game is nothing more than a Civ5 clone, and feels unfinished to boot.  Interface is clumsy, and little information is readily available.  You've got to go looking for stuff, even what building you just finished constructing, or what tech unlocks X resource.  You'll have to hold your cursor over each one until you find it.\n\nThe factions have little flavor to them.  They're generic enemies as far as the player is concerned.  And the AI is a DIRECT copy/paste from Civ5.  There's the new system of "favors", which doesn't seem to do much, but aside from that it's the exact same AI system.  They're still going to pester you every 20-30 turns asking for gold, open boarders, or to declare war on someone.  Honestly it really does shatter the immersion.  I was pretty psyched for an Alpha Centauri feel, but this just feels like more Civ5 once you get past the shiny new colors.  Humanity has just landed on a strange alien world with hostile lifeforms all around, and... you already want to start killing each other?\n\nYou're still going to get denounced, sorry, "condemned" every 30 turns or so for not giving AI jerk X whatever he asked for.  You're still going to get DoW'd by said jerk even though he can't challenge you.  The AI still doesn't know how to use their army.  You're even going to see the *exact same text* from a lot of Civ5 conversations.  EXACT same.  Word for word.\n\nThe tile system is pretty much identical.  You've got food, production, energy (gold), and culture.  Instead of happiness, you have healthyness, which fulfills the exact same role, limiting your expansion and punishing you for falling too low.  Instead of luxury resources, you build happiness buildings and research techs.  Instead of ancient ruins, you have crashed satellites, and instead of archealogical sites, you have protean ruins or alien skeletons.  It feels neat the first time, but quickly reveals itself to be old mechanics in a new outfit.\n\nCombat is identical to civ5.\n\nThe 3-way ideology system is fun.  I enjoy playing around with it, and I do really like the unit upgrades and how you get to pick buffs for your troops as you level.  It also upgrades *all* of that unit, so you aren't left running swordsmen home to upgrade.  However, the promotion system is AWFUL.  I thought it was a downer when they simplified the promotions from Civ4 to Civ5, but this is even worse!  There is only ONE promotion opion for ALL military units.  Just one!  Every time you level up, you pick either instant heal, or a generic +10% combat boost.  That's it!  No blitz, no shock, no drill, no medic, no commando, etc etc.  Super dull.\n\nThe aliens are kinda cool. They're essentially reskinned barbarians from Civ5, but some types are stronger and they act a bit more unified.  The early game definitely did feel like a battle against the indigenous life.  But by turn 100, they're simply a nuisance.\n\nAs far as tile upgrades go, they're somewhere between Civ4 and 5.  You don't have quite the selection as Civ4, but it's more interesting than 5.  Tricky at first because you wonder where you're going to get resource X from, but fun in its own way.\n\nThe new tech web is nice.  I like this feature of the game.\n\nTrade routes are actually so numerous they become bothersome.  But they're so important to your economy that you can't ignore them.\n\nUltimately this game feels unfinished.  Rushed.  Like, they worked a bunch on making this mod and didn't have time to polish or playtest it.  It lacks depth, character, and charm.  I've run into huge oversights already.  For example, there's a new quest system, which is kind of neat.  However, my main early quest, which was multi-parter, is impossible to complete!  I was tasked with building a biofuel plant in my capital.  However, a biofuel plant requires a workable Algea tile.  There is no algae within 3 tiles of my capital, so I can't build one.  So the quest remains uncompleted forever.  This is the kind of thing that a simple internal playtest should have caught.\n\nAnd then some things are just downright balanced silly.  There's a wonder I can build right now, for 1500 production, that gives 2 food and 3 health.  WHAT?  I can construct regular buildings that do just as much!  Why on Earth would I build this?  It just makes no sense.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a mod that should cost $15-20 tops.  $50 is the price for an entirely new game, and this is NOT.  Huge swaths of it are direct copy/pastes from Civ5, and the game suffers for it.  There's none of the sense of development that comes from progression in the other games.  You start the game with access to trade, air units, naval units, satellites, etc.  You don't get any legitimately new toys throughout the game.  You simply get stronger versions (which you can customize slightly) of what you already have.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, but as it stands it's a rush job, copy-paste of Civ5 with new colors and renamed resources/units.  The first 50 or so turns of your first playthrough feel like a new-ish experience, but beyond that you notice just how familiar everything is, and suddenly you realize you're just playing Civ5 with new textures.\n\nI am very disappointed.  There could have been so much more.  Let us *change* the planet based on our choices.  Let us actually forge a story.  Let the choices grow different and function distinctly!  Everyone lands on the planet the same, and slowly grows apart in function *and* form by their actions.  Instead, my giant mech robot is functionally identical to your floaing Protoss-looking laser tank.  There's just so much this game teases you with. So many things you think "Ohhh it'll be neat when..." and it just doesn't happen.","October 25, 2014","false","41.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

There are a couple of features that give it a different look and feel as opposed to Civ 5 and SMAC, which is a good thing. But I can't escape the feeling of wanting a more immersive experience in this game. Deciding for myself which way I would like to go, rather than founding myself lost in a maze of research goals, with a fixed capital city unable to move it, an AI randomly asking for 'favors' and declaring war the next turn or not really feeling connected with the building options. This all makes this a too confined experience. Simply give me a map editor, or some sort of option to increase my freedom of play.\n\nI seriously felt like I wanted to play Civ5 again, rather than continuing this game and after I noticed on the Community Hub that this game will be 'milked' with DLC incoming, I seriously advice to wait untill a hefty discount comes along. I'm sad that I can't give it an overall general recommendation, but I'm really hoping for a redemption patch in the future or some free or low-priced expansions.","October 28, 2014","false","52.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Beyond Earth is definitely a Civilization game, though there are many differences that set this game apart from its predecessors.  To keep this review relatively short, I'll make a list regarding the game based on what I experienced on my first full game of it.\n\n\n- Similar to Civilization V's policies, Virtues allow you to pick and choose bonuses which will assist in the development of your civilization.  They are extremely well balanced and work well whether you focus mainly on one of the four categories (Might, Prosperity, Knowledge, Industry) or if you pick and choose throughout.  Synergy bonuses are given for both building wide or deep on the Virtue Tree.\n\n- The technology web was very enjoyable for this type of a game.  The old technology tree worked extraordinarily well when Civilization was based on history, though the open web is an excellent change for a Sci-Fi futuristic 4X game.  You can, for the most part, pick and choose which technologies best suit the style of play that you are going for.\n\n- Affinity, is somewhat similar to the Ideologies of Civilization V, in that it affects your relationship with others depending on which of the three that they have chosen from.  I focused on Purity, the affinity that seeks to keep humans human.  They seek to hold onto their culture and turn the newly colonized planet into a second Earth.  The other affinities are Harmony, which is the goal of integrating into the ecosystem of the planet, and Superiority, which is the modification of humanity via technology to reach a higher state of being.  Each affinity has it's own sets of bonus, special buildings, and unique units that give each and every affinity a different feel.\n\nThough there are many other new features (and others that were cut) these were the three that I thought drastically differed from the Civilization games of the past.  This game is a lot of fun to play and I'm very excited to see the expansions that will be released for it.\n\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10","October 26, 2014","true","79.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

All these issues culminate into a bland, cookie cutter experience.

Here are my main gripes, based on 10 hours of play.\n\n- At times UI is trying to be cool looking rather than functional. For example, minimap is quite small and contrary to store page screenshots, the color scheme has been changed so that continents and oceans are different shades black and gray. Not to mention you can see through the map which adds to confusion. Colors all in all are quite annoying. Sometimes miasma is quite hard to see, and resources of xenomass easily disappear into green mess that the map sometimes is (at least on lush biome I've been playing on).\n\n- Aliens are quite interesting but in my opinion they should be more varied and far more aggressive (note: I'm playing with "frenzied aliens" option on). Even when I killed them in the dozens and raided their nests they didn't seem to get more aggressive in return. Even AI civilizations are too passive. I can't remember a single instance where a civilization declared a war on another (in my 10 hours of playtime), except when I declared a war on AI player, and even then he surrendered without a fight.\n\n- Quest decisions are way too linear. About 80-90% of the time it works this way: You built a building and now some scientist/engineer has improved it, choose between bonus resource A or resource B. There, quest done in a couple of clicks. Same thing with unit upgrades, now you get to choose between instant heal or 10% strength. Unit upgrades you get via affinity are a bit better, but the choice is still always a binary one between 2 options. Can't we have more variety in our choices?\n\n- Each faction severely lacks personality since their leaders are straight up boring. Their specialties could be better too. For example Brasilia's +10% to melee strength is very unimaginitive. I would have much preferred Alpha Centauri like leaders with strong and well developed personalities, but that is hard to tie into Beyond Earth setting with the affinity system.\n\n- Oceans need more life in them. This time only developer's imagination was the limit and they chose not to utilize the oceans in any interesting way. How about super rare and useful resources in the middle of nowhere, guarded by krakens? Alien artifacts sending signals from the deep, inviting explorers? Aquatic cities?\n\n- No natural wonders. But why? They should be easy to implement and would add a lot of character to the planet.\n\nTl;dr: Game needs more variety and depth (in quests etc,), utilize the setting better, more aggressive AI and some fixes to color scheme and UI in general. These issues need to be addressed quickly by the developers. It's a tough decision, but at the present state, I can't really recommend this game, even though I'm enjoying it despite its many flaws. There are many good aspects to the game: tech web, virtues, orbital layer, affinity progression... but right now the negatives weigh too much.","October 26, 2014","false","64.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I have waited for the reincarnation of Alpha Centauri for all these years, and have bought this game at the first possible occasion. What I got in the end was just a dumbed down version of Civilization V, which was (in my opinion) just a simplified version of Civilization IV in the first place. Alpha Centauri was an etalon, a perfect game, which required only a graphics' revamp perhaps. There is nothing new in Beyond Earth, neither it has all the brilliant features of Alpha Centauri (unit constructor, terraforming, unique leaders' personalities etc.). Some people say that they are really happy that they never played Alpha Centauri. Poor souls, they even don't know what they missed. Even when not compared to its spiritual predecessor, Beyond Earth remains just an empty husk, and no pearls will appear from it.\n\nI WILL play this game, and WILL try to decribe all its cons and (if I find any) pros in more detail. Affinity system isn't bad, but it's more boring and less flexible than the social engineering system used in Alpha Centauri. So far, I consider Beyond Earth just a worthless waste of hard-earned money. It seems that the developers haven't even tried to make something worth the name of a successor to Alpha Centauri.\n\nP.S. This is my appeal to the people considering buying Beyond Earth. Go and buy Alpha Centauri instead.","October 25, 2014","false","1.8"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","24","42","0","0"

For a high priced game, I was expecting a lot more.\nThe game may be worth buying when it hit a 75% price reduction, but right now I really feel ripped off.\n\nThe current feel of the game is an unfinished Civ 5 clone.\n\nThere is some nice ideas, like the new tech tree and affinity, but the implementation is horrible at best.\nThe tech tree idea is great, but the current "navigation" is horrible. The techs lack flavour. It would have been easier if they had just called it "upgrade 1", "upgrade 2" etc. (Comprared to the Tech description in their older games this is really lacking).\nThe affinity system is a nice idea, but you lack control, and with the way the tech tree/upgrades work, it seem more random what you end up with, not that this is a real problem as all the cool upgrades is in the start of the affinity tree.\n\nSome more ranting...\nLike the old Civ games, there is some ingame documentation (Civ manual), again this is a huge step backwards, as there are no "links" between relevant stuff.\n\nAll in all, this seems like a game build upon the existing Civ engine, by some interns, with some rough guidelines and a limited amount of time.\n\nNow My review may seem a bit harsh, and the game is "ok" just not worth the full price, and way below the usual standards of the Firaxis/Civ brand.\n\nHaving paid full price for theis "product" I really hope they will do their best to fix the problems (crappy AI etc.), if the fix is in form af a DLC we need to pay for... well then I lost the last respect for the firm. If not, and the problems are fixed/game improved to the normal standard of Firaxis/Civ products, then I will gladly rewrite this review in a more positive tone.\n","October 28, 2014","false","247.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

I really wanted this to suck in hours of my life so I could pretend to be humanity's messiah of the stars. Sadly, I was mistaken. I'll start with the few good aspects:\n\n-"Customizable" Civs: This is a great feature because it really lets you fine-tune how you want to play in order to win. This customization also leads to unpredictability, allowing more replay value.\n-Tech Web: The tech web also allows you to customize what you're doing and how you're doing it with it's branching paths and tech "leaves" to research. Because it's so non-linear, it's harder to tell what other Civs are researching, and that leads to more interesting, varied gameplay.\n-Aliens: If Barbarians were cannon-fodder, then these are the guys shooting the cannons. Never have you felt so threatened by "barbarian" units as you have these guys. Naturally they eventually become less and less threatening with advanced combat technologies, although some of the aliens keep their threat kevel high even in the late-game.\n-Affinity-Specific Units: These are units that can only be unlocked through a combination of the tech web and having enough points in a certain Affinity. These units look cool and are fairly powerful, and create a bit of unit diversity.\n\nNow for the bad. With 200+ hours in Civ 5, starting off post-Gods-and-Kings expansion, I'm no newcomer here, although I've still never been very good at playing but always enjoyed the game nonetheless. Even still, I was able to win on turn 317 on the normal difficulty when I had trouble doing something like that in Civ 5. In fact, it was so easy, I barely even played. I more of just micromanaged my four cities after putting up my anti-alien fence building. Near the end I even just went ahead and started razing my neighbors cities with my ultimate Harmony unit JUST TO BURN TIME UNTIL I WON. No one put up a fight against me, even my neighbor-now-enemy had just a few ranged units, one planted in each of his cities! I also found some of the gameplay changes, like Happiness to Healthiness and lack of some kind of Beyond Earth-equivilent of tourism/religion, made the gameplay feel very dumbed down. The game also felt very bland, as I never really saw any other units besides a standard Marine, Explorer, and Worker robot until I got my special units, and even then only saw them (this is more relating back to the AI seemingly being incredibly incompetent, but still a con nontheless). As well, the color pallette seems to have noticeably darkened, and personally becomes much more boring to look at as a result. All in all, I think Civ: Beyond Earth needs what Civ 5 got; A GnK/BNW expansion that adds more to and fixes the base game. In it's current state, I regret spending $50 for what feels like a polished beta of a game.\n\nPros:\n-Custom Civs and the tech web lead to unpredicatable gameplay with better replayability\n-Alien AI actually feel threatening and pose a challenge for a good portion of the game\n-Affinity-specific units look cool and are powerful; I was able to 1HKO an enemy outpost being built with my Harmony Ultimate unit.\nCons:\n-Much easier/AI much dumber than Civ 5\n-Gameplay changes like Happiness to Healthiness and lack of depth (no tourism/religion or equivilent) make the game feel dumbed down/lacking\n-Lack of unit diversity; everyone practically has the same units until they start specializing down their Affinity; even then the majority of units are just reskins with some different stats.\n-Color pallette is much darker; I personally found it to be unattractive after a long session.","October 25, 2014","false","11.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

This is coming from someone who happily has played 400+ hours of Civ V too.\n\nIt feels like a poorly balanced Civ V mod. There are some novel things in there - the affinity trees for instance are pretty neat. The questing (done better in Endless Legend) is also ok as is the esponiage. But there are too many annoyances - health severely limiting growth, overly aggressive native life forms, oribtal layer not being very well developed, bad AI - combined with balance problems and a real lack of personality make this one a pass. Frankly, I've found myself clicking "next turn" over and over again because the game punishes you from exploring, the health problems prevents you from conquering and there's nothing else to do. What's the most maddening thing is that Civ V encountered - and then patched OUT - many of these same issues. There's no excuse for them to happen in Beyond Earth.\n\nThe real killer is the lack of personalities. Yeah, I know that this game isn't a remake of SMAC but it's supposed to be inspired by it. Well, the thing that SMAC did that was so innovative was to give each faction a very distinct - almost unique - personality. The wonder movies, diplomacy and even the tech tree descriptions were all written around those personalities. Instead of copying this strength, the factions here are all faceless until far too late into the game (and by then it's too late). It's an absolute deal killer.\n\nEven after patches it's still a collection of half-baked ideas that simply don't work together. There are far, far better 4x games on the market.

Unlike civ 5 where some factions were especially powerful perhaps even inbalanced.\n\n*Ideologies - The three main ideologies are all realistic, compelling and ultimately lead to different styles of play and win conditions. Solving one of my main gripes with CIv 5 in that your civ almost always favoured a victory so doing your best to win involved simply repeating a tried and tested strategy.\n\n*Tech web - While confusing at first glance and for a couple of playthroughs time it really does allow you to specialise. In civ 5 that one player with the highest science got first dibs on every wonder, not anymore!\n\n*Aliens replace barbarians - More than just a cosmetic change the aliens are not inherently hostile and will treat you differently based on how you treat them. Some are hilariously overpowered at the start of the game but can be avoided. The difficulty setting probably has an effect too.\n\n*Orbital layer - Allows another layer of military conquest where you can rain death from above with massive units or orbital weapons. But also satilites that can create new resources on blank tiles allowing you to develop the map in very new ways. I would love to see this be pushed further to allow a more earthlike climate for the purity ideology.\n\nCons-\n*The game is outright missing some of the features that came with DLC for civ 5 and will probably end up being DLC later down the line. Including: religion, natural wonders, world congress, tourism/culture victory.\n\n*The game does not have distinct phases like Civ 5 which were based on different eras of human civilisation. As such it the game doesnt really have the same flow of technological advancement making it hard to see how well you are doing in comparison to your rivals. In times of peace this can make the game feel extremely detached almost like no progress is being made at all, at least in war you can see new units duking it out!\n\n*Unlike barbarians the aliens do not not gain any new units over the course of a game. Making them very strong to begin with but the weaker ones quickly become little more than wasted movement points as your units effortlessly plough through them.\n\n*Very little interaction with AI players - The only new addition being that the AI will compliment you if you same the same attitude towards the Aliens or for choosing the same ideology. Civ 5 was lacking in this regard as well, it simply isnt interesting to deal with them in any way.\n\n*Visuals while functional arent exactly amazing. Beyond earth being a stand alone game rather than a paid DLC for Civ 5 means there was an opportunity to up the visuals, which was clearly missed as the game looks to be on the same level of graphical fidelity as civ 5.\n\ntl:dr\nDifferent enough from Civ 5 to be worth trying (I have enjoyed it thus far), similar enough to make you realise whats missing or hasnt been improved.","January 15, 2015","true","20.2"," 37 of 67 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","37","67","2","0"

DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE PROMISES.NOT WORTH IT.\nKeep Playing Civ 4 or 5 and wait until its on sale for a couple dollars or if ever a decent mod comes out for it. Or buy PANDORA FIRST CONTACT, I'm sure the game WITH the expansion is less then Civ BE which seems to be an expensive Bad rip-off of it.\n\nP R O S:\n\nMusic is amazing! Really good stuff, until you declare war or something, then it turns to the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Civ 5 had, pianos and Very Sad Elevator Music.\n\nSounds are amazing as well, the rifles firing and the machines working are top notch!\n\nVery Small Download - 1.7Gb download, unpacks to around 3gb\n\nC O N S:\n\nThe Sponsor names sound awful. Really, they sound bad. How bad? ... BAD! Very Bad. Some of them sound like something a beauty pageant contestant would come up with, like "My favorite Planet is the SUN! And my favorite country is Polystralia! Giggle, giggle!" NO joke, that's actually one of them. NO matter if they are possible and grammatically correct, they still sound AWFUL! Again take a look at what Alpha Centauri did. Or M.A.X. or Pandora First Contact.\n\nThe Research narration quotes are all MADE UP! We have THOUSANDS of years of recorded human history and evolution, and what do we do? We say not today wisdom! Today is the day for re-tar-ded crap to spew forth like a river of retardation where all knowledge and profound wisdom gets swept away,like watching a marathon of Honey Boo Boo or the Jersey Shore! All the Civ games until now had amazing quotes every time you do a research or wonder, Its one of the best things the games had done right. Now, all that is history. Pandora First Contact at least had very witty quotes. This game has turds in word format.\n\nGOD AWFUL NARRATION!!! Civ 4 had Leonard Nimoy narrating the research and Wonders and whatever else the game had to narrate, it was AMAZING! Then Civ 5 came out and everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ed about the narrator, even though I still wanted Spock to be reading them, I actually liked the narrator since he sounded like Charlton Heston, but of course he wasn't, it turned out to be a guy named William Morgan Sheppard. Still, it still sounded EPIC and Awesome and if you could imagine a God-like story teller's voice telling the ordeals of Humans on their existence, you could at least imagine either one being it. ON CIV BE, they, I assume grabbed the nearest east European intern, and had her read all the lines in one sitting. Seriously! She sounds like Katia, the Russian Bride who was US$ 10 more expensive, narrating the lines with all the enthusiasm and excitement of an autistic man reading a phone book. With the budget this game had, they could of picked a real actor, or and old good one, ANYBODY who could act and narrate. I actually think she was probably amazing, spectacularly good at giving head, since that would explain why she got the part.\n\nLast but not least YOU CANT CREATE CUSTOM SPONSORS OR IDENTITY OR ANYTHING. Endless Space, Galactic Civilization, even Master of Orion had a way of creating a custom identity with custom bonuses. Since this is all Science FICTION and all the sponsors are FICTION and the planet is FICTION, why not us play around with it? Maybe the intern who narrated it wanted it this way...\n\nConclusion, its still a great game, but not worth the money its costing right now at launch.( I assume its US$ 60, for me it was more, that might explain my mood at time of writing). With the exception to the music and sounds, feels like a Civ 5 Mod, nothing new brought to the table. Seems like an expensive rip-off of PANDORA FIRST CONTACT without the innovations like being able to switch weaponry on your infantry or open an Alien Gate and trigger an invasion. Wild life on the planet is crap compared to PANDORA as well, no giant Aliens the size of cities. No day night cycles.","October 24, 2014","false","16.1"," 204 of 388 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","204","388","0","29"

It plays a lot like a full conversion mod for Civilization V, but to say that's all it is betrays the beautiful restructuring of game mechanics that this version posseses. The game feels more dynamic (thanks to a tech web, as opposed to a tech tree), making each playthrough a completely different game. While Civilization V (and its predecessors) was completely addicting, Beyond Earth makes each game a radically different experience, something that Civ 5 did way better than any of the other installments of the franchise.\n\nThat being said, I wasn't particularly fond of the glitches. I've heard a few people mention them before, but when I sat down and played through Beyond Earth, I found them to be quite bothersome. None were game-breaking, but often they were reptitive annoyances that are completely circumventable... once you learn what they are. The achievement counters also seem to be off, as I found myself occassionally getting two points for certain things when one normally ought to receive only one... Not that I'm complaing about that though!\n\nAnd the achievements are indeed a stellar part of this game. Civilization V was the first game to add them, and they often felt very grind-y and unneccessary. Beyond Earth slimmed most of those bad ones out, leaving in just a few for those gamers dedicated enough to endure the small bits of grind and reach 100% completion.\n\nAt $49.99 currently, Beyond Earth has quite a hefty price tag. I'd personally wait until a 50% off or more sale, just to feel like you had no doubt that buying this game was money well spent.

The game is a decent improvement from Civ 5. The mechanics are identical but they were never a problem, graphics/animations/sound are good, the units are exactly what you’d expect from a Civ game (with a few interesting twists), and the tech web is an interesting addition.\n\nBut, as with the last Civ game, performance gets exponentially worse the longer you play it.  I play marathon games, and by turn 900 it’s taking 2+ minutes for all NPCs to go through their turns.  The interface is clunky and unintuitive – worse than Civ 5’s since they’ve crammed in more things.  Navigating the the planet is a chore - aliens (like the barbs in Civ 5) are annoying, there are miasmas every other tile (which damage your troops), the other 1/3 of the tiles are canyons or mountains which your troops can't traverse (you'd think if you have the tech to colonize another planet you might be able to get over a hill).

If there was a "maybe" button, I would choose that for this game. It is not a bad game, but it lacks the same depth and playability as Civ V. It's got some great ideas and fun concepts, but there are too many parts that either don't make sense, or just fail entirely. The upgrading of units is a good concept in its self, however it is also quite restrictive. In early to mid-game you have a very small selection of unit types that are quite weak and by end game a wider range of powerful units become available. By this point however, unless you deactivate the victory conditions, you are not left with a huge amount of time to use them. There is also the big problem of Affinity specific resource. You choose your affinity quite early in the game, however you may find by mid-game you do not have enough of the affinity specific resource and so you cannot build the new units you have spent so long waiting for.\n\nThere is also the issue of the tech tree, which is just not user friendly. You really must take time to plan out your discoveries at the start of the game, otherwise you could find yourself missing vital technologies. Also, due to the affinity upgrade system, you end up targeting the affinity technologies to get the better units, and so fall behind in other basic areas.\n\nThe intrigue system was quite an exciting concept with some great sounding abilities at the higher levels, however you rarely get to use them (if ever). You can place one agent per city and give them missions that will raise the intrigue level in a city if they succeed (level 0 to 5). The problem is that it takes far too long to raise the level and relies on multiple races targeting the same city. This means you tend to end up only using the level 0 through 2 skills, which are just a bit dull.\n\nIn all I was disappointed by this instalment of Civ. I love Civ 5 and just feel they have missed the target with this update - a real shame as Alpha Centuri was a great game. I recommend you save your money, and get Civ 5 instead.","January 16, 2015","false","180.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/recommended/65980/","comradewinston","ComradeWinston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradewinston/","302 products in account","From the third person I had all but assumed this a heartless copy of Civ5 and now thanks to one of Steam's free weekends, I can now say it very much is. Although I cannot recommend it now, for such a steep price when Civ5 offers so much more, expansions could remedy this problem in time. So unless you're a fanboy, I don't see why any reasonable informed consumer would buy this until expansions are released.\n\nThat said, the new tech tree is convoluted and innavigable. Clearly its a spin-off of Endless Space's and they somehow managed to make it impossible to know anything about what's in it unless you mouse over every last technology. I've been at it for some hours already and I've seen a slew of "this guy made a wonder" messages which I much rather have seen as pop-ups in reference to me but I still can't figure out what tech unlocks what wonder from a glance yet because its represented so terribly. If anything, I'd rather uninstall this right about now and dive back into Civ5, that is if Age of Wonders or Endless Legend didn't exist and weren't almost unquestionably entirely better games.\n\nThe only thing good about this game is the slight branching-off of everything. Dependent on your affinity, you can eventually make this or that unit along with choosing one of two passive boons to a unit every now & then. Otherwise the new culture mechanic just splits off into four stale long trees of military, growth, science, and production choices. Factions are nothing more than someone from some vague area of the planet; African faction being a black guy, the French-Iberia one being some old French woman, and the Russian guy being a generic Ruskie. Nothing about this game stands out and the prospect of inevitable overpriced expansions doesn't provide much hope for the future of this game, as again this is certainly no longer the best 4x turn-based game series.","January 15, 2015","false","4.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/recommended/65980/","Somnambuls","D.Cosmos [lv]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Somnambuls/","233 products in account","Many reviewers expected Beyond Earth to be Alpha Centauri 2, which it is not. Neither it is a Civilization V mod. It IS a new game, which, although share some features of Civ5 (hex grid, battle system, unit classes, wonders, resources, neutral units) and AC (ideologies, sci-fi techs), is played differently.\n\nThe main focus in BE is on affinity (ideology) choices. As you specialise towards a particular victory type, you need to focus on specific technologies. Each next progress level gives you an affinity point, which in turn provides you with useful perks (upgrades) for your units + bonuses. These specific perks will radically change your units as you progress on specific affinity path (alien-like units, machine-like units or human units).\n\nThe culture works in a similar way as in Civ5. After certain level of culture is reached, you can acquire virtues (4 virtue categories – Might, Prosperity, Knowledge and Industry - in 3 tiers), which work in a similar way as social policies in Civ 5. There are synergy bonuses for focusing on same category virtues or same tier virtues.\n\nAlso, there are quests, research pods and exploration areas, which substantially can boost your progress over the time. As well as the destruction of aliens and alien nests, especially with certain Might virtues.\n\nThe victory types are following: Domination - conquer all other players; Contact - contact alien civilization; Transcendence (requires Harmony specialisation)  - civilization fully adapts to the new planet and becomes enlightened; Promised Land (requires Purity specialisation) - bring Earth population to the new planet; Emancipation (requires Supremacy specialisation) - conquer ("free") Earth.\n\nSo, it's a completely different setting in Beyond Earth. And you require a different approach from what you're used to in Civ5. Although, the same basic rules are still in place: e.g., a) food is population, population is everything; b) science is progress, progress is victory.\n\nWhen I played Beyond Earth for the first time, there were certain innovations that annoyed me, but after playing a while, I got used to them and they started to make sense for me.\nFor example:\n\n1. Technology tree is replaced with technology web, which makes it hard to find things, unless you haven't played few sessions. However, with filters and search option, it becomes quite easy to find what you're looking for and to plan your strategy.\n2. Miasma - spore clouds on some tiles that damage human units. This was really annoying in the beginning. However with right technologies, it actually is kind of cool way to have something to transform. And besides, it makes sense, that alien planet is initially hostile towards humans, but as human population adapts to the new habitat, it learns to use the nature for its own good.\n3. Aliens – very hostile, very procreative and (some of them) very strong. Initially, it is very hard to avoid them or kill them, so it might be annoying experience for beginners, but, again, with right technologies and strategy, there are ways to overcome this problem and turn it for your own good. After you have the right technologies and units, it's a great opportunity to gain XP for your army. You can have neutral relationship with aliens (by not destroying their nests), but I have never tried this option, because they are always in your way and threaten you on each turn.\n4. Colour balance - blue and green are dominant colours, it's hard to distinguish miasma and resources. By turning resource yields and icons on, it's possible to minimise this problem, but, still, why couldn't they make miasma red or purple?\n5. There is a radical shift towards agressive playstyle compared to Civ5. It's almost a must to constantly build units and to defend or attack somebody. It's not something I was used to in Civ5. And at first I didn't really like it. But then again, the overall gameplay is more versatile and balanced and the player gets to use and enjoy all of his strengths in a versatile way. It really freshens up the TBS feel in this game.\n6. AI behaviour. AI players are either nasty or stupid or both. The diplomatic relationship and deals do not make any sense. There is no solution for this. Just forget about reasonable trade offers, when playing Beyond Earth. You're on your own. I hope Firaxis will change this with future updates.\n\nSo, with that said, I think Beyond Earth is really a great game. Not perhaps as good as Civilization V, but it certainly feels fresh, runs smoothly and each game session offers a different experience.\n\nI would recommend it to all Civilization fans, not perhaps for its full price, but with atleast -40% discount (30 €), it's worth the price even in its current Vanilla state. However, I do hope there will be new expansions, scenarios and maps.\n\nMy overall rating: 9/10.","January 18, 2015","true","47.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Firstly I'll get it out of the way and say it's a good game, no question. It's far from perfect but if you like civilization then you will like this title.\n\nI fear the single downfall of this game lies in the development. It's as if Firaxis did not have a large enough budget to fully complete this game to make it unique. There are a couple things that bother me with the game so far, the voice acting and it's oh-so-similar CIV 5 likeness. Maybe this was my own fault coming in to this game expecting something COMPLETELY different or something similar to Alpha Centauri. Not that any of these reasons are terrible but I think I worked it up in my head that this game was going to be the perfect blend of Alpha Centauri And Civ 5. It's not, it's good but far from a breakout series.\n\nThe sole thing I would say about the voice acting is that it needs more work. Each civ does have a unique voice actor but when wonders are complete or you're read a definition you get the voice actor who also voices the Kavithan Protectorate. Should this bother me? I think I was just spoiled with Civ 4 and Civ 5.\n\nOn to the good stuff - There were a few things I really liked almost immediately after starting. The futuristic theme lends more capabilities and options for the familiar civ player to start with. I love planetfall, this is basically the enactment of your ship touching down and establishing your first colony on the planet you choose. Before this you are allowed to tweak how you start and what starting benefits your sponsor and civilization get. These options range from scientific, cultural to militaristic benefits to help you mould your civ before you start planetfall, Pretty cool stuff.\n\nThe addition to upgrading your military was a very nice change. Depending on how you steer your civilization this can define what type of militaristic units you get. The 3 directions you can split in to are determined by how you research your technologies. Researching technologies can give you points towards an affinity which can affect your military in very unique ways. This is in addition to veterancy which was not removed but instead improved on.\n\nOverall I would say this is a great title. I have been playing it since release and don't foresee stopping any time soon.\n\nGo out and get it!","October 28, 2014","true","43.4"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Destregan/recommended/65980/","Destregan","Destregan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Destregan/","63 products in account","Beyond Earth feels like an entry title into the series. With that I mean that it sure is a nice game on some fronts and it rolls with the alien theme, it let's you down if you are looking for that Brave New World vibe.\n\nThe game feels and acts like a reskinned civ 5. The units let your expectations down, the year is somewhere in the future, and at this point still you have 'melee' units which in civ 5 style exhange hits with other units. The addition of satelites is a nice touch, however that feels like its the only thing added. You still have your Civ 5 units being a Melee unit, Ranged unit, Artilery unit and cavalery unit. However instead of the upgrades of these units being tied to your technology they are now tied to your affinity (basicly your ideology).\n\nHow I do like the affinity system it does force your research, and strategy with that into a singular path. Since discovering certian technologies grant you affinity points you are forced to pick those techs up, which give you a false hope of an immense tech web with lots of choices. On top of this you'll find that (especcially) on higher difficulties that you don't have a free choice of affinity, with that your playstyle as well, either. You will be looking at what strategic resources are nearby and you will pick the affinity that goes with the specific strategic resource which happens to be in abbundance near your landing zone.\n\nOn top of this the unique feel you used to have for your civilization is gone. Leaders talk less and feel less interactive as well. Furthermore instead of the leader sitting in their "Throne room" they now just show the leader without any background. The uniqueness of your civilization and your games you'll play are gone as well since there are just 8 factions. If you enjoy playing larger maps then these games will always be with the same factions. Factions have a random personality now as well it seems, so no more war mongering shaka.\n\nAlong with the uniqueness of your civ missing, you'll find yourself looking for a lot more if you compare this to Civ 5. The victory system is simplified now, you have 3 basic victory types, 1 is bound to your affinity (basicly build a wonder after researching the right techs), 1 is bound to finding an artifact using the new scout system and the final one is domination. However the first two victories basicly feel like research X asap and perform action Y asap after that. So dumbed down you have 2 victory paths which is a huge letdown to the 4 victories in civ 5, which also felt unique in their playstyle.\n\nPerformance wise civ BE runs great. I have had no crashes and it doesn't seem very taxing on the machine either. The game looks very nice from an observers viewpoint. However from a players viewpoint this is no longer the case. Be prepared for a lot of blue. The techweb feels like a blue hive which includes vague options and lacks color in general. You really can't find any tech or wonder or any other distinction in the tech web easily. On top of this the overall view of the game is messy. You cant really see terrain clearly and this results in you hovering with your mouse over all the terrain to see the yields (or turn the show yields option on).\n\nAll in all this game is a great let down for the expectations set up by its predecessor. If you are new to the series you can pick this up to get a general feel of the Civ series. However your bucks are better spent on the full edition of civ 5 which all in all still feels like a superior game. Rating = 4 / 10, the game feels like a rushed product where Firaxis did not utilise any of the experience build up in making the previous civilization games.\n\nThe good:\n* The terrain looks good visiually and offers a nice change\n* The new system of picking your cargo etc allows for more diverse games\n* The alien system makes "barbarians" a some what city state like faction of their own\n\nThe bad:\n* The game feels messy and lakcs distinctive features in all parts (tech web, buildings, general overview, etc.)\n* Very  low amount of factions in the game of whoms abilities feel lack-luster for some and overpowered for others\n* Low diversity of units, everything is dumbed down to your basic units which use the affinity system for upgraded units\n* Units and buildings dont feel like what you'd expect from space faring civilizations\n* No more religion (or new equivalent)\n* Less diverse games by less victory types\n* Leaders feel a lot less personal and even more as just annoying pop ups\n* Spacing between civilizations (map size) seems less forcing you to have contested borders relatively fast.\n\nShort conclusion:\nRating 4/ 10. Stick to civ 5 Brave new world, either as a new player or as an experienced player.\n\n\n\n","November 16, 2014","false","18.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

BE starts very promising, but after a serious amount of rounds the game is repetitive and in my opinion , a bit pointless. The choices in the tech web are giving me the feeling that they are random and they don't have a serious impact on the game. Also, after so many rounds , the aliens are still doing the same stuff. I feel that the battle between another civilization it's a bit meaningless , because you left from Earth to find a better place to live, not to conquer. I am sorry to say that, but the game is boring. I am going to stick with Civ V. I hope in the future the DLCs will help the game, but i am not willing to gamble another 40-50 € for this game. If you love Civ V , don't buy this.

The "Just one more turn" button does not work.\n\nSecondly, when you lose, you don't see any feedback about 1) who won  2) how you did and 3) why you lost.\n\nThe rest of the game is fairly decent. However, the "hey, screw you, you lose" aspect of the game makes it feel like you just wasted a number of hours playing.\n\nAt this point I can't recommend the game. If Firaxis gets their head out of whatever orifice they have it stuffed up, they should be able to fix this problem fairly easily. At that point I'll revisit this review.","November 15, 2014","false","21.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

On the one hand, it was a lot of fun playing through my first victory and going through the tech tree and so forth as Kavitha. But it just felt so....Civ V-like. Yes, the graphics are different, the sponsors are different, and there's different buildings, units, and wonders. But the mechanics feel like Civ V-reskin.\n\nFirst off the good stuff: I like how the minor powers/city states only occupy one tile. You were probably annoyed one way or another when Monaco took that fountain of youth tile or another natural wonder. It's good to see that the sponsors get a lot of land to use. Also, I like the outpost criteria. I think that should be in Civ 6. Giving an output/settlement a few turns to fully develop is something unique. Rome wasn't built in a day right? :)\n\nI also really like the quotes.\n\nNow the things I don't like: boring leaders (they sound dull and uninspiring), boring units (there's only to be 3 types of units, vs unique units for each civ in Civ V), boring music (I played my own music when I play, and I  - Civ V's music was awesome with the peace and war themes), boring wonders (I had to look through all the wonders the first time, although it's quite easy to see that the ones that need more production are the wonders), some virtues are OP (propserity - bottom right with -25% health - and the other health benefits in that tree, make that area the new Tradition tree. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT IF YOU WANT TO WIN. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE, unless you want to enter -20 health), and by far, this feels like an unfinished game. When I won through victory, the ending was so anticlimatic, and I went "That's it?". It's quite obvious that similar mechanics like religion will be in the game eventually: I want to worship Space Gandhi.

Which I think is one of the reasons I really like Civilization: Beyond Earth.\n\nThe one unit per tile is a massive improvement over using squares. No more doom stacks... the sci fi setting makes it as there no more archers that can fire across the English Channel in this game. The lack of historical figures is an improvement over using historical characters. It tended to make the game of CIv abit funny having a faction leader that never ages lol. Sorry this is coming from somebody who plays Paradox and Total War titles.\n\nThe affinity system and the new and improved tech tree are well executed.\n\nI was a bit wary about buying this with some of the mixed reviews. But so far and  an hours play time in I am enjoying it. Mind you  I have not played CIv 5 so the criticism that CIv Be is a glorified mod is understandable.\n\nThis game can only get even better with some more expansions.\n\nBought this on sale at 50% because I never pre order games.","May 19, 2015","true","186.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

If you paid $50-60 for the base game, you'd be uber ♥♥♥♥♥♥, too.  If, however, you paid $20 like me (or even less with recent sales), you'd be fine with your purchase.  The base game really isn't that bad; it's not particularly memorable, but pay $15-20, and you should avoid any buyer's remorse.\n\n\nDOES THE DLC HELP? IT'S KIND OF EXPENSIVE.\n\nYes! Rising Tide boosts Beyond Earth from an okay game to a very good game.  If you even remotely liked Beyond Earth, pick up Rising Tide immediately.  If you have neither, you should be able to get both Beyond Earth and Rising Tide together for around $40-50 in a future sale.  While the DLC might have too high a price tag, the two items combined are definitely worth $40-50.\n\n\nLOTS OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS ARE SAYING TO STICK WITH CIVILIZATION V.  SHOULD I BOTHER GETTING BEYOND EARTH IF I ALREADY HAVE CIV V?\n\nMost defintiely.  Beyond Earth is NOT just a poor man's Civ V with a space skin thrown on.  Instead, I would say it's built on a Civ V chassis.  Players will recognize many of the same concepts and game mechanics, but also notice significant differences.\n\nJust a few:\n\n1) "aliens" function quite differently from "barbarians" in older games\n\n2) the tech "tree" is really more of a "web" now, and many of the technological choices have no equivalent in previous Civ games.  They didn't take the existing tree and say, "Ooooooh, let's just call it 'space bronze working' now."\n\n3) affinity levels -- how your civilization will relate to the Old Earth and your new home -- have a significant impact on the types of buildings, military units, etc available to you.\n\n4) there are some cool new types of victory scenarios.  Ahhh, nothing like the feeling of sending giant alien hybrids through a warp gate back to old Earth to "emancipate" them from their petty bickering.\n\n\nIt's a decent base game, well worth a $15-20 investment.  As with Civ V, I think it will become a truly great game once all the DLC dust has cleared.  Jump on the bandwagon now and enjoy the ride.","January 2","true","13.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

But unlike Civ V, especially with all its addons, has a lot more to offer than Beyond Earth. The different civs are only a few and not really interesting. The difference between the civs is also negligible. The progression via affinity according to Supremacy, Harmony, or Purity is a nice idea but they are only 3 options compared to the numerous in Civ V via religion or culture. If you wanted you could win the game within a short time because the different goals, with the exception of domination maybe, is fairly easy. The tech you need to research does not take too long and then, if you have a strong town with good production, build the wonder fairly quickly and after about 75 turns it is over. Meaning the computer can also win easily in higher difficulty. I do not know if the AI actually does that because I did not get to those above normal difficulties yet. Marathon feels like normal speed in Civ V and is over quickly as well.\n\nThe diversity of units is very limited. You basically get 1 unit of each type. 1 ship, 1 plane, 1 artillery, 1 infantry and so on.\n\nIn general diversity is what I think is the problem that is most lacking. Nothing that they cannot add with mods or updates but at this point I rather play Civ V or Endless Legends.","November 5, 2014","false","83.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

But, I'm so used to the masterpiece that is Civilization 5 : Brave New World, that this rendition sadly pales into insignificance. Many of the features that made Civ 5 what it was have either been heavily simplified or removed entirely - good examples being the unit variety and faction identities/bonuses.\n\nGood/New features :\n\nI like the addition of the orbital layer - it adds another dynamic to empire building and warfare.\nThe new Affinities (Ideologies) are a different spin on Civ 5, and I think do give you a feel of what your Civ represents in terms of values.\nMiasma - it feels like a major pain to start out, and if you play as Harmony, you can turn it to your advantage - a nice touch.\nThe Virtues tree (social upgrades) are a nice touch giving you the option to progress either in a single tree or multiple trees - each having bonus boosts (i.e. you get bonuses for spreading across multiple trees - unlike Civ 5).\nThe Quests - it adds a nice way to customise buildings to your specific playstyle, and gives nice little boosts to your empire. Ultimately though, it's a mechanism to reduce the number of buildings in the game.\nThe favour system in diplomacy is a nice touch. If you don't need anything from another faction, they trade you an IOU which can be called in later.\nThe visual appeal is a nice change from dull and boring earth :o)  Although, the graphics overall aren't really an upgrade over Civ 5 (not that it was needed tbh).\n\nThings that disappoint me :\n\nThe tech web - although a decent idea, it just seems to be a random collection of upgrades that you stumble into. I never get a feel that I'm progressing towards something meaningful. Example : In Civ 5, acquiring Dynamite was a major boost for your Artillery capabilities, and you would often divert resources to getting it as early as possible if you were planning a war. You don't get that feeling in C:BE.\n\nThe wonders are........Meh. They are small and fairly insignificant boosts that have little synergy with each other. Again, Civ 5 often required you to build/acquire certain wonders to achieve certain victories.\n\nThe lack of "atmosphere". This is a new planet shrouded in mystery! The quest system is good for customisation, but they could have done so much more with it to give you that feeling that this is a weird and wonderful new place that you have to grapple with to get the most out of it. The Aliens are basically the "Barbarians" of Civ 5 - but they seem to flip a coin as to whether or not to attack you. Once you get to mid-game, they are irrelevant as a force - you might as well terminate them on sight, even playing as Harmony! Would have been much better if they made the natural inhabitants an AI-only faction in their own right, and link quests to them depending on your Affinity.\n\nThe "health" system. It's basically "happiness" from Civ 5, but seems to be more forgiving. You can expand very aggressively in C:BE and not suffer too much. If you did that in Civ 5, you'd find life very difficult if your people weren't happy. The "softening" of this expansion bottleneck means that you are engaging far less with your neighbours to acquire happiness or manipulate the game in your favour via a league of nations/UN - oh wait, luxury goods don't exist anymore either. Why do I need to talk to anyone again?\n\nThe NPC stations; the C:BE equivalent of City States. They are a trading option for a single trade route - nothing more. You don't fight over them. They don't fight for you. They don't consume land and foil your best laid expansion plans. You can't take them over. They don't give you a bigger voice at the table of international diplomacy - nope...they just sit there and give you a few extra resource points - and if you're unlucky they appear out of the blue and stop you from planting an outpost where you want it. Meh.\n\nEconomy - I never feel like Energy (Gold) is a bottleneck. If you had an abundance of gold in Civ 5, you could do so much with it. If you weren't a gold friendly faction, you'd sometimes struggle to make ends meet - to field that Dynasty crushing army.  Where there were big gold sinks in Civ 5 like maintaining alliances and control over city states, upgrading units etc - the absence of this limits the use of excess energy to rush buying units and buildings.  So far - Energy is just something I casually look at. It's rarely in the negative per turn. It's just not a resource that needs to be carefully managed like in Civ 5.\n\nLack of unit diversity - There are not many units at all. Only different ways to customise them via increases in Affinity. It's like the buildings - less of them, but you can customise them.\n\nAll in all I'm disappointed - After Civ 5 and X-COM, Firaxis were the only software house I'd ever pre-order anything from. I'll be thinking twice now.\n\nThat said - this game does have potential for modding and future expansions. My advice is to park it until that happens. Civ 5 only became truly great after the second expansion.\n\nFor people who are new to the Civ franchise, you'd probably enjoy this game.  For Civ 5 veterans like myself, it's a bit of a let down that leaves you chomping at the bit for an expansion.","November 4, 2014","false","12.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Normally this would be far to little to write accurate review, and you are right!\n\nThe first thing I did when I start the game was of course the settings, see how everything is set. First thing I noticed, no 1920x1080 resolution supported in full screen. I got confused, which game in 2014 didn't have it?!\nI went on the web and found out this is normal for those with a specific refresh rate of a their monitor, I guess this somehow got pets the superb Q/A testing.\n\nFine, I will play it in windows mode\n\nI looked at the choices I could get, and I noticed that you only have 8 Civs, this was kinda mediocre to me when you compare it to the previous game, and because they aren't  the 'known' civ's of the world, it felt very lacking.\nThe bonuses of each civs as well made them far less unique then I thought. But ill just go ahead and pick something.\n\nAfter 'personalising' my faction ( which with the limited choices you cannot really call it that ) I entered  the game!\n\nFirst thing I noticed, no awesome voice overs of William Morgan Sheppard or  Leonard Nimoy.\nI started, settled, and explored with my unit, already felt a bit CiV 5 but that doesn't have to be bad.\nI found something to use my explorer on, started to dig around and then it already started, next turn, next turn and next turn. Not much going on.\n\nI started fiddling with the UI and noticed so much is missing and its all very blend, while in previous civs it all looked quite nice with art and stuff, this game is just made out of bars that anyone can do! The minimap is very annoying coloured, everything is very dark which means you got to suck the player in for that next turn.\n\nThen suddenly other civs joined, landed on the map and I could see where they were,  meaning no exploring what so ever to find that other civilization. Played some more, heard my first research completed, no cool pop up, a very average voice over ( sorry.. ) made a new city with a oversized settler, started seeing the other civs units, all the same, as me, no uniqueness. I started looking some more throught the UI, Affinity, Virtues, Researching.\n\nI had a quest popping up asking me for a station to drop near me, I made my choice, it dropped down and well that was it, you can trade with this station but for the rest it does nothing. Imagen a city state without workers and units around it while growing and feeling sort of alive, no here they are just dead buildings. Speaking of quests, at first, I loved em, they do give a bit of lore BUT they the bonus is always very small, in the end, its just picking something you go for or what you need. You quickly just pick and forget.\n\nWhile I don't mind the Web of researching, its not good and it is very boring, while you see cool artworks from CiV 5, this again feels really cheap.\nOther civs started to ask for things, when I read what they had to say, it was pure copy paste from CiV 5.. and that is when I started to have enough. And I saw flaw after flaw and flaw. Wonders, I build them, never knowing I actually made one! Why? They aren't 'wonderful' I honestly thought they were just a building! When I started upgrading units, ah a bigger gun! Awesome!...\n\n150 turns in, trade spam became annoying, you can have as low as 2 trade routes on a city.\n\n(as you can tell by my writing I start to become a bit more unforgiving, exactly how I felt during my play session for the first time )\n\nI noticed that sure, affinity will make your units look different in end game, but they will still be exactly the same as any other civ that has it, while I know that in CiV 5, modern age it is the same as well, before that you had a couple of ages feeling relatively unique compared to the rest. Mods made this even better.\n\nAs you have noticed I said nothing about the aliens, that's because they have nothing to do with the game, they are there, being annoying but nothing else, even when you kill nest after nest, nothing.\n\nI then gave up on the game, it was just to boring, to tedious and it has no soul, i feels like almost no effort was made into this.\n\nI do have one positive, I have to say, is the music, its beautiful  and I am 100% sure, that's the only reason I played it for this long.\n\nI will not recommend this to anyone, not at full price, perhaps at 10 euros max. I will also never recommend this to a CiV Veteran, because he will see this too. As far as it goes for me, this is a MOD, and a bad one at that.","October 31, 2014","false","7.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

This game is lets face it dull, the graphics are vibrant but not in the good way as i often felt my eyes being strained. The ads show off a wide new range of victories but once you play the game you'll know thats its just bs.

And some people will say that it will get better in the expansions, but even civ 5 vanilla had more soul, features, and appeal than this game does in it's current state.

It would have made an excellent mod for Civ V, but is absolutely not worth paying the full price for. If you are a massive Civ fan, it might be a good purchase but Civ V still remains a stronger game in every single measurable aspect.\n\nPresumably, until the first DLC release there are only eight playable civs. However, it does not make a difference as the civs do NOT have unique units. Instead, what units you can build depends on your 'affinity'. As you level up through the enormously complex tech tree, you will gain points towards one of three affinity trees depending on what skills you train- Harmony, Purity or Supremacy. Essentially this means that there are actually only an absolutely pathetic three sets of units possible to build.\n\nWait until the Christmas specials for this one, folks.\n\n","October 27, 2014","false","15.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Settling an alien world, with new choices, familiar themes, allies and adversaries, I found the AI to be more sophisticated than even Civilization V, with alien creatures capable of wiping out soldiers with a single strike in the beginning of your campaign. You must be on your guard as the terrain itself can be hostile, with miasma deposits that damage you when you get near. The research tree is much more extensive than previous Civilization games, and is more dynamic, as opposed to linear, with branches and leaves to the research tree. I found this game to be more difficult than V, but it has a decent tutorial system to help you through the transition. I think for hard core lovers of the Sid Meier's Civilization series, you will have those who love it, and those who hate it, due to the changes.

It just don't think that it is worth 50 dollars. If you are a huge civ fan buy this game but keep in mind that it is basically reskinned civ5. Civ5 was  a great game but this game looks too similar.\n\nPros:\n-As addictive as civ5. This game whittles away much time easily.\n-The planets look pretty good. This is running on the civ5 engine so it does not look next gen but it looks good.\n-The aliens are great. There are quite a few varieties and they pose a good beginning game challenge.\n-The tech tree is cool. There is a lot of customizablity.\n-the affinity system is good but could be more extensive. Most ways to get affinity points are passive (research this tech or choose a quest) but it is a nice addition that I'm sure will be enhanced in DLC\n\nCons:\n-There are not very many different units types. There are no civ specific units, and there are very few types.\n-This game is obviously built around DLC, there is a lot that should be here (more than just 8 civs) that have been left out\n-The few civs each feel identical and have almost no differences. At least the civ5 rulers were actual people.\n-There are not very many victory types. There is domination, first contact, and one affinity specific vixtory open to you. No culture, monetary or science victory can be won.\n-The AI is unpredictable. They attack without pretext and are almost the same as in Civ5.\n\nAll in all, this game is not bad.

Any online play takes several tries to get off the ground because the game crashes constantly in multiplayer, although it is admittedly better in LAN play than over the internet.  It tends to be a toss-up whether or not the racial faction bonuses will work at any given time. The mechanics are unimaginative, with a completely uninspired tech-bubble that lets you decide exactly the way you wish your civilization to be the same as everyone else's because the techs are scattered all over the place and full of requirements from other techs placed far away on the tree. In the year 2014 there's apparently no way to make an algorithm that even attempts to balance starting conditions. In effect, it's pretty much the exact same deal as with civilization 5, although the tech bubble is less intuitive and harder to construct a proper build out of.\n\nBarbarians, one of the most annoying and random features of civilization 5, has been given a steroid treatment so that the game can rocket into the dull trope of all alien worlds somehow inexplicably playing host to naturally bullet-resistant life-forms. Rather than being an interesting event and object of interaction with the world, the aliens pour out of nests, meaning that depending on your location they will either be an insignificant nuisance that you don't really need to take a stance on or absolutely obliterate any chance of staying competitive with anyone who was placed elsewhere on the map. Their aggression is mostly tied into the nests - if you are surrounded by them then too bad, if not then you might not even need to escort your workers and colonists to new locations. This is unmitigated by the techs for dealing with them, due to their being placed on high tiers and randomly around the tech bubble.\n\nYou're not alone in dealing with the alien threat, however. Every now and then an unafiliated outpost will land somewhere in your expansion circle, forcing you to go to war with them or 35 turns before they go away. Sometimes two outposts disagree about which one of them is going to ruin your day, and make you decide - never give you the option to tell them both to screw off. This happens at random times throughout the game, and you have no control over it. These are the exact two random events that will happen - outposts taking your spot, and aliens taking your spot. Other players may also take your spot, but that's to be expected as you can also take theirs, being that they don't fall from the sky without warning.\n\nThis game is lazy at best, more of a late beta than a full release in most of the ways that matter. If you preordered, but are intending to play with friends who did not, you can't use the bonus map types - which is pretty stupid, but the blow is softened by the fact that the new map types are basically small variations on the old ones. In their botched attempt to basically recreate Alpha Centauri, Firaxis has managed to leave out most of the interesting parts of this predecessor - the tech bubble is bad, there is no lore to speak of, the factions are bland, even the quotes are terrible - and mashed it with the worst parts of Civilization 5's engine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/65980/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Sid Meier's Civilization has been one of my favorite PC series since I first laid hands on Civilization II. With the more recent release of Civilization V, my love for the franchise was rekindled; the revamped, addictive gameplay model was remarkably difficult to put down. When Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth was announced, I figured developer Firaxis would keep the trend going. Thankfully, that's definitely the case.Beyond Earth, as its name implies, is a sci-fi-tinged take on the Civilization formula. On different alien planets, you establish an outpost that becomes a full-fledged city. The names of the planets matters little; instead, each planet represents different map layouts. Some feature multiple land masses and smaller bodies of water separating the land, while others may have an extremely large land mass surrounded by ocean. There's a decent variety to choose from, along with more advanced types that feature tougher climates and layouts than the standard set. You can also dictate the overall size of the map, allowing for two, four, six, or eight different sponsors on any map.As you might suspect, a sponsor is essentially a nation or faction controlled by you, another player, or the AI. Beyond Earth features a total of eight sponsors. If you're willing to delve into the optional Civilopedia, you get a lot more information on the background of each sponsor and how each relates to real-world cultures. Each sponsor also has a distinct attribute.There are even more options at your disposal when beginning a new single-player game. Aside from picking the size/type of map and sponsor, you also choose a colonist type. You can also choose your spacecraft, which grants additional bonuses, like the ability to see all coasts or see all alien nests on the map despite the standard "fog" that needs to be lifted via exploring units. Finally, you can choose what cargo to bring on your journey, essentially providing another bonus.Having all of these starting options and choices helps to make each single-player game feel unique, regardless of how many times you play the game. The options aren't uncommon for the Civilization series, but I enjoyed the sci-fi spin. Every bonus or ability provided by cargo, spacecraft, colonists, etc., helps you mold the game to your play style. Any game can be won in a number of ways, so you're pretty much free to explore the victory condition that you'd prefer.Most victory conditions are spread across three different affinities that you can explore: Harmony, Purity and Supremacy. You either choose to live in peace with all forms of life on the planet, wipe out alien species or dominate opposing sponsors. You can devote time to all three affinities or focus on just one. Each affinity "levels up" as you gain points by completing branches of the Tech Web. This in turn provides you with new technology, units and buildings to further enhance your cities and sponsor.Leveling up your affinities provides special bonuses, often to military, land and sea units once you hit certain milestones. The different affinity bonuses do a solid job of complementing their intended path, but some of the military-focused upgrades get a little generic and repetitive.While the Tech Web is chock-full of various technologies to explore, it's a bit clunky and difficult to navigate. The biggest issue I had was pinpointing the natural progression of the affinity on which I was focusing. It doesn't feel as organized as it should, and for a new player, it is absolutely overwhelming. While Civilization V focused much of its early game on battling against barbarian hordes in order to gain footholds and experience for starting cities and units, Beyond Earth has a slightly slower pace. Barbarians are replaced by alien bugs, which are generally peaceful unless you attack first or get too close to their nests. Instead, many of your early turns in Beyond Earth are going to be focused on exploring. As you roam the map, moving from one hexagonal tile to the next, you'll luck into resource pods, which can provide quick boosts to base resources like energy and science.Once you've mapped out a sizeable portion of the area and have likely run into rival sponsors, you'll want to begin expansion by designating new outposts. Once an outpost is established, it slowly grows as long as it remains healthy. Health essentially replaces the happiness stat of other Civilization titles, but maintaining it doesn't feel nearly as problematic as it did in Civilization V.As cities expand, they occupy more of the surrounding tiles. These tiles can be modified by worker units, which enhance or mine the natural resources. As in other Civilization titles, you can automate a lot of unit functions, but you'll likely want to be hands-on with most of them. Unit speeds are pretty quick, so most turns pass quickly.The only real issue I've had with Beyond Earth is that the opposing AI is remarkably docile. On various difficulty settings, I've had to really work hard to trigger any sort of diplomatic incident. When you encounter new sponsors, they're generally jovial enough to immediately engage in a dialogue with you. You often receive notices to open borders or establish trade.While perfectly playable via local means, with both LAN support and single-machine "pass the mouse" modes, Beyond Earth also hosts online multiplayer. There don't seem to be many players still using it, as I'd only run into one or two hosted rooms at any time of the day.Passive AI and lackluster online support from the community isn't enough to make Civilization: Beyond Earth a total wash. If you've enjoyed the series over the years, you'll likely spend many hours with this entry as well. It deviates just enough from the excellent Civilization V to be a worthwhile experience, and it offers a different pace than its predecessor, so even though it's not a significant upgrade, it's still pretty remarkable.","March 12, 2015","true","002.4"," 44 of 82 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","44","82","6","4"

All I see is a reskin, and a very poor one at that. You just dont feel acomplished even when you have the best runthrough you can. Rather than getting new units, all you do is upgrade existing ones, while this is ok, again, it doesnt feel acomplishing when you upgrade them. Before the new unit would replace the existing one (like replacing longswordsman with Minutemen, or Tanks with Death Machines), why they couldnt impliment that is beyond me. Also, rather than working towards the end of the tech tree to win, now theres a cluster F*** of a tech tree that will make new players heads spin.\n\nAnother problem, the map itself. You see that "Floatstone" or "Fireaxite", well dont bother with it for half the game, because thats when your able to even harvest it. WHATS THE POINT OF HAVING REVEALED RESOURCES THAT YOU CANT DO ANYTHING WITH? What happened to Revealing it on the map at the point of when you need it. Best example of doing it right, Civ 5. In Civ 5, you reveal almost every strategic resource when you progress the tech tree. Here, most of it is shown you you outright. Not all, but most.\n\nAlso, there doesnt seem to be alot of resources in total, and most dont have the same effect it did in Civ 5. Happyness, i mean "Health" is not controlled anymore by the resources you have, which makes it very difficult to keep the "empire" "healthy".\n\nProbably the worst part though, the part that really pisses me off, are the victories. I beat the game doing the promised land victory. Heres what you do, you launch the tellalink satalite and then you can get the Exodus Gate. Once you build that, you think the ending is right there right? WRONG? NOW, you have to teleport 20 earth settlers to settle on the planet, and they cant settle within 3 tiles of eachother or cities. This game ending is so ♥♥♥♥ed up its unbelievable, and to top it off, theres a glitch in the game where it wont give me the achievment for it.\n\nThese are just some facts and my oen opinions on the game. I think they should have exapnded Civ 5 firther rather than give us this game, here here we are. This game is unfinished and unpolished in terms of gameplay and the victories are just ♥♥♥♥ing horrid. Avoid this game until proper DLC content make this game hopefully as complete it made Civ 5.\n\nP.S. I also forgot to mention that a bunch of animations either seem to be missing from the game or just not there. When I was attacking enemies, i didnt see anything that looked like they were getting shot it. What it looks like is the gun flashing w/ sound effects but no visuals of them getting shot, just them dieing. Best example, using the Rocket vehicles. I dont see any rockets fireing, just the red sparks of wat i believe to be them them coming from the end barrels.","October 26, 2014","false","34.0"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

The tech web is an interesting idea on paper but in practice the web takes the exciting tech race and throws it out the window. No improvements to the AI. Also, if you ignore the Aliens then they'll ignore you right back... and that is it the Aliens are out of the game. The outposts which were city-states in civ v are dumbed down so that you can only send trade routes to them. The orbital layer is underwhelming to say the least. And the favors system in diplomacy is useless.\n\nThe good news is that it is a very very pretty reskin of CIV and the good Civ V game play dynamics are still there. Additionally, Multiplayer is pretty good.\n\nMy Advice: Wait for either good mod or a great dlc to improve this game. Until then it is unfortunate that I cannot recommend this game.\n\n*Just like everyone else I am a long time Civilization Fan.","October 24, 2014","false","19.4"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","30","55","0","0"

But I'm a big fan of Sid Meier and went ahead and purchased.  At first I could totally relate to all the negative comments. It really did seem like Civ 5 had been reskinned and renamed, but without the good stuff.\n\nWhat I discovered after sticking with it awhile, determined to get my money's worth:\n- This is not Civ 5, therefore you cannot play with exact same strategy as Civ 5. Similar, but different enough you will need to adjust a bit\n- There is a learning curve. Most overwhelming I found was the Technology Web. Definitely takes a while to wrap your head around what is important and when to research.\n- Wonders do help ALOT. If you build the right ones. Again, there is a learning curve\n- Read up on the Affinity's, pick one and go hard\n- Unless you only want to go to war for a Domination Victory, check out the ingame help, learn about the Victories, pick one and go for it\n\nOn the down side:\n- Trade routes are a nuisance. You always seem to give away more than you receive, but it can help things keep ticking over. You can more or less put them on auto pilot if you want to\n- Overall the game is a bit bland. In an effort to make it look futuristic all the developers have achieved is making it "samey" imho\n- Lack of variation in the color scheme adds to the sameyness feel of things, it also makes identifying different types of units etc challenging at times\n\nOverall I am greatly enjoying this game. Each time round I discover something new and find a new depth. If you enjoy strategy and are prepared for a learning curve then you will enjoy BE too.","May 26, 2015","true","97.6"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","20","36","0","0"

Fans had been wondering when they'd see a spiritual successor to Alpha Centauri for some time, and Beyond Earth takes it into the modern era nicely, very much its own thing but with nice consistencies in lore and in some returning unit types, but apart from that, everything is redesigned from the ground up and is balanced pretty nicely for whatever type of game you're looking to get, from long and epic on huge planets to short, sweet and scrappy with a handful of opponents in close proximity. There's also a plethora of different map types and features to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours if you let it, particularly with the Exoplanets map pack. My favorite is a fixed-orbit planet, with scorching desert on one hemisphere, frozen wasteland in the other, and a sweet spot around the highly-contested equator area. There's a lot of little touches that add a lot of depth and replayability, which I like very much.\n\nA lot of people I've asked about it have given it flak for feeling like a mod of Civ 5 they charged full price for, but they're forgetting that Alpha Centauri was just an improvement on the Civ 2 engine, and it was just as unique and brilliant. I don't mind this, and I really feel like you get what you pay for with Firaxis games. Their QA has never been perfect, though. Even this far down the line, there's still graphical glitches and spelling errors remaining deeper into the tech tree. Not as many as there used to be, and I recommend just a little bit more power than Steam's recommended settings if you're looking to buy the right hardware to max out the graphics in this game.\n\nI am torn between recommending the expansion at this point or not. It adds a LOT to the game and distances itself further from what could honestly be called "just a Civ 5 mod." The gameplay is expanded into the ocean, with enhanced graphics for undersea tiles a welcome feast for the eye, with all-new tile enhancements and coastal graphics. Sea bases are finally a thing again, and the way they acquire territory and contribute to Culture is interesting. In other ways, though, it makes the game feel less complete and cluttered. I dunno why you can't zoom out in the tech web anymore, but the redesign with added color coding is at least very nice. The hybrid affinities are great, but at this point I feel like they're accomodating multi-class play styles a little TOO much. You can basically just blindly whisk through the tech web, researching whatever, and at any point you'll be pretty well-equipped with good options for any situation. I don't know whether to call it an improvement or a lack of focus. I've had some good games with it, anyway, and it does seem more effective in the short term at least to focus on one direction, whether it be an endgame plan or a particular affinity or powerful unit you want to go for. I think the clincher for me is how the alien AI behaves differently on different planet types in Rising Tide. It's such a small touch, but one that adds infinite variety, which is important in games that have a randomized element.\n\nIn the end, if you like Civ, definitely get this game, and if you want a truly unique and rich experience, get the expansion too, but with that, it feels like they focused on some areas more than others, and like they might be gearing up for a second expansion at some point, like with Civ 5. In particular I hope for them to focus on the combat AI a bit more. It's a little too easy to steamroll them on the battlefield, even an expansion down the line. Word of advice: Even if you're just starting out with the game, play it on at least Gemini, because it is way less challenging than some Civ games.","April 5","true","329.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They avoid affinity levels like the plague and bounce around with 1st level units as long as they can. Oh, and they no longer trade resources, just 'favours', which of course can be saved up and used later to sway their minds, but playing beyond 200 turns with a pocket full of favours doesn't get you very far.\n\n- Stations (city states); Low hp, low defence, don't have a ranged attack, don't absorb land, rather poor late game benefits (even at tier 3), they dont call for help, computer players will demand you stop attacking them even when you're the one trading and protecting them!\n\n- Health; The old Civ5 happiness system has been replaced by a health system, which is entirely dependant on buildings which take some time to research and build and rarely benefit you beyond +3 increase. A few late game tile improvements grant you health also, but at rather steep costs. So don't expect to expand your empire beyond 3-4 cities without falling well below the health line.\n\n- Beginning bonuses; plenty of reasonable choice, however scanning for alien nests only works on turn 1, +1 population for capital city is rather poor even on a marathon length game, CIV bonuses are rather poor compared to Civ5 Civ's, but obviously we will need to wait a few months for another 5-10 Civs to be introduced.\n\n- Easy tech; Adopting the Scavenging virtue with the first level purity affinity grants your scouts immunity to alien attacks and are free to roam the world destroying every alien nest in site for a sweet tech bonus, the aliens assult any other unit near nests and rarely end their turn on top of the nest making for easy explorer pickings. This method has bumped myself beyond the AI every game.\n\nThere are plenty more issues to touch up on but you start to see a trend affecting almost every element of the game. But I feel that some pros should be listed as well, this is Civ after all!\n\n- Aliens; love them, so much more annoying and stronger than barbarians, with mid-end game units like the siege worm and KRAKEN floating around the world. Making explorers and ships likely to die within a few turns after automation as they blindly stumble into the claws of the local fauna.\n\n- Outposts; Great adaptation to city development, stops those pesky neighbours from landing a city 4 tiles from your capital. easily destroyed, no ranged attack, slow border expansion, great all around.\n\n- Unit evolution; as you gain affinity levels, your units gain strength and unique bonuses! and not to mention a new skin. Instant upgrades for all units is rather unbalanced but this makes for a much more diverse game and interesting wars.\n\n- Tech web; With the choice of rushing to end-game tech or slowly developing every capability, taking away the linear approach has been a fantastic improvement. Of course, being futuristic makes it rather confusing at first, I highly recommend a few minutes reading over potential improvements before selecting what to research next.\n\n- Quests; Needs some work, however its great to have some goals pushing your game play, kill the giant worm! or even free the slaves from far base one! It would be nice to see some foriegn country specific quests encouraging a more violent game.\n\nWell there you have some basics of the game to ponder over, I've met plenty more issues and oddities that need to be worked over in the next few weeks but this game does have great potential just as Civ5 had when it was first released.\n\nI can see that the game has been rushed for release before it's time, but with the next 2 or 3 major updates, this will be worth buying for all the strategy and Civ fans out there.","November 2, 2014","false","216.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

There is some minor gameplay variation from Civ V, but not improvement. For example, the new starting options and events/quests are interesting at first but not fleshed out enough. And the lacklustre goes much further...\n\nOpportunities were missed here. Instead of thinking, "Players can scan the world from space, so how can we modify the game to take account of a detailed world map being available from the beginning?", we instead get the same mostly dark world to start with. Instead of thinking, "No need to reinvent e.g. boats and tanks, so what new strategic units can we develop?", we instead just get units in a highly analogous progression to the historical Civ series.\n\nThe ending had no build-up and was followed by zero post-game analysis: gone are the histograms etc. The ending was just a single splash screen, positive or negative, not even telling me which victory my opponoent had won. Frankly the game feels unfinished.","November 3, 2014","false","16.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

One for me, and one for a friend.\n\nI have told that friend to wait a couple of months, because everything past turn 100 or so is broken and/or badly balanced or simply not finished.\n\nDiplomacy is a joke. The AI makes offers it does does not agree to. I have even been offered *Nothing* for *Nothing* by an AI opponent.\n\nIn earlier CIV games you got a sense of when an opponent was close to a tech/culture win and could act accordingly. Here you only get the information "75%" if you know where to look, and then suddenly BAM! YOU LOSE!\n\nI really like the Affinity system, but early victory requires going 90-100% after just one of the three. And don't get me started on units... Their strength is 100% tied into the affinity system. Units upgrade EXPONATIALLY with affinity with huge leaps in strenght. A linear or logistic curve would be much better IMHO. Getting a high enough affinity to enable an "affinity win" should not automatically give you invincible units - going after those wins should be a sacrifice; not an obvious path.\n\nLet's hope DLC's fix this mess.

I've defended this game against naysayers for a while now but I think it's about time I ate my own words somewhat.\n\nWhile BE is undoubtedly still a decent game, playing it for the past 10 or so hours has made it abundantly clear why there should have been an open beta. And I'm not referring to complaints about how this doesn't live up to the legacy of SMAC or how it's too similar to Civ 5. I wish those were the only issues. Suffice it to say there are a lot of missteps that really shouldn't have made it past the testing stage. The game is missing a lot of key UI features and shortcuts that were already present in Civ 5 and you'd think would have transitioned quite easily into this title.\n\nFor instance, why are we never told when something is built? Unless it's a wonder, the city just prompts you to select something new without ever telling you what was just completed. And while I'm glad to see more trade routes, why do I need to refresh all of them over and over without any option to just leave them to continue trading until canceled? I realize that wasn't an option in Civ 5, but with all the routes we have to micromanage now, it really ought to be.\n\nMeanwhile, things I'd like to have dragged out - such as victory completions - are even more lackluster than in Civ 5. It's just a water color painting and an option to either play a few more turns or leave to the main menu. That's it. Where are the endgame screens with the graphs and maps and a rating of my performance or anything else that would offer the player some semblance of closure and completion? Totally absent. On the other hand, if I lose, why am I never even told what victory condition was used to win the game? I can't even check in the quest log because there's no option to "Keep Playing" if I lose.\n\nThere's no way to track the victory progress of rival factions beyond vague quarterly updates, so I'm forced to limit the game to the only victory conditions I can keep tabs on, namely Timed and Domination. There's also no diplomatic view to see which factions are at war with each other, the aliens can more or less be avoided until you're powerful enough to completely crush them, after which they become completely irrelevant, and the quests will occasionally have bizarrely impossible tasks such as constructing a petrochemical plant near a city that doesn't have a petroleum resource.\n\nThese are all things that really should've been implemented or ironed out before even setting a release date.\n\nI enjoy the sci-fi aesthetic, I like the darker, almost twilight atmosphere and planetscape, the quests give me things to do instead of just pressing END TURN ad nauseum, espionage is much more rewarding, and the Affinity system offers a sense of direction and purpose that I always felt was lacking in previous Civ games that weren't SMAC. The units are fewer but more versatile, the sense of adventure and discovery more palpable than in Civ 5 and assuming multiplayer works the way it should, I see it being a lot more enjoyable than Civ 5.\n\nThat said, it feels like I'm playing an incomplete game. Quotes and voice acting are rather forgettable, attack animations seem to have been an afterthought, with impact explosions not even implemented for most units, Prosperity absolutely trumps all other Virtue trees, orbital layer isn't nearly as useful as the devs made it out to be, and immersion in terms of the overall narrative just isn't there. I mean come on, at least let me check to see how my own faction leader's appearance changes with my Affinity progress. Give me some monuments. Show my workers changing along with my affinity, even if it's just aesthetically. Give me a Planetary Council to exert diplomatic pressure on my rivals. Something. ANYTHING.\n\nReally hoping to see a lot of patching and hotfixes in the coming months.","November 2, 2014","false","209.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The UI is terrible and Firaxis should replace their designers with the guy(s?) who wrote InfoAddict.

There's also no diplomatic view to see which factions are at war with each other, the aliens can more or less be avoided until you're powerful enough to completely crush them, after which they become completely irrelevant, and the quests will occasionally have bizarrely impossible tasks such as constructing a petrochemical plant near a city that doesn't have a petroleum resource.\n\nThese are all things that really should've been implemented or ironed out before even setting a release date.\n\nI enjoy the sci-fi aesthetic, I like the darker, almost twilight atmosphere and planetscape, the quests give me things to do instead of just pressing END TURN ad nauseum, espionage is much more rewarding, and the Affinity system offers a sense of direction and purpose that I always felt was lacking in previous Civ games that weren't SMAC. The units are fewer but more versatile, the sense of adventure and discovery more palpable than in Civ 5 and assuming multiplayer works the way it should, I see it being a lot more enjoyable than Civ 5.\n\nThat said, it feels like I'm playing an incomplete game. Quotes and voice acting are rather forgettable, attack animations seem to have been an afterthought, with impact explosions not even implemented for most units, Prosperity absolutely trumps all other Virtue trees, orbital layer isn't nearly as useful as the devs made it out to be, and immersion in terms of the overall narrative just isn't there. I mean come on, at least let me check to see how my own faction leader's appearance changes with my Affinity progress. Give me some monuments. Show my workers changing along with my affinity, even if it's just aesthetically. Give me a Planetary Council to exert diplomatic pressure on my rivals. Something. ANYTHING.\n\nReally hoping to see a lot of patching and hotfixes in the coming months.","November 2, 2014","false","209.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It could have been better.\nMost game features are just retextured versions of the Civ V game. Culture from Civ V are shrunken down and renamed Virtues. Affinities are slightly tweaked versions of the Ideologies from Civ. The range of military units has been vastly diminished, though customisation is a good, new, feature.\n\nAn entirely new feature are the Quests. Quests were supposed to be interesting, but they quickly are repetitive.\n"Do you want to add food or culture from this new building you build?" is repeated multiple times. A few, game changing quests would have been an improvement. Civ BE does anything but. It inudates the player with dozens of quests which have barely any effect. They quickly become uninteresting and more of a hassle.\n\nThe "Stations" are the stunted, crippled City States from Civ 5. They do not claim territory and do not have a diplomacy option. They never spawn units and are essentially just trade nodes for you to trade with, each providing a bonus.\n\nWonders from Civ 5 which used to give plentiful bonuses and game changers such as doubling the army have been scaled back. For 1400 production points, you can build a wonder with an intelligent sounding name which is marginally better than a building with a quarter the production cost. Wonders are also astonishingly varied. While some yield meager bonuses, others provide you with massive bonuses to health and production.\n\nAll in all, Civ BE is not very new, nor very interesting and leaves you feeling that something is missing or broken about it. If you want to buy Civ BE, wait until an expansion pack or two are out and on sale and buy them both.\nThat is all.","November 2, 2014","false","21.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I was hoping it'd be a successor to Alpha Centauri, or at least a nice upgrade to Civ a la Gods and Kings.  What this is really is a mod of Civ V without a lot of the hooks for me, personally.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar, but the games flow is nowhere near as smooth or intuitive as Civ V. Some of the main selling points really are not well thought out, and don't add much. The quests are boring and the 'choices' one can make add very little. The Aliens really are in a similar vein to barbarians, and not really interesting.\n\nCombat is very similar to Civ V. The AI is good, but not better than Gods & Kings. The tech trees are odd, and while fun to read through, not that fun in an actual game. While offering choice, the game is actually even more linear in nature than previous Civ titles.\n\nMy secondary complaint is the game isn't fun at a macro level. The goals are odd. The faction choices bizarre. The Miasma and environment issues are actually more tedious than enjoyable.\n\nThe design appears to be a mailed in rushed additional expansion labeled as a new game.\n\nIf you don't have Civ V, I'd suggest you nab it. With all the expansions it's a far more satisfying and fun experience. If you have Civ V with the expansions, then there's really no need to buy this game. You already have the exact same graphics gameplay, and a deeper and more fun experience available without needing to spend 50 bucks.\n\nBig thumbs down.","November 2, 2014","false","24.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Wait for a sale, wait for possible DLC or expansions.\n\nThere's simply not enough content, not enough diversity, to keep me engaged. Without a wider variety of content, most games feel the same, and aside from the early turns, each progresses in the same way. The sponsors (civilizations) differ from one another in only the most minimal way, and other pre-game choices are just as drab. Some of the hype surrounding Beyond Earth touted the number of different ways you could set up your nation before the start of the match, but in practice these choices only have a minimal effect, and one that fades into near-meaninglessness.\n\nThis trend, of blandness and shallow choices, permeates the entire game. The list of veterancy promotions for units has been gutted to two: an instant heal and a minor power increase, which is a very boring let down. Wonders offer resource bonuses much like regular buildings, lacking the character and unique abilities seen in the Civilization games, and without the beautiful art and fanfare we used to get. Speaking of fanfare, the victory and defeat screens are also minimalist, and don't offer you any post-game information or statistics. Instead, you are offered the choice of quitting to the main menu or (if victorious) continueing to play. That's extremely anti-climatic. Even Alpha Centauri, if memory serves, offered a turn-by turn territory map so you could watch how the various civilizations grew and shrank.\n\nThe tech tree's organization, an interesting departure from tradition, suffers because the icons displayed lack adequate differentiation in shape or colour. Not only does this make the tech screen somewhat ugly, it also leads to needless tech-by-tech searching to find out which technology unlocks the specific unit, building, wonder, or ability you are looking for. That's information you should be able to find at a glance.\n\nMap presets and custom options are both sparse, and even with the preorder DLC they pale in comparison to previous games. You are unlikely to be presented with any novel maps, which is a shame, especially with the new map features (canyons, miasma) that could be used to really spice things up.\n\nThe list of available units is slim. Yes, you are presented with options to customize them based on your chosen psuedo-ideology,  but far too many of these choices are dry percentage increases, and they don't alleviate the damning lack of variety. You get one air unit, two navel units, and a scant handful of melee and ranged land units.\n\nQuests are a neat new addition, but again the interesting aspects are mired down by the majority of "quests" prompting you to choose between one of two options.\n\nThe trade system, while manditory, is boring and cannot be automated, meaning that by late-game, you're reassigning one or more trade units to its route almost every turn. By late game, on a larger map, you're spending too much time micro-managing trade routes, the interface for which has NO meaningful filtration options, nor does it adequately highlight the route the unit was previously assigned to.\n\nAnd there is one things that really really gets me, despite being a seemingly trivial issue: there is either a hidden "Time" victory condition or a bug with disabling the Max Turns option, meaning that games end for me after a set number of turns, with victory going to the player currently leading. That's the absolute least satisfying way to win a match, and an extremely frustrating sucker-punch of a loss. The first time it happenedto me, I was dumbstruck. I didn't know it would occur, and it made me feel like the hours I had sunk into that game were meaningless, wasted. And that was a match I "won."\n\nIn the end, what is new in Beyond Earth fails to make up for in what has been removed, in either depth or width, and it is disconcerting that the game fails to match the content of Alpha Centauri. There is simply too much missing (great people, the religion system, veterency upgrades, wonders/civilizations/units/maps that look, feel, and play uniquely, and satisfying victories). Consider this along side the overall lack of character (bland... everything) and annoying interface (tech tree, trade routes--Both of which are addressed in various mods, which tells you something), and the game just feels rushed.\n\nI hope we see some heavy content additions, which I believe can salvage the game and give us a reason to come back to it. Until then, wait for a significant price-drop.","November 3, 2014","false","25.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I really, really tried. Why can't I like this? Why, after almost 350 hours in Civ 5, does more of the same not appeal to me?\n\n1. 1 unit per tile. Hooboy. Big design choice for Civ 5, making its return in BE. Annoying at times in C5. Damned near impossible to work with in BE. The maps are smaller, which does nothing to help the system. Unit clutter is extreme with the addition of canyons and the tight maps (even on the largest shuffling around 4 units can be a major pain). The AI is still clueless as to how this system works. C5 has been out for 4 years. 4. Years. During that time Firaxis has yet to figure out how to make the AI understand one of the most important core gameplay elements. It bogs down the game until warfare just becomes a flat out tedium and not worth the trouble.\n\n2. Smaller maps. In addition to the issues with 1UPT, the maps just aren't as impressive. Expect to be jostling sooner, over more worthless terrain, with the same blundering AI that feeds units piecemeal into the grinder. The epic scale has gone. In a game like this, epic is what it should all be about.\n\n3. Unit design choices. This is a mixed bag, more on that later. But the...I want to say lack of forward thinking on the way units branch is frustrating as all get out most of the time. I'll take a specific example here, but it's by no means my only gripe. The supremacy branch gets a unique siege unit. Said unique siege unit has 3 range but is very slow. It needs to set up to fire. Ok, that's fine...so why does it not have the ability to perform indirect fire? Why is that not one of the upgrades for the unit? It's supposed to be one of the most powerful artillery platforms on the planet but it can't call in strikes on a unit on the other side of a forest?\n\n4. The stripping away of information that was previously available in C5. Example: Trade routes still function pretty much the same in BE, with the exception of internal trade, which is no longer just shipping one resource (production or food) one way. Cool. So why did they remove the tool tip that demonstrates why the values are what they are and what is going in each direction? Why does the base game lack information on what a city just finished producing (something firaxis has promised to fix, but there's already a mod out for)? The loss of the strategic map, the giant charlie foxtrot that is the city screen, the lack of a simple turns til gain counter for science and culture...why? Was it slowing gameplay down that much?\n\n5. The AI itself. ICS is back in full force. The AI is just as bad as ever, except the options to deal with them have been limited even more (I'll get into that later). Forcing colonies 3 tiles away from each other does nothing to stop the AI from spamming as many of them as they can, with no rhyme or reason, no particular emphasis on strategic resources or valuable terrain. Now that more cities actively slows research acquisition, it would be nice if the AI was designed to plan intelligently. The handling of promotions, of which there are now only one type (permanent bonus to strength) is ALWAYS delegated to the immediate +50 hp if an AI unit has taken any damage.\n\n6. Diplomacy. Still as bad as ever. Remember that bit about less information? Here's an example again: One AI decided it didn't like a trade outpost next to my capital. I, having been trading with said outpost for quite some time, was surprised and upset to see a swarm of units come in and start attacking it (one at a time mind you). I went into the diplomacy screen to see if there was an option to tell said AI to leave the outpost alone. Nope. No ability to say "I like this place and if you continue to attack it I will stop you." The AI was no doubt surprised when I declared war, simply to protect a resource I was actively using. Oh it gets better. After butchering their expidition, the AI promptly offered me peace and one of their colonies. I hadn't even gotten a unit close that colony. I had no intention of even attacking any of their colonies. They just gave it to me.\n\nLater in the same game another AI declared war on me without warning. This I don't mind. It's a nice surprise to finally see them take some intiative...and 1UPT combined with the small map and rubbish terrain meant their army never even attacked my colony before they got massacred. Again, almost an immediate peace offer including one of their colonies. Not a piddling 2 or 3 pop either, a full developed colony. In a war they were the aggressor in. While my army was tied up on the other side of the continent and in position to retaliate, and my reserves were doing nothing but taking defensive positions.\n\nBut it's not just those kind of issues that are so annoying about the diplomacy. It's the sheer inanity of it all. The constant jibes, denunciations, veiled threats, stupid trade offers...It breaks immersion to have to stop every other freaking turn and click through yet another snub or 1 favor for extremely rare strategic resources exchange.\n\nBest way to improve diplomacy in BE? Look at Alpha Centauri (only comparison I will draw to that game in this review, I promise). Give us the option to IGNORE the AI. Not only did we have the option to ignore them, they had the option to ignore us. With the diplomacy system as rubbish as it is, this would be the best way to improve it. Simply turn it off.\n\n7. The lackluster victories. A text box. A small image. Never have so many turns and expectations gone into getting so little. Again, this game should be epic. It should not end in a text box. It should not give just the option to keep going or go back to menu. Others have complained about this in relation to C5. What happened to scores and rankings and demographics and all the other stuff that could be so cool to look at once a game was finished? Why can't I see the entire map once it's over?\n\n8. The sheer damned grind of it all. Three victories. 22 hours. If it didn't take up to a minute to process AI turns, if everything wasn't so bogged down and slow, halve that time. This game isn't engaging beyond the first 100 turns. It simply isn't. Micromanaging the same trade route over and over again. Constructing the same structures over and over again. Waiting for a wonder to be built to provide some trivial bonus and making me wonder if it was worth it. Either automating workers (which is still just as bad as C5) or micromanging them. Carefully moving units each turn so they don't get destroyed walking through miasma rather than avoiding it. Clicking next turn again, and again, and again, waiting for the victory condition to set in, all the while dealing with moronic AI, a bog down of units, a lack of information, and what basically amounts to accounting.\n\nIt simply isn't fun. It's tedium. That's all it is. Tedium. And it didn't take long for it leave a bad taste in my mouth, especially coupled with the fact that they released the game with some pretty serious bugs that should have been squashed during development.\n\nWould I buy this game again? Not as it is. Not at full price. Hopefully they'll be able to make it more interesting with expansions, but so much of what was done to make C5 enjoyable (it was pretty bad too at release) is gone. It's a backslide.\n\nThat being said, there are a couple of positives and things I feel well done. Not going as in depth with these.\n\n1. The unit upgrade system. Seriously. This is a cool feature. Not real well implemented in terms of upgrade choice, but cool.\n\n2. Virtues. I really like what they did with culture. The synergies and bonuses for stacking is a neat idea, and while providing nice bonuses isn't game breaking to a huge extent (except that one virtue that gives +.2 health/building, THAT's game breaking as hell).\n\n3.

The virtue tree is neat.  The unit upgrading system is fun, yet inconsistent (if you don't select an upgrade because you're looking to take a different upgrade path, your unit will still cost more, but have no benefit from the increased cost).  City managers for automated improvement building are gone.  Just finding the building queue and where to set your specialists is beyond poorly designed.  Actually, the city screen as a whole has taken a huge step backward from Civ 4.  Workers have no command to build a road network of their own, aside from the most basic route-to command.  Dozens of times, I have had to reapply the go-to command to my units.  Practically zero explorable objects on a large map.  Trade routes become quite annoying as your empire grows, as you have to re-apply the trade routes every 30 turns.\n\nOh, and the game is occasionally unwinnable.  The game bugged out when we dominated the opponent.  Team 2 was removed, but no victory was given.  We even went and finished a second victory condition, but that simply made my game crash.  I was unable to rejoin the game, as it won't allow you to join a game where there is only one team.","January 19, 2015","false","20.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Beyond Earth even goes - well - beyond Civ 5 by adding the orbital layer, covert ops, quests, excavations and the affinity system.\n\nUnfortunately (based on my limited trial run) the affinity system feels like a slog and doesn't even come close to replacing the custom unit system of it's inspiration. The rest of the disappointment can be filed under the one thing that Beyond Earth absolutely nailed from Alpha Centauri: The terrible UI. Obviously 15 years are not enough to fix that. The trade route system is annoying busywork, the help system is even worse that in SMAC but the most brain-dead design decision must have been to blur out the most essential stats every time you enter a management window.\n\nFiraxis could salvage this game with nothing but some UI-teaks (coincidentally exactly the same thing that SMAC would have required for a re-release).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandalwoodrabbit/recommended/65980/","sandalwoodrabbit","Sandalwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandalwoodrabbit/","132 products in account","I was skeptical of Beyond Earth at first.  The hype was that it would be the long-awaited revival of the brilliant cult classic, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.  After what I'd heard about Beyond Earth mechanics, it sounded like the defining characteristics of the game had been passed over.  Social Engineering and Prototyping are nowhere to be found, shaping the very continents through terraforming and sea bases are missing.\n\nBut now, with a few additional playthroughs behind me, my perspective has changed.  Do NOT look at Beyond Earth as an Alpha Centauri remake.  Treat it as a stand-alone project.\n\nI have heard this title described as 'Civ 5 in space' and I feel like it's a mildly misguided assessment.  The elements that tie Beyond Earth to Civilization V are simply the baseline elements that make a Civilization game.  As a veteran of Civilization games since 1991, I can confidently say that Beyond Earth stands as much apart from other releases as any other and you'll enjoy learning the new technology trees, units, buildings, and virtues (similar to the previous game's Social Policies) and bending them to your advantage.\n\nFor new players to Sid Meier games, this is a fun 4X title that may overwhelm you with choices at first, but in time you'll come to appreciate them and use them to your benefit.  The visual and audio aesthetics of the game are pleasant and smooth, lending a great deal to the atmosphere, though I would say the faction leaders could use more development and variety.\n\nFor loyal Civilization fanatics, you may find the new mechanics (especially the technology) fractured and far more open than previous games, but it will become a benefit as you learn your way around the trees.  Variety and freedom of optimisation are the name of the game.\n\nTo summarise, it's a fantastic game and money well spent.  Where Civilization V crash-landed with severe multiplayer issues and coarse gameplay, Beyond Earth arrives with a relatively smooth landing.  There are no gamebreaking bugs.  Across some fifty hours of gameplay, I have had one crash and it did not repeat.  I look forward to the release of expansions sometime in the next year, with any luck, and what they will add to an already well-rounded title.\n\nThat said, please remake Alpha Centuari for us, changing as few elements as possible.  We beg you.","January 23, 2015","true","150.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

The business goal of money, money, and more money with rushed development just doesn’t work in the gaming industry without taking a hit.\n\nI extended game play by building up to understand the tech tree and learn the strategy. I tried a standard sized default map and set it up to only be won by domination. I could not complete this game I set up because of a tech tree game defect, but here is what I did see before I gave up.\n\n1. When you conquer all cities of a player, they are still in the game! They show on the score board (mini option window), they have roaming units, they interact with your leader and are still able denounce you, and they can conduct spy missions (I caught one)!\n\n2. Key resources for the 3 possible paths is not balanced if you choose to focus on only one. I was only able to build at most 3 Supremacy titan units with little remaining resources for much else (some buildings require them). I eventually equaled in Harmony and  I was able to build about 10 titan harmony units with plenty of resources left over. There is an obvious advantage for Harmony.\n\n3. <CRITICAL> The tech tree cannot be fully researched. I was only able to continue my game until I had to pick the last research item and the game locked on its selection screen. I was unable to tab out or focus on a Task Manager screen to kill the game. It kept throwing me back to Beyond Earth. Definitely not ready there.\n\n4. The tech tree is not a good game design because it’s not large enough with the idea that a player should focus on one of 3 main paths. This should have been thought out more and presentation was difficult to see in a quick overview. The zoom in and out feature should just be removed if it cant be done correctly. This should have been wiped and redone in presentation.\n\n5. You can only reach a max of 18 in one of the paths, but there is no reason not to be able to go higher. I was even able to select a greyed out option to increase beyond 18 (took the point away and gave me nothing). There should be no reason to stop it in presentation even if it doesn’t affect game play. I felt cheated out of a point even if it had no value.\n\n6. The initial options to set up a game with bonuses advantages is a great idea over the set advantages in Civilization 5, but it fails to present the initial racial titles even though it is obvious during the game the origins exist when speaking different languages that follow a Civilization 5 format. A simple presentation flaw that doesn’t match achievements either.\n\n7. The AI should be guided by victory conditions, but it became obvious that with only domination allowed, none of the computer teams were trying to achieve it. It felt like this basic direction for AI was completely ignored instead of being the main direction for goals of winning. Where is the challenge?\n\nThis is what I saw over the 31 hours I played. Some of these will eventually be fixed, but the game just is not ready for release, so if you are considering buying it, wait.  I am sure there are many other defects, but the game should not lock your computer through poor game design. Join the side that demands better quality from their products.\n\nFor game concept I would give this 4 out of 5 stars, it could be so much more than it is and has great potential.\n\nFor readiness 2, only because it was from a stable Civilization 5 engine - but they didn’t finish testing.\n","November 3, 2014","false","52.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I really dont get why so many bad reviews, this game definitely doesnt deserve it. Below I will point some pros and cons of the game and stuff that i would like to see on future dlcs/expansions:\n\n--> Pros:\n\n- The new aliens are a nice challenge on the early game, especially Siege Worms because you never know how they will react.\n- The new Affinity System is great, it gives players an option on how to devote their colony, so do you want your colony to remain pure and follow Old Earth ideologies? Or maybe make cybernetic enhancements on your people and spread chaos and havoc with robotic armies? Or maybe be one with your new planet and domesticate and integrate the alien lifeforms for your own purposes? Well, its your call!\n- The new map exploration is awesome, with your explorer units you search for Supply Pods which will give you small yields of Science, Culture or Energy and even a free Solar Collector or you can reveal the secrets of Ancient Ruins that will give you boosts on researches or the option for an affinity level or even investigate a crashed space ship which could countain the logs of a failed colonization mission giving you acess to new quests.\n- The new quest system is very interesting and offers the players many challenges across your games, the quests are generated based on how you are playing the game. Example: Spotting a Siege Worm will activate a quest that involves killing it and the reward will surely pay the effort, or making a trade route with a independent Station may trigger another Station to give you a quest to destroy their rival Station and as a reward they will give you a boost on the yields they provide. There are also quests that involves affinity levels and they will help you to develop you colony based on your actions during those quests.\n- The new orbital units are a great new feature, it allows you to deploy from Solar Collectors to boost the energy generation of your city to satellites armed with giant lasers that you can use both for defend or attack.\n\n--> Cons\n\n- There are very few sponsors (only 8) so there isnt much diversity on the games, at least they can pick different affinities.\n- The combat on Civilization Beyond Earth surely need some balancing, cities are much more powerful now and if you want to play Space Atilla early game it will be kinda hard since most units will be melted by the cities defense on the early game so you need to spend a lot of time on making very large armies if you want to conquer cities early on, however later on that is not a problem because the units at around 12 Affinity Level are already very powerful and it takes less than 5 turns if you are well positioned to conquer a capital, based on this the game pratically forces you to go for a domination victory on the late game where everyone else is at around 50%-75% on another victory type.\n- Trade routes are waaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered, every city can set 2 trade routes and if you get an auto plant you can get another one so basically its 3 trade routes per city. In my opinion a good number would be a max of 4 Trade Routes per Civilization and you can improve that to maybe 6 or 7 by making wonders, affinity bonus or quest reward.\n- The wonders on this game provides very weak bonuses, so most times you dont even bother making them because the bonus they grant you aint that great. The ones i usually make are the Ectogenesis Pod and the Gene Vault mainly to aid the city growth on the early game.\n- All the units are of the same color, ok you can see the colored icon but it would be nice if the units had your sponsor color.\n- Only 2 naval units, there is a ranged cruiser and a carrier, it would be nice if we could build submarines or a melee naval unit to conquer coastal city using only naval force.\n- The User Interface is confusing since everything is pretty much of the same color, seeing what is your city producing, on how many turns it will grow or how many turns to finish that beautiful wonder is very confusing and hard to see because everything including the small numbers are of the same color of your sponsor but im sure that can be polished.\n- The tech tree is nice and gives you freedom to focus on what you want, but it takes some time to get used to it and know what leads to what or what you need to reveal or improve the resources.\n- Covert Ops are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpowered.\n\n--> What I would like to see on the future\n\n- A religion system that could work with your choosen affinity\n- More military units, especially naval ones\n- More sponsors, i think a number of 16-20 sponsors would give a good diversity to the game\n- Sponsors should have unique units/buildings. For example the PAC could have a special worker unit that improves tiles a lot faster and have +1 movement since they are focused on production or the ARC could build a special Spying Agency or another build which improves the spying activity.\n- Different alien types, it would be badass if there were different types of aliens based on the map type or something like that, that would add diversity to the game.\n- Improved military AI, sometimes the AI takes some very dumb decisions when you are at war with them.\n\nWell, thats my review for Civilization Beyond Earth, Im really enjoying the game and i believe that this game just need some polishing and im sure that with the future dlcs/expansions it will become even better than it already is.\n\n","November 17, 2014","true","102.7"," 62 of 118 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","62","118","0","0"

Civ V with the expansions has more options regarding things like the world congress and tourism. Civ V obviously also has a broader scope if you consider the techologies and stuff available in each age.\n\nThe reason I recommend it however is that I find the pacing in Beyond Earth to be a bit faster and more dynamic. Things start to get interesting a lot a quicker. The early stages of Civ V can be a bit boring. The music is really top notch as well and the graphics are good. The wars can feel pretty dramatic.\n\nIt fall short of the greatness of it's spiritual forefather, Alpha Centauri however, which was arguably better than it's counterpart, Civ II. Beyond Earth is certainly not better than Civ 5.\n\nYet if you are a Civ fan looking for an alternate challenge/scenario, or new to this genre I recommend it as it's very easy to pick up and play. The faster pace does make campaigns quite interesting and if you are new to the genre and like sci-fi I would recommend. Especially if on a promotion!

Although it requires a bit of unit diversity, even with the upgrades, you'd still miss the custom unit creation that was available in Alpha Centauri. Factions are diverse but not too distinct from each other, which makes them somewhat easier to get used to quickly. Gameplay and turn times are much smoother than in Civ 5, especially in later phases of the game in a very large map you'd feel the difference of ai completing their turns much quicker.\n\nAs i read the comments i see people who haven't played Alpha Centauri but fans of Civ series are a bit confused and calling this an expansion pack of sorts. It simply isn't. Just take it as exploring, or rather migrating to an alien planet because earth is no more habitable and imagine all that 'future tech' in Civ games are new set of techs in here. Sure it takes time to get used to but it doesn't prevent it being so much fun.\n\nIt will become a legendary successor when they add more factions, a little more unit diversity and some other dlc add ons but it's still a must buy right off the bat for any Civ or Alpha Centauri fan.","October 24, 2014","true","105.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabdilla/recommended/65980/","jabdilla","Startled Penguin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabdilla/","199 products in account","I got this game out of the Humble Bundle and it ended up in my backlog.  I played through a few maps on Quick, with medium difficulty.  This is a review out of that, coming in March 2016, with a map pack of DLC but not the expansion pack DLC.\n\nThe "Not Recommended" is on this game as the thought that it is a $30 separate release.  You can usually get Civilization 5, Gods and Kings and Brave New World for that on sale.  Spend your money on that.\n\nValue:  I normally don't put a value review in my reviews, but this game needs an exception.  It's simply not worth what has been asked of it.  It's a total conversion DLC that was sold as a separate game.  It's not a full game, it's a reskin of the Civ 5 engine that was already 3 years old when this game came to market in 2014.  In 2016, it's simply tired.  It's not worth $30.  It's probably worth $15.  The price should adjust accordingly, because it is tactically stale at this point, and I have less than 30 hours in the Civ 5 franchise (Civ 5, BNW and BE aggregated).\n\n\nPlot and Mechanics: 6/10.  You play a nation of colonists freshly landed on an alien world, who must survive through turn based strategy to a number of varying victories.  Unlike Civ5, the goal here isn't military, it's resource management and city-simulation.  You'll need a military, but it is not the best way to win in my experience on PvAI.  As a result, the games feel overly long, because there are long periods of downtime where you're not doing anything.  The plot is absent.  There's literally nothing. The leaders don't have personalities, the planet doesn't have a history, the aliens are basically background pageantry.  I'm getting angry with how little was realized out of this while writing my review.  Let's move on.\n\nGraphics: 8/10.  This game looks amazing, and some of the community mods make it look utterly stunning.  I'm giving half credit to the map texturing to the devs, because the textures were their doing.  The sandy planets, volcanic fissures, oceans, stations, aliens and soldiers all look freaking cool.  I love the motif and the design decisions to differentiate the human colonists based on their colonial decisions rather than their heritages.  With that said, there are so many UI problems and readibility problems on the map that I turned to the community to resolve some of them.  These are easily resolved issues that could have been fixed at any point in the last two years of this game, but it's still really hard to tell which tiles are unhealthy, which units are in a hex and who owns them.  I had to look up online how to access my trade and diplomacy maps because the information isn't adequately presented on one screen (like Civ5's diplo bar).  The information interface is a chore, but the quality here is very good even if the usability and presentation is lacking.\n\nSound: 6/10.  The backing tracks are really enjoyable, and addicting.  I found myself thumping my head along with the ambience music a few times.  The leader vocals are horrible, however, to the point of being an absolute chore to listen to in the game.  I am fairly certain a university acting troupe could outperform this script.  It's dreadful and drags the entire immersion of the game down.   Unit sounds are bloody amazing, however.  The action sounds of Marines, CNDRs and even the Siege worm sound epic and crisp.  It's clear Firaxis put a lot of work into this part of the game and it shows.\n\nGameplay: 7/10.  I'm going to make a few specific ratings, because this review is a comparison setting BNW Civ5 at 10/10.  I'm going to justify to you why this game is seven-tenths as good as Civ5.\n\nThe Tech Web (Good):  The tech web, which is an utterly unreadable mess of organizational progress, replaces the Tech Tree from Civ 5.  It's a good change.  Yes.  A good change.  The progression is much less linear and it fits the motif of this being a post-human civilization made by humans.  Every game I've had plays really differently, and there aren't the obvious power spikes of Civ 5.  That's a really enjoyable change to the game that was an excellent decision, even if it takes getting used to.\n\nVictory Conditions (Bad):  The victory conditions being largely non-military really makes the game lag between turn 100-250.  You might have a military, but it's hard to use it, and you won't want to, owing to the amount that all of the AIs will absolutely hate you.  Most of the AIs do a peaceful route, and I haven't once been attacked in two separate 300 turn games.  That's not Civ, that's Sim City.  So what replaced Domination victories?  There are 5 separate thematic victories that encourage you to do things like terraform the world, or reconnect with Old Earth.  They're thematically cool but really randomly granted.  If anyone ever played the Dune Total Conversion mod for Civ 4, they feel just ripped from that mod.  Once again, it feels like these are DLC add-ons to a Civ5 that should have provided non-military wins to a military game, but instead we got a new environment that places non-military wins in a non-interactive game.\n\nAlien AI (Good):  The aliens really behave like a huge powerful faction.  They are neutral towards those that don't bother them and are vicious to those who seek and destroy them.  It's a nice change from Barbarians.\n\nEarly Game (Disastrous):  There is no early game.  None.  You can't rush anything and swarm an opponent.  It's too had to get good production going and too hard to pressure anyone with how utterly crippling health values are.  The bonuses from Virtues is too strong to not go for early culture, and as a result you wind up with a very insular and passive early game.  This isn't unenjoyable, but it's a disasterous change from Civ 5, because it's just not fun in this game to do these things.  Exploration of the map doesn't feel as tactical as it did in Civ 5.  You're not looking for early military experience to fuel a great person, because you don't get awarded great people.  Wonders are basically non-existent, so there's not really any goals to work toward if you aren't being a warmonger.  It ends up really ruining this game after the first few times you play it.\n\nQuests (Mixed):  The idea of quests is super cool.  You have these quests that let you mold your civ after every time you build a new building for the first time.  That's the not-cool part.  Each building has a corresponding quest that will fire the same every single game.  It's repetitive customization.  It would be nice to see more dynamic events that have a mean-time-to-happen implementation instead of triggered events from the construction of buildings.  It doesn't seem like you're really doing anything with these quests, just that they're some form of gameplay for the early game.\n\nReplayability; 5/10.  I have no interest in playing this game multiplayer.  It's an unbalanced mess of a game that I imagine would be really really frustrating playing against another human being.  Hell, it's kind of frustrating playing this game against an AI.  The question of building wide vs building tall, building economy vs building military, building culture vs building science ... have all been ruined.  The economy of tiles is a mess in this game, and resource starts and location typically dictate if this game is even playable.  There is no story to complete, and I feel like you can see everything this motif has to offer in maybe 5 games.  While there is some replay added by Affinity specializations, this ultimately falls short of the rich environments and synergistic gameplay that Civ5 offers.\n\nVerdict: 5/10.  This is an ultmately forgettable title from a developer that has made some really wonderful and enjoyable games throughout the years.  What's frustrating about Civilization: Beyond Earth is the abundant potential teeming everywhere in the game.  This could have absolutely been an excellent title.  However, any brilliance shown is short-lived.","March 23","false","5.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It is difficult to tell what type of terrain tiles are without mousing over it and the tech tree is so confusing and hard to memorize what everything is on it as things are not color coded well as to where I knew what everything was that is unlocked in the tech tree in Civ V like what building that is for example, and if you play with the AI's you will find that the AI avatars are very bland in this civ and lack any personality when compared to the colorful leaders of civ V. So like I said at this state I would not recommend buying CIV Beyond Earth, I recommend waiting for bugs and issues to be fixed and for DLC to be released which will most likely improve the overall gameplay.","November 16, 2014","false","25.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

There is only a small definite amount of units to choose from. None that are unique, no upgrades that are unique.  I understood the favor system in trade. but favors are treated like a commodity in this game, you trade it just like you would a resource. Which is terrible idea.

I think the main issue is that people compare it to Civ V gold edition with all of it's DLC. I will admit that it's definitely not as replayable as Civ V at the moment, but I feel that when the Rising Tides DLC comes out it will give the game some new aspects that will make it more favorable.\nEDIT: 10/31/15\nRising tides did make the game more replayable and added some new aspects. However it also screwed up the diplomacy system (which was then updated not too long after). Overall it was a nice improvment with the aquatic cities, hybrid units, and emphasis on exploration.

I've been playing Civ since I can remember, it's where I learned probably <70% of my world history, and I'm 20 years old. I've been playing since Civ 2, and I can actually remember Test of Time coming out. I should love basically anything Civ. But for several reasons, I feel completely let down.\n\n1. Several game crashes. I was prepared for this, lock ups happen and I set autosave to every other turn just because of this.\n\n2. The aesthetic is just terrible. It's a bland mix of greens and browns even with graphics maxed, you can't see units in cities at all and it's incredibly annoying to try to figure out what miasma is, and as a strategy game, losing 10% of your units HP can be a game losing mistake.\n\n3. The tutorial SUCKS. Like, big time. I've played 14 hours and I still have absolutely no idea how I'm supposed to progress through the affinities. It seems like it's just random quests + using the gaudy tech web, which takes a lot of my agency away.\n\n4. The tech web is interesting, but it's unbelievably confusing. There are so many options and halfway into the game you've got 18 options and none of them are a clearly useful tech. The constraint of being linear in the previous Civ tech trees added elegance to them, this time the freedom has made tech wildly unfun. I could very easily see what my path was going to be in other Civ games, and lining up timings with other facets of the game was not just fun, but it was exactly why I played those games.\n\n5. Combat unit upgrades might as well be random. They tie into the affinity system that is already murky with no explanation. Your affinity level translates directly into how strong your combat units are. This means that if you keep getting quests that require end game techs or to destroy Alien Nests when there are none near you, you lose to your opponent who ramps up 5 affinity tiers ahead of you and busts into your base. More lack of agency.\n\n6. UI falterings in hotseat. I wanted to show my friend this game because I was excited about it, but after 5 turns or so the graphics started disappearing, like the prompt that your city needs a new production. Some of the prompts also don't show up in single player as well, like city growth. Not being aware of what's going on in the game can be really taxing, the reason that Civ V had so many prompts was to free up the player's mental resources and make it more about the strategy and less about the memorization.\n\nThere are a few more smaller problems, but all of these are core issues with the game. Look elsewhere for your 4X gaming for now, it will be a LOT of work to make this an enjoyable game for me.\n\nEdit #1 After playing another game, I ran into affinities being rewarded through excavations, another random element which the player has little control over, I got 4 affinity upgrades and destroyed my opponents because I had a massive unit upgrade advantage.\n\nEdit #2 After another couple of games, I've actually come to realize that the choices you make as a player don't really matter against the AI. So, if you're only wanting to experience an easy game in single player, go for it. There is a turning point at which you're just always ahead of the AI. Which is okay I suppose, if it weren't for screwy multiplayer.\n\nAnyway, if you want to play single player alone, you'll get about 30-40 hours before you feel like you've done mostly everything.","October 25, 2014","false","69.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

I completely understand some issues are bound to be in the release version of the game.  What I am mystified about is the sheer number of obvious game play breaking bugs that were in the initial release.  And when I mean obvious I mean glaring in your face omissions.\nI have to wonder what the internal testers were up to?  If core mechanics are barely functioning then maybe you should have just disappointed the community with a pushed back release instead of dumping a half finished game on us.\nSadly this game feels half finished.  The lack of even the most basic ending sequence was a major let down.  Want to see some stats on what you did? Too damn bad.  Expecting some neat cut scenes for world wonders?  Too damn bad.\nThe tech web was a let down as well.  In the end you have virtually cleared the whole thing anyway.  They only real choices you are making are within the leaves that concern the affinity system.  So the hype of "choose your own path" was complete hogwash.\nAnother let down were the actual units.  I get the affinity system changes the looks and abilities somewhat of the units.  It just seems very sterile.  Very few options for units.   I guess I was simply spoiled on older Civ games with a much wider selection of units.\nIn the end I can't say I am satisfied with my purchase.  I have hopes some patches will fix some of the ciritical problems.  So if your planning on buying I would wait a few months until the dust settles and pick this up on sale.","October 27, 2014","false","18.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

I was just hoping for so much more.\n\nFor the most part, this is a Civ 5 reskin on another planet. The research tree has been converted to a research web, starting in the middle and spreading out in a direction you are interested in. While this has been done before in other games, it's still a pretty neat mechanic that I personally enjoy over the traditional tree. There exists a Health System to limit the expansion of your Civilizations which provides you with buffs or debuffs if you haven't expanded in a while or if you have committed to the appropriate research topics. I found this seemed to hinder me more often than it helped me when I focused on a conquest campaign but on a research intensive run it seemed to aid me. Re-tasking trade convoys becomes a tedious chore in the mid to late game that leaves you quite thankful that there isn't a 'corner the market' economic victory\n\nA questing system has been added to this version of Civilization. While they do add flavor to this bland drink of a game, their only true purpose is to add affinity points to one direction or another. Please make no mistake, the tales the quests themselves weave and the rewards you receive for them are interesting, but in the long run they do little to affect your game.\n\nI found that the various endgames leave your victories quite hollow and vague. Each endgame I experienced felt like they were the prologue of some other work of science fiction rather than an end to the one I was playing. Perhaps the developers wanted the end to feel open, or were leaving room for sequels/expansions/dlc/etc. I managed to get to three of these endings before I lost the desire to replay to game to see others. Truthfully it feels like someone walked into the developers studio one day and said 'Times up. Ship it as is."\n\nI cannot recommend this game. But the reason I can't recommend this game is a terrible one: nostalgia. At some point, this was tagged as a 'spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.' Alpha Centauri was one of my all time favorite turn based, civilization style games. This game is *sort of* like Alpha Centauri in that it is also a civilization style game that takes place on an other planet. But this is where those similarities end.\n\nI'm sure there are other who will enjoy this game. I just don't.","June 14, 2015","false","131.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Of course Civ 5 got two great expansino packs and became a great game awhile after its release. I have had les issues on relase than I did Civ 5 and I am enjoying it slightly more than Civilization 5 during it's launch.\n\nSome nice new additions and features, the game looks good and of course it is a joy to play. I also find it more challenging than the last two Civilization games which is a nice bonus. Addicting gameplay is just the start with this new civilization, as there are many well crafted aspects to this game.\n\nOf course it can get better and if Brave new world was any indiction this will only get better with time. But what's hear to start is very enjoyable and a wonderful civilization game in its own right. Love Civilization? Jump in and enjoy the ride, as a veteran of the series since Civ 1, this is my favorite Civ game on release since Civilization 3!\n\nMy only big issue so far is the UI, it could be alot better and leaves alot to be desired. Ill go as far as saying the UI is atrocious and it definatly the games biggest issue. Hopefully with future expansion packs this can be improved. Other than that, the AI could be better and late game can lad a tad, but these are pretty small issues compared to all the good things this game does.\n\nIf I had to give it a score I would give it a 8 or 8.5/10, that could move up to a 9 or higher if the expansion packs in the future are well done. In the end this is a great "base" to build onto, it is fun as is but has room to improve forsure.","October 26, 2014","true","20.2"," 47 of 89 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","47","89","0","5"

There is barely anything new to see in Beyond Earth, even though it's supposed to be an hostile alien world it ends up being less hostile and less alien than our very own Earth.\n\nThe civilizations of Beyond Earth are also plain, there are only a few small statistic changes between them.

All alien resources are just normal resources in Civilization with sci-fier names, all alien tiles are literally the same functionally but just have a different visuals to them. Sadly even the visuals of the alien terrains are a bit bad, there are barely any variation (like visual difference between desert and plains, or tundra and grasslands) and everything is similar shades and covers. Mushrooms are alien, right? Lets put mushrooms everywhere. Purple is alien too? Yup, lets shade everything with it. Obviously every terrain type has their own textures, but the contrast between visuals of area is very very low.\n\nHappiness has been removed and replaced with health (it works the same, except your citizens don't get super healthy when they get ecstatic :D).

I still love the one unit per tile strategy system but I would prefer to play Pandora with the expansions more.  There are more systems in Pandora than what Beyond Earth currently offers.  I am not a fan of the instant spy network and leveling up intrigue to cast huge capital decimating powers.  Feels there is little risk to just pumping this up.  There are really 3 different paths to take and to level up your military you should be pumping into an affinity to get more powerful units.  So instead of going for a specific research, any research with that affinity or quest will get you more powerful units - assuming you unlocked the basic version of course.  So to get the most bang for your buck, you can get a social/economical research upgrade and later on grab an affinity with it to boost military as well.\n\nOverall I would not recommend this game in it's current state but that is about how I feel with every Civ game that first comes out.

However as the game is likely to recieve expansions and dlcs that will take it from a great game to a fantastic game it may be worth waiting for a sale before buying. My review will mostly be comparisons to Civilization 5. With this in mind here are my thoughts:\n\nInterface;\nThe interface design on the game is tightened up a bit on the main screen. Its a bit more sleek. However as a result some information is a bit small and hard to find at first as a result. Very functional and works just like Civ 5 for the most part. The biggest interface complaint is the Tech Web. The mostly blue and white coloring along with the almost unnoticeable difference between wonders and buildings on it makes it a chore to look at and sort through. Fortunately mods are already coming along to fix this so its not as big an issue as it might otherwise be.\n\nAI:\nA little better but the same as always. The game explains why the AI hates or loves you though so their reasoning is a bit more transparent. Unfortunately the AI is as dumb as always and having played on Gemini difficulty mostly they seem to barely present a challenge to an experienced player. As usual it seems like the main thing that keeps AI players afloat is the massive amount of cheating they do but in this game it seems like they don't do quite as much of it. The staggered spawning doesn't really matter because the AI returns to parity quite quickly. All in all its the same as its always been with the AI in Civilization. I  personally find the AI to be the weakest part of this game just like in Civilization 5.\n\nCivilizations:\nWhat has been lost in variety from Civilization 5 has been made up for by balance and customizability. Providing a series of mostly balanced options the game offers you a chance to customize how your Civilization starts and prevents the first 5 turns from playing out mostly the same every time. While I do miss some of the more fun and unique units and buildings from Civilization 5 I think the system used here is overall better. The loss of Civilizations with terrible bonuses is good. These Civs do seem to lack personality but to be honest they never had personality in Civilization 5. Any personality attributed to the AI by players was created by the implied history of America for example.\n\nGameplay:\nOn the surface it appears to be incredibly similar to Civilization 5 and in a lot of ways, it is. Units can't stack, the map is hex based, resources are reskinned but the same, ect. Despite this the game plays quite differently with aliens proving more dynamic and challenging than barbariens ever were. Spies have been revamped and are both more useful and interesting. Trade routes work on a by city basis as opposed to a global limit encouraging massive trade empires. The culture trees promote far more diversification and interesting strategies with their synergy bonuses. The tech web, a huge change to the previous tree system of Civ 5 diversifies each Civilization far more than unique bonuses ever did and allows for many interesting strategies. Except for the Domination all the victories have been revamped creating interesting ways for players to win and allowing for a lot of time for other players to interfere. Expeditions and resource pods create more variety and must often be fought over by the aliens squatting nearby. Miasma while often irritating makes positioning all the more important. Sattelites, one of the bigger new additions have many varied and useful effects on the land beneath them. I could keep going on but in the end while most of the changes feel small in my opinion they all add up together to create a game that feels and plays very differently from Civilization 5. It is certainly an iterative sequel but it is a different game from Civilization 5 in a myriad of ways.\n\nI am greatly enjoying my time with this game warts and all and I look forward to the dlc and expansions that will make it even better.","October 30, 2014","true","28.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

Sometimes unable to build Units, just bulding Cities and even more Cities, not gathering ressources.\nAt other times they attack you out of the blue, for no reason.\nAnd this happens like a gamble, totally random and can happen on every difficulty.\nOften all the AI does is a) nothing besides spamming Cities or b) Steamrolling you with a an Army that contains mostly just one Unit type.\nIf you play with AI vs AI, your AI is mostly nothing more than a victim. On higher difficulty they just get rushed without resistance.\nFor fun i tried several settings like 2v1, 3vs1, 2vs2  and even 6 AI + Me ( playing defensive) vs ONE Enemy AI, and guess who won? the Enemy rushed one unable Teammate after another.\n\nAlso hilarious, when the AI ends up with a cashflow of MINUS 7000 per turn, like this\n\n- If youre not familar with Civilization IV or V, its hard to find into the Game, the Settings, Hud, and Overview are very confusing.\n\n-  Wonders and Quests have an insufficient  or confusing Descriptions. Also some Quests are bugged in case that they wont be completed, even if you did all required tasks, and sometimes they just repeat themselves over and over again.\n\n- No Match Statistics after the Game. I loved to see a Gameoverview at CiV 5, but here it seems to be missing.\n\n\n\nAll together Beyond Earth has some nice new Changes, but also a lot of Civilization V in it.\n\nThats not bad, but considering the high Price, Broken AI, confusing Descriptions&Menus and that the lack in variety makes the Game boring after "only" 50 Hours, its a tough decision.\n\nCurrently I would say that you better install and try the DEMO before you buy it!\n( You can find it on the right side of the Game's Storepage )\n\nTo be fair, there is hope that it will be patched soon and even with its flaws it kept me entertained for 50 Hours, so it gets a "YES" from me, but please dont expect it to be Fun for hundreds of Hours, like former CIV Titles, because it just isnt.","October 28, 2014","true","60.7"," 93 of 179 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","93","179","0","0"

Beyond Earth has a much brighter outlook in most ways, the aliens aren't horrifying, the factions are kind of tame, and in general, things feel less intense.\n\nBut, not comparing it to that, its an extremely solid civilization game. It feels much more streamlined than everything so far to me, with passive unlocks and techonoligcal boosts, units never don't feel like they go obsolete, and buildings steadily increase in worth throughout the game. The quest system provides customization to your buildings which is nice, but I still feel like there is one fundamental thing that dissapointed me in this game-\n\nThe game is fun and streamlined, but it could have had so much more worked pumped into its story and presentation, and would be awesome if it had.","October 26, 2014","true","52.7"," 53 of 101 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","53","101","0","0"

It was my first experience with the Civilization franchise and I loved the game from the beginning, though as expansions were released I came to realize just how lacking the game had been when first launched. Despite this, I would still have rated vanilla Civ 5 as a pretty good game. Naturally, when I heard about Beyond Earth I was very excited.\n\nI expected it to be very similar to Civ 5 but more polished and with innovative new systems that would enhance the user experience. I expected to get a Civ 5 game that was worth being its own game. I have been VERY disappointed. The jump from Brave New World to Beyond Earth seems to be the same as from Vanilla Civ 5 to Gods and Kings. This is a stand-alone expansion, not a full game. I can see the potential for it to be great, but it feels unfinished. I've played for only a few hours and I don't really feel any urge to play any more.\n\nIn my first play through, I noticed the following negatives:\n\n-Some buildings don't actually work. I built a Progenitor Garden (+20% health in that city) and it did nothing. I spent a lot of energy to build it immediately and the building didn't provide any boost to health. I haven't built all of the building and wasn't really paying attention to most of the buildings that I did build, but I can't help but wonder how many other buildings didn't actually have any effect at all and were just wasting energy.\n\n-Units weren't cleared from the Unit Upgrade window. As I upgraded more and more units, they simply overlapped each other graphically in the window. This is not a game ending issue, but I would have expected small stuff like this to be smoothed out before release. It adds to the rushed and unfinished feel of the game.\n\n-Baffling AI. I actually had an AI offer to renew a trade with me and when I accepted it, they refused and demanded that I offer them more to continue the trade. THEY WERE THE ONES THAT OFFERED TO RENEW THE PREVIOUS TRADE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!! There are too many examples of bad AI in this game, but this example really epitomizes the players experience in dealing with the AI in most aspects of the game.\n\n- Related to the previous point, general diplomacy sucks. The AI holds onto old grudes FOREVER. For example, if you tell them to not build cities near you, that has a negative effect on your relationship for the rest of the game. I know that this occured in Civ 5 too, but I really expected some better diplomacy and international relations in this game. It's been 300 years... get over it already!\n\n-Each colony feels the same. Each sponsor gives a unique bonus, but this is not enough to change the feel of the game. Playing as any of the sponsors feels exactly the same with no appreciable difference in cultures. Each of the sponsors is obviously supposed to represent some faction that controls some large portion of Earth, but aside from the accent of the leader, there is no difference in the look or feel of the resulting colonies these sponsors produce.\n\n-Affinities. First, I like the concept of the affinities: that each group would have a different approach to the alien world on which they landed. That said, I would have preferred to have a system in which I could choose affinity abilities like with ideologies in Brave New World except using these new affinity specific resources instead of culture.\n\nThere were some things that I did like:\n\n-Quests. The quest system adds a new level of customizability to the game. After constructing a building, a quest decision is presented to allow the player to choose one of two effects to add to that building. For example, you might be able to add +1 culture or +1 production to all of a certain building for the rest of the game.\n\n-Improved espionage. I like the changes to the espionage system, though this aspect of the game also suffers from feeling a bit unfinished.\n\n-Tech Web. Rather than a linear progression through a tech tree in which you will inevitably end up with all of the technology eventually, the tech web requires more strategic planning as to which direction your colony will take.\n\nThese are really fairly minor changes for a full game. It seems as if the developers decided that because Civ 5 already exists and was a big success, that they could get away with minor improvements, change the art, and pass it off as a full game. If this was a brand new franchise, Beyond Earth might have worked as a fresh concept. Civilization fans expect more than a passable game though.\n\nI will probably buy the inevitable expansions and/or DLC, but only when they are on sale; the improvements that are sure to come should have been included in this release and I refuse to pay top dollar for upcoming additions.\n\nI am actually very upset that I spent $50 on this game; if I could get my money back, I would. I will keep this in mind if you somehow manage to make another new Civilization game, Firaxis. Lesson learned... don't preorder because the game won't be finished.","October 26, 2014","false","21.6"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

The AI is terrible, I played normal in a massive Domination match, and was never attacked even though I played very aggressively and constantly spat in the face of my opposition, allowing me to slowly plow over the massive map over the course of 600 or so turns with little-to-no retaliation. Even mass-scale assaults were met with maybe 1-2 gun ships buzzing my infantry before being shot down.\nThe spy system is a bit more advanced the previous ones, but it's the only thing the AI is good at countering, making it almost useless, but I haven't played it against a live person.\nThe aliens, after you upgrade your infantry to level 3, aren't at all a threat, making clearing them a very, very easy task using a single of the mid-to-late game infantry to plow through them. Though, near the start of the game, the aliens can make expansion and resource aquisition extremely difficult, adding to the fun.\nIn Civ 5, the barbarians leveled with you, making you constantly need to contend with them in heavier force than they had, but the aliens stay a measely 8-16 strength, and you'll have building defences that prevent combat altogether. The Seige worms (equal to a mid-level unit) are either far too aggressive early on, or not at all, leading to a quick death or a slight irritant.\n\nI enjoy the difference in technology routes, using Xenos as allies through Harmony, staying "pure" to humans, or going the cyborg/robot route, and the units aesthetics reflecting as such, but it doesn't really affect gameplay much, the individual perks barely changing between the three factions, as they're all more-or-less the same in combat, save for slight differences in mobility, which play much less of a role in combat than you'd think.\n\nThe starting of the game can be an uphill battle, but once you're at the top, it's far too easy and smooth, even on higher difficulties.\nBut, with some more expansions or mods, I feel this game will be one of the best Civs yet.\nBuy it if you've got the money, but I'd reccomend waiting.","December 4, 2014","true","117.3"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","0"

Worth waiting for the 'complete' edition on 75-80% sale sometime next year.\n\nPlaytime from the "free weekend"\n\nIt tries to add some nice new features or atleast some form of cause and effect into the gameplay beyond the immediate action. Alas in most cases it is little more than a black or white additional perk or mindless resolution that impacts little on gameplay or immersion and becomes tedious with the double notification delivery system.\n\nThe ai scripting and actions are laughable, inconsistent and detached from the ingame circumstances and the affinity/faction system doesn't seem to stack well with gameplay actions but is more determined by tickbox decisions and research.\n\nThe pace is casual/slow, even an aggressive playstyle is conducted slowly while a more laid back passive approach is not necessarily exploited, as all the different factions are playing their own games independent of each other with only the player choosing whether to interact compete or ignore them. Perhaps this changes with the different difficulties and planetary settings.\n\nDespite this critism it still delivers a solid turnbased 4x with multiple win conditions for added variety challenge and replayability. Culture perks, unit upgrades, research unlocks, resource management, variable terrain, trade, diplomacy, espionage and  tidy graphics package with clean UI.\n","January 17, 2015","false","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As it is now, there aren't quite enough interesting decisions to be made, and there are some annoyances that should be ironed out. For example, there are so many useless buildings and pointless "quest" decisions. Diplomacy is lacking. Civ 5 was the same way, but now with Brave New World and several years of gameplay/balance/AI/UI patches, it's really compelling. But still, Beyond Earth is a new Civ game, and if you like the turn based 4x strategy gameplay, you could do worse. It's both the most similar sequel, in that it reuses the underlying Civ 5 Brave New World engine (hexagonal tiles, one unit per tile, trade routes) and the most different, in that it explores futuristic alien technologies. It makes some nice simplifications over Civ 5, such as simpler promotions, simpler city conquering (no Courthouses), removal of Great People (which were more fiddly than they were worth in my opinion), a more gentle happiness/healthiness statistic. So my advice is to buy Beyond Earth whenever it's heavily discounted, but don't play it until late 2015, after they've made more improvements.","January 18, 2015","false","185.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's just so much wrong in this game and most of it has been summed up by the previous reviewers. The characters are worse than some of the faction mods found in Civ 5, the game isn't that much of an improvement over Civ 5, it is very very expensive for absolutely no reason. The replayablity isn't too great, the mods are too few, the multiplayer isn't that good. I can go on on about why the game isn't worth your cash (or in my case, the 2 day free trial given out and even then I barely wanted to play it), but if I had to sum it all in one message it would be wait until the next sale, and get the Civ 5 complete edition with all DLC for $12 like I did and you will not only enjoy it more but also save a lot of money.

Instead of taking advantage from the Sci-Fi theme and come up with some really eclectic, interesting and MEMORABLE factions, everybody has the same generic units and buildings.

I'm a big fan of the Civilization series, and anything scifi is always a plus in my book. However, this game... Starting off, you have extremely limited options as to where to start your first city, which can seriously set you back in the early game. The science tree or graph or whatever is an absolute mess, nearly unreadable, confusing for old fans of Civ and completely overwhelming for any newcomers. All the tiles look the same (I had to hover over most tiles to figure out what they were), the aliens are absolutely everywhere, stopping your explorers and then randomly killing them for no reason... And the miasma, which could have been interesting, is just far too abundant to be anything but a serious annoyance. The actual civilizations themselves, or the colonies as they were, in addition to being very few in number, are also extremely bland and seem to have practically no differences from each other. The leaders have next to no personality, and all their little log excerpts seem to be dime-a-dozen platitudes about the loss of Earth and the squandering of natural materials - or then destruction of the aliens.\n\nIt's such a shame, because this could have been the best game in the entire series with a little development. The basic idea was there, and there were so many ways this could have gone. I would give wads of cash for something more akin to Civ meets Mass Effect, where there's an actual variety of species and planet types. The civ leaders could have actual character, and the aliens, too - why were they not sentient? Why could I not play as them? Why are the aliens so meaningless to the game?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the problems with the multiplayer. I got kicked out more times than I can count, and I probably stared at loading screens more than I got actual playtime in. Finally, I had to give up without completing the multiplayer game, because my constant dropping was making it stand still for everyone else. Additionally, the game would occasionally freeze for no reason and force me to restart it to be responsive again. I've never had issues like that with any other game. I don't know if the free weekend was crowding the servers or what, but it was basically unplayable.\n\nSuch a shame. I guess I'll have to get my Civ fix and my scifi fix separately, then.","January 17, 2015","false","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where in V, winning  by science, send your people to the stars beyond earth let you pioneer new worlds.\n\nAt the start you can choose between a few conglomerates. Unlike V, where the perks are set to a leader, you get to choose them.\n\nWhen you have played civilisation before you feel at home yet a little disappointed. When you start you see the changes and well they are nice in the beginning. You have a grid as tech exploration which gives you more freedom.\nThe orders which you could choose in V (after DLC and certain timespan) are replaced by affinities which are there from start. And you have virtues instead of social policies.\n\nThe affinities are linked to researching tech and unit upgrades to affinities.\n\nSo yeah everything is there and it has a nice ring to it.\n\nThen why the diappointment you might think. Well imo this game has such potential you can only feel sad about the missed opportunities.\n\nThe playable factions are just human. Aliens are mere barbarians in this game. The planets you can choose to pioneer are only earthlike planets. You have 3 "choices". One with a few large masses (like earth) One with one big landmass and a big ocean with possibilitie of small isles (pangaea) and an island like planet. But none of them have an alien look.\nSo all the possibiliteis of strange new planets to explore or some weird alien races to play aren't there.\n\nSo yeah at the current state and price I simply cannot recommend the game. It has so much more potential but feels more like a mod than a full game.\n\nWill I keep my eye on the game. Definately. With some nice mods it can become a great addition to the civ series.","January 19, 2015","false","246.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The base mechanics are all the same, only renamed to sound space-y and futuristic and barely any of the improvements brought by the Civ V DLC are here. Whatever new mechanics are added, they feel poorly implemented at best, like they know they're gonna release 30$ DLC in the future to rework them (as is likely the case).\n\n-The Affinity system looks interesting at first, but it's entirely reliant on the the tech tree (or rather "web"), so if you're not focusing solely on producing Science, you're not gonna get anywhere, fast. -Everything depends on Affinity now, from Victories to Unit upgrades, and unless you're devoting yourself to one Affinity, you can't do anything productive.\n-In fact, apart from Domination, all the victories are basically differently flavoured Science victories now, as Diplomacy and Culture have been all but removed.\n-The new Tech Web also seems interesting at first (a common theme with this game, it seems), but it quickly loses focus, because you have to go for the Affinity-adding techs, wich are spread seemingly at random on the Web. So on one hand you need to concentrate on Affinity, but that means randomly picking different techs... It quickly becomes a mess, considering the next point.\nThat new tech-y coat of paint... The great thing about Civ was how quiclkly you could get into it. The Units, Buildings, Leaders, even Wonders - you took one look at them, you knew who they were and what they did. Now, it's basically stabs in the dark. You have no idea what each unit is by glancing at the name (like when you're deciding what to Produce next), the Leaders are completely interchngeable, the Wonedrs are basically random bits of words stuck together to random effects... And since you can't help but to compare this to Civ V (and you have to, because the gameplay is identical), it looks just awful.\n-Oh, and the worst part - instead of Spock's (or at the very least Spock's sound-a-like) soothing narration you get something that sounds like a teen girl, narrating random quotes by the fictional "leaders".. Yeah, actual quotes from actual people have been cut too....\n\nThere are good points - the Espionage system is expanded and the new Quest and Decision systems work really well. But that's all, really.\n\nMost of all, this just feels like a big new scenario for Civ V. And if that's what it was, instead of a full price game with several full price DLC coming soon, that would be pretty awesome. But now, it feels like a big step beck for the franchise, not justifying the full price.","January 17, 2015","false","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It uses the same engine and same diplomacy trade ect ect ect as CIV V. Which is not a bad thing per se. As I understand when Civ V first launched it was not received well but with the additions of DLC it became a much better game. Both good and bad. It is bad because we will have to purchase a 30 dollar DLC to make this a truly great game. I will say however that the other civs were useless. I suppose I am only mostly though my first game but I found little interactions between the other Civs. This is probably due to the lack of luxury resources however. The aliens will be your primary threat as the other civs are rather docile. I am disappointed by the wonders in this game. In Civ V it was something special with music and a picture and a quote. Now its just meh. The affinities are a great new addition and it is neat to see them mix and mingle with how the other civs leaders look. and they provide nice little bonuses as well. According to the affinity you have the highest rating for some civs will love you and others will hate you. Either way this game is very similar to civ V. if you liked civ V than chances are you will like BE as well.","October 26, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

People like saying that it is a reskin of Civ V, wich I disagree with as well. Beyond Earth has the affinities, the orbital layer, and satellites in general, better spying system (in my opinion), quests, the tech web, new resources which have a large impact on how a game will turn out (i.e. firaxite, floatstone), different units (as opposed to a civilization's special unit in Civ V, the affinity changes more than just a single unit). Aliens might be compared to barbarians, but you can not tame barbarians and have them help fight with you. The multiple special abilities you may pick from is a nice little feature to slightly impact gameplay, the trade system with foreign cities and outposts is good too.

Because of this, as a fan of the Civ games and an owner of Civ IV GOTY Edition and Civ V, I jumped at the opportunity to play it on the free weekend. Logging in a straight 13 hours in one sitting, I can honestly say that I have enjoyed it more than I did Civ V and Civ IV, and I plan on buying it.\n\nThere are a LOT of reviews saying that this is "Civ V Reskin" and that isn't true. I've played around 250 hours of Civ V, and this is a good bit different from Civ V.\n\nThat being said, Civ : Beyond Earth adds a lot of new features that were either absent or very miniscule in the previous games. Some of these features include:\n-Covert ops\n-Branches determining what stlye of civilization you will run\n-Unit upgrades, determined by your civilization's style\n-More resources, different trading methods, different UI\n-New diverse and sometimes kinda scary "Alien" units to replace the "Barbarians" of the previous games\nEverything is just reworked and really great.\nHowever, I did run into a few cons\n-When I launched the game, the introduction cinematic played, and then the screen displaying the title and the 3 ships was shown. This display was stuck, and I was a bit confused at first, but upon alt-tabbing out and then back in, I was brought to the main menu. Nothing really of botherance, just a little confusing.\n-The game, while it did add a LOT of new features, did not really change the overall style of a Civ game, but that's expected, because it's a ♥♥♥♥ing Civ game. It's not gonna all of a sudden be innovative. It's gonna add these small details, small features, and move on.\n\nOverall: If you're into the Sci-Fi, space exploration, or robotic scene, this is a good Civ game for you.\nHowever, if you like Civ V more than you like your mother/children/girlfriend, stick to Civ V.","January 17, 2015","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Beyond Earth has the affinities, the orbital layer, and satellites in general, better spying system (in my opinion), quests, the tech web, new resources which have a large impact on how a game will turn out (i.e. firaxite, floatstone), different units (as opposed to a civilization's special unit in Civ V, the affinity changes more than just a single unit). Aliens might be compared to barbarians, but you can not tame barbarians and have them help fight with you. The multiple special abilities you may pick from is a nice little feature to slightly impact gameplay, the trade system with foreign cities and outposts is good too. And when people say that it is a reskin of Civ V, its a Civ game. Did you want something else? I agree that the colors are dull, but other than that I would say that Civilization: Beyond Earth is a good game.","January 25, 2015","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sentient/recommended/65980/","sentient","Sentient6","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sentient/","145 products in account","The concept behind this game sounded pretty sweet, but in practice, this just feels like an incomplete Civ 5 with a fresh (and confusing) coat of paint. The base mechanics are all the same, only renamed to sound space-y and futuristic and barely any of the improvements brought by the Civ V DLC are here. Whatever new mechanics are added, they feel poorly implemented at best, like they know they're gonna release 30$ DLC in the future to rework them (as is likely the case).\n\n-The Affinity system looks interesting at first, but it's entirely reliant on the the tech tree (or rather "web"), so if you're not focusing solely on producing Science, you're not gonna get anywhere, fast. -Everything depends on Affinity now, from Victories to Unit upgrades, and unless you're devoting yourself to one Affinity, you can't do anything productive.\n-In fact, apart from Domination, all the victories are basically differently flavoured Science victories now, as Diplomacy and Culture have been all but removed.\n-The new Tech Web also seems interesting at first (a common theme with this game, it seems), but it quickly loses focus, because you have to go for the Affinity-adding techs, wich are spread seemingly at random on the Web. So on one hand you need to concentrate on Affinity, but that means randomly picking different techs... It quickly becomes a mess, considering the next point.\nThat new tech-y coat of paint... The great thing about Civ was how quiclkly you could get into it. The Units, Buildings, Leaders, even Wonders - you took one look at them, you knew who they were and what they did. Now, it's basically stabs in the dark. You have no idea what each unit is by glancing at the name (like when you're deciding what to Produce next), the Leaders are completely interchngeable, the Wonedrs are basically random bits of words stuck together to random effects... And since you can't help but to compare this to Civ V (and you have to, because the gameplay is identical), it looks just awful.\n-Oh, and the worst part - instead of Spock's (or at the very least Spock's sound-a-like) soothing narration you get something that sounds like a teen girl, narrating random quotes by the fictional "leaders".. Yeah, actual quotes from actual people have been cut too....\n\nThere are good points - the Espionage system is expanded and the new Quest and Decision systems work really well. But that's all, really.\n\nMost of all, this just feels like a big new scenario for Civ V. And if that's what it was, instead of a full price game with several full price DLC coming soon, that would be pretty awesome. But now, it feels like a big step beck for the franchise, not justifying the full price.","January 17, 2015","false","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its Civ2: ToT's space scenario. But redesigned. The tech web I was excited about but is rather clunky in practice. Ive been finding it best to completely as much as I can focus on one of the three affinities. Mixing the techs usually puts you pretty behind, even though its limited benefits to steer off your affinity some of the techs you will really be able to use. Just had my closest to winning game and it was literally through grinding through techs and trying to stay out of war and not expand. War isnt what it used to be. Im so tempted to go back to civ 5 so I can have a grand campaign of a war with multiple civs. The balance issues at this point make the game hard to recommend, Im flying through games with really really low number of cities on bigger maps than civ 5 has given me since the custom maps mod was taken down. I still have yet to really break more than 9 or 10 cities max. One of those times I went to war with a fledgling faction. The units all upgrading at once is kinda fun. But once again theres alot of balance issues with being able to afford the epic units and not fall behind somewhere else. I think I have to step away from it for a while, wait til a patch comes out.","November 1, 2014","false","107.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everything about this game is balanced to produce smaller civs and increased interactions between civs.  This may be great if you play multiplayer, but for a single player fan like me, it takes away from the experience of leading mankinds first intersteller colonization.  Rather then wanting to climb over that next ridge, see whats there, and then optimize for the best city placement,; I'm forced to race against AI cities that are dropped right next to me.\n\nThis game is definetly not an updated version of Alpha Centauri.  Some of the innovations are great, the use of satellites, autoupgrading units, explorer expiditions, and affinities.  But other things are just off, the ability to cross oceans so soon after landing feels wrong.\n\nThe tech web is a very mixed bag.  Compared to past Civilization games that had a linear tech tree based on history, it makes perfect sense that in the future you could choose which path to pursue.  The problem with it was that I always felt that there was maybe one or two optimal choices.  Pick wrong and you would fail.  You need health, you need energy, you need better weapons from affinity choices, and you will always feel pulled by the choices.  In past civs there was always some slack with the tech choices.  Rather than techs giving me choices and rewards, I feel tense everytime I open the research window.\n\nThe virtue menu is also innovative, it gives you the option to customize your civ.  But everytime i play, it feels like there is only one good tree.  You have to take prosperity, anything else and you will fall behind the AI.  Maybe in multiplayer it would be a different story, but in single player it seems anything else is a waste till you max it out.\n\nThe civilopedia is awesome.  This may be the most narrative of all the Civilization games and the fiction inside the civilopedia had me opening the game just to read it.  And that shows a big problem with the game.  I was more interested in reading the civilopedia than playing the game.","November 1, 2014","false","38.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game really let's you do whatever you want; and although I enjoy a good sandbox, there just isn't too much decision making here.  You can level up in any given tech direction, affinity, or culture at will.  The only exclusionary forces to how you progress are the minor bonuses you chose to give to your military units.  Every other bonus you can get can just be min/maxed by playing the game longer.  In the end every empire I create comes out to be the same min/maxed plot-of-land expansion as the one I played before, despite all the options given to you in the beginning.    And the end game is just completely unfulfilling.  There's no lead up, or breakdown of the game; not even an option to play just one more turn! It's grayed out for me every time!  It just ends, and unless you're really quick at reading text before the box pops up to tell you it's over, then you may never know.  Yeah, that's right, the text box at the end is the same stock message for every game, with no details concerning who won, or how.\n\nI do really enjoy the level with which you can customize your society, and that the NPC's and cities change in design depending on your affinity, and I will still continue to play this game,  but I don't think I can recommend it as it exists right now.

I have been a CIV fan since the first game, which btw was the first PC game I ever bought, somewhere in the 90's. From CIV to CIV 5 I completed 1 game every 10 or 20 because I loved the early game stages...the exploration...the early choices...the first encounters. Then you had to decide which civs to befriend, which to attack, how to specialize your cities, etc.. By the modern age it was clear who was going to win so there I go to a new game, with a different civ and a smile in my face.\n\nI don't know exactly what is the issue with BE but I could not endure more than 4 hrs in the first game and maybe 2 in the second. The tech web is confusing and it is not clear where I am going, the world is colorful yet dull, and I am not sure I am making meaningful choices throughout the game. Everything seems sooooo boring...\n\nNot to mention a very annoying bug which prevents me from playing at low res (1,280 x 720).\n\nMaybe I didn't try long enough but it was the first CIV game I gave up so early, and I played every single one of them.

It feels too much like Civilisation 5 just more confusing. The tech tree is a huge improvement over Civilisation V but along with the affinities feel like the only new things to the series. You may now only play as 8 different civ's which is fine as you can customise them but this means that you can no longer have the large 12+ player games. Another problem is that for the same price you could get Civilisation V + all of the DLC's (Civ V Complete Pack) which is much more completed than this.\n\nI played it for about 4 hours when it went out and haven't played it since due to me just not wanting to play it.

It feels like a re-skin of Civ 5 with to many of the core features pulled out.\n\nThe long reason?\n\nThe aliens are an annoyance, they don't add a fun challange they just zip around eating your units while you can't do anything to defend them. The research is a pain, half the time you've got no clue what it is you're researching. Take the "transgenics" research for example, it gives you a gene smelter. Great. Somebody mind telling me what a gene smelter is or what it does before I waste my time on this research? Also the research is a mess, people can end up with aircraft before you have any form of anti-air units that can defend you. basically meaning that your units get bombarded by cities twice. Finally, and most annoyingly is the lack of explanation of how to do anything with the trade routes. I, wrongfully, assumed that as every other unit in the game can embark onto the water the trade convoy could as well. Nope! It's the only type of unit where you've got to build a differnt unit to travel across the sea. So to summarise a ranty review, the reasearch is in a stupid order and you generally have no clue what you're doing, trade routes make no sense and aliens are plain annoying.\n\nAre there any good points? Sure, the affinity system is a great addition in my opinoin and the unit upgrades that come from this system are relly cool. That's about it for the good though.

So ultimately: If you enjoyed Civ V, you'll probably enjoy the gameplay here. If you didn't like Civ V, nothing is improved here whatsoever.\n\nWhen Civ IV did a total conversion with a few new mechanics, new graphics, but ultimately the same engine underneath  -- with "Final Frontier" and "Fall From Heaven: Age of Ice", both tucked away as part of the mods for Beyond the Sword -- it was just an added part of an expansion pack that gave you more in Civ IV itself.\n\nWith Beyond Earth, I'm expected to pay the price of a new game for it, and I cannot deny I am disappointed in what it adds, and more importantly, where it fails to live up to its spiritual predecessor, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.\n\nThe Virtues system seems like it could've done so much more, but instead it's just power-ups with no tradeoffs. The Affinities are clever, but ultimately fail to end up truly drawing you in. (A tiny suggestion there: it would've been nice to see your own leader as he or she is transformed by their affinity, just as much as it was interesting to see the other leaders transformed!)\n\nA bizarrely minor gripe: the tech descriptions are all read by one voice; even though they are frequently attributed to the leaders, who are voice acted. Why not pay the VAs a bit more and get them to read those things? (Heck, could we have had the voice actors actually read the lines for their dialogue in the diplomacy screens? Nah, not that either.) It would have done a great deal, as with Alpha Centauri, to help make the leaders seem more alive. CEO Fielding isn't even in the same ballpark as CEO Nwabudike Morgan.  These leaders didn't feel like actual characters, and I managed to get through an entire playthrough without a single one of them declaring war against me, despite numerous threats.\n\nIn summary: I wanted to love it.

I'm not a direhard fan of the Civ games, having played Civ IV and Civ V, but I was looking to pick this up, because Civ in space sounded pretty cool. I didn't buy this game right away, because 1) I felt like it was overpriced for what essentially looked liked a Civ V clone, I perhaps would spend $30 on it, but no way was I going to sink $50 into it, and 2) This is Steam, and a new game from a very renowned developer as Firaxis was very likely to go on sale during the winter sale. So the game was released and I waited until Christmas to check it out. I went onto the store page, and noticed that this game got 'mixed' reviews. What? A game with the Sid Meier's Civilization name not getting at least above average reviews? I was skeptical about the reviews, but ultimately decided to hold onto my money. And then, to put the final nail in the coffin, the free weekend rolled around. I could finally try this game out for myself before deciding if I wanted to buy it. I no longer regret my decision to hold onto my money. This game is unfortunately a reskinned Civ V, with pretty much every good feature of it dumbed down. AI personalities are boring, the tech tree was interesting, but confusing and eventually just became a game of "research the technologies that will get you affinity points". There was hardly any intro or help when starting the game, aside from choosing your previous Civ exposure. My first, and only, game essentially became a game of finding research to gain affinity, minimal interaction with the AI nations, and waiting out to victory.\n\nTL:DR; reskinned, dumbed down Civ V in space. Only buy if you really, really enjoy Civ V and are willing to overlook the many flaws, then maybe for you it will be enjoyable. I personally, however, am glad to remove this game from my wishlist.","January 17, 2015","false","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I can't really recommend this to anyone because Civ 5 pretty much did everything this game does, but better (two exceptions being the tech tree, maybe, and then I liked the virtue system from what I played anyway).  The opening intro for the game is pretty sweet, though.\n\nAdmittedly I don't have much time in this game (I only played during the free weekend, and even that was only ~5 hours, because that's all I could stomach - and I have almost 700 hours in Civ 5, 230 hours in Endless Space, 1600 hours in EU4, etc), but I don't think I would pay more than $10 for this game - and even then I would have some hesitance.  Calling this game a mod may have been somewhat generous, as it's more like a watered down reskin.\n\nThe UI is pretty much horrible; they removed the demographics stats portion entirely; they literally just renamed the mechanics and changed the icons (happiness is now health, money is now energy); you just build the base unit of each unit type, which is then upgraded (automatically) to the next one that you pick when you raise your affinity (which is pretty much only raised based on what you learn in the tech tree); the alien mechanic is kind of weird(?), you can not attack aliens and do the Harmony affinity, but they still occasionally attack you and ruin your trade routes, so it's just best to kill them all anyway apparently; the diplomacy options are all copy and pasted from Civ 5 (except for earning favors I guess now, which it wasn't exactly clear how that actually works out in practice); and the whole premise for the game, mankind embarking off into space for their salvation...only to battle against each other and repeat exactly what they did on earth that they were trying to escape/fix - sure, I guess.\n\nThe only two somewhat redeeming parts of this game are the tech tree and the virtue system, of which I'm still undecided on the tech tree since it's seemingly not really organized any way specifically and different techs and affinities are strewn about throughout; but the virtue system is pretty cool, I like it (at least what I played of it so far anyway).\n\nWith all the space themed stuff and technological advances, it really just made me want to play Endless Space or Galactic Civilizations III. I wanted to like this game, but I'm not even sure expansions could save it without overhauling the UI and adding a little more depth. Not to mention there's no portraits for any of the pictures for units and buildings, just words and icons. The only other thing that was kind of cool was that cities start out at level 0 and have to gain enough influence to become a full-fledged city.\n\nAlso, for some reason, you see where the computers all start, for basically no reason whatsoever. Oh, and did I mention that Stations (the city-state equivalents that only work with a trade route now) just randomly spawn places? Like when you're ~2 turns away from settling that area with a colonist on the way down? Basically my reaction to the game as a whole, but specifically when that occured:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjZuGas6yRQ","January 18, 2015","false","5.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It feels too much like Civilisation 5 just more confusing. The tech tree is a huge improvement over Civilisation V but along with the affinities feel like the only new things to the series. You may now only play as 8 different civ's which is fine as you can customise them but this means that you can no longer have the large 12+ player games. Another problem is that for the same price you could get Civilisation V + all of the DLC's (Civ V Complete Pack) which is much more completed than this.\n\nI played it for about 4 hours when it went out and haven't played it since due to me just not wanting to play it. Which is the opposite of which Civ V made me want to do!\n\nFinally, the multiplayer is absolutely godawful, worse than Civilisation V awful. In Civ V you could play multiplayer but it was nowhere near stable and with this I've practically given up on trying to play multiplayer at all. Until Firaxis gets their crap together I will have to say that Civilisation: Beyond Earth is no where near worth the money!\n\ntl;dr Civilisation V is better in almost every way\n\nWhat I'd give Civ V: 8/10\n\nWhat I give Beyond Earth: 4/10\n\nThanks for reading.","January 18, 2015","false","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game really let's you do whatever you want; and although I enjoy a good sandbox, there just isn't too much decision making here.  You can level up in any given tech direction, affinity, or culture at will.  The only exclusionary forces to how you progress are the minor bonuses you chose to give to your military units.  Every other bonus you can get can just be min/maxed by playing the game longer.  In the end every empire I create comes out to be the same min/maxed plot-of-land expansion as the one I played before, despite all the options given to you in the beginning.    And the end game is just completely unfulfilling.  There's no lead up, or breakdown of the game; not even an option to play just one more turn! It's grayed out for me every time!  It just ends, and unless you're really quick at reading text before the box pops up to tell you it's over, then you may never know.  Yeah, that's right, the text box at the end is the same stock message for every game, with no details concerning who won, or how.\n\nI do really enjoy the level with which you can customize your society, and that the NPC's and cities change in design depending on your affinity, and I will still continue to play this game,  but I don't think I can recommend it as it exists right now.  I guess we'll just have to wait for some DLC.","November 1, 2014","false","73.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

What I didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics  the game could be overwhelming at times.

Turn away, this isn't it. Not to say it's inherently bad, but it just isn't Civ. I absolutely love Civ V and while Beyond Earth does scratch the Civ itch a bit, it brings a different experience to the table. Yes, the gameplay is shockingly similar to that of Civ 5, but what it brings new is wonderful. An overhaul of the previously named "Culture and Social Policies" is now streamlined and way more useful. New "quests" and major decisions have to be made that influence your "civ" one way or antother- one of my favorite aspects. And finally, the unforgiving alien landscapes. New terrain, such as crevaces, canyons, and the crazy aliens that, at first, threaten your small cities existence. The final major change is the technology overhaul. Instead of a linear tech "tree" from the previous games, the tech section is now organized into a large web, encoumpassing many different things in any direction. While this was daunting and honestly confusing at first, as you progress it starts to make sense. What I have come to enjoy about this style of technology system is that two players could decide to go in opposite directions of the tech web, researching different things and still be competetive, despite each other not having each other's units/tech/buildings/etc. There is a new aspect in Beyond Earth that introduces orbital units. Satellites that can gain a bit more solar energy (this games "gold") to satellites that provide defense bonuses and healing per turn for millitary units. While this is somewhat intriguing, I feel it wasn't fully fleshed out and honestly you can get through an entire game completly ignoring this new system.\n\nThe Good: Tech Web, Culture overhaul, Quest Decisions\n\nThe Bad: Boring early game, some mechanics too similar to Civ 5.\n\nOverall: I think this would have done much better as a "standalone" DLC for Civ 5, or an "addon game" rather than a brand new $60 game. It feels too similar to pay really anything substantial, but if you do play it, it can be a lot of fun.\n\n7/10","August 14, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I no longer add the "on sale" disclaimer if you're going to go ahead and get Rising Tide, too.\n-------\n\nWow, first off, I'm only bothering to add a positive review because I just realized the review rating right now is like 53%! Holy shnikes!\n\nI understand, though. Really, after playing Civ 5 with all the DLC, Civ BE is kind of underwhelming. I think the biggest reason it comes short though is because of the limited number of factions. Only 8! If you want to play with more than 8, you either have to mod up (especially a pain in the ♥♥♥ for multiplayer or nigh impossible for non-Windows users), or overlap different players with the same "sponsor." Yes, the game does make it possible to do this and changes the color for the players using the same team, but, it's kind of a turn off to me to have to keep track of purple Brasil and green Brasil...\n\nOn the plus side though, and overall I do give this game a thumbs up (when it's on sale!), it does add a number of cool things ..... the Affinity branches and the technology web (that's right web... not tree) come to mind. The way units upgrade across the board as you increase Affinity levels is kind of cool. Being able to pick your upgrade bonuses and even mix Affinity branches up a little bit is kind of cool. Barbarians (aliens) are now much more interesting and can actually change hostility toward individual civs. And purely for flavor, the sci-fi battles and multiple terrain textures (desert / fungal / terran planets) are fun.\n\nSo, for Civ 5 + DLC fans, Civ BE right now is indeed not worth the big $. You'll miss nukes. You'll miss 20+ unique factions. However, if you enjoy sci-fi flare, it's worth it on sale. Get it for $20 or maybe even $30, depending on your impatience levels. Meh. Poor game deserves better than a 53% rating. Awww.","March 12, 2015","true","194.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

This is a game hat deserves to be under the Civilization banner.\nRising tide is a step in the right direction, adding more unique aspects, and expanding existing ones. I love ocean cities, hybrid affinities and new units. the game feels more fleshed out now, but it still has ways to go. The update is like gods and kings for Civ 5, it's good, but BNW is around the corner. i would not reomend playing without the expansion, because the base is undeniably lacking.","August 21, 2015","true","49.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, it falls short of reaching the same excellence of AC let alone surpassing it. Although it has some great graphics (based on the Civ V engine) and uses almost similar mechanics from Civ V, albeit with differences to depict its futuristic setting, the Civ:BE at times feels shallow and seem to lack the depth and engagement of other Civ titles.\n\nAn expansion entitled Rising Tide is suppose to improve upon the base game and it is hope that the new content will be able to lift the game from mediocre to awesome. Despite its flaws (other reviewers have already pointed them out so I won't repeat it here), Civ:BE still has potential. It is hoped that Firaxis will continue to support the game by releasing more content that not only improves gameplay but also establish it as a standalone but excellent title that inherits AC's DNA without replicating it.\n\nIn short, it is a recommended purchase for those interested in sci-fi themed colony building sims. However, I would only get it during sales as the current status of the game does not warrant its full price.","July 17, 2015","true","35.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I do have some complaints, but none are necessarily game breaking. For example, the buildings in your cities are very forgettable and many seem useless. This was a similar issue in civ v though, with the useless buildings. So what it usually turns into each game for me, is a plan my affinity ahead of time, don't attack the aliens, only research things for my affinity, and only build free buildings since money is so hard to make in this game. Also, I'm still unsure how healthiness even works, but it's still by far much better than happiness from civ v. Not the best civ game, but coming from an owner of every civ game, this is still extremely fun. On a personal note, I always try to roleplay when I play civ, and when I get late game, I hate how it stops on future tech. If someone made a game merge system between civ v and BE, it would be so cool to pcikup late game and work on military space ships.","May 2, 2015","true","39.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Barbarians are interesting this time (and are alien lifeforms)\n2. Lots of interesting and unique paths toward victory and victory objectives\n3. Clean and sexy UI\n4. Spying is now AWESOME and easy\n5. Trade routes make more sense\n6. Really interesting and creatively redesigned tech tree\n7. Deeper diplomacy than in Civ 5\n8. The best core gameplay features from Civ 5 are all still here\n9. Impressive customization options at the start of each game\n10. Everything is just much deeper and better designed than in Civ 5 at this point.\n\nThe criticisms people have for the game tend to be that it was buggy (now it's not), it was expensive (I just bought it at half-price), it wasn't as fully featured as Civ 5 is with all its DLC (but BE has DLC coming in a few months and Civ 5 was awfully disappointing before DLC came out), and it pales in comparison to Alpha Centauri (I just didn't find that to be true). I think they may have polished things up and improved things greatly since release because it just doesn't deserve the crappy to lukewarm reviews it has been getting.

The benefits are all picked by you as you pick the game type. There are no real settings for the world anymore besides the size and speed at which you play so that was taken away a bit. The game play seems smooth enough just like most civ games. I give it 3.5/5 Stars. I expected much more with all the hype which is why I don't give it more stars. I hate game makers that hype games just to make a few extra bucks.","March 6, 2015","true","142.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have around 40hrs offline on it at least. 100% Fun I read many of the reviews and was worried about this game being full of bugs. Personally its worked GREAT! No Issues playing on full HD Ultra settings. If your a fan of this type of game your in for a real treat. Seriously give it a shot. Few minor things I'd liked changed of course would be a better AI to fight. Increasing the difficulty only gives them a cheating advantage instead of making them a better player. Sadly quite common in most of these games. The Soundtrack is off the hook! Graphics are intense.  Computer loves to trade for FAVORs. Also lame unless they took these favors more seriously. Covert ops are great but VERY hard to get up in the more gameplay effecting Black Ops.

This game has a lot of potential, but is underdeveloped. It could be a nice Civ game with a kick-♥♥♥ story line, but still not there, especially with the latter.\n\nGameplay: Affinities are well integrated into all aspects of gameplay. The tech web is a fresh addition to a system that has been practically unchanged since Civ2. Aliens are kinda cool, but need more depth. You now choose the upgrades of your units.\n\nBiggest problem (edit:is now corrected) - AI does not react to the new concepts, making the game incredibly easy as of now.\n\nAI will ignore affinity techs until late game, meaning you just need to do two quests, get lvl 3 of random affinity and crush the entire map with upgraded units. The fact you get free upgrade to all units immediately after it is available also contributes, but AI is the bigger problem.\n\nLike in all CIv games, AI doesn't really care about your victory progress, it pursues only its objectives. This is still valid here: you can go on a domination streak, the other Civs will not rally against you. You can place a Mind Flower smack on the border with a Purity Civ, they will ignore it. Considering that 3/5 victory types in this game are to build and hold a planetary wonder, this has to change.\n\nFor the first time in Civ game health (hapiness) is simply a nuissance. March through the map, -45 health, who cares?\n\nStory: Again affinities. Everything revolves around who you choose to be. Storyline-wise, these three choices feel very logical and distinct, as they are core in everything Sci-Fi. The sponsors' and leaders' background has integrity. There are a lot of flaws in the details, however.\n\nMost of Civilopedia is nonsence ("Memetwork" - 9gag is now a world wonder). Half the technologies feel like you are researching the same thing, too much random meaningless words thrown in. Unit upgrades lack description. Orbital stations lack description.

Turn away, this isn't it. Not to say it's inherently bad, but it just isn't Civ. I absolutely love Civ V and while Beyond Earth does scratch the Civ itch a bit, it brings a different experience to the table. Yes, the gameplay is shockingly similar to that of Civ 5, but what it brings new is wonderful. An overhaul of the previously named "Culture and Social Policies" is now streamlined and way more useful. New "quests" and major decisions have to be made that influence your "civ" one way or antother- one of my favorite aspects. And finally, the unforgiving alien landscapes. New terrain, such as crevaces, canyons, and the crazy aliens that, at first, threaten your small cities existence. The final major change is the technology overhaul. Instead of a linear tech "tree" from the previous games, the tech section is now organized into a large web, encoumpassing many different things in any direction. While this was daunting and honestly confusing at first, as you progress it starts to make sense. What I have come to enjoy about this style of technology system is that two players could decide to go in opposite directions of the tech web, researching different things and still be competetive, despite each other not having each other's units/tech/buildings/etc. There is a new aspect in Beyond Earth that introduces orbital units. Satellites that can gain a bit more solar energy (this games "gold") to satellites that provide defense bonuses and healing per turn for millitary units. While this is somewhat intriguing, I feel it wasn't fully fleshed out and honestly you can get through an entire game completly ignoring this new system.\n\nThe Good: Tech Web, Culture overhaul, Quest Decisions\n\nThe Bad: Boring early game, some mechanics too similar to Civ 5.\n\nOverall: I think this would have done much better as a "standalone" DLC for Civ 5, or an "addon game" rather than a brand new $60 game. It feels too similar to pay really anything substantial, but if you do play it, it can be a lot of fun.\n\n7/10","August 14, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It comes with a more personal gameplay experience, alowing a degree of cousomization to your army, and quests that shape you future based on your own decisions.

I still recommend this game for those that are looking for a similar game to Civ V with a sci-fi spin.","August 13, 2015","true","26.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I no longer add the "on sale" disclaimer if you're going to go ahead and get Rising Tide, too.\n-------\n\nWow, first off, I'm only bothering to add a positive review because I just realized the review rating right now is like 53%! Holy shnikes!\n\nI understand, though. Really, after playing Civ 5 with all the DLC, Civ BE is kind of underwhelming. I think the biggest reason it comes short though is because of the limited number of factions. Only 8! If you want to play with more than 8, you either have to mod up (especially a pain in the ♥♥♥ for multiplayer or nigh impossible for non-Windows users), or overlap different players with the same "sponsor." Yes, the game does make it possible to do this and changes the color for the players using the same team, but, it's kind of a turn off to me to have to keep track of purple Brasil and green Brasil...\n\nOn the plus side though, and overall I do give this game a thumbs up (when it's on sale!), it does add a number of cool things ..... the Affinity branches and the technology web (that's right web... not tree) come to mind. The way units upgrade across the board as you increase Affinity levels is kind of cool. Being able to pick your upgrade bonuses and even mix Affinity branches up a little bit is kind of cool. Barbarians (aliens) are now much more interesting and can actually change hostility toward individual civs. And purely for flavor, the sci-fi battles and multiple terrain textures (desert / fungal / terran planets) are fun.\n\nSo, for Civ 5 + DLC fans, Civ BE right now is indeed not worth the big $. You'll miss nukes. You'll miss 20+ unique factions. However, if you enjoy sci-fi flare, it's worth it on sale. Get it for $20 or maybe even $30, depending on your impatience levels. Meh. Poor game deserves better than a 53% rating. Awww.","March 12, 2015","true","194.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It wasn't until its DLCs released that it became a solid title.\n\nBeyond Earth, at its release, is unifinished and lacking in polish.\n\nI have no doubt that BE will become a solid title once it's polished up (via DLCs, I'm sure). At that point, it'll be worth buying. Until then, it's a nice beta release.\n\n- edit - 07/24/2015 -edit-\n\nStill a down-vote. It's a neat title with lots of possibility--but the diplomacy is still weak, and the game is still lacking in character or soul or personality. The devs have, themselves, admitted to this, and I think this is one of the things that will be DLCed up in the coming months.\n\nOn a more interesting note, I find it neat that a large number of the wonders had to be rebalanced to simply be considered useful. Just speaks to how not-ready this title was for release.\n\nIn any case, DLC will be out in a bit. I'll probably Day 1 Download because, hey, why not.","November 2, 2014","false","58.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalgeeear/recommended/65980/","metalgeeear","A Luigi Misfire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalgeeear/","196 products in account","A very deep and thought provoking 4X...if only for a few hours. Only can recommend for those who are very hardcore Civilization fans and are willing to shell out $50 for about as much content as Civ 5 had at release.\nPros and Cons further down, TL:DR version here.\nDO NOT purchase this game if you have not played Civilization V with all the DLC and are looking for a good Strategy game. You can get Civilization V Complete for the same price as this and have hundreds of hundreds of hours of content between the DLC and the Workshop. I only recommend this for the very hardcore Civilization fans who can deal with not amount of content. Firaxis always has expansions to their games now, so I would wait until the first expansion is out to consider this game, if you're in need of a new 4X play Age of Wonders 3 or Endless Legend, you can even go old school and kick it with Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.\nIf you have $50 to spend then go for it. This is a really good game and it shows, but the lack of content will leave you wanting more and the price tag is not enough for me to recommend it to anyone but the most fanatical Civ fans.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Deep and thought provoking narritive into the victories and how you advance as a civilization. Augmenting yourself with technology or becoming more alien, or rejecting the two.\n+ Huge UI improvements, everything is much neater than Civilization V, no more right-clicking through 200 Citystate messages and quests.\n+ Non-Linear technology web, allows players to plan and use more strategy in their game.\n+ Steam Workshop Support\n+ Builds off the Civilization V engine, allowing newcomers to feel welcome and experts to jump right into the game and expierence the new features themselves.\n+ Revamped policy system,  lots of bonuses and extra goodies allowing for a much better time for those who don't rake in loads of culture, while rewarding those who do.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of content is HUGE in this game, especially coming off the wealth of content Civilization V with all the DLC had. Games take nowhere near as long as in Civ V. You will find yourself out of things to build reletively quickly, not many buildings and units.\n- Maps are reletively small and barren, there aren't any landmarks to discover and there aren't enough Civilizations to have a large map akin to Earth like in Civilization V, there's no real thrill to exploring, just getting slaughtered by aliens.\n- Diplomacy is non-existent. It's just like how it was in Civilization V, but doesn't take intol account the futuristic setting very well. Trading resources means nothing because you don't need any (besides oil), the ones you need are granted to you by developing affinities, and they do not do anything for your people (no happiness increase, no city-state quests to fufill, no we love the king day)\n- AI is brain dead. Every game I've played the AI doesn't go for a victory other than Domination. They end up warring with each other eternally, attacking aliens (attacking aliens make every alien on the map more hostile to any civilization) and just having so many units that they lose hundreds of energy (currency) per turn.\n- Barely any buildings to make, no units either.\n- No Great People, even Generals and Admirals.\n- Games take a short amount of time, even on Normal and Epic times due to the ease to achieve victory and lack of other content.\n\nI'd give it about an average score, 6/10. What's there works well and blends nicely into the game, it runs very well and everything looks gorgeous. But it's not enough to keep your attention for more than a little bit at a time (you can obviously tell from my playtime. I have ten times this on Civ 5.) Wait until more expansions come out and the price drops. This game is NOT worth $50. It's worth $20.\n\n","January 12, 2015","false","11.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
