The emotional connection the viewer feels when Sam gets told to sort his socks, as well as the impending danger imposed upon the viewer when Sam decides to "shut his eyes for just a bit" before doing so, are both so incredibly deep and resplendent that the only way to describe this is as an experience. You look at good art; you experience timeless art. Similarly, you experience Pajama Sam's Sock Works instead of merely playing it. This game is a feast - a delight to the senses - and has earned its place in the phenomenal Pajama Sam series.","December 14, 2014","true","0.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","18","19","9","0"

As usual for the humongous arcade games there's a degree of luck here, but it's never crippling enough to the point where you can be forced into impossible situation, and it's still mostly a reactive thinking exercise. It never gets too difficult but it's not that easy, either, and it's really quite enjoyable for what it is.","November 20, 2014","true","2.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I would say, the level customization was the best feature the game offered.\n\nThe soundtrack is impressive and is soothing. Guess what? I owe my childhood to Jeremy Soule for making the music! If the name is not recognizable, The Elder Scrolls might ring a bell.\n\nOf course, the game has not aged well and looking back, the gameplay is very limited. It gets very repetitive and I doubt anyone would be willing to play the campaign mode twice. The level customization does help a little but due to the small and clunky interface, it does get boring after a while because of the limitations.\n\nEssentially, the only redeemable parts of the game was the music and the ability to make custom levels. Sock Works does not offer anything new otherwise, as it is essentially taken from "Buzzy The Knowledge Bug: Let's Explore the Airport" minigame.\n\nSo then, why do I recommend this game? It's for nostalgia and good for a one-time playthrough as now, the game is easily forgotten due to better games now. As such, get the game at a deep discount if interest still holds.","May 13","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

The object of the game is to control various convoy belts and other machines to sort out the right color socks in the right color baskets. As you progress further into the game, the later levels get trickier and other times, the levels are simply easy. Keep in mind that this is not an adventure game like the main franchise with the whole exploration and point and click scenario. Which is why I refer to it as a "spin-off" features Pajama Sam in a mini game theme game. If you like the Pajama Sam adventure games, then you may like this one. It's overrall an addicting game to make the time go by.","July 4, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
