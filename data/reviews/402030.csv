It's very easy to pick up and play, and you can get going within seconds, Aside from all the usual options desired by shmuppers (rotatable screen being the main one), you can also change the music pack used by the game. I haven't tried out the option just yet, but I imagine I could use Cave's music, for example.\n\nI'm not one for longer reviews, but I also want to praise the music and the art, since it becomes immediately clear that a lot of love was put into both these aspects. It feels a bit like I'm playing an Amiga game, and this is high praise in my book.","October 14, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

You may also remember me being one of the people streaming an early build not too long ago and showing off an Arcade full clear. It's remarkable to see how much this game has grown since it's origins and the journey was fun.\n\nThis game really does hail back to a time when things were more simple without a crazy tedious scoring system that may drive oneself to madness.  It's fun, easy to get into, yet still hectic when playing to break scores, while offering enough variety in ships and modes to not be put down after one go.  If you like games where you see your score climb to stupid high amounts on an exponential scale, this can make you smile. Also, make note that your bombs are tied both to survival and to scoring.  Throw everything together and it should make for an interesting combination to see what everyone pulls off...","October 15, 2015","true","30.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/robotater/recommended/402030/","robotater","[воом] come have a gander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/robotater/","283 products in account","Product received for free\n\nProvided by Giveaways Reborn\nZenohell is a fast-paced bullet hell space shooter in a 16-bit style.\n\nPresentationThe graphics are spot-on, looking exactly like something that would have come out for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive or the Turbo Grafix 16/PC Engine. The sound effects are great, except for the shooting sound effect of the player's ship, which is essentially just a click, but it's usually so buried under other sounds that it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe music sounds fantastic and really fits in with the fast-paced and chaotic gameplay, but it was kind of disappointing in that it didn't really fit with the whole 16-bit aesthetic, so instead of sounding like a midi from a Sound Blaster or anything that would have come out of a 16-bit system, it sounds like modern electronic music (which it is).\n\nControlsOn a keyboard, the game controls quite nicely, using the standard emulator presets of Shift, Z, and X as the action buttons and the arrow keys for movement. The use of Shift as one of the action keys feels awkward at times, but it's nothing a quick rebind can't fix.\n\nUsing a controller, the joystick controls to move the ship feel quite jerky, with the ship only moving in eight directions, while the joystick, of course, moves in all 360 degrees. The action buttons don't work on first time startup, and must be manually bound using the options menu.\n\nPlotThe plot in this game is negligible. It is the standard "aliens are attacking! Save us!" Of course, plot isn't the main draw for this game.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay is fast-paced and simple. The goal, of course, is to shoot all of the bad guys. To do this, the player has a choice between multiple ships, each of which plays differently. The main difference between the ships is their shot patterns, which, depending on the ship chosen, can drastically change the way the game is played.\n\nThe player is given three weapons: the basic shot, a bomb that clears the screen of enemies' shots and gives the player invincibility for a short time, and a "focus shot" which is the basic shot, but slightly more powerful.\n\nThe fast-paced nature of the game makes it quite difficult to dodge enemy projectiles, which seem to be everywhere. This challenge is what makes the game, really, since the enemies are really quite easy to defeat simply by holding down the shoot button.\n\nThere is a subtle strategy to using the bombs, since the player is only given three at the beginning of the level and there is no way to replenish them.\n\nThe game allows for infinite continues, which is wonderful, because it is ridiculously difficult at times.\n\nReplayabilityThe game is essentially an arcade game, and always has the incentive of trying to get a higher score (or not use continues).\n\nConclusionZenohell is a bullet hell shooter, that, while it has its flaws, is thoroughly enjoying and does what it sets out to do.\n\nFollow Giveaways Reborn ! curator for more reviews\nThis game has been given away in Giveaways Reborn !","June 5","true","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omega5102/recommended/402030/","omega5102","Omega5102","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omega5102/","319 products in account","Retro style Shoot em' up with simple mechanics\nZenohell reminded me of some of the games I used to play in the arcade when I was a kid, such as 1941. The game uses similiar mechanics; eliminate all enemies on screen, while at the same time avoiding the constant barrage of enemy projectiles filling the screen. The gameplay is similar to the classic shoot em' ups, where you have to avoid enemy projectiles while also trying to gain the most points possible. The game gives you three ships to choose from, each with different patterns of fire, and stats. This gives the game variety, and adds some extra challenge. Zenohell stays true the genre and is definitely worth playing if you enjoyed games of the 90s shoot em' up genre.\n\nPROS\nFun, engaging gameplay\nDifferent ships gives gameplay variety\nFun Bosh Rush mode\nStays true to genre\nMusic reminiscent of older shmups\nSimple, easy to learn controls\nVisuals resemble that of classic shoot em' ups\nCONS\nToo short; I completed the first gamemode within 30 minutes\nBosses lack variety\nEnemy patterns are often too similar\nSummary:\nThis game is perfect for those who miss the shoot em' ups of the 90s, or people new to the genre willing to give it a try. I had a lot of fun with this game, although I was disappointed when I finished it so quickly. However the Boss Rush mode is a fun addition to the game, for those who complete the campaign.\n\nRating:\nI'd give Zenohell an 8/10.\n\nWant more recommendations?
