That in itself makes it worth a recommendation for me.\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about but the gameplay is solid, and it's always fun driving around blowing up other cars.\nThe AI starts out braindead but as you progress, it begins to give more and more of a challenge.","June 26, 2014","true","3.8"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","1"

You are driving a truck that can switch between a race mode with jet engines on the back and a battle mode where it is bristling with weapons and spikes how can this not be awesome? However it somehow manages to  be mediocre. As you progress through the game you unlock new weapons and upgrades for you truck. The developers have tried very hard to add a variety in the missions but they basically all come down to racing or destroying stuff. The story is okay, it strings the races together but it is nothing spectacular. This game will provide a few hours of anarchic fun but it is not one you are going to keep coming back to.","May 17, 2015","true","6.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","4"

But the truth is there is very little to have fun with. The game is dated, no one plays online, the arcade singleplayer action is too easy. In just a few minutes I went through 1/3 of the races, all in first place or top speed through. Wish I could say something about this game was fun as racing with semi trucks is a really fun idea, espicially since I'm a truck driver. But sadly there is nothing I can say that is good. Even the music wasnt great for its time, and when someone was talking they talked unbearably slow or generic. 1 out of 5 stars.","March 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 57 of 104 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","57","104","0","0"

For anyone who has played Twisted Metal (The ones on PS1) and remembers Darkside, this is pretty much that. So for Twisted Metal fans I will recommend this game but overall I just won't recommend it for how easy it is.","March 6","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/losergeek/recommended/285520/","losergeek","Joshua","http://steamcommunity.com/id/losergeek/","2883 products in account","There are elements of fun here, but inconsistent framerate and less-than-perfect controls keep it from being everything it could be. Any events that don't require precision are decently entertaining, but unfortunately those are too few and far between. I'll just go back to dreaming about Burnout Revenge getting a PC release.\n\nUpdate: After changing the .exe to launch in Windows XP compatibility mode, performance is improved slightly. Still not great, and not enough to change my mind about not recommending it, but it does make the game more playable, if anyone is experiencing the same problems I am with choppy framerate.","September 2, 2014","false","2.1"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

You have front bumper spikes, side spinning saws (later), front firing weapons (primary and secondary), and rear mine dispensers. Your truck can also be upgraded with better armor, transmission, engine, and so on.\n\nThe fighting is about what you'd expect in such a game... You are in 3rd person but very low, so your truck will obstruct your view ahead. Fortunately you can pretty much run through almost anything in your way, or your shoot your way through. There are missions that are pure racing (where you use racing mode, complete with afterburning engines) pure combat (survive arena for X seconds), or run-n-gun (fight enemies as you try to make it through checkpoints). The more you kill the more time on the clock you get, but the the more damage you suffer. There are a few oddball missions such as "pilot a RC bomb drone" or "max speed into a cafe".\n\nThe problem is the first level's "end mission". Instead of a boss fight, you're basically put into a gauntlet that's basically 3 missions together. First is a checkpoint race where you need to pass through little tokens to get extra time. When you reach a mall you crash through to land and found the way's blocked, and you need to kill X police cars to get out. Then it's a long run-n-gun to the final endpoint... where I've tried about 10 times, with max upgrades, and I keep running out of time (the only way to gain time is kill the cops, and they sometimes aren't fast enough so you can't kill them (or I'm taking too many go-fast upgrades?!)  So I can't even get onto "level 2" (i.e. next city).\n\nVoiceover is atrocious, storyline is outrageous, sound is... mediocre. Graphics are tolerable. This is a weird game. If you like your idea of wanton destruction, give it a try. But not quite my cup of tea.","December 15, 2014","false","2.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","2"
