After having spent a great deal of time playing this on console, I was more than thrilled to hear an updated version of Super Time Force was making its way to Steam with new playable characters and extra content. Bought to us by the fellows people over at Capybara Games -  this once Xbox 360/Xbox One exclusive has finally arrived to grace our PCs. Filled with humorous time-travel tropes and classic side-scrolling action, I was delighted to add this charming little game to my Steam library.\n\nGameplay Super Time Force Ultra (aka STFU)  brings an innovative twist to the side-scrolling, run n’ gun action shooter genre. One can say it’s a mix between Contra and Braid. The player takes control of the Super Time Force; an ever growing squad of time-traveling military agents with the ability to…well…control time!\n\nWhile you’ll only be controlling one squad member at a time, you can freeze/rewind time and spawn in as another member of your squad. Doing so will not erase your previous actions; instead you’ll fight alongside your previous character. It only takes one hit to kill you. Rewinding time to prevent a squad member’s death will turn them into a power-up which you can collect. Due to the silly nature of this mechanic, it’s possible to have duplicate characters fighting on the screen at once, which can clutter the screen up a quite bit and make it pretty chaotic, but that's part of fun.\n\nWhen it comes down to the core of the game, you’ll be using these mechanics to boost your firepower, fix any blunders you’ve made, or experiment around with different moves. Just remember, you’ll be working against the clock; missions are timed, but you can collect extra time, as well as lives, and other collectibles. Upon completing a stage, you are treated to a nice replay of your carnage (from start to finish) in real time. Think of it as what a bystander would see (without all the time powers.) It’s a pretty neat feature.\n\nCharacters, Stages, and EnemiesThe full roster originally consisted of 16 playable characters, but with the addition of Pyro, Zoey, and Saxton Hale in STFU - the full roster is now boosted to 19. Capy did a fantastic job making each squad member likeable and unique; each has his/her own unique abilities, which consist of a standard attack and a special charged move. New characters are unlocked by rescuing from hilarious predicaments during missions, collecting collectibles, or beating challenge stages.\n\nOne of my favorite things about the game is the stage selection – You’ll appreciate this if you’re a fan of Mega Man! After the intro stage, you can choose to tackle whichever stage you want, right off the bat - Mega Man style! Stages are imaginative and diverse. In one stage you’ll find yourself fighting dinosaurs in prehistoric times; in another you’ll be traveling through Atlantis. I absolutely adore the design and liveliness of each level!\n\nMuch like the stages, every enemy is themed appropriately to the stage/scenario they are on. Some fly and act as stage hazards, while others fire projectiles or try to get up close and melee you. The bosses are especially well crafted, each having amusing quirks in their design. The boss fights themselves are massive in scale, but in the end, it all comes down to how many squad members you can get on screen to defeat the boss as quickly as possible before time runs out.\n\nAesthetic and SoundI’m just going to say it, I’m a sucker for pixel art. Everything I mentioned previously from characters, stages, and bosses are all wonderfully crafted. Even if it’s just sprites, I can tell Capy put a great deal of love and care into creating their assets.\n\nThe outstanding soundtrack undoubtedly does the game justice. Starting the game, you are immediately welcomed by a fantastic chiptune track composed by the talented Jason DeGroo. He did a spectacular job and I would recommend checking out the 53-track album if you have the time. Also, the sound FX is spot on and fits the action on screen beautifully.\n\nThe Charming StoryIf you’re looking for a serious story, you’re in the wrong place. STFU’s story is erratic and makes no sense. Why did we go back to prehistoric times? Well, to save the dinosaurs so they can live alongside us. Why did we go back to medieval times to find the Holy Grail? Well, to save a chain of medieval themed restaurants, of course.  It doesn’t take itself seriously and is filled with paradoxes, but I guess that’s what makes STFU so charming and why I absolutely adore it.\n\nWorth the Price?One playthrough (not counting any of the challenge stages) can take roughly 3-5 hours. That said, it has high replayability - there are secret unlockable, achievements and new modes to play to explore. $15 is the asking price and I’d say it’s worth it for a good time, especially if it’s on sale!\n\nMy Final 2 CentsHonestly, I can’t praise this game enough. Capybara Games did a stellar job bringing this to PC and giving us Steam users some extra love. There are humorous and memorable moments to be had and I guarantee STFU will put a smile on your face.\n\nHighly recommended, ESPECIALLY if you’re an old school gamer looking for a fresh and interesting concept.","August 25, 2014","true","9.0"," 298 of 324 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","298","324","6","16"

Heh. I’m not telling you to be quiet but STFU is the abbreviation for Super Time Force Ultra a game which managed to make me get hooked from the very start.\n\nHave you ever wanted a co-op game which gets rid of the co op part?\nYou might probably say ’Bu-But … u iz not makin’ sense! Well relax kiddo and listen.\nFor some people this might be a dream come true. You can co op and to be honest you’re forced to at nearly all times. Sounds weird doesn’t it?\nWell here comes the super fun part of STFU! You have to co op with yourself!\nSay whaaaaaaat? That’s right folks. You have the super, awesome yes I want to say even godlike power of controlling time: TIME OUT!\n\nSo what does this mean.\nLet’s take this quote from the Developer’s Homepage:\n\nTIME OUT LETS YOU STOP TIME AND REWIND BACK THROUGH WHAT YOU JUST DID!\nTHEN YOU CAN JUMP BACK INTO THE ACTION WITH A NEW CHARACTER AND PLAY ALONGSIDE YOUR PAST SELF IN THE PAST, WHICH IS NOW THE PRESENT… WHOA.\nYOU CAN USE TIME OUT TO PARTNER UP WITH YOURSELF IN THE GOOD OL’ DAYS OF A FEW SECONDS AGO, CREATING A VERITABLE ARMY OF YOU(S).\n...Woah Dude. Mind blown right? Doesn’t this sound just awesome?\nAnd boy the whole game is definitely something else.\n\nThere are a ton of characters you can play as, including favorites from TF2 and L4D.\nYou’ll die in six different time periods. Oh yeah you will die don’t argue with me on that. In fact you will die a lot my friend. Before you you complain or might even end up crying let me quote the developer again:\n\nBUT DYING IS PART OF THE STRATEGIZING, SO DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT! WHEN YOU DIE, YOU CAN JUST REWIND TIME, ADD MORE FIREPOWER AND GO!\nSo quit your whining and go! More firepower equals more fun equals you enjoying this game probably way more than you should!\n\nStoryLet’s make it short right here. Because the story is rather confusing since it involves time travel and to make you understand how time travel works I’d have to go deep into the world of physics and you’d still wouldn’t get it … well I don’t quite get it but it’s possible! At least in STFU!\nYou’re a scientist, with one eye, yes this is important I’ll get back later to i, in 1987 discovering the theory of time travel. Short after the world turns upside down. Your biggest concern: Can you use time travel to go back in time and save your beloved car? A Toyota?\nRight after someone appears. A Guy that looks exactly like you but he lost both of his eyeballs and wears two eye patches! See? Not one but two! It’s your future self! So after a sweet talk you know what you have to do: Saving the Earth!\n\nThis is as much as I can spoil the story at the moment because: Time Travel. It would be too confusing.\n\nAtmosphereFun, crazy, high paced and gorgeous. ‘Nuff said let’s move on!\nGuess I have to expand a bit on it right?\nWell alright. Crazy would be really the best way to describe the feeling I get by playing it.\nThere’s no need to decide whether you want to use Shieldy Blockerson, using a Shield as his weapon or Jean Rambois wielding, guess what, a Machine Gun of course! I mean if you fancy both you can use’em at the same time! Sorta. Well if you happen to activate a Time Out and trust you will, you’ll can go ahead and collect your buddy as a power up turning into this nearly indestructible dude or gal … or reptile.\n\nThe Pixel Art in this game is fitting and trust me when I’m telling you the game would look horrible if it would have been made in 3D. Not to mention it wouldn’t be fun anymore.\nUsing Pixel Art for a game like this just boosts the crazy factor.\nNot to mention the music, if you can hear it over the sounds of exploding robots and bullet shells flying all over the place, just adds something to the game which let’s you forget time.\n\nNot to mention the dialogues. Oh they’re glorious. Fancy. Crazy and so much more … You just have to fall in love with the Doc of the future. He’s a real man.\n\nGameplayI talked about it earlier but the biggest focus of STFU would be the Time Out feature.\nYou have to use it if someone dies or is about to die. If you want to blow open a gate and you’re not strong enough to do it alone. Just Time Out and go back in time and show, whoever or whatever you want to show it to, who’s boss!\nBut that’s not all. The real beauty of the game is the, let’s just call it, single player co op.\nYou’ll have to think on the stats which characters you’re going to use in which way to face certain enemies or situations.\nBesides that the game’s crazy, high paced and above all else: Challenging.\n\nI’d like to go as far as to say that this game is similar to Demon’s Souls. Similar as in it will punish you from the very start and throw you into situations where you could end up throwing your controller at your screen.\nBut then again that’s the beauty of the game. It’s challenging and rewarding. Finishing a level nearly unharmed or so … a good feeling.\n\nVisualsPixel Art is love. Pixel Art is life. STFU is just another example why Pixel Art will, hopefully, never and should never die. It gives games a certain charm on it’s own.\n\nWhat else can I say?...Woah dude. Crazy.\nYeah I can’t emphasis the crazy part enough. I mean the game’s gorgeous and looks absolutely fantastic but above all else the game’s stupid and crazy and I love it such much because of it.\nThe Intro alone got me hooked … I mean … If you read that boy you’ll end up loving the game on the spot. It’s just so good.\nTo be honest I should have bought the game full price. And not on sale. It seriously deserves every penny.\nAnd a shout out to my dear and annoying friend TimLol aka ScumSol for showing this game to me.","June 14, 2015","true","2.4"," 59 of 74 people (80%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","80","59","74","16","3"

Just an FYI.\n\nSuper Time Force is one of the best games I've played this year, period. Its so fun. And thats the most important thing, isn't it? Its incredibly fun. The gameplay is solid and introduces a mechanic that improves the action platformer so much that I wouldn't mind seeing a few other games incorperate something like this, because my god is it amazing.\n\nThe time travel. Its incredibly fun and satisfying to fly back in time to kill an enemy that killed one of your other teamates, and possibly save his life. You can then absorbe their life and now you're able to take even more hits(One more, to be exact). This doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you see it in action, believe me, its a lot of fun. Another thing this game does very well is it makes the entire team important. There will be situations where your wondering how to solve it, and maybe you'll pull out a teamate you wouldn't really think to use. It just adds so much more to the game and makes it that much more enjoyable.\n\nI'm about halfway through the game and if I was going to make any sort of complaint it would be the story/humor. For one, the humor is just bad in my opinion. Its like the borderlands-esque trying really hard to be funny and it just makes me cringe kind of humor, for that reason the rest of the story is just garbage to me, because its based so much on this terrible sense of humor(in my opinion). It falls flat, and its really a shame because the rest of the game is so amazing.\n\nI suppose gameplay is king here, but if you're gonna try and write funny humor, don't make it so horrible that I'm cringing when I try and read your dialogue.\n\nI don't really do ratings anymore, so I'll say this. I recommend this game at full price, absolutely. Especially if your into the kind of humor the game produces. One of the best games of the year so far, hope to see more great things from Capybara Games.\n\nEdit: I have now finished the main story of the game. I still love this game as much as I did when I wrote this. The story is still horrible.\n\nBuy At Full Price","September 1, 2014","true","9.4"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","43","49","0","2"

But the way time travel is used here is great, it puts me in that "speedruning" mindset, but it barely ever feels stressfull to have a strict time limit AND limited lives for a level. The challenge mode can be mindmelting  sometimes, but the story mode is a big goofy romp the whole way through. It has just enough difficulty to make you think you arent going to beat it, but you are given allot of leeway, and it is immensly satasfying once you reach the end and the level and the replay shows everything falling into place perfectly.\nMy only complaints are about the shortness of the story campaign, and the way the characters are done.\nBasicly the only things that separate the characters are what their weapon and their hitbox, i wound have liked to see more passive differences, and better balence between the characters (i found myself returning over and over to a few favorites.) I also think that a replay saving system would be nice, and perhaps a highscore board similar to dustforce.\nGet this game. Right now. Go on. Why are you still reading?

But before you can begin to use it to make the world more better robots start falling from the sky, everything starts exploding, and a future version of yourself appears in front of you. Turns out time travel isn't quite all it's cracked up to be, but that's OK because the Super Time Force is here to fix all the stuff you screwed up and make the world more awesome for everyone! Though it's probably Capy I should thank, not the STF, for giving me some an awesome...time, with one of the most outrageously fun and intensely smart games I've played all year!\n\nSuper Time Force Ultra (the last word being as this is an updated version of the Xbox One/360 game) is a side scrolling shooter ala Contra, but with an insanely clever implementation of a time manipulation mechanic. The gist of this is you have the ability to rewind time at will, letting you back up and remedy a poorly done section or avoid a grisly death, all while your other character continues to run on their own timeline repeating your entire previous run before you rewound. What this means practically is you have the ability to stack characters on top of each other, allowing you to clear huge amounts of enemies, collect items, and quickly decimate bosses incredibly fast as dozens of versions of yourself run along the screen at once. Think the replay mode at the end of a Super Meat Boy level, except now everyone has guns.\n\nBut the mechanic doesn't stop as just a rewind button, but also allows you to save other versions of yourself by killing an enemy before they get to you, and then stacking your saved character onto yourself and doubling your firepower and lifespan. This not only lessens the blow of death, but actually makes it rewarding and almost encouraged, as well as completely destroying the frustration of a difficult segment or challenging enemy as it's so easy to rewind and do it again.\n\nWith so much rewinding and replaying segments it would be easy to have the pacing be absolutely sluggish and repetitive, but STFU accounts for this by giving you but 60 seconds to run through levels (though there are certain collectibles that extend this slightly) making it an all out dash for the end before time runs out. Frequently I'd find myself playing for hours without ever realizing it, as with everything moving so fast and absolutely no downtime it's ever so easy to melt away into the game and have it feel as if no time has passed at all.\n\nI realize trying to take this all in makes STFU sounds like an immensely complex and stressful game, but the genius of it is that as soon as you get your hands on it everything is shockingly intuitive. Reading the "how to play" summary before starting the game had my head spinning, but within moments of playing the game everything fell into place and only continued to become more engaging and creative the longer I played and experimented with them. STFU is incredibly smart yet completely accessible to anyone that picks up the controller, and it's this fact that allows it to break out of the realm of just an interesting idea to being an insanely fun experience. It balances intelligent design with pure joy and entertainment with a deftness that is rarely achieved in any genre, no less one that has been floundering in a pool of uninspired mediocrity for the last several years.\n\nBut maybe ultimately what makes STFU so gratuitously delightful to play is the sheer amount of unrestrained fun you can feel emanating from every bit of the experience. From the gorgeously colorful art style, to the silly writing and even more ridiculous scenarios it's abundantly clear how much work developer Capy Games put into the game to make every single second as abundantly entertaining as it is. It's been far too long since I've played a game for the sole purpose of enjoying the hell out of it, and to be perfectly honest I cannot think of a single thing to complain about or that I feel could be improved upon in STFU. Capy has achieved excellence in all areas of design, and deserve a significant amount of commendation for what is almost certainly the most impressive game they've made in a long line of critical hits, and I can't thank them enough for finally bringing to PC.\n\nIn short I've had the time of my life, and can't wait to do it all over again (and I won't even need a time machine to do so)!\n\nFull disclosure: Super Time Force Ultra was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/250700/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","At first glance, Super Time Force looks like a Metal Slug/Contra type of game: a 2D side-scroller in the run'n'gun vein.\nWhile the aspect is similar, the gameplay is in fact very different, for better or worse.\n\nThe special feature of Super Time Force is to rewind time in the level while the previous occurrence of the player will do the same exact action. The player spawns with a new/same character, at an earlier point of time in the level, and exists alongside his past selves.\nIt is then possible to prevent the death of previous characters to pick them up for bonus combo attacks, or to be multiple characters shooting at the same target to gain time in destroying something, as there is a time limit to finish the level (which is very generous with all the bonus pick-ups to increase the time on the clock).\nAt the end of a mission, a replay allows to see an army of the player storming through the level and wreaking complete chaos.\nThis time feature is particularly well done and makes the game really really fun, as the players create their own challenges and time puzzles.\nThere is quite some variety in the level design and the atmosphere of the different levels (dinosaurs, post-apo, medieval, futuristic, etc), so it keeps feeling fresh and interesting.\n\nThe problem is that the gameplay itself is not exactly the best. Unlike for instance Broforce, most characters can shoot in diagonals and up or down. This sounds like a good idea of course, but it is badly implemented. Games where you move and shoot independently do the twin-stick formula. On PC, it would mean moving and jumping on WASD and using the mouse to aim and shoot. But no, they went with the same stick/WASD both for aiming and moving, which removes the possibility to navigate fluidly through opponents while disposing of the enemies that are on a different plane than the player, and a LOT of enemies are on a different plane instead of just facing the player. The placement of the enemies is good, don't get me wrong. It just feels imprecise and approximate with the current control scheme. Thankfully the game is reactive and not clunky, but really I wish the moving and aiming was better implemented to reflect the complexity of the game. The developers came up with buttons to lock the player from moving or to keep aiming in a specific direction, which seems like a weird patch-up instead of just using the mouse/another stick to aim. Especially on PC!\n\nThere are tons of characters to unlock, even if the main first ones are often the most suited. They different abilities are great and complement each other, it is really fun to use them and to think about which is best for which situation.\n\nThe story is simple, fun and silly, and the graphics are.... Well, it's a matter of taste, but from the developers of Sword  and Sworcery I expected better. Everything in Super Time Force is very minimalistic and cubical, even a lot of effects. I did not really like the art style despite liking the variety in the environments and missions.\n\nAs a conclusion, this is a game with a great novel game mechanic that is fully mastered, and just in addition to the fun of shooting with interesting and different characters, it is worth playing it. The downside are the controls, having movement and aiming on the same keys does not suit a game with so many actions and it makes it feel imprecise and approximate. Movements/jump on WASD and aiming on the mouse would have felt so much better!","January 17, 2015","true","9.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Like Dark Souls, it is a game that will punish you in the beginning, forcing you to learn its mechanics, and eventually master them. Once you do, you will feel very powerful, and the game becomes quite rewarding as you burn through the stages with a mini-army of your past selves. It's a great concept that borrows from its predecessors, yet still creates something very new and fresh. The game's sense of humor is wonderful, and the ending is the best I've seen in any game in 2014. An original, enjoyable work by a very talented developer.","December 18, 2014","true","8.8"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","21","28","0","0"

I think they're a really cheap way to make something humourous. At least try to make your jokes work on more than one level. Cracking stupid jokes based on some loose utterances while acting all clever is really funny...[Rewind]\n\nSo anyone who ever played Super Meatboy will attest that platforming games can be extremely unfogiving. Especially SMB, that just throws you back to start even if you mess up two pixels before the end. Wouldn't it be cool if you could rewind your game for a second or two, just to get that jump right? Super Time Force Ultra has you covered.\n\nRachet and Clank Future had these puzzles where you're constantly rewind time to move in tandem with yourself to open doors and stuff. They were really ingenious and I liked them very much because they made you think on more than one level. Unlike puns that are just flat gaffes that no one can really...[Rewind]\n\nSTFU (Yes, they made a pun....[Rewind]\n\nSTFU is a retro-style run and gun shooter where you play as a squad of inter-temporal mercenaries that have to stop some robots from messing up the course of history. However, your team prefers the "All solving hammer approach" and just makes due with shooting everything. The main key here is that you have about a minute to complete a stage. Not nearly enough. However, because you can rewind time to any point beyond the first second, you can run through segments, while you let your past selves deal with the enemies. If you end up dying, you can rewind to come in with a different weapon to tackle the enemy, rewind again to walk again, but this time the enemy will be blown up before it can hit you.\n\nThe mechanic is easy to use and tough to master. Seasoned players will find themselves growing comfortable with building a spectacular setup that resolves and obstacle in mere seconds, while beginners will be pleased that the retry button is lenient enough to keep them coming back.\n\nThe characters borrow heavilty from pop-culture and puns. Even the dialog is in a league of its own when it comes to making the same pun over and over again. The whole game revolves around repetition so it isn't entirely weird that names like Jean Rambois, Dolphin Lundgren and Melanie Gibson (pretending to be the road warrior) show up. It is groan inducing at times, but you'll get through it in time....Crap I just made a time pun. [Rewind]\n\nThe chaos on screen can pile up to such a degree that you wonder how you managed to get it done in the first place. Luckily the game replays your run through a level to show you just how clever you were at the time. Damnit! [Rewind]\n\nSo, all in all, be sure to check this game out, because it is well worth your time. ...[Rewind]\n\nJust play it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NatePyrokai/recommended/250700/","NatePyrokai","Dr. Sexy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NatePyrokai/","268 products in account","It feels pretty bad wanting to write a bad review of this game, but after several times of picking it up and slogging my way through it I kept having the same problems over and over.\n\nOn the surface the game has a very fun pixel aesthetic, and the music more than adequately captures the mood of the game. However, this game is almost exclusively aesthetic.\n\nThe games core mechanic is around using different characters to work your way through a level--You can only take 1 hit before you die, but you can rewind time at any point and respawn with the same, or a new character. The games challenge comes from using characters to quickly overcome set pieces and race against the clock, which has a very tight time constraint. You're only allowed so many respawns too, which (in theory) should force you to use your rewinds/respawns effectively.\n\nThe problem with this game is that almost everything can be brute-forced and the set pieces end up providing little to no challenge during the games stages. Overcoming the set pieces is tedious and repetative, and using characters effectively doesn't provide any real rewarding feedback, and this is due to an overabundance of available resets.\n\nAlmost all the stages can be taken down with a single character, and whereas the game is not entirely intended to be played that way, there is literally no encouragement to do otherwise. This is largely due to some of the characters being incredibly niche in their application since each character only has 2 moves: Their standard attack and a charge attack. So more than likely you'll find yourself comfortable with 1 or 2 characters, only branching out in a desperate attempt to inject some life into the shockingly mundane experience.\n\nThe game comes alive during the boss fights, which if the game was only the boss fights (and the mildly entertaining puzzle rooms) I would actually recommend it without much thought. Using your entire rewind pool to take down one very overpowered enemy ends up feeling relatively exciting because of the nature of being able to overcome pattern in one cohesive string of actions. However, ultimately, like the stages, this doesn't feel immensely rewarding despite it's flash-in-the-pan fun due to the players ability to slam their head against the enemy until it's dead.\n\nAlso the the writing is horrendous. HORRENDOUS. Whereas I don't require much story in my games, and in fact I usually want it to be as unintrusive as possible when it comes to platformers, I simply could not ignore the juvenille attempt at humor that this game crams down your throat. For a game with the potential to be played semi-serious for some great humor, it devolves to sophmorish poop and violence jokes. I wish I could've ignored it, but the game makes a point early that it wants to be at some part narrative to justify your adventure, but the justification is so garbage that I spent most of the time wishing it wasn't there.\n\nCould you have fun playing this game? Probably. Can I recommend this game? Not even remotely. Unfortunately the games uncompelling gameplay and ♥♥♥♥♥♥-chill inducing writing leaves a title with high potentail stranded in the dime-a-dozen pixel aesthetic indie games as of late.\n0 Comments","January 28, 2015","false","3.3"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

If you explained it to someone it'd be simple:\n\n"It's a side-scrolling run 'n gun game except you can rewind time if you mess up."\n\nBut once you get your hands on it you'll start to realize it's so much more then just "rewind if you mess up". You can rewind to help yourself kill a boss in 2 seconds instead of 15. Speed up certain stage segments by being in multiple places at once all at the same time, etc, etc.\n\nGetting into the game you'll quickly notice that the story isn't what drives this game. It's quirky, witty and not afraid to make fun of itself but eventually the jokes just get stale; thankfully we're not all buying this for the story and if you are then I'd recommend another game all together.\n\nBut aside from the quirky story and rewind mechanic the game features 6 stages with 3~4 chapters each, one of which is always a boss chapter so it's short (60 seconds for each final chapter). The stages themselves are beautifully designed and have specific enemy themes to them since you'll be in different time periods for each stage.\n\nNow one playthrough of the game would take you about 3~6 hours if you just go from start to finish, there's another difficulty which may take you a little longer to complete since each squad member has 1 life and if they die then you're forced to either save them or forget them for the entire chapter. Also aside from the two playthroughs there's badges you can collect in each stage depending on what you do.\n\nThey are:\nChapter Clear - Just beat a chapter to get this badge.\nGlorbs Get - Acquire all yellow diamond's floating about in a chapter to get this badge.\nShards Destroyed - Destroying all purple shards that appear after rewinding in a chapter to get this badge.\nLooker Met - Reach the 'Looker' before he leaves his human form at the end of a chapter to get this badge.\nSTF Badge - Acquire all other badges in a chapter to get this one.\n\nGoing for all the badges in each stage will add a considerable amount of game time and it's extremely unlikely you'll get all of them in one playthrough so you'll probably be replaying chapters a bunch if you're going for 100%.\n\nOntop of the two playthroughs and badges you can collect they also have a seperate set of challenge levels called Helladeck Levels. These levels will test your skill and patience because each of the 50 (Yea fifty) stages makes you use pre-set characters with a certain amount of rewinds to try to collect all the glorbs before time runs out. They really do a great job of showcasing how unique each character in the game is from one another.\n\nSpeaking of characters there's a ton, they range from a dolphin wielding a machine-gun to a jedi wearing a bathrobe. Some of them are hidden in chapters while others are unlocked once reaching certain milestones of Glorb/Shard/Looker badge completion.\n\nLike I said at the start of this review, definitely worth the asking price in my opinion Capybara Games did a fantastic job and I don't regret any minute of playing through both difficulties and doing just about everything the game had to offer.\n\nBut if you're looking for something to quickly play for a night or two until you beat it once then I'd say purchase it on a sale since the game's short and the story doesn't take itself seriously at all.","February 13, 2015","true","13.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

I ended up receiving it as a gift this Christmas, and it blew my expectations out of the water. I initially wanted it because it had secret TF2 characters, a unique pixel-art style, and it seemed to have a pretty cool approach to the idea of a time-travel mechanic. Instead of simply rewinding to fix your mistakes, you rewind to help your past selves fight enemies, destroy obstacles, shield for one another, and just cooperate in general. It reminds me of Lemmings in that you add specialized characters one by one to achieve an objective - except instead of ladders and shovels it's sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and plasma shields. Once you finally complete the level after discovering the perfect combination of characters to pass the stage's trials in the alotted ~60 second timer, you get to see the chaos all come together in a satisfying final replay. All the time you spent platforming, destroying, and fighting with each specific character builds up into one massive bullet-hell that's amazing to watch.\n\nIt's like a teamwork based game where all your teammates are different iterations of you. All the satisfaction of a well-oiled team without the stress of working with uncooperative teammates. What's not to love?\n\n+bonus points for the over-the-top 80's action movie references and themes.

It's one of the more intelligent ideas I've seen in a game and it works surprisingly well. The level replay is a mind trip watching all of the time rewinding you've done unfold in real-time. You have sixty seconds to beat each level but with all of the time rewinds that you have and time boosters you can pick up, you really get much more time than that. The graphics are great new-age retro and everything is done well. It reminds me of a megaman game. The music is fitting but nothing memorable, and the sound is very well done. A ton of indie games I have played have all been difficult mainly because of their slippery loose controls. Thankfully, this game has nice tight controls which is its best quality besides the super cool time rewind ability. It is a very refreshing, very welcome change in pace. The gameplay is a lot of fun. Explosions, gunfire, platforming, boss fights, it's all here. The time rewind lets you go back as far as you want and spawn in another hero and you can fight alongside the hero you were just using in a sort of ghost mode, giving you more needed firepower, but you also have to use it to be able to do enough damage to a boss in time to kill it. Normally timed missions are one of my biggest pet peeves in games, but this game I have never once felt rushed because of the ability to rewind time to make up for lost time. I have total control of whether or not I finish the level in time and that feels awesome.\n\n8.5/10 very fun game","May 13, 2015","true","3.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Each has its own abilities, so, depending on the situation, one might be better than the other two. Your ability can either be activated fast by pressing the "Fire" Button or can be channeled to a more powerful attack by pressing and holding the Fire button.\nOne thing your heroes have in common is that they are really squishy and die most of the time with one hit. If that happens you can rewind the time even back to the very beginning of the level, if you so desire. And with that said we come to the main mechanic of the game: The time travelling.\n\nAs stated above you can rewind time to anywhere you want, except for the very point of your death. Each move, each action  you have taken before with whatever characters you have happened to choose is kept, which means everything you have done before will affect your current attempt, so to speak.\nWhen you have died before rewinding the time and you happen to kill or disable the source of your death in the current attempt, you can pick up the character that now doesn't die as a shield which means that you can be hit more than once.\nBut even if you don't get hit by anything you still have an advantage by doing that.\nBecause of you having picked up the spirit, said spirit will now use his abilities simultaneously to you, which increases your firepower immensly.\nThere is a plethora of ways to use this mechanic, so I've just scratched the surface with that description.\n\nThe dialogue and the pop-culture references are good for a laugh or too and are reminiscent of oldschool parody titles that don't take themselves seriously. This also serves as an explanation on why the story is, let's say, not really comprehensible. The reasons on why you go (back) to certain times is interesting, to say the least, and I think you'll have to see it for yourself.\n\nAsthethicswise the game has a lot to offer and when you've played superbrothers: swords and sorcery, you might recognize Capybara's artstyle there. It is also a good example on how to make good pixel art.\n\nThe background of each stage is unique and has something to offer, so I recommend taking the time(no pun intended) to take a look at the replay and paying attention to the background. You might find something surprising here and there.\nSpeaking of the replay, it is a nice addition which lets you take a look at your failures and epic moments, even in sloooow... moootiooon... which makes this moments even better.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, and you can even buy it on its own, but why would you do that, you can buy the game as well in a package.\n\nAre there any complaints? Well not really. One thing that might be nice to have is a multiplayer mode(VS, Co-op, Co-optional), but as I've said, it would be nice to have.\n\n\nIn the end we come to the price. It's 15€ and seeing that it has taken me about an hour to complete about 1/5 of the game, I'd say its safe to assume that one playthrough might take up to 5 hours. Apart from that there is pretty much nothing that speaks against a recommendation from my side.\nTo put it in the vein of Mr. Leeroy Jenkins: "Alright! Time's up!

I may update this review at a later date.\n\nI feel the need to give my first impressions of STFU.\nThis game looked kinda cool, and seemed to have some really sweet ideas. But something just isn't quite there for me. I bought this game at 66% off. I thought that even if I didn't totally enjoy the gameplay I could still appreciate the visuals and game mechanics. I can't say I'd recommend STFU, even with a 66% discount.\n\nBefore I get into why I'm not a fan, lets quickly list some things I do like.\nThe visuals are pretty cool and unique\nDialogue is kind of humorous\nThe time travel effects are pretty damn cool\nThe game looks good, and the art is well made. But I have a fair amount of issues with the core gameplay.\nThe PC port feels lazy - The tutorial kept asking me to press controller buttons. Many parts of the UI still reference controller buttons. I honestly feel like there should have been a little more effort put into the port. It plays laright once you find all the buttons and perhaps change a few.\nYou have to look where you're shooting - At least in the PC port you can only shoot as you move, this makes hitting a stationary target very difficult. I have no idea if this is by design. But I often find myself struggling to hit things.\nThe time travel mechanics break the flow of gameplay - As soon as I'm even slightly getting into the platforming, I must go back and repeat the last 10 seconds.\nTime travel is kinda repetitive - You're probably thinking "Yeah, of course you're repeating it. That's the whole idea!" My issue is that the repetition isn't made fun. It can often get quite frustrating. It feels like a mini grind. "Repeat the last 10 seconds 3 times to get through this wall."\nDefeating enemies is a finicky task - The previously mentioned aiming/moving issues make killing enemies a somewhat troublesome task. You might be thinking "get good scrub, you obviously aren't good enough." I'm not saying the game is hard or too difficult. I just feel like killing stuff requires some luck/flailing around for 3 deaths. If that makes sense?\nI'm told the game is kinda short - Aparently STFU only sports 3-4 hours of gameplay. I'm sure that's for a reason. The enviroments look lovely, and I'm sure they took a lot of time. You could also compare the price of a movie ticket to 3-4 hours of fun. But, for the price I would rather recomend otehr games.\nSimply touching an enemy kills you - This may seem like nit picking, or trivial. Whatever. There doesn't seem to be a smart way to kill enemies. Progressing through the levels often feels like bludgeoning my head against a wall in the hopes I knock it down. Just move forward, flair around with some attacks, die a bunch, maybe succede.\n\nSome of those things may give you the impression I hate the game. I don't. But I feel little motivation to play past the first stage.\n\nPlease, please, please remember that these are only my first impressions. I'm planning on playing some more, but I felt the need to comment on some core issues I'm having.\n\nSome people seem to really be enjoying the game, but I can't say I'd reccomend it after my first impressions. Gameplay feels iritating at times, and I often don't feel in control.","December 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 60 of 112 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","60","112","3","0"

That's more or less what this game is.\n\nThis has quickly reached high rankings in my favorite games. I love platformers, I love shooters, I love run&guns, I love puzzle games, and I love unique concepts. That's basically everything I love covered in a single title!  There are a few things I have complaints about however, but I'll get to those in a minute.\n\nPros:\n- You can save yourself by going back in time and preventing the death from occuring\n-The game can be played by almost anyone of any skill level, but there's harder challenges for those (like me) want a more difficult game\n-Great sense of humor, and it doesn't even need to be vugar to be funny\n-Replayability is very high. Each level contains various things to accomplish such as beating it very quickly, collecting all of the Glorbs, or destroying all of the slo-mo doodads\n-Team Fortress Characters... But no hats or F2P model?\n-The game's name shortens to STFU\n\nCons:\n-The replay viewer is very limited. You can't save replays, and I feel as though you should be able to control the camera to watch the various prespectives rather than just following your "Main" prospective. Also, in the Helladeck, the replay stops at your very last glorb according to your main prespective, meaning your replay can be cut short of how long the actual playthrough was.\n-It can be frustrating when trying to get a fast time on a level, because once you defeat the boss, you can't rewind time and do it faster. You have to time out your shifts just before the boss is defeated, or the level ends, and your time is a little longer than it should be. This also means you can't re-wind through the whole level to make sure you didn't miss anything.\n\n\nI feel the pros definitely outweigh the cons, and like I said, this has worked its way up to one of my favorite games on steam.  If you have fifteen dollars on hand, I highly reccomend you buy STFU, or you had just better STFU.","September 1, 2014","true","24.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You can rewind time to redo small or entire segments of the level where you have "screwed up" and died.  When you rewind back to that point in time, you can choose to spawn as the same character or an entirely new character to continue your progress.  The character you died with from your previous life spawns as well, but as a ghost or shadow character that continues to pour out damage along with your reborn character.\n\nOn paper, Super Time Force Ultra sounds like gameplay made in heaven, but it is not fun gameplay wise.  Rewinding time could not be any more unrewarding.  Along with the unforgiving enemy death traps, and level design that requires nearly perfect timing and acquisition of "time capsules" to increase your timer (you die when the timer runs out), it all makes for unforgiving gameplay that is not rewarding in the "Dark Souls" or hardcore sense.  It is cheap and poorly designed.  Often times, you will find yourself at the end of the level with less than 10 seconds left, and far and away from the finish line.  In that case, you will need to rewind as far back as you can to redo your course, and remedy past mistakes to perfection in order to beat the timer.\n\nDue to the time aspect, and rewind mechanic, Super Time Force Ultra leaves no room for co-op design.  This is a single-player game through and through, and in the words of the developer, there was no way to design the game around co-op due to the "rewind time" mechanic.  That is absolutely fine, but the rewind time mechanic makes this game not fun, and it makes other Contra-like videogames like Broforce the better purchase.\n\nI will be brutally honest here with my words, and I have chose them meticulously--in interviews and evidence of poor design, it does not seem like the developers were confident with their design.  They have backpedaled their words in interviews.  If a word could sum up this videogame, it would be backpedaling.\n\nThe design is faulty, counterintuitive, and leaves too much room for do-overs.  STFU would have been better without the rewind time mechanic.  It should have been made with the "repeat the level over" design with the Contra-like gameplay.  Throw in co-op and this game would have been a blast.\n\nDespite the Contra style gameplay, great set pieces, and beautiful pixelated art style, the one game mechanic that was suppose to be the shining force of the game was its major drawback.\n\nVerdict:\n\nNot recommended.\n\nJust not fun to play.\n\n5 out of 10","March 2, 2015","false","1.6"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","24","43","0","2"

You're often trying to shoot at an enemy with a gun that require some awkward timing/jumping/positioning etc. Objectives and enemies seem to be positioned such that you have to constantly stop, wait, clear the screen, move, etc. That's not horrible, but the style/theme of the game is one of play, die, rinse, repeat which doesn't jive with levels that are designed to trap the player into slower, cautious play (until you build up a number of replays to unleash a barrage).\n\nThe game's fundamental concept seems fine, it just seems held back by a plethora of minor design issues. For example, movement control feels okay except for the part where charging you weapon forces you to move slow. Why not have charging the weapon have no effect (a la megaman)? This seems like the games designers wanted players to be slow when shooting, to be required to move methodically through a level. Essentially you can run or you can gun, but you can't run and gun. And in a game that has a big clock ticking down in front of your face all the time, you have a setting that tells the player to "go go go", but the game's mechanics forces you to be "slow slow slow".\n\nI really want to like this game. And I feel like if I sunk 40-100 hours on it, it'd be a blast to speed run some stages, but as it is, it's lacking just enough to be ultimately frustrating so I'm not willing to sink that kind of time into it.

Well okay sure some games can relate with the time travel rewind/fast forward mechanic, but it's in the way that STF handles player progression through levels that makes it the most genius time travel game ever.\n\nSo many moments, especially when going for better times and collectibles within a level, become struggles against not only well-thought-out enemy and hazard placement, but struggles against your own previous actions.\n\nAre you .01 seconds away from getting the par time for a level? Rewind all the way to beginning to get the slow down shard that makes you appear faster in real time. Oh, you already got it? Find a way to shoot it offscreen before your previous self nabbed it.\n\nTeam member abilities and attacks are also ingeniously integrated into the main game and are (thankfully) utilized well in the Ultra edition's puzzle levels (the Helladeck). Shieldy is my favorite, as merely holding down with your shield charged allows you to bounce on and over enemies which has allowed me to breeze pass parts that were otherwise dead-ends in my speed runs.\n\nNew to this edition is the inclusion of "Ultra Force" characters which beyond toting a really neat black-and-purple color scheme and powered up attacks, aren't much more than a novelty. They do help in getting better times as they can do a bit more damage than the regular team however.\n\nThe graphics are crisp and charming, the animations even more so. STF never once slowed down for me, even when 30+ iterations of my characters were clogging the screen at once.\n\nThe only downsides to this package are the occasional menu crashes, the sometimes amatuerish-sounding and grating chiptune soundtrack, and a weird slowdown glitch that occasionally happens when you reload a level too quickly. And the story is cute but ultimately the humor is so cheesy-for-cheesy's-sake that it becomes painful, especially upon repeat playthroughs.\n\nIf you have this game already on XBLA I wouldn't recommend getting it again unless you A. Love it, B. Wanna support Capy Games, or C. Want more Super Time Force! I could definitely see these brilliant mechanics being expanded in new and interesting ways and if that were coupled with a story with a bit more weight and a bit less meme-humor (Think Shovel Knight), sequels to STF could be masterpiece-level gems.\n\nUltimately, Super Time Force (Ultra or not) is a smart and painstakingly designed videogame that oozes with the unique and distinct joy of the classic hazard-and-enemy laced platformer.

A sidescrolling shooter, you can reverse time to 'double up' (and more) on yourself to help kill enemies and beat the level within the time limit. If you die, rewind and try to save yourself from dying by killing the thing that killed you before it has the chance!\n\nThe levels are varied in terms of art, each world has a level that mixes up the objectives and style, and each boss is really fun and zany. There's a lot of unlockable characters, each has their own style and abilities, giving you an ever-increasing pallette of tools to deal with the challenges you face.\n\nThe game isn't incredibly hard, but it is really fun, and the challenge level felt just about right for me. For the ultra-hardcore player, a hardcore mode unlocks on completion, that locks out a character completely if they die, unless you can travel back in time and prevent their death. Sounds like a lot of fun, but I'm certain it will make the game REALLY hard, so if you're after a challenge, there it is!\n\nI enjoyed the game's art style, which reminded me of Bravest Warriors / Adventure Time, and the humour is really good. There are a few overlong cutscenes (namely at the start and the end of the game), but they're so well written and amusing you don't really mind.\n\nThere's a lot of unlockables and collectables too, so there's a significant amount to do after completing the game's stages.

How is possible? Well, time travel, duh?! You bonuses on your way that extend the time with more seconds, but if you don't play your cards right you'll never have much TIME to complete it.\n\nThis game really want you to step out of the conventional way of thinking, it wants you to think outside of TIME itself, if you think that you can't get that shiny bonus that come out of the enemy way too fast and vanish when it touches the ground, you are doing it wrong, rewind TIME and tell that bonus to fudge off!\n\nAside for this the story is an amazing clusterfudge of hilarious TIME travels, there's no TIME to explain that!\n\nThis game is a really fun and enjoyable experience that anyone, be the pro gamer or the casual, can jump into it.\n\nNow if you excuse me i have an appointment with my dinobros in 20 minutes in the past from now.","August 26, 2014","true","10.0"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","0"

With all the mindless shooting and rewinding time, it opened this strategy to continue shooting in more effective ways, with your own personal style. If you enjoy a ridiculous and thought provoking story, it gives you the quantity for you to thirst for more of this game.\nThere are so many playable characters that all have their own unique traits, you get to find your comfort zone in which you choose countlessly to rampage across time. I looked at what I'm up against and thought 'what would be the best option? Long Distance, Close up? Do I want to get the enemies all at once or try to pick off the biggest threats to losing a character? It encourages thought for shooting anything and anywhere.\nThe art style is beautiful. People may think of it as unoriginal or an indie-staple. Vic Nguyen shows off the best in colours and animation and really captures an atmosphere in each level, making it feel unique. I say these graphics suited the game best.\nIt didn't take too long for me to beat the game when I did not go for all of the items thrown about, but I suggest you do to get a insane menagerie of characters, even a few from Valves franchise.\nI see no real negatives, if you die constantly in the game, its a matter of paying closer attention.

Awesome! Probably. And hopefully unrelated to all of the crazy apocalyptic stuff that suddenly starts happening across time and space.\n\nLuckily, you are the Super TIME Force, so time can rest easy knowing that you are there to fix/cause all of its problems.\n\nSo this game is amazing. It's fun, it's funny, it's delightfully pretty. And they've added a slew of awesome features for the ULTRA Steam release.\n\nYou definitely should own it. You definitely should play it.\n\nI was lucky enough to meet some of the radical folks from Capy when the brought one of the game's early builds to PAX East, and got to watch it evolve over the course of the next two years until its XBLA release. The time spent polishing the game shows not just in the exquisite pixel art but the refinement of the incredibly tight, surprisingly strategic gameplay. There are so many wonderful layers to this game's mechanics.\n\nAt the surface, if you die (and you will - its all one-hit kills and designed to be hardcore) you can rewind to retry - however far back you feel like. As you very quickly begin understanding the interactions between the core characters and their unique abilities, you start to make decisions about who to respawn as and when, thus conserving lives, saving time, and powering up.\n\nBut as you dig deeper into how the collectables and powerups (the glorbs and hyper-slow-mo shards, carefully placed across each map) work, you realize that you have to be fairly tactical in their use. Killing an enemy carrying a glorb too soon may cause it to launch far ahead of you, requiring you to backtrack on the timeline to optimize, shave time, and try and reach that point sooner in order to catch it before it shatters on the ground. Activating a shard and granting yourself super-charged slow-mo too soon prevents you from being able to do so at any point later in time, in subsequent lives, so you may want to avoid it initially, turn it on later, die or time out, then activate it sooner and sooner on subsequent runs so that each life gets its benefits.\n\nAnd then, if you're going for the speedrun secrets... you've got to reevaluate all of that.\n\nAll in all, STFU is a wonderfully hardcore, classic contra-style game with a time travel twist that is so much more than a gimmick and a deceptive amount of depth.","August 25, 2014","true","19.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/250700/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","A very good game with a great concept and really, really annoying writing, Super Time Force Ultra is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up with a cast of interesting and diverse characters. A mix of Contra's shooting, Braid's time manipulation, and a bad Saturday morning cartoon's writing and plot, STFU has fun to spare, though a few elements can get repetitive.\n\nThe gameplay itself is the standout here, with a mix of rapid shooting action and precise time control, letting you repeat sections while your previous character carries out the actions you just did, allowing you to do a lot of things within the same timeframe. It's a neat gimmick, and one that rarely ends up feeling forced. The one downside is that every single boss fight in the game boils down to repeating the same 60-second chunk of time a ton to bring their health down, often 10-20 times. It's a slight complaint, because a few bosses have their own quirks such as an object you have to defend, or minions that attack you, etc.\n\nEach character has their own interesting normal and charged shots; characters have varying amounts of usefulness, but every one is fun to use. The combat feels good, and enemy health is set to a manageable level that keeps them from being bullet sponges (Cough cough, Mercenary Kings). I found that mostly you'd use 4 or 5 characters a lot, with others mostly being relegated to a few extremely situational uses. You gain more characters as you play, often in hidden, missable areas, which provide a fun reason to explore the levels.\n\nOther reasons to explore include pink sparkly items that, when touched or shot, slow down time; this allows you to get in a lot of shots in a short amount of time, letting you use crucial seconds to easily defeat tough enemies or bosses.\nThere are also gold items to collect which add another life to your counter, and little.. sparkly things that I have no idea what they do. (Upon researching, apparently they activate time trials. I don't know what the reward is, because I was never good enough to finish them, since I didn't know that was their point.)\n\nA neat gameplay mechanic is that if you die, then go back in time and prevent that character from dying, you can absorb them to gain an extra hit point as well as their charged shot mechanic, letting you become a more powerful character (until your inevitable death). This means that you have a lot to keep track of when you're rewinding time, as you can figure out how to save a character's life, absorb them, and attack anew.\n\nThe game's low-res pixel art aesthetic might initially look trite and overplayed, but the use of muted colors and few outlines on things overall adds up to a pleasing look, though not wholly unique. The levels all look different from each other, however, which helps sell the interesting time travel theme; future levels are gleaming futuristic chrome, whereas the levels set far back in the past are full of dinosaurs and interesting flora and fauna.\n\nThe soundtrack is passable, though I didn't note any particularly great or horrible tracks. The sound design itself is fun, though, with punchy gun noises and loud, goofy character screams as they die in slow motion.\n\nThe only real complaint I had aside from the slight repetition was the writing. It's just so overly WE'RE A VIDEO GAME that it takes me out every time the mission commander says "LOL" or uses other awful internet slang. It's distracting and immature, and almost all attempts at humor fall flat, closer to a child shouting for attention than a witty pun or joke.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with STFU, but I wish the characters had done just that. The gameplay is fun, the level design is interesting, and the game doesn't outstay its welcome. There's a lot of stuff I didn't get; I came nowhere close to 100% completing the game, so completionists will have a lot of fun collecting collectibles and beating time trials, unlocking characters, etc.\n\nI give Super Time Force Ultra an 8/10, and I'd like to see Capybara revisit this concept because the core gameplay is a blast. Recommended.\n","September 16, 2014","true","11.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/250700/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","I've played this game for about an hour and 45 minutes before writing this. It's pretty good.\n- Being able to rewind back in time and re-spawn at any point is a really cool alternative to simply having extra lives\n- I like the choice of heroes and the large amount of variety in the locations, enemies and bosses\n\nhttp://youtu.be/c_kwgTqLFNo\nhttp://youtu.be/uJ3fhdQCeys\nYou have three heroes to choose from when you spawn. A machine gunner who has a spread shot secondary firing mode. A sniper with reflective shots whose special fires a big laser through walls. Lastly the shield dude who is able to block and reflect projectiles and has a special area of effect attack that lays down a protective shield.\n-----Each time you die you expend a 'timeout' and can rewind the action to any point you want, you are then able to re-spawn as one of the characters at the position of your previous avatar. Your previous incarnations will follow the paths you took and repeat the actions you made with them. The damage your previous incarnations made to enemies will still be dealt and accumulate, you pretty much have to do so to beat the game. I'm not sure that's it's possible to get through this game without dying and using a single character.\n-----You can do stuff like use a shield guy to lay down protective barriers. Then on death re-spawn as a gunner or a sniper and use those barriers for cover. If you save previous incarnations from death they leave behind a power-up which allows you to take one more hit before you die, usually you die in one hit. You will also be able use their special until you expend that extra hit. So basically if a gunner picks up the power-up left by a shield guy both of their specials abilities are activated so that a protective barrier is placed down as well as a spread shot.\n-----I found the game quite challenging. I ran out time-outs once even though you start with thirty of them. Your characters are quite vulnerable usually only being able to take a single hit, and it's easy to miss something and get yourself killed on it. You need to use variety in the characters you choose, some will work better in certain situations and their effects are more effective with one another. It helps to use a bit of strategy in terms of which hero you pick and at which point in the past you re-spawn at.\n-----You encounter a large variety of enemies. First it's just robots. But after the first area you have access to the choice of different locations, like in Megaman. I didn't have time to visit them all but there around eight different world's each with their a different theme and their own unique enemies. A medieval era where you search for the holy grail. You are then taken to heaven where you find henchmen from various world worlds from the game lining up to be processed for the afterlife. In these places you battle knights, archers, cherubs and angels. You are given a Jetpack to fly around with in heaven, yay! There is also a post-apocalyptic world and a dinosaur themed one and so on. Each world ends with a boss battle and each of these has a unique appearance and attack sequence.\n\nSo the game look's really good. I haven't played a lot of Contra which this game is meant to be like. But I've played a bit of metal slug and this game me a lot of that.\n-----The opening scene where you have the scientist who invented time travel and his alternate incarnation from another timeline reminded a LOT of Men In Black 3 where there was a very similar scene. I think this is probably intentional and I thought that was really cool.\n-----There's a lot of silly humorous dialogue. My favorite part was when I came across the former Bass player of the teams leader. You are told that he would be a good addition to the team as long as he isn't murdered by a giant robot, but of course as soon as that's said a robot drops down and does just that.\n\nI really enjoyed playing this game. As far as plat-formers go I think it has quite a bit of content, and it feel really good and fun to play. It's definitely a game that I would like to return to if I can make time for it.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 25, 2014","true","3.5"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","4"

Whether it is interacting with your CO who has TWO eye patches or heading back in time to stop the asteroid which killed the dinosaurs (irrespective of the number of dinosaurs you kill on your way to the impact site), there is a charming and hilarious disregard for that pesky time space continuum in the epic quest to make time more AWESOME.\n\nThe earlier levels are a little hard as It takes a few levels to unlock the diverse array of characters to play with and you might end of gravitating between only half of them, most of them are amusing and useful. However despite the many deaths you'll experience, there is a very generous lives given for each level and you are never judged on lives used (only the collectables and the insane time medal [good luck if you try for that]).\n\nBut with each death, the level becomes a little easier as your previous lives continue fighting (and shooting) when you replay it. This means that while the level might give you 60 seconds to beat it, you'll be playing it over quite a few times, especially near the beginning with less skill and less characters. But there is something satisfying with killing the dude who killed one of your previous lives in order to pick him up as a powerup.\n\nNevertheless the entire game is very enjoyable and certainly well worth the time to have an epic romp through time as the...

But then, not really. I'd actually classify it as a *puzzle* game, and a very very good one at that.\nThe premise is that you control a character in a level which is much too long for the time limit you have and with death being ~everywhere. Only, when you die or at any given time you can stop time, rewind, then from that point spawn a new character (of the same or another class, there are a lot of classes which you unlock throughout the levels, each with their own unique skillset). You'll move again, but the previous character still does the stuff you controlled it to do.\n\nThis leads to a very puzzle-like way of approaching levels. You will constantly branch and rewind, using new characters to protect older ones (which allows you to pick them up again) which died originally. Bosses result in a giant carnage of 15-30 characters blasting various weak spots at various points in time.\n\nAt the end of each level, the game plays back everything in "normal time", which is very interesting to watch.\n\nIt's a really good game. Graphics are solid, controls are very tight, the mechanic is quite unique and works well, enough stuff to do, the only thing I would criticize is that unless you're going for a minimum-rewinds approach, difficulty is often on the low end.","December 20, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has the same "fun" factor as Super Mario Bros. 3.\nIt's a 2D schmup platformer with a rewind mechanic.  It saves your previous iterations to fight along side of.  This creates a sort of single player co-op mechanics which takes trail and error, planning ahead, and lots and lots of bullets.\n\nLots of replay-ability, in my opinion, because it adds an "Ultra Force" as well as a Super Hardcore mode upon completing it the first time.  There are also a TON of unlockables.\n\nIt's totally subjective, but I also adore the visual style and the music.

It's a Contra-like action game with a simple but ingenious time travel mechanic--at any time, you can rewind time and re-insert yourself, playing alongside your previous self carrying out your previous actions. You only have 60 seconds to finish most levels, which is impossible if there were only one of you, so the goal is to figure out how best to team up with yourself to tackle obstacles and mow down bad guys. The rewind mechanic turns trial-and-error into trial-and-improve, making it a joy to loop through a firefight until your one-person army is able to obliterate every enemy before they even get off a shot. The real-time playback at the end showing every timeline simultaneously is a hilariously fun bit of mayhem that will remind you of the satisfying "meat parade" at the end of every level of Super Meat Boy.

You control an ever-expanding roster of heroes with the power to rewind time, drop in a different (or not!) teammate and try again *alongside your past teammate*.

I burned through the missions all night on a worknight, it was just that fun. The mechanics are inventive, the pixel-art platform-environments are beautifully created and challenging, the art style is perfectly suited to the tone of the game and the controls have a precision that would be the envy of many other larger titles in the action-platformer genre. The centrepiece of the game is a unique and brilliant mechanic that allows you to rewind and insert additional characters into your game, slowly turning what would be an overwhelmingly difficult platform landscape to your advantage using each character's unique skills in a complementary fashion to solve the challenges within a certain time-limit. Totalbiscuit put it best when he described it as Braid meets Contra.\n\nVery little bad can be said about this game. Other reviewers have duly chastised STF for its dizzyingly stupid dialogue (and deservedly so - the game tries way too hard to be wacky and referential and what passes for humour is reminiscent of the sort of chat site lolz you might have enjoyed when you were nine), but ultimately the game is still a delight to play because of its focus on the gameplay and mechanics.\nI thoroughly recommend Super Time Force Ultra.\n\n7.5/10\n","January 7, 2015","true","23.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

JEFFREY MILLER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thewhyguy1000/","155 products in account","I'd advise you check with your doctor before playing this one, because it has a heavy dose of RADICAL.\n\nSuper Time Force Ultra is an action-platformer adventure made by the lovely CAPYbara Studios revolving around a central mechanic of time travel. To simplify it for those of you who haven't played, if you die, you can rewind and save your past self to make a buddy. Does this game care about paradoxes? of course not. STFU's (yes, I know it shares an acronym with other.... phrases) strongest point is this mechanic itself, in that it leads to dynamic styles of play in which you'll find yourself fighting alongside 10 of yourself. CAPY's writing department really shines when it comes to humor, which was shown well back in Super Brothers: Sword and Sworcery EP, but is really brought into light with this game. The nonsensical idea of time travel game play has to be matched up with an equally silly story and characters, and boy, does this game do it. The three starting characters available to the player are Jean Rambois, Shieldy Blockerson, and Aimy Mckillin. If the jokes are not immediately apparent, you obviously didn't check with your doctor like I asked you to. The characters are on a quest to simply make the world a more awesome place by completing tasks such as saving the dinosaurs, saving a Medieval Times restaurant from closing by selling the Holy Grail on eBay, and getting all the plugins and updates from future browsers to watch funny cat videos....in the 1980s.\nYes, this game is silly, but does the over-the-top extraordinary concept take away from gameplay? No, I'd say it actually complements it well. There's about 33 levels including bosses, plus the Steam-exclusive Helladeck challenges which will test your skill with individual characters. Each of the normal campaign levels run from around 5 to 10 minutes, so I'd say it's an investment well made, especially if you 100%. Speaking of the characters, each of them has a core design which they all share. Each one has two attacks, a normal and a super attack activated by holding down the attack button. To give good examples, Shieldy has a normal shield swipe/block, and then a Super Shield Ring which blocks all damage for all characters inside it, and Aimy has a normal laser which can bounce off angled walls, and a super laser which can penetrate the previously-mentioned walls. This core design makes each character easy to pick up and play, and overall it makes the game a lot more fun. This game is easily my Singleplayer GOTY 2014, and I would tell anyone right now to go play it. By the way, KOOKABUNGA!","January 11, 2015","true","21.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ten if you're a perfectionist. It's cool and fun, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's on sale. I guess I'll give it a thumbs up, but only because I bought it for five dollars, and I believe that is the fitting price\n\nWhen I say the game is mediocre, I mean it. The level design is incredibly simple, derivative, trite, and forgettable. Some of the bosses are kind of neat, but that's the extent of it. They have a bunch of similar versions of two or three puzzles, all of which are either solved by having two heros shooting on opposite sides or having Shieldly block something. Every and all parts of the main campaign can be completed by shear brute force, and there's no reward for being clever besides a sticker and the sake of being clever. If that's enough for you, then the game's design is sufficient. If that's not, then you'll get bored real fast, as did I.\n\nUnlocks suffer from a similar issue. You either unlock a character by collecting a certain percentage of collectibles (yes, really), or going down somewhere in the level. Literally every character hidden in a level is just in an obvious basement somewhere, or hidden in plain view with a panning camera. Some of the characters are somewhat unique, but they still manage to become incredibly redundent. I promise you that you only need half the cast to get everything done flawlessly, and I quickly min-maxed almost all my play-time into three or four characters who excelled at certain situations. Minor, less essencial characters just feel like reskins and button remaps. It's like adding a dozen slightly worse but slightly different sniper rifles in Counter Strike. Neat the first use, but then entirely useless.\n\nThe puzzle portion of the game helps demonstrate the clever mechanic of the game, but the puzzles are, just like most of the game, is very derivative. If you like puzzle platformers, you've seen all the levels before. It's boring.\n\nApparently this game is funny? Could've fooled me.\n\nThe one saving grace is the main mechanic, the time travelling. It's fantasically executed. It has a brief learning curve, but after a bit you'll start to think along with the game. During the end-of-mission replay, you get to truly see how clever and unique the game is. To experience this little original addition to puzzle-platformer game mechanics is a joy within itself. However, even this one great aspect of the game sells itself too short\n\nI usually hate it when people say a game is too short. I think it's ridiculous and misguided to expect a game, or any experience, to be worth a certain price per hour or minute. Way too often do games over stay their welcome and drag out what could have otherwise been a satisfying and complete experience in order to make themselves seem larger than they are. However, Super Time Force Ultra is that rare scenario when a game is honestly too short. It introduces itself, it builds up new characters that all add new dynamics, then it suddenly ends. The game shows you its cool little idea that it worked really hard on, does a little song and dance with it, but leaves just when you were beginning to get into it leaving a trail of half-baked puzzle levels in its wake.\n\nAt the asking price, I would not recommend this game. It can be beatten in under five hours, yet somehow still feels repetitive and overly familar a halfway in. For five, perhaps ten dollars, it's worth that short fun adventure of getting the hang of the game's one interesting and polished mechanic. Wait for a sale if you're really interested in puzzle platformers or shoot 'em ups, pass if you're not.","December 29, 2014","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only negative thing I could possibly say about it is that some of the sprites feel a bit too chunky sometimes. Other than that, the game feels SOLID. With the esthetics along with the tsunami of 80s and 90s pop culture references, STFU brings me back to "the good old days" (quite subjective, I know) of gaming, in a way that no other game has managed to.\n\nGood: Lots!!!\nBad: Severe slowdowns at times.

The dialoges of the proffesor are pretty much a parody of the internet in my opinion which makes the games it´s story/plot more fun. To give you an idea of what I mean you travel back to they year 3000 to install the latest plugin to watch a cat video. But first you have to face the police chasing you with their helicopters, hoovercrafts etc.\n\nThe game's originality relies on one mechanic: Time. The time out mechaninc is worked out really well and you get forced to use it in order to beat the bosses and collect all colectables. The time mechanic makes it a very challenging platformer with a great satisfaction when you pull a good rewind useage off. Also the characters are very simple but effective. As to what I've seen of the game you can complete a whole mission with one character but it would be very hard. The fact that your time and time-outs are limited makes it even more challenging, hence rewarding.\n\nThe replay value of missions is also very high as you won't collect all colectables during your first time.\n\nThe pixel style fits the game just right in my opinion and is also done very well.\n\nI rate this game 8,5/10. Definitely play if you like challenging platformers or interesting mechanics. Also sorry for my english, it's my second language.","December 10, 2014","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Set up a shield at that point this time. And if you save yourself from your previous run death, instead of a paradox, you combine with them, gaining their special ability.\n\nAgain, a really fun game.\n\nThe only thing I have to criticize is that the humor they're trying for comes off as trying WAAAAAAY too hard.

Now it sound complicated but bear with me : if you shoot 2 baddies and die a shameful death, you can choose to respawn like right after you've killed the first baddy. Not only that, but your precedent run will be played at the same time as you play.\n\nA concrete exemple : if you die 20 times, there will be 20 ghost of you shooting at bad guys at the same time. This lead to several different strategies and opportunities, since when you rewind time, everything around you reset too : you can use one life to get the collectable (Glorbs), you can use another life to save an extra character from a savage death, or you can tear your way through a boss by using brute time force.\n\nNice pixel art, good soundtrack, and a good amount of replayability.\nI guess you could say I had a great...time (I'm so sorry).\n\n10/10 would mess continium space time again.","January 1","true","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a 2D platformer/shooter/what have you, and it's like Contra where you die in one hit, but you have control over time, so you can undo your mistake and continue on through the level as if nothing happened. If you save your past self from dying, he turns into a powerup, and there's so many combinations you can use, since this game has quite alot of unlockable characters. For a paltry 15 dollars, this game is pretty good. I spent a good few hours really enjoying myself, and enjoying myself helping myself. Story-wise, it's pffft.

The problem I had was that it wasnt that challenging, because you could just spam millions of copys of yourself and bomb yourself through the level without really thinking about what to do.\nHowever this changes after you beat the game and unlock "SUPER HARDCORE MODE" where characters stay dead for the rest of the level when they died. This makes you think much more about your decisions and puts the challenge into game it needed.\nI would describe STFU more as a puzzle game and not as a shooter. This is especially true in the "Helladeck"-Levels which are small levels where you have to find the solution to a problem with low time and low amount of flashbacks. These levels are actually fun to play and give you more to do. The game itself you can beat in 2 hours, but as I said the Super Hardcore Mode is where the real game begins so you can add 2-4 hours to that and another 2-4 hours for the Helladeck levels.\nThe game tries to be funny, but for me it fails most of the time but thats just me I think.","December 13, 2014","true","8.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

When I first saw it on sale at Christmas time I thought to myself; "Ooh, wow, that looks like a cool game. Looks like a blend of Braid and Contra. Imma buy dis!" Noooooooooo, don't make my mistake.\n\nAt first I thought it was neat, the time travel mechanic was okay, not the best but still okay. But then came the first boss. LITERALLY THE ONLY THING YOU DO IS SPAM SHOTS AND TIME TRAVEL SO YOU CAN SPAM MORE SHOTS. After that the levels became bland, repetative and just plain stupid. The dialogue and "story" if you can even call it that is pathetic at best. The controls are clunky and constantly require your full attention. You constantly get killed by stuff you can't even see because it blends in with the background and overall is just a mess.\n\nNow, let's talk about "time travel" in this game. All it is is going back a few seconds so you can fix mistakes you may have done. You have a limited supply of time travels and you can only replenish 10 per level. And oh yeah, THEY'RE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL. I can't think of a single level where I didn't spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of time traveling only to die to incredibly-hard-to-see ♥♥♥♥ the second I respawned! It's so ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating!\n\nOverall I think this game is a load of trash. I can't recall a single time where I had fun, was intrigued by a part, felt a need to actually try, or even knew what the hell was going on. I honestly tried to like this game, I WANTED TO LIKE THIS GAME. But it ended up becoming one of my least favorite games on Steam. And for $14.99? Gimme a break. If you enjoy boring, repetative, corny, bland, frustrating and overall non-fun games, buy this game.\n\n2/8 m8, I rly h8.","April 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

That's the best description for this game. It has time travel, dinosaurs on skateboards, Atlanteans looking like they just got off the set of the Jersey Shore, and tons of  evil robots.  It's basically a 2D shooter like metal slug but you can (and need) to use your time powers in order to do more damage to bosses or get past hard parts of the game faster.

A perfect mix of fantastic mechanics, pleasing aesthetics, and a comedic story is what Super Time Force Ultra offers. I thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough of the game and so I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the game.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are simple: platform your way to the end of the level and, if you die, simply rewind time and choose another character (or the same one!) to retry... only the previous you battles with the current you! There is a time limit to each level along with a set number of rewinds, so use the "Time Out" feature I just described wisely.\n\nThe sound and design are what you would expect from many recent Indie 2D platformers. For me, this isn't a bad thing, as I think the game looks and sounds great, BUT, if you're not into that kind of thing, then tough luck... The story is pretty cool too, but what makes it is all the puns made with time and all the nonsense that goes on with time-travel and how it can be broken.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game, so DEFINITELY go ahead and buy it!\nEnjoy! :D","May 15, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These insane individuals laugh in the face of mortality. By blending the mechanics of both platformers and side-scrolling shooters, STFU has managed to create something startlingly unique. One of the few games that gives you the perfect chance to go back and fix your mistakes in order to move forward.\nIn fact, this game wants you to make as many mistakes as possible. This opens up the gameplay to allow you to head back in time to save yourself and gain that character as a power-up, all while still racing the clock to reach the finish line. Didn't make that jump and got hit by a laser blast, go back and set up your defensive character to keep them safe, or use a melee character to reflect the shots back at the perpetrator. The options are limitless. And with a huge cast of characters, with wide-ranging skills and abilities, there is almost always a way to fix your problem.\nWhile traveling through space and time there is always a little chance for a break from saving the world from all your own mayhem. The simple yet enjoyable storyline will keep you laughing the whole way through, all the while cursing at yourself for making silly mistakes that you then get to fix. The story levels will definitely have you working hard to figure out the secret to your own best run. While difficult, the story missions are in no way close to Super Meat Boy levels of pain and suffering. But don't let that deter you, if you want harder, then you need only step over to the Helladeck simulations. These will boost your skills at handling time while solving action oriented puzzles in limited time.\nBy combining loveable quirky characters with interesting skills and movement, this game has managed to break up the monotony of platformers and side-scrolling shooters, by rolling them into one cohesive stylized game with the foundation being....you will mess up and will have to go back in time to save yourself. Good luck, and may time always be on your side.","May 7, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the get go, Super Time Force slaps you upside your unforgiving mug with a stylish art style, awesome music and bug-nuts side-scrolling run-and-gun action. Commander Repeatski and his team are on quest to fight through time and fix a bunch of stupid ♥♥♥♥ that's happened in history, from saving the dinosaurs from extinction to averting the apocalypse in the future, and kick a legendary amount of ♥♥♥ doing it. Along the way you will recruit a varied and colorful team of time warriors, including special guests Saxton Hale, the Pyro and Zoey. Your character dies in a mere single hit and you have precious few minutes to complete a level, but at any point you can reverse time and attempt the same few seconds over, perhaps with a whole new character. Because of this, the game is never any harder then it absolutely has to be, and every rewind improves your odds. Saving a past self from death earns you powerups, and soon you will fill the screen with so many gun-toting time clones that the game turns into bullet hell- for the bad guys! Packed full of 80s action and references, Super Time Force is a treat to play from beginning to end.","July 31, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the gameplay being a mix of Briad and Contra. A time manipulating, 2-D platforming shooter, STFU makes it so when ever a charecter dies you can rewind and try to save that character. Characters can be saved in three different ways:\n1) blocking the bullets with the shield charecter\n2) kill the enemies before the enemy can give the killing hit\n3) Become a diversion and shift the focus for the enemies so teammates wont get hit\nThis makes death apart of strategy, if you find yourself with not enough fire power then you'll might consider killing a character and then saving them so you can conquer the chalenge.","June 18, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

These insane individuals laugh in the face of mortality. By blending the mechanics of both platformers and side-scrolling shooters, STFU has managed to create something startlingly unique. One of the few games that gives you the perfect chance to go back and fix your mistakes in order to move forward.\nIn fact, this game wants you to make as many mistakes as possible. This opens up the gameplay to allow you to head back in time to save yourself and gain that character as a power-up, all while still racing the clock to reach the finish line. Didn't make that jump and got hit by a laser blast, go back and set up your defensive character to keep them safe, or use a melee character to reflect the shots back at the perpetrator. The options are limitless. And with a huge cast of characters, with wide-ranging skills and abilities, there is almost always a way to fix your problem.\nWhile traveling through space and time there is always a little chance for a break from saving the world from all your own mayhem. The simple yet enjoyable storyline will keep you laughing the whole way through, all the while cursing at yourself for making silly mistakes that you then get to fix. The story levels will definitely have you working hard to figure out the secret to your own best run. While difficult, the story missions are in no way close to Super Meat Boy levels of pain and suffering. But don't let that deter you, if you want harder, then you need only step over to the Helladeck simulations. These will boost your skills at handling time while solving action oriented puzzles in limited time.\nBy combining loveable quirky characters with interesting skills and movement, this game has managed to break up the monotony of platformers and side-scrolling shooters, by rolling them into one cohesive stylized game with the foundation being....you will mess up and will have to go back in time to save yourself. Good luck, and may time always be on your side.","May 7, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the best description for this game. It has time travel, dinosaurs on skateboards, Atlanteans looking like they just got off the set of the Jersey Shore, and tons of  evil robots.  It's basically a 2D shooter like metal slug but you can (and need) to use your time powers in order to do more damage to bosses or get past hard parts of the game faster. It's not exactly an easy game but man is it fun. The writing has some great humor plus it's just ridiculously fun to play.

With the gameplay being a mix of Briad and Contra. A time manipulating, 2-D platforming shooter, STFU makes it so when ever a charecter dies you can rewind and try to save that character. Characters can be saved in three different ways:\n1) blocking the bullets with the shield charecter\n2) kill the enemies before the enemy can give the killing hit\n3) Become a diversion and shift the focus for the enemies so teammates wont get hit\nThis makes death apart of strategy, if you find yourself with not enough fire power then you'll might consider killing a character and then saving them so you can conquer the chalenge.","June 18, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't stress enough how smart this game's design is. It uses the common time travel trope and packages it with an amazingly chaotic action/puzzle element.\n\nYou will start each level with one character, traversing the level as usual, but when you die, you get to choose where in your previous life you want to divert the time-line with a new character. Your previous selves keep playing as you did and if you save them from dying, you can converge your time-line with theirs to gain their special attack. It sounds complicated, and on some level it is, but the flow is super satisfying. It takes some thought and strategy to get through the levels and perfecting a level can take some real dedication.\n\nThe dialogue is super corny, but it's legitimately the funniest game I've played in years.
