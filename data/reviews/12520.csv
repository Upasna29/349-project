That said, I loved ALL of SCS's trucking games throughout the 18WoS series. The game has decent control, great economy and company management and brilliant truck ownership detail. Before I get ahead of myself, however, here's a real list of pros and cons to this game:\n\n=PROS=\n- Decent graphics: This game may be old, and it does show it's age, but the graphics still look alright, if a little dull at times.\n- Good control: This game is no ETS2, but it definitely feels right. Its a bit slick at times, but you have to remember you are driving a heavy truck.\n- Company management: Manage everything from the trucks, to the drivers, right down to the contracts and companies.\n- Truck AND trailer management: ETS2 fans will like this... You can BUY TRAILERS. Just a little bit of extra management and a bit of extra content to buy.\n\n=CONS=\n- AGE: This game shows it's age... alot. The sound is low quality, the graphics are dull as stated before... it's an old game.\n- Bugs: This game has its share of bugs and issues. I personally have problems with the fov not setting properly. I have to manually set it for it to look right.\n- Fatigue: The game's fatigue system is realistic to the game time, but the distances to game time are not realistic. I woke up at the edge of a city, and by the time I got to the other side, I had to sleep again. I suggest turning fatigue off in the config files.\n- Scenery: This game also shows it's age in scenery. It's a bit dull and repeatitive.\n\nI enjoyed the game, and I still go back and play it occasionally. I would reccomend the game to anyone who likes other 18wos games, or trucking games in general.","January 17, 2015","true","20.0"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","44","47","3","0"

I haven't had a single crash with this game.\nIf you have a gaming wheel like I do with my Logitech Driving Force GT then you'll be happy to know you can also use them with this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/12520/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul is a Trucking Simulator. You start off with a truck, which you will use to pick up and drop off delivery jobs you choose to accept. From refueling your rig, to stopping at weigh stations and getting some sleep, 18 Wheels of Steel is a pretty decent sim. Even on Easy mode, you need to be careful of how you drive and make sure to obey traffic laws, such as turn signals and stop lights. I started playing it thinking I would put in the bare minimum just to get a taste for the game so I could write about it, but found it to be mildly addictive. I have yet to complete my first haul, but I am confident I will get there soon.\n\n18 Wheels of Steel does not have a playable tutorial, so you will learn on the fly. From what I understand of the game, the rigs you drive are based on real life trucks, so there is an element of realism the makers have brought into the game to give you an immersive experience. There are dozens of cities across North America, each with their own unique layout, making some of the deliveries an interesting challenge. All in all I thought it was a pretty fun game. If you like Simulators, this isn't a bad one.","July 12, 2015","true","1.6"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","39","49","2","0"

Also, I do not normally play driving games (racing or otherwise) and have not played Euro Truck Simulator 2 (newer by the same developer).\n\nPros:\n- Surprisingly good traffic AI (although not very realistic), they normally slow down for ya, but had a guy run me off the road after a weigh station.\n- Surprising depth and possible re-playability.\n- Decent graphics for a 7 year old game.\n\nCons:\n- Poor key bindings (did not have a steering wheel)\n- Repetitive (as can be expected I guess)\n- Difficulty entering cities from highways\n- Bad camera angles\n\nTo elaborate, I enjoyed my few hours of playing. My time was spent making a delivery from Dallas to El Paso (something), El Paso to Albuquerque (Coal), Albuquerque to Dallas (Explosives). I found the West and East legs to be easy and tedious, with the north and south legs to be more difficult. I noticed that there's a way to buy many trucks and trailers as well as have contracts created for companies. I did not investigate the business side of the game, but do know it's there for another play time.\n\nI used a key pad which had most of the keys bound to and found that the bindings were not terrible, but limiting. I could not use the number pad to answer radio calls and had no idea what each of the codes meant.\n\nAll in all, my biggest gripe was the limited access road to high way connections. When heading south on I35 from I40, I had to go through Dallas and come back around in order to reach my destination. This was the most annoying of the destinations, but I had a similar problem in El Paso and Albuquerque.\n\ntl;dr: In summary, I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of the genre, otherwise I wouldn't. 4/10","June 30, 2014","true","7.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

Tagged as Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel (which was a sequel to Hard Truck 2: King of the Road), it was the first that used the Wheels of Steel tag name as the game play differs completely from racing trucks delivering goods. Since then, there were another four instalments where, besides the graphical enhancements, many changes were made like Mexico being left out then arrived back, sleep timer comes and goes and so on. It seems that every game after the first, developers ValuSoft couldn’t make up their minds what to leave out or to use. Well, the sixth game in the series, 18 Wheels of Steel: American Long Haul, it seems ValuSoft finally made up their minds and just chuck everything in from all the previous series thus making this game the ‘final copy’. And it certainly shows as this simulator will be the closest you ever get other than driving the real thing.\n\nSo my real purpose for playing this game is for the love of driving. America / Canada and bits of Mexico has a diverse range of landscapes to discover and thankfully, the game’s visual aspects is quite decent. Nothing ground breaking however still pleasant to look at. In addition to the pretty decent physics, you have a good feel driving around with a massive haul trailing behind. For instance, delivering glass was pretty easy going however when I delivered those oversize tubes through the Rocky Mountains (i.e. from Calgary to Vancouver), with snow smashing on my windscreen, it got my adrenaline running as I need to be very careful dodging traffic as well as ensuring my truck doesn’t tip over. And because you can play your own music using the truck’s radio player, it’s a great experience to have (yet the music needs to be on .ogg format).\n\nSo whilst the game’s intent is to build an empire, I felt it failed in that respect as there’s no competition at all. You can sit back, relax and listen to your radio channel whilst having the cash rolling in. Granted, the beginning is quite rough as you need to do some real repetitive jobs (X – Beyond the Frontier anyone?) however once you have the money to buy another truck, trailer and hire additional helpers, the game’s difficulty level gets a lot easier. However, if you, like me, like to drive the open world and seeing vast landscapes, you will enjoy this game as America is a pretty country to see. With its majestic mountain ranges, endless deserts, Great Plains and of course, bustling cities, developers Valusoft chose the correct country to display all of this. However, because it also plays on as a business simulation, it missed the mark.\n\nFull review:\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/18-wheels-of-steel-american-long-haul/user-reviews/2200-12653156/\n\n8 / 10","July 3, 2015","true","102.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HitGod47/recommended/12520/","HitGod47","HitGod47","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HitGod47/","791 products in account","If, like me, you are too impatient to wait for American Truck Simulator to be finished then this game is the best when it comes to driving trucks across the United States from coast to coast.\n\nIt is by no means a perfect game but it is one of the best in the 18 Wheels of Steel series. The series includes seven games, but only three of them are on Steam. Most fans prefer the previous "18 Wheels of Steel: Haulin'", but I think that's only because the modding community was more active for that one. Unless you absolutely need replicas of popular trucks then I think it's okay to do without them. Other than that, both games are nearly identical to each other. The only major difference is that American Long Haul has more cities to explore. Not only is the mainland United States traversible (not Hawaii and Alaska), but you can also visit parts of Canada and Mexico. I think that alone makes American Long Haul worth playing over any other trucking simulator.\n\nLike I said, the map is huge; covers all of the country with most major cities being represented. The ony downside to this is that there is no route advisor. A world map and a mini-map on the screen are the only tools that can help you get get around. It's kind of annoying at first having to go back and forth to the map to familiarize yourself with the roads. But then I started liking the challenge because it reminds me of the old days before GPS was available and drivers actually had to use road maps.\n\nOne thing I really like about this game and which I think is sorely needed today is the CB radio feature. During your travels you can hear other drivers on the radio asking for weather and traffic reports and you can actually respond to them with a response menu by pressing the "v" key. It doesn't appear to do anything at first except give you a warm feeling inside, but apparently it helps your reputation grow and opens up more drivers for hire later on.\n\nThere's no option for using internet radio like you can in other SCS games, but you can import your own music. In that case you must convert your MP3s to the OGG format and there are websites you can use for doing that without downloading anything. I imported a few radio stations from GTA and they sound very nice and natural in this game.\n\nMy biggest gripe would have to be the steering. There is a mod somewhere that lets you steer with a mouse, but I prefer using a keyboard for steering. It works for me in other driving games, and until I actually buy a steering wheel that is what I'm going to use. Unfortunately, in this game, the wheel auto-centers itself too quickly so you're having to constantly jam on the "a" and "d" keys when making a sharp turn. It's not a total inconvenience, but it takes some time to get used to. If it bothers you that much then I would suggest a controller.\n\nHard to believe that SCS made this game so many years ago and there's actually more ground to cover than in any of their recent games. American Truck Simulator was released with only two states and Euro Truck Simulator 2 is being finished by modders. But they have stuck with the same formula over the years and, aside from graphics, their games have remained the same.\n\nAmerican Long Haul is not much different from ETS 2 or American Truck Simulator. You're still a truck driver managing your own company; you take jobs and deliver loads; you hire drivers to work for you; when you get tired you pull off the side of the road and sleep; when you need gas you go to the filling station; police give you a hard time; and when you get money you can buy more trucks. And really, what else do you need? Why not just skip the DLC fest and play this game instead?","February 8","true","3.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bangagain/recommended/12520/","bangagain","O(1)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bangagain/","1672 products in account","This game runs perfectly on Windows 10 still. The fact is, it's an old game from SCS published around 2007 as one of 18 Wheels of Steel series. SCS is also the author of the overwhelmingly postive Euro Track Simulator 2. Theme of this game is logistics, you buy a tow track, transporting stuffs like evacuator, to destination anywhere you want from job list.\n\nHowever since this game is pretty old, it has poor sorta suck 3D support IMO (Prism3d engine? Not even heard of that), plus AI is dull to hell. When you meet cops, just cut out the engine and wait there. After a while you can continue, or just save & reload (a little bit tricky). I coulnd't find anywhere like this amidst countries I've been to.\n\nA simulator of real life circumstances/experience should provide acceptable graphics for targets at least, but this game is not that case. If you enjoy truck driving, buy it without regret but don't expect too much. It can't offer you endlessly fun in game, but only driving, what, you mean you want to enjoy the landscape? You will feel sorry about that again. For kids in new era, don't expect them whiling hours in 18WOS ALH.\n\nI suggest you all buying ETS2 since it has massive imporvements of graphics, less bugs like falling from ground or suddenly out of screen, and more intelligent elements regarding AI, and so on. If you insist on buying this for whatever reason, do it during sales.","September 26, 2015","true","5.9"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

It has few minor issues that may deter many gamers from giving this classic title its due.\n\nThe cities are not fleshed out. They are essentially hubs to drop cargo and get new assignments. The Fines for stopping too far over the line at red lights seems rediculously high, and the braking distance for a bobtailed tractor is a little far, but oh well. The meat of this game is spent driving miles and miles of bland landscapes sharing the road with what appears to be all students on their first day of drivers education classes.\n\nHaving said all that, however, I still enjoyed playing this game and finding out by trial and error what we were supposed to be doing, other than delivering and picking up cargo.

The time it takes to get somewhere my be a little long, but it isn't anything too long. Some people say it is the exact distance in real life - but I am not sure to this rumor. Driving may be boring sometimes, but somehow you get over it for either unexplainable reasons, or watching the scenery and cars, or talking to yourself, or you look at your map, or just stopping at rest stops and seeing civilization can get over that boringness... Somehow...\n\nOne thing I partly dislike about the game, is traffic. Yeah, the traffic is low and you can get somewhere quickly, but I don't enjoy how there are not too much medium or high traffic occasions - Sometimes, the cars infront slow down to a speed causing all the cars to slow down aswell, slowing down the whole process for a while until the front cars speed up. I think how long you stay in the traffic and when/how it happens is just fine, I am just kind of mad at acctidents:\n\nVery rarley does an acctident happen, and when it does, all traffic is held up because of the cars in the acctident turning on their blinkers, not letting any cars or trucks pass them. This goes on and on and on and probably never ends, just sitting there, I've never had the patience to wait. To resolve this issue you have to advance time so all the cars would disappear... I just dislike how nothing happens. I see ambulances, fire trucks and police cruisers around the city and interstates. If there is a crash, I would have liked to notify truckers, which might (somehow) notify emergency services, and they may come responding to resolve the issue.\n\nBut don't get your hopes up for any updates, SCS Software is NOT coming back to a game this old. With all the Euro Truck Simulator, Extreme Trucker, and the all new American Truck Simulator (as of this writing it is very new), there is no point coming back to this game.\n\nOverall, the game deserves an 8/10 for its organzation, system on building up your trucking empire and other aspects I may or may not have mentioned. For more information about  the game or other games made by the company - visit SCS Software Forums.\n\nEDIT:\nI also forgot to tell you that you should be saving at least every in game day or every 30 real life minutes due to a "Prism3D.exe" error. Basically - after playing around 30 minutes - 1 hour, the game crashes showing a file saying "Prism3D.exe" error. I have seen negative reviews just because of this problem. I warn you to keep saving or you might just not like the game because of one technical error.","November 6, 2015","true","26.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The tissue-thin plot has good ole boy pals running a load of fosters cross-country on a tight deadline while trying to avoid an assortment of less-than-bright cops.\n\nThe player jumps into the part of "the trucker", a heart-throb for all white-trash trailer dwelling women, to a tee. SCS Software does an impeccable job of bringing to life the role of the backwards southern lifestyle. The soundtrack was an instant classic, combining folk, bluegrass and country, and leaving the player with an urge to recite the lyrics for days after.  As you can tell by my gamer handle screen name, I love this game. I do regard this video game as an all time favorite, VGA material? Certainly not. But who cares. A must play for all serious game players.\n\n2/10","April 14, 2011","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

It is replaced with different kinds of pressure - such as juggling sleep, not damaging precious cargo and even avoiding speeding fines).\n\nIt is reccommended you do use a wheel for this but not essential.

The 1 metre draw distance really allows you to suck in the beauty of the gorgeous textures that burn your retinas. The pop-in is great because it gives you a nice shock when a car pops into existance and you crash into it, adds a layer of tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The legal system is charmingly weird, as carnage will net you a fine of about $4.50 but running a red light, well, be expected to pay about $8000. The cabins were expertly designed, it's almost as if the game designers were real truck drivers. The driving mechanics are spot on, never have i felt more like i am driving an office chair with three broken wheels. The choice of drivers is a bit unrealistic most truck drivers don't make me feel anyone near as hot as those vague outlines did. All in all i think this game has perfectly captured what it is like to be a truck driver in America and how thrilling every day must be.

I didn't realize that this game was actually made in 2007 so that is entirely my fault. The reason I am putting that I would not recomend this game is because I purchased it at 9.99 and it's only worth about 1.99 for today's standards, if that. We have better options and a company that wants to put something like this on the market should actually continue to make new versions to keep up with the standards.\n\nThis is all based on Today's standards vs. Today's price, year 2014.\nSo the actual review is that the graphix are low end on high settings, not worth the price. The game lacks good control configuration though has limited keyboard/joypad binding. The actual controls are horrid - no smooth driving wheel rotation to keep on the winding roads(compairing to current standards of games that sell for 9.99 keep in mind).\nI like the idea of police on the side of roads, but the don't actually pull you over and a ticket is way high for the lack of any kind of justice system. Two thousand dollars for a red light run is too much for a first offense even if you are guilty.\n\nI personally think that you could spend your money on their more current games and get a better value. I would just take this off the market and make a new one if I were SCS. They do have better games.","June 30, 2014","false","0.3"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

If you want a alturnitive to ETS2 this is a okay one (much better than extream truckers IMO too). but if your looking for a really good truck sim, jump to Euro Truck Simulator 2 instead.\n\nAlso the people making Euro truck simulator 2 are making a America version too, so that should be fun. ;)\n\nPS I just realized ETS2 and This are made by the same Developer.\n\nAnyway I'm going to go with No, wait for the America Truck simulator (my name for it :P) or get Euro Truck simulator, it's better than this game, even though this game isn't really bad.

I managed to pick it up and at an insanely low price of $3, which it then, becomes good value. It models most of North America, albiet smaller. Driving from Florida to Vancouver will still take you the better part of 6-10 hours, so small is an overstatement. You can drive a decent selection of big rigs, and the game's compatible with most gamepads and wheels. Get contracts, haul countless types of cargo and drive across country in the snow, rain and of course sunny weather. Everything works on the truck, indicators, fuel, cops will even fine you for infractions. Talk to other trucks via radio about the weather, traffic reports or whatever else is relevant. Though it's not particularly pretty it does a great job at mimicing the lifestyle of a trucker... though, who the hell wants to be a trucker. 6 / 10","May 19, 2011","false","2.2"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

There is a decent amount of road in this game, enough that long hauls take a very long time. It is too easy to damage the trailer, and it is also WAY too easy to run red lights. Effective braking can be accomplished by using the pedal brakes (S), the jake brake (B), and the parking brake (Space). Cars will honk at you for waiting patiently behind other cars at red lights. Cars will also make sudden turns in the wrong lanes that will ♥♥♥♥ you up. Cars will also turn right into your trailer without realizing that it is there until too late. Cops are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and can ticket you without even chasing you. If you pass by a cop on your side of the divided highway, they will ticket you, if you pass a cop on the other side of the road, they will pursue you, It is surprisingly easy to outrun the cops, but if you don't have some speed built up before you start the chase, you are screwed. Also, it helps to have some heavy traffic when in a police chase, the cops aren't the best at avoiding crashes.

As such, it is nowhere near as good as their later offerings like Euro Truck Simulator 2. But for its age, this is a pretty decent game. You get the whole United States, some of Canada and some of Mexico. Steering is a little rough compared to ETS 2, but OK. The graphics are nowhere near as sophisticated as they are in ETS 2 (they resemble the graphics in Bus Driver, an SCS game of a similar vintage to this one). But for the era that this game was made, they're pretty good. Physics are not as good as ETS 2, but they're acceptable.\n\nIf you want a truly great truck simulator, buy Euro Truck Simulator 2. But if you want something a little more "old school" and want to whet your appetite for the upcoming American Truck Simulator, you could do a lot worse than give this game a whirl.","December 15, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the effort they put into the modeling of the trucks tho. The customization of truck is pretty cool too, got to say.\n\nGameplay: 5/10\nThe driving is not that intuitive, but still enjoyable\n\nStory: 2/10\nReally nothing to see here. You drive trucks after all.\n\nFun: 6.5/10\nI was having good fun with this game, why? cause i like trucks game, as simple. It feel redundant after some hour tho.\n\nLifetime: 8/10\nPretty much endless, it really depend on WHERE  you want to end. Do you want to have the biggest fleet or have the best truck ever, or have so many trucks that you dont even know what to do with.\n\nTotal: 25.5/50\nSo it is a old game, but i think that it can be very enjoyable for people that LIKE driving Trucks forever, even if the graphics are old, its still lookable at the very least. For a low price, i say do get it.\n\nHave a nice day.","July 8, 2015","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
