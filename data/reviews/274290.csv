On the surface this looks to be true, but under the hood sits a different beast. Instead we find a survival sim, ala Oregon Trail, with almost no forgiveness in it's computerized soul. There are strategies and ideas that work, but quite often you have to roll the dice and pray.\n\nAt any point, a single wrong decision or unlucky break at the wrong moment can send you screaming back to the begining of a chapter undoing half hour worth of work. The more mercenary you are, the more wiggle room you are given. Kindness may or may not be rewarded, and sometimes will be acts of futility or suicide. Soon it becomes a balance of risk and failure, of cost and rewards. You are forced to buy time more than once at the cost of your own flesh. People will die, and you never know who you really want to save.\n\nThrown into this mix are a set of metarules that neither the player nor the character know about until they are stumbled across. You'll stumble across them at the worst of moments, wasting time you never really have but serve as puzzle pieces to the larger narative.\n\nThat said, the question becomes: is it worth it a playthru?\n\nMy answer is a cautious 'yes' to those who like creative and harsh gameplay or those looking for a different experience.","July 29, 2014","true","10.3"," 788 of 903 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","788","903","0","8"

While I haven't spent a lot of time playing the new modes, all evidence points towards them providing acceptable alternatives which fix some of the issues highlighted below. I will leave my original review intact as the main difficulty hasn't changed any, and will hopefully have additional thoughts up eventually.\n\nOriginal Review\n\nAs I sit here and enter the same commands over and over again, I feel a certain autonomy take over. My mind has numbed to the plight of those whom I hold at the end of my gun. Empathy has long since ejected from the escape pods and crash landed onto a dead, sandy planet nearby. Common sense jettisoned eons ago. I shoot them in non-vital locations, I punch them repeatedly ‘til their faces look like the meat Rocky used to practice with. They beg me not to do anything crazy and I just don’t care. Oceans gush forth from blood stained eyes, the salty water providing no comfort or nourishment to parched souls. My finger is quivering above the trigger, its cold steel the only thing I know anymore. Lost to the hypnotic whir of densely packed computerized science equipment, I drift off in a daze in the midst of the situation. Why do I feel so disconnected from these horrific events? Have I always been this broken or has something made me this way? Why is it that, somewhere in the back of my mind, I feel like I have done this all before?\n\nOh, that’s right. Because I ♥♥♥♥ing have.\n\nGods Will Be Watching has been advertised as a game about choice, moral conundrums, and how far you’ll go for the sake of the mission. This is, unfortunately, not what the game turned out to be. Instead, it may be best to view it as a puzzle game, one in which you need to figure out the optimal pattern for shooting hostages in the leg, hacking the computer, and holding  off the oncoming SWAT team, all while keeping your hostages from losing their minds or getting a little too comfortable instead of fitting tetrominos together for a high score. It had all of the potential to be a memorable, stressfully worthwhile “experience” like Papers, Please. Unfortunately, the execution of its many parts fail to come together in any meaningful way, much like the game’s choices or lack thereof.\n\nDespite flashing choice as though you were at an all-you-can-cry buffet of nerve testing conundrums a la The Walking Dead Season 1, there’s very little in the way of consequence to anything you do. Characters whom you watch violently expire from this godless universe will magically re-appear in the later chapters, which I will cover more later, even going so far as to having their ghost speak to you. Every situation has a set of conditions that must absolutely be met in order to progress or else you will be judged by the gods as unworthy and forced to redo the entire chapter. Failing to keep a specific person alive can doom you towards the end of a segment, mismanaging your various resources could lead to an instant ‘game over’, or the RNGods may decide that on this die roll that revolver will finally go off and plaster the wall with your brains.\n\nThe skill-based deaths and resets I could forgive to a degree, but the fact that die rolls can force you to lose 30 minutes of progress requiring you to do every painstaking move over again to try and progress is mind boggling. Even more so when you realize that there are no mid-chapter saves at all. The only saves that occur take place at the beginning of a chapter, so if you have to quit the game at all you will need to either finish that chapter first or be okay with your work vanishing. To call this a shortcoming is understating how frustrating the entire lack of saves thing really is. Almost every single chapter drags on needlessly and could have easily been cut in half with progress doubled to allow each scenario to only last 10-15 minutes instead of 30-45.\n\nI audibly groaned when the torture sequence teased that it would last longer than 20 days. The desert scenario is almost entirely centered around RNG rolls and luck deciding you were worthy. At least some of the other chapters, such as the hostage scenario in chapter one, tie their mechanics to detailed animations that give you an idea of exactly where you stand with each element of the puzzle. The Russian Roulette segment can, and potentially will, send you back to the beginning of the chapter it appears in. I mean, I watched The Deer Hunter too and I didn’t think it would make for a good idea in a video game! Thematically, it’s cool, but leave it to cutscenes like Killer 7 did.\n\nIt’s a shame too, as the story presented could have made more of an impact if people could actually make it to the final chapters to see everything tie together. Players have been noticing a lot of inconsistencies and oddities, citing the game’s touting of choice as though it would matter and being disappointed that killing off a character in one chapter would leave them alive in the next. The story does, in fact, get around to explaining why this occurs but it happens so late in the game that I worry most players will have given up long before then. I get that the story uses the cycle of repeating the scenarios over and over again but it’s just not that fun. It’s like a Coen Brothers movie that misses its own point.\n\nGods Will Be Watching tested my patience, caused me to do things I wouldn’t have ordinarily considered doing, and made me live out the harsh life of Sgt. Burden, with us both wondering why the Gods insisted on punishing us so. In the end, the developers’ insistence on arbitrary difficulty through randomization under pressing time and resource limits and difficulty spikes really slaughters any momentum that could build up and may leave players feeling unsatisfied. I grew so frustrated by restarts that I ended up caving and playing on easy. Even then, the game was no cake walk. Perhaps the point of the game is to break me down and wear out my ability to give a damn. But somewhere deep within myself and Sgt. Burden, we found the will to continue on. Something driving us forward despite the odds. But not many others will, I fear. And for their sake, I hope the Gods are listening as well.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to check it out at http://www.rgz.ca/gaming/gods-will-be-watching-review-nihils-hymn/ along with my other reviews as they come.

You will think all your efforts to get out of the situations, while keeping everything else in one piece, focusing on the well-being of everyone around you are meaningless when that one chamber loaded with a bullet is fired, or when you reach a dead end in a desert, all based solely on chance.\n\nYou'll start off trying your best to advance through the chapters and keep everyone mentally and physically safe, only to find yourself wandering through a desert in the game over screen. You'll start questioning if that's fair, if the devs were just stupid while designing the game, making you fail even after you made all the "right" choices. You will then start to make some harsh choices, sacrificing the mental well-being for the sake of physical safety of the characters. You will then maybe start to make some progress until something random happens (like that one chamber loaded with a bullet is fired) and you're in that desert again, wondering what did you do wrong this time.\n\nYou will start over, now focusing on advancing, you'll start to make some physical sacrifices for the sake of surivival. You'll make a person eat its loved one so that everyone can get away of a situation, or execute people in cold blood just to make sure there's enough oxygen for everyone to breathe. You'll stop caring about the random factor - or your own mistakes, even - that keeps taking you back to that desert. You'll also stop caring about the people around you, it doesn't matter if you'd care, if you're prone to fail anyways.\n\nAnd for that matter, failure is always at your doorstep, it really doesn't matter which choice did you make in the end, as long as that end is met. You will then see why 30% of the user reviews are negative, and all of them are focusing on this "your choices don't matter" as the single, most negative point of the game. I gotta say that's something pretty unfair. You see, the choices you make actually doesn't matter at all, that's the whole point of the game, and this is a good thing, this game would be pretty pointless without it, actually (there's the puzzle mode for that non-random experience, it sucks).\n\nI won't tell you exactly why choices not mattering is the whole point of the game, that would be spoiling. But I'm sure you'll get it by the end of it.\nOr you won't, maybe you'll turn a blind eye to the phylosophycal plot behind this ruthless experience and focus on the ruthless experience itself, just to come here at the store page and whine about RNG, or maybe you just want to have a good time getting frustrated, and are tired of playing something like Dark Souls.\n\nHell, i wouldn't even write this damn review if it wasn't for the "fairness situation" and why it's genius and makes you move away from the PC and take a walk outside to digest what your mind just registered.\n\nIf you just want to enjoy the harsh situations the main character experiences, the game has a mode that turns randomness off called puzzle mode i guess. But i truly advise against it, for which you would automatically lose all the story making sense, and why the game over screen is not actually the game getting over, and that you did not lose any progress at all in your failed attempts.\n\nBut, all in all, in the end, it is all meaningless, your choices in life, just like your choices in-game, are meaningless, out there, there's a guy who didn't write this review, or any review whatsoever, or he (she? it?) did, it does not matter. We were born by chance, and chance surrounds us. Everytime i fail or succeed, be it at an exam, at hitting on girls, or at a video game, i can see it does not have a single piece of importance, the outcome doesn't matter, because i know that the universe is so great that even the most well-thought and overall good choices will lead only to chaos.\n\nWe just gotta continue playing this game of chance, feeling that the universe is mocking us at every step.","June 12, 2015","true","15.2"," 202 of 250 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","202","250","15","20"

I expected to pick it up for a few hours, beat it in a day, and never think much about it after that. I was wrong.\n\nFor one, this game is hard as hell. Even after the mercy update which added additional puzzle and narrative only modes that remove some of the chance, I spent honest to god hours trying to beat some of the chapters. The results were rewarding, don’t get me wrong, but every death sent me back to the beginning and with no checkpoint saving that meant every decision I made had the potential to send me down a different path within the level. There were many times that I would have ditched the damn thing, as I’m not a patient person and honestly, point and clicks rarely interest me. But this one did, because it isn’t really a point and click. It’s more of a resource managing survival simulator with a really killer soundtrack.\n\nYou follow the life of a man named Burden and direct him in seven different levels; a break in, a torture chamber, a laboratory, a desert. In every chapter, lives are in your hands, and there are often few repercussions for deciding to end those lives or choosing to save them. Do you inject a trusting pet with a poison to find a cure to save your whole team? Do you kill a child to get a security code that might save an entire planet? There’s nothing really stopping you from turning Burden into the most callous antihero you can imagine except that at the end of each level you can see how every other player did and what choices they made.\n\nThe game is also incredibly story driven, carefully constructing a gritty universe through simplistic (and gorgeous) pixel graphics and dialogue. The fun part is that while the end in pretty much the same no matter what you do, the small choices you make in early chapters will effect the rest of the game very quietly. I’ve rarely felt so haunted and confused as when I killed a teammate in Gods Will Be Watching, not because what happened was scary but because it didn’t matter.\n\nI’m not going to go too much into that because, spoilers, but if you’re looking for something to lose sleep over for a few days this game will certainly help pass the time. As I type this the game is on sale for $5usd, but it's definitely worth the $20 I paid for the collector's edition.","October 21, 2014","true","41.9"," 138 of 168 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","138","168","2","0"

I think Gods' has been underappreciated and unfairly reviewed simply because it poorly manages our expectations. I want to emphasise that this is a resource management endurance strategy. You don't walk around freely, examine things, pick up or combine items. There's no inventory. There's no traditional adventure game puzzles. Again, it's not an adventure game. It's just not.\n\nMost chapters are just one "room" with a clear objective, and you must manage the people and resources in that scene carefully to survive until the objective is achieved. The interface is minimalist: You don't get direct control of your character. Clicking a person or object in the scene brings up a context menu with a list of choices. Typical choices are conversational, issuing orders or performing an action. The "puzzle" aspect comes from failure. Each chapter, you have to figure out how these actions affect the variables and only then can you develop a strategy to balance and exploit them. Because you can fail before even trying all possible actions, you'll probably fail at least once per chapter.\n\nThe reason I think it's called an adventure game (a classification I strongly reject), besides superficially presenting as one, is it's a highly narrative experience, played out primarily through conversational in-game cutscenes leading into each chapter.\n\nPROS Gods' feels like a fresh and original concept.\nThe story is an epic mind♥♥♥♥, and is the main reason I love this game. It's of time-honoured sci-fi tradition: dark, intense, existential and philosophical. It's a work of art and it makes you think.\nIt has gorgeous pixel graphics with a mysterious ability to convey a lot with a little. There's some nice animation and lighting details which pixel art fans will appreciate. Non-pixel art fans, this may be the game which changes your opinion.\nThe music works well, mostly ambience supporting the tension but occasionally stepping into the foreground for crescendo events. While I don't normally buy soundtracks, I do recommend the Collector's Edition for the 2h22m soundtrack in this one.\nThe gameplay is satisfying when you succeed (frustrating when you don't).\nCONS Marketing fail: it's a 100% strategy game thinly veiled as an adventure game.\nBy jumping all over the place in the first half, it gives the false impression there's not much plot substance. I think the intent was to slowly build mystery and intrigue but I felt it instead failed to capitalise on one of its strongest points from the get-go.\nThe whole premise of moral dilemma, choice and consequence is completely oversold. Choices don't carry between chapters and the gruesome, pixelated deaths of your comrades appeal more as black comedy than weighing on your conscience. Make no mistake: you're now a psychopath and your loved ones are an expendable resource there for exploitation in achieving your goal. You will regret their deaths solely for loss of their usefulness.\nThe easier difficulty modes added in the 'mercy update' were poorly implemented and diminish the entire experience. I implore you to play in 'Original Light' mode, because by eliminating the element of chance, the newer 'Puzzle Light' and 'Story' modes undermine the most engaging aspect of God's gameplay; the factor of risk when making decisions (it should be noted that even in the harder modes, outcomes are still primarily based on odds and not completely random). The new modes not only rob you of a sense of accomplishment, but make the game feel too short (it stands at a respectable 8 hours in Light mode by my clock, though I'm a poor strategist).\nGods' is definitely not for everyone: (a) There's no voice acting. (b) Gods' is minimalist and subtle in every aspect from gameplay to art, sound, animation, storytelling & characters. While this feels like a deliberate stylistic choice, not everyone will see it that way. (c) It's a resource management game and therefore involves many repetitive actions. (d) You are left to figure out the basic mechanics on your own, through failure. Meanwhile, it's only fun if you play on the harder difficulties. Gods' was designed to be cruel.\nHMMMMMM Some of the first PC games I played, around 25 years ago had this magical and mysterious air about them. They seemed so creative and imaginative and just so... out of nowhere. I don't really get that feeling these days, but I got it from Gods Will Be Watching. By chapter 5, I was totally sold, and after completion, I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. That's why I'm proud to have supported this game, and have featured it on my Steam profile ever since.\n\nWhile it's far from perfect and I can completely understand why some people even go so far as to loathe it, to me, Gods' is an absolute treasure and is close to my heart. This has nothing to do with nostalgia and everything to do with artistic merit. There are many better designed games but somehow they're just not as memorable.","August 16, 2015","true","14.4"," 80 of 87 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","80","87","2","5"

There are roughly (I didn't count) 7 difficulty settings. The hardest being.. original. I played the first 3 chapters this way. I failed over and over. So, not really really being super into failing I started over on 'narrative' mode. The “easiest” of them all. Now, it WAS easier, my decisions did not effect the variables as greatly but guess what.. I failed over and over probably 10-30 times each scenario. But each time with new information as to what needed to be prioritized. Believe it or not it all comes together narratively in the end and I want to tell you now; its super satisfying.\n\nThis game is highly narratively driven. It is technically an adventure game but most of the puzzles take place on a single screen. The puzzles are very complicated and unforgiving, not because of pixel hunts or anything you might expect but because each scenario you find yourself in has about 10 or more variables that change with every decision. It is turn based and through discovery you'll find that some actions are free and give a better handle on the situation. Each time you fail you come back with more knowledge of the previous attempt. Do I focus more on keeping people alive or moving forward? Do I focus more on getting the information I need or staying true to my allegiances? Each time you'll find through experimentation what makes what tick and how much it'll take before it pushes back.\n\nI mentioned it was a meter management sim, only, not until later on when things get really sticky do you have concise information about where the meters are or even what your actions will produce as a result. That is, until you find out their consequences first hand. But until that comes you've no idea what position those meters are in or how much your actions do or do not affect them.\n\nEach scenario puts you charge of multiple people or rather one person delegating orders. And to this games credit, every time something bad happens, every time someone dies, despite the very real fact that it may have been another character doing the action possibly due to your inaction. It feels like its your fault, as if you are entirely responsible and had it not been for you indecision or blatant lack of thought during making your decision things could have worked out so much better for everyone.\n\nEach decision due to the fragile nature of things adds that much more meaning to it. I hate to go on and on about how great the ending feels and how it all collides together. But I'm going to, the mounting frustration due to the failure of each puzzle and how rewarding it is to finally overcome such adversity and impossible situations is truly rewarding. Easily one of the most frustratingly beautiful games I've played in recent years.\n\nNot for everyone/10 but truly rewarding for those that do complete it.","November 26, 2015","true","7.7"," 67 of 70 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","67","70","2","2"

I don't always need my decisions to go my way, but it often feels like it doesn't matter -- making it feel like my input doesn't really play any part in the game at all. I might as well flip a coin.\n\nAnother issue I have with the game is that the outcome of one scenario won't affect the next one, so if my partner dies during the very intense torture sequence he'll still be alive and kicking as if nothing happened as the story continues, which takes away any impact from what happened.\n\nI want to love this game. The game jam scenario was incredible and I gladly support the developers. Perhaps a sequel (or a similar game in a totally different setting) might be better, but it's hard for me to recommend this with these issues.","April 16","false","5.2"," 93 of 110 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","93","110","2","2"

But still on the merits of such is it a good game? No, as it is so brutally and (more importantly) unfairly difficult, that it makes Dark Souls look tame.\n\nI can only give you my impressions so far at this point in writing, but after many attempts I have now progressed to the 5th of 7th chapter on easy difficulty, due to the bone crushing nature of the normal mode, and the game suffers from, I feel, 3 key issues:\n\nLack of checkpoints\nLuck based gameplay\nTrial and error situations\n\nIf you fail a chapter at any point, you must restart the whole thing again; and these are not short levels at all, they can be up to 30 mins or more.\nWhat makes this all the more infuriating is the unfair nature of the situations you are thrown in. Some personal highlights of frustration:\n\n-Erratic and unreliable behaviour indicators on hostages, along with dice roll elements for progression in chapter 1\n-Russian roulette in chapter 2, where if the RNG decides you just go back to the start of the level.\n-Trial and error elements are also at play in the same chapter, where the pattern of torture is easy to circumvent if you know in advance what is coming but you'd only know that through hindsight and past failures.\n-Chapter 3 has shifting goalposts - devised a plan around what you were told at the start of the mission? Too bad chump! We've got more work to do! Again, only hindsight would allow you to plan for the "real" goalposts.\n-Chapter 5 is purely luck! Find a hidden base, that is in a randomised location each time!\n\nAnd it's at this point that I just wonder if there is any point in continuing this arduous slog. High difficulty has its appeals, the popularity of Souls series and Roguelikes are proof enough but they at least are fair.\n\nThis is closer to a frustrating dice roll simulator than a survival game.

So basically a game where the makers admit is designed poorly, and forego immersion for the least interesting part of the story.\n\nIt starts on the wrong foot by having the first level be the hardest one, because nothing like a bad first impression.\nOn the second level we are shown their stellar QA, where if your buddy dies he still keeps talking during the scenes.

Basically a point and click (adventure) thriller where choices played a heavy role in the out come of events....\n\nNot quite, I just finished beating a chapter where 3 of my crew members just ran off (damn deserters....) and lo and behold, in the next chapter they magically came back! So yeah.... choices you make don't matter towards the outcome of the game.\n\nOriginally after reading many "Not Recommended reviews" which pretty much summed up my original feelings on the game I really came to conclude why this game is more disappointing in it's game play...\n\nAlthough there is a heavy focus on dying/failing A LOT, there isn't a balance of feeling rewarded after completing a chapter. Many people compare it to Dark Souls, while in Dark Souls and in this you learn from your mistakes, but after you beat an enemy in Dark Souls you feel a sense of accomplishment and victory, while in Gods Will Be Watching there isn't much satisfaction to be found other then a relief of not having to play the chapter over for the 10th time.\n\nSame comparision can be made to Portal, you get that "AHA!" moment where the game makes you feel like a genius when you figure out a puzzle. In Gods Will be Watching it's just trial and error over and over.\n\nTo boil it down here are the choices you make in this game:\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nRestart Chapter\nBumble f*** your way into the next chapter: Repeat.\n\nIt's sad that I can't really fully recommend this game, it almost had everything going for it, an amazing sound track, cool pixel graphics, a great atmosphere, and... well to be honest I zoned out of the story a long time after having to replay the chapters, you have a tendency not to give a f*** after seeing dialog repeat so often.\n\nAnyways, if this game still has your curiosity, please at least wait for a sale to give it a go.","July 26, 2014","false","6.8"," 360 of 539 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","360","539","0","6"

I was expecting something akin to Masq, a story that is dynamically affected by the player's actions, allowing you to move forward even when a bad choice is made. The game's description certainly made it feel like that was the game I was buying, but unfortunately the game does not work like that at all.\n\nNo, the six different chapters are simply puzzles, and they must be completed in a very specific manner or else you have to start the chapter over from scratch. There is no way to save your game during a chapter, and if you fail the chapter (and you WILL fail, many times) you will end up losing up to half an hour of play time. This is very frustrating.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I am not criticizing the game's difficulty. I like games that are difficult. I played a lot of FTL: Faster Than Light, for example. But the fact that this game forces you to redo everything when you fail - complete with reading the exact same lines of dialogue over again - does not amount to fun; it is simply repetitive. And yes, the latest updates allow you to tone down the difficulty if you want to, but this simply de-fangs the game.\n\nAnd even when dynamic results DO occur during the chapters, the game seems to forget all about them when the current chapter is finished. For example, when I played the torture sequence, Jack ended up dead, and yet in the next chapter he was alive and well with no explanation given. This left a pretty big question mark in my head.\n\nUnderneath its questionable mechanics, Gods May Be Watching does have a well-written story, charming graphics, and an excellent music score. It attempts to take a fresh approach to the adventure game genre, but unfortunately this approach doesn't always work.\n\nIf you're interested in this title, I would recommend waiting for it to go on sale.","December 16, 2014","false","2.8"," 93 of 126 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","93","126","2","1"

The style is spot on, the premise was interesting, and anything marketed as 'an innovative departure from the traditional point-and-click adventure genre' catches my attention immediately.\n\nHaving now played the game and having watched friends play through the bulk of it, I'm not quite sure if that quote was meant to be some sort of cruel joke or not.  Gods Will be Watching is not an adventure game.  It is a Crisis Management Simulator with a story attached, and retro point-and-click adventure game graphics and art that serve as a GUI for said Crisis Management Simulator.\n\nEach level puts you in one room (Sometimes with one or two other rooms nearby) where you are given six or more things to manage in one turn, and one action that you are allowed to manage with.  In the first level you are put in charge of a hostage situation while your team tries to hack the mainframe of the building you are in.  There are four hostages, each with individual moods to manage, the hacking process itself which needs to be reinforced periodically otherwise you lose progress, and a group of armed guards right outside the room inching their way forward every turn.\n\nWith all these things progressively 'worsening' every turn and only one action per turn to use to address any of the six (or more, as you progress) factors, you are forced to make what the game is marketing as difficult, morally ambiguous decisions.\n\nIt is excruciatingly difficult, and you will never (Or very rarely) get through a level with all of your 'resources' in tact.  The game is designed that way, and you are meant to fail over and over again.  Levels can be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half long depending on how long you take to make decisions, but the game never moves beyond this basic tenet of creating a situation where you have to juggle eight chainsaws but you only have one hand, and then later you just become blind.\n\nThere's no adventuring anywhere near here, so when they say it's a 'drastic departure from point-and-click adventure' they could've actually said that it was a drastic departure from Microsoft Flight Simulator and that would've been just as true.\n\nMisleading PR aside, what's especially annoying is the nature of this crisis simulator.  Sometimes, (And the game doesn't always tell you when.) it is heavily RNG dependent, meaning that you can lose the game 45 minutes into a mission because you got a bad roll behind the scenes and consequently got shot in the face.  There are no checkpoints in Gods, so you go back to the very beginning of the mission and have to roll the die again, after another 45 minutes.\n\nI don't shy away from difficulty usually.  I love the Souls series because it is punishingly difficult and consequences to failure are dire, but it's never unfair with its difficulty.  Gods is unfair.\n\nThere are other times where you will have made a crucial mistake early on that doesn't outright screw you over, but slowly erodes your chances of winning until the very end of the mission an hour and a half later.  You fail and you restart, having to perfectly balance a host of rapidly changing factors for another hour and a half and hope you didn't screw up at all along the way.\n\nMoral choices in the game thus become non-existent.  You think nothing of morals, and you start to view the game as a set of variables that need to be manipulated in such a way as to guarantee success as things start to erode.  I suppose you could say that the game forces you to be ruthless, but it is too effective.  Instead of worrying about the fate of the characters invovled, you look at them simply as bits in your poorly running machine, and if they take too much oil then you get rid of them.\n\nThe problem is, that's not a moral choice.  It's a mathematical one.  A clinical one.  You don't feel torn when you make these decisions because you care about the characters, you feel torn because you're not sure if this move is going to screw you over an hour later and make you painstakingly redo everything.  I would've gladly sacrificed everyone just to move onto the next mission successfully.\n\nAnd that's the other problem.  Consequence, three quarters of the way into the game, does not exist.  I will avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say that things that happen in one mission don't seem to carry over with any kind of meaning to any subsequent mission.  To use a loose example, if you lose your special hat in one mission, you will magically have it in the next one with no explanation as to how.\n\nDespite all of this, I don't think Gods Will Be Watching is necessarily a bad game.  It's a bad game for me, and a bad game for who it's being marketed to.  Some people will probably really enjoy it, but I think that group of people is relatively small.\n\nThey had a good vision for the game and they executed it without compromise.  And then I presume they realized that there's not a lot of money in an excrutiatingly difficult and unforgiving crisis management simulator that's partially RNG dependent and instead marketed the game as some sort of advanced point-and-click adventure game with a lot of ambiguous moral choices to make and consequences to follow.

It manages to capture great pixel graphics, great sound effects and great music. Now, this game has major, considerable flaws:\n\nThe choices in the game don't matter. If you kill a friendly character, he/she comes back alive in the next chapter because else you wouldn't progress in the game (even though they're "dead.")\nThe tasks ordered to do are very tedious, and sometimes boring. Most chapters are basically management of other characters and if you fail, you restart all over again.\nThis game is pure PRD (Pseudo-Random Distribution.) You can fail genuinely because of percentages. If you're a gambler Original mode is for you, but not even Puzzle mode saves you sometimes from the PRD it has, so... Good luck!\n"Puzzles" are not hard (and hence, the game is not long.) They're just insanely difficult (and relies in luck to do so,) and made up so you need to restart and pray to the gods the PRD is merciful the next time you repeat. The worst offender is Chapter 5.\nI'm aware this game was supposed to be very hard from start to finish, and I did enjoy the challenge, it was just tedious to do it over and over again. The chapters are really not worth retrying for the extra stuff and you lose your emotional link with the characters very quick after doing it again and again (and after figuring out they "revive" in the next chapters), and even though this game is reviewed and seen by some other people that it's a "adventure" game, it is not. It is a point-and-click management resource game at its best.\n\nHowever, there's also a good share of what I liked about the game, and some of them were said earlier.\nIt has a very good atmosphere with great music and backgrounds along with neat sound effects.\nThe pixel graphics are done here splendidly and I genuinely enjoyed the cutscenes.\nChapters like the 2nd, the 6th and the 7th were really good. I will let you figure out why (or not.)\nThe story, even though short, it's pretty neat.\nThe gore is also really good here for a pixel game.\nIt has a lot of difficulty settings suited for your liking. Don't want to play the game? Play Narrative mode. Do you find the challenge hard? Play Original Light. However, Puzzle Mode doesn't remove all the PRD...\nEven though there's a lot of good things about the game, the bad things overwhelm the good ones, and it's not a game I would recommend.

Because I like the art style for "Gods will be watching" and that the game is trying something different than other offerings. And I can see how for other people this might be an ejoyable game (as can be seen in the other reviews) however.....this to me is not a fun game to play. And when a game is not fun to play it pretty much becomes work, only without the salary as a reward.\n\nTo my fault I was expecting a point and click adventure or something aking to it, however this game sets you into a specific situation each level. And you have to 'work' at finding a way out of that situation by doing repetitive tasks (key word: repetitive) and if you fail after 10 minutes you can do the whole thing over again from the very beginning.\n\nThe Dark Souls comparison was made, however as opposed to that game, this one feels like the result is more based on luck than actually improving your skills into getting you further into the game. As such (to me) it wasn't satisfying when you cleared a level. It was more a sense of relief that I didn't have to do the same thing again...and again...and again.\n\nThe moral choices don't appear to matter much either, in one level I had people die on my watch only for them to reappear the next. Their characters are now glitching on the screen (that was funny) to show something is not 'right', but essentially their deaths apparantly didn't matter. Nor would your choices.\n\nIf you like puzzle games where the end result is gained by mostly (not all the time) luck as opposed to deducing what to do, then one could try "Gods will be Watching" for an original setting and a game which I find looks pretty cool.

Difficulty for difficulty's sake may appeal to a certain minority of people, but it's intensely off-putting for everyone else. It's even more off-putting when you're made to feel bad for not enjoying the difficulty, or even insulted for it. There's a strange difficulty superiority complex in some gaming circles that I can't quite get my head around, and it leads to some games pitching themselves firmly in Camp Difficult and making a big song and dance about how punishing they are, like it's a badge of honour.\n\nPrior to the update last year, Gods Will Be Watching firmly fell into this camp. On the "original" difficulty, there are random events and unpredictable difficulty spikes that come out of nowhere, ruining any progress you've made in the puzzle so far and forcing you to restart. The usual response to any complaints about this is that they're explained by the end of the story (which they are... kind of), but this doesn't alter the fact that they make playing the game an endurance test rather than anything resembling fun. Go Camp Difficult!\n\nPost-update, however, it's now possible to play the game in a way that feels (mostly) fair, and it's a completely different experience. Stripped of all the rage-inducing random events, the real game can actually finally come out... and I can honestly say I've not really played anything like it. It looks like a point-and-click adventure game, but doesn't play anything like one. Each chapter consists of a chunk of (pretty decent) story exposition followed by a very complex puzzle, usually involving resource and team management across multiple different variables that need to be balanced at all times to prevent catastrophic failure. And you will fail. Even on "easy" mode, you'll most likely have to repeat each chapter a couple of times at least. The difference between doing this on the original and easy difficulties is that on original, you'll have to repeat chapters multiple times because the game randomly fails you over and over, whereas on easy, you only have to repeat the chapters because you've made a mistake or because you've not fully understood a mechanic of the puzzle. This seems like a fair challenge. The puzzles are hard, but not insurmountable, and without the element of randomness it's possible to complete each puzzle through good old logic and planning rather than through sheer perseverance.\n\nI'm really belabouring this point because the game still tries to make you feel bad for playing on anything but 'original', like you aren't experiencing the "true" game, and I suspect many people feel pressured into playing it on original and just give up in frustration. I don't think I could disagree with the developers more about this. The random elements ruin an otherwise brilliant game, and without them the game really shines through.\n\nIn summary: play it, but don't play it on the original difficulty, unless you're feeling particularly masochistic.","October 21, 2015","true","8.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The demo is freely available, and was interesting, if bleak-- I never beat it. The demo places you in the role of a Sergeant Burden, stranded with his crew on a hostile planet. It's a game of multi-tasking; you need to keep you and the crew warm, fed, free of disease, keep morale up, repair the radio so you can send out a distress signal, and fend off the local wildlife.\n\nIf that sounds like a lot, it is. Like I said, I never beat the damn thing. I kept focusing so hard on staying on top of things and doing my best to save everyone. I inevitably spread myself too thin, so I would consistently end up saving no one at all. But the demo handled this well, very well, even. Nothing happens all at once-- instead things slowly start going to hell around you, and as you try and patch up one problem, another crops up. By the time you realize things have gotten out of hand, it's too late.\n\nIt's a fascinating approach to handling choice in the storytelling, because it's based so much on knowing how people are going to play the game. It's never posing binary options to you: it asks you to prioritize, and it will actively use perfectionist tendencies against you.\n\nThe full version of Gods Will be Watching steps up the game. Where the demo had no real urgency to it, the first gameplay sequence is a tense hostage situation. The atmosphere very much encourages you to rush, though the game is largly turn-based: time only advances when you make a choice.\n\nIf you rush, you will die. You'll die a lot in general, actually. The game is broken up into multiple discrete scenarios, and until you learn to manage the unique needs of each scenario, you will die repeatedly, even on easy mode. With this comes one of my few quibbles with the game-- there's no quicksave or way to save within a scenario. When you die, you have to start over from the beginning, no matter how far you've gotten. While this plays well into the game's ethos of outright forcing you to sacrifice something, after a few tries it gets really frustrating to have to go through ten or twenty minutes of gameplay over and over again. I would really appreciate being able to drop a save at a mid-scenario checkpoint.\n\nThe art style is that skinny-legged highly-pixelated look that Sword and Sworcery popularized. I'm not a fan of the style but it's skillfully done, and reducing faces to a pixely blur actually helps the mood of the game. It looks good, and the game covers subject matter where it needs to be careful to walk a line between showing too much detail and not enough.\n\nThis is because the game throws you into a torture sequence as its second scenario. It doesn't pull any punches. I was nervous going into this sequence, given you can beat, maim, or kill hostages in the first one. You don't ever really have to, but the option remains open and visible, and I kept wondering if I would have to. In a few failed attempts, I did. But I'm avoiding talking about the torture scenario. It's brutally portrayed-- the heavy pixelation of the graphics is both a relief for being so vague and a horror for leaving enough open to the imagination. It's explicitly not torture porn, because pornography is intended to be pleasurable.\n\nWhich, if anything is, the central flaw of the game. It's not pleasurable: it's a harrowing experience. It's compelling, it's fascinating, but it's not something that will ever make you feel good. I don't think it's important that a game be pleasurable experience, however. It's not something necessary to any other sort of fiction-- most books, movies, and TV will be fun, to be sure, but by no means do any of them need to be fun to be good. But it's definitely something worth noting; you're going to need to hug a pet or loved one after playing.\n\nGoing as far in the game as I have (as I said, it's very difficult; I'm still working on it), it's still in question to me if how you play each scenario affects anything at all about later ones. The game does track, say, if anyone at all dies, but dead characters seem to still appear in the following chapter. Something seems strange about it, though-- I'm not entirely certain if those returning characters are real or some sort of hallucination. I'm not entirely sure if it matters either way, for two distinct reasons.\n\nFirst, the choices you make in the gameplay are the gameplay. It's never really telling you that it's doing it; it's never giving you prompts of "be good person y/n". But every action you take is at the expense of a different action, with its own risks. It's certainly possible to try and go for a 'perfect' run-through or a 'villain' game but without a guide in hand you'll have to take your chances, and only you the player-- the titular, metaphorical 'god'-- will be judging the actions. The game follows through on the notion that it's not assigning a meaning of right or wrong to your actions in a way that few do. The only goal you are given is to survive to the end of the scenario. Anything else along the way is optional, and you're not even informed of what all your options could have been until the end of the chapter. (At the end of each, you're given data on how your actions match up to how others have played the same scenario, something I'm glad to see in wider usage than just Telltale games. This is the closest the game comes to judging you: your overall approach will be characterized with a single word. My attempts to dribble out miniscule amounts of information in order to space out beatings were inevitably characterized as 'suicidal'. The assessment appears to have no impact on play.)\n\nSecond is that GWBW tells a reasonably compelling story. Enough so that I've been fairly circumspect about saying anything at all about it. There's an evil space empire and a rebel group you've infiltrated and an apparently-neutral third party that you work for. Biological weapons and the question of where the line between freedom-fighting and terrorism actually is, and how being personally affected will change where you see those lines. It's heavy stuff, and I don't see the game answering any of those questions for you. But there's a character story in here, too, or more specifically a story about relationships. Donald and Sarah are married, Jack loves the dog that comes along, Burden and Jack go through hell together... and then there's the relationship between Burden and Liam, head of the rebel group Xenolifer. It's strangely intimate, the way Burden speaks about him, hangs so much of his sympathy for the Xenolifer cause on Liam\nhimself. It stands out starkly amidst the stilted phrasing and outright gameness that forces you to keep the game at arm's length.\n\nGods Will be Watching is not an immersive game, but that's okay. It's a game that works best at a distance, when you're treating it as a game to be beaten, a puzzle to be solved, because that's where the failure cascades the game thrives upon come from. If you throw yourself into the place of Sergeant Burden, if you decide in advance what constitutes acceptable losses, you're not going to be feeling that rising dread, and it won't change to panic just before everything goes all to hell.\n\nThe game is by no means flawless; the text of the game is, even where it's grammatically correct, written in stilted, unnatural English. Given Deconstructeam is based out of Spain, I'm neither surprised nor hugely bothered by this lack of conversational mastery, and they know how to use it to create atmosphere. But a more thorough edit is a level of polish that I think would make for a better game.","July 24, 2014","true","10.3"," 160 of 277 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","160","277","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/274290/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2000 products in account","THIS “REVIEW” HAS BEEN UPDATED.\n\nI had great hopes and I was really hyped to finally play Gods Will Be Watching. I'll admit, I never played the free version that originated the full game and after playing this game I think I should have actually so that I knew what I was getting myself into. Be warned, this might contain SPOILERS!\n\nOn the Steam store page it says that Gods Will Be Watching is "An innovative departure from the traditional point and click adventure taking place in six intimate, tension-filled scenarios linked together through an epic narrative of interstellar espionage.". I have to agree to some extent, it is indeed an "innovative departure from the traditional point and click adventure" type of games but, the way I see it, the scenarios are not "linked together". So basicly the game is divided in several chapters and in each chapter there's a chance one of the characters from your "team" can die but on the other hand even if a character dies, let's say, in Chapter 3, it will still be alive in Chapter 4. This happened to me and I couldn't see a connection because as far as I know Chapter 1 takes place before the second chapter, the second before the third and so on, so I don't see a logical explanation for this, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nPutting that issue aside I can say that I think the game looks absolutely gorgeous and the sountrack is really good and does a great job in putting you in the right mood, atleast it did for me. One other thing that fascinates me in this game is the universe in which the game tooks place, from revolutionary organizations looking to end slavery to undercover operations being carried out by federations and empires that rule part of the galaxy. Overall the universe and the plot is plain great and that also creates another issue for me. It happens often in games that the world where the game takes place is rich and well designed, however some of these games only show you tiny fractions of the universe and I get really sad about that because there's a whole set of opportunities to explore in this world. For example, in Chapter 2 you have to endure torture during a few days and during your torture, your torturer talks with you and he speaks of a Sports League in which players compete but he then tells you that they win by actually killing the enemy team, or atleast that's what I understood. This is a great example of what I mentioned before, the game teases you with great things, yet it doesn't show you anything.\n\nOf course this is very relative from one person to another, you can say I'm pretty much just ranting here but the ranting is just coming now.\n\nWhen I got Gods Will Be Watching I was expecting a standard point and click game with a certain story that was told through a series of choices you made and each choice would lead to a different outcome on the storyline. In the end I was wrong. There's pretty much nothing like that in Gods Will Be Watching, if you don't follow a specific set of "parameters" you lose and you have to start the Chapter all over again. What infuriates me the most is that there's not even a specific path which you have to follow in order to complete a Chapter, most of them are pretty reliant on luck. Having looked for some guides and some walkthroughs on Youtube I saw that the same action could lead to totally different outcomes and sometimes even total failure. I can understand the fact that a game is hard when it doesn't rely on luck, which Gods Will Be Watching certainly does. People that think games like Dark Souls or Ninja Gaiden are hard would hate to play this, that I am sure, atleast in those games you can fight back and turn the tide when in this game you can't, sometimes it reaches a poin where there's nothing but defeat waiting for you, yet the game drags on.\n\nI really want to like this game and I really want to finish it (I'm currently in Chapter 4), but the way you get (pardon the term) screwed over and over just makes me mad and feel like I shouldn't have bought it in the first place because of it's luck based nature. Like I said I don't mind a game that is hard to play and to master, but when a game is trying to tell you a story I just want to enjoy the story without having to worry and to go through all the hassle to find out how to beat a certain level. Some people might be okay with this but I'm totally not. I bought this expecting a narrative experience and I found myself in some sort of survival micro management game trying to make sure I wouldn't make a wrong move or else all my progress until that point would be lost.\n\nI might return to it someday, hell, I might even play it again tomorrow, I honestly don't know. Probably I'll just watch some walkthrough/letsplay on Youtube to see how the game ends because that's what I'm most interested in. I can't really bother myself to spend hours on a single Chapter until the game decides not to shoot me in the face and I manage to get lucky and beat that chapter.\n\nI often compare point and click adventure games to books/movies/tv shows because they present you with a linear storyline and you just experience it, and that's pretty much why I enjoy point and click adventure games, because they tell a story but in an interactive way, in a way a book or a movie can't tell because you're just watching/reading there's no physical input from you that affects when or how the story progresses, and I feel that's the problem with this game, I just can't enjoy the story because of it's luck based design. I really want to recommend Gods Will Be Watching but due to the flaws I've mentioned I think that if you're like me, you won't enjoy this. If you are looking for a game with a good story to enjoy, you probably won't like Gods Will Be Watching, you'll end up "suffering" while experiencing that story and I'm sure I'm not the only one who hates that.\n\nUPDATE: After some tweaking I was able to finish the game on easy. Like I was told, on the last chapter the game finally explains to you, atleast in some way, why someone is alive despite their death on the previous chapter. After beating it, I can say for sure, this has an excellent plot and I find the ending quite remarkable.\n\nDespite that, I honestly can’t recommend the game yet, I still think that it involves a great amount of trial and error and a huge deal of micro management. Please understand this, I don’t think Gods Will Be Watching is a bad game, I think it’s quite good actually. Do I think it stands as an innovative departure from the point and click adventure type of games? Yes. Do I think it stands out as a good narrative driven experience? Yes, but I don’t think the type of gameplay stands out for most people who are looking for a more “casual” narrative experience.\n\nConcluding, the story, the plot, the soundtrack, the graphic style are amazing, however I feel like the type of gameplay that was introduced into the game doesn’t really help to appeal to a larger audience. Some people will love it and some people will hate it. Then there’s probably others like me who are in the middle ground.","July 26, 2014","false","17.7"," 112 of 193 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","112","193","0","10"

The game's pacing, which can be very tedious (as you will fail often) requires a strong emotional commitment to the story. The art, writing and soundtrack help to accomplish that, but so does the challenge inherent in each chapter's puzzle.\n\nEach chapter requires a different type of resource management, so at a basic level you should not hate that type of gameplay mechanic if you're going to invest your time and your money into playing it. But this is no Diner Dash—the situations are dark and fraught with drama, with life hanging in the balance. I found myself playing and failing chapters over and over again, not wanting to stop until I succeeded—and that eventual and inevitable success feels so, so sweet. If you're not into that kind of thing, there are many different modes to play. Some modes take out or minimize random events, others allow it to be the difficult, almost impossible beast that it was designed to be. I think this helps the game appeal to more types of players, while also enhancing its replay factor significantly. If you enjoyed a specific chapter, you can select a chapter to play—I know I'll be trying the Sineicos chapter again.\n\nIt's not a perfect game. The standout example of that to me is when one of my team members perished in a chapter, and I was surprised to find they were alive and well in the next chapter—with no explanation given at the time. It caused the rest of my gameplay experience to be fraught with the question of whether or not it mattered if I tried to play a certain way—namely, keeping the members my team alive. At the time, it compromised the emotional connection I had with the game and its story. I'd thought it was a mistake, and I became wary of whether there would be more mistakes to come. However (without giving anything away) after completing the game, I believe it was intentional and not an oversight.\n\nAll said and done, I freakin' loved it. It's one of my favorites ever, and I can't wait to see more from this developer.","September 7, 2015","true","11.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Your choices may not be the most popular, or the most moral, but they may be the most logical.  Only you and the Gods will be watching.\n\nGods Will Be Watching is a 2D point-and-click adventure regarding the trials and tribulations of Sgt. Burden, an agent of E.C.U.K., the Everdusk Company for the Universe Knowledge, tasked to be undercover in the group Xenolifer to learn about the origins and wherewithal of the Medusea Virus.  Throughout the game, Sgt. Burden is tasked with hard-fought decisions: from which hostages to trade or to kill, to which partner will receive the lethal dose for the sake of a cure.  These choices that Gods Will Be Watching gives you are never clear cut or easy to do, most will have a negative aspect in the short-term but are necessary in the long run to the success of finishing the said mission.  It’s a haunting feeling knowing you may have to kill an important partner to complete a mission because he can take an antidote test better than your other crew, and those uncomfortable feelings are easily worth the price of admission.  It’s hard to come by games nowadays that can make you squirm in your seat because you know what you have to do, but you most certainly do not want to do them.\n\nGods Will Be Watching boasts a retro style that really breathes a lot of life into the scenery.  Even with the disadvantage of having very little specific details in the characters and backgrounds, Deconstructeam does a fantastic job painting a beautiful picture of open worlds and claustrophobic corridors catering to the difficult tasks at hand.  The music that accompanies the brooding situations highlights and builds accordingly to the situations, sinking into your brain and not letting go, making every decision you take even heavier and intense than the last.\n\nThough Gods Will Be Watching is an impactful and thought-provoking game, it’s not a terribly long experience.  Gods Will Be Watching at the most will take you around 7-8 hours on its difficult “Original” mode, with specific tasks to beating each level netting you awards like concept art and illustrations.  Gods Will Be Watching does add different styles to its chapters: Puzzle Mode removes most of the random number generating puzzles and makes the chapters built on a pattern that can be cracked, while Narrative Mode allows an easier run-through of the game allowing one to indulge in the story more so the complex issues that arise from it.  But ultimately once you’ve finished Gods Will Be Watching, the tense atmosphere of not knowing what’ll happen next get lost during your second and third play through.\n\nEven though Gods Will Be Watching is a short, difficult experience, it is an experience that should be recognized and indulged.  The moral choices and brooding atmosphere sucks you in and doesn’t let go, giving the player an uncomfortable, tense, and thrilling rollercoaster of a ride, even if it’s only good for one go around.\n","November 6, 2014","true","7.6"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

"Why not kill the doctor? He will spawn in the next chapter! Its not really about the future, its pretty much about how you feel.\n\nJust seeing that life less body makes you feel guilt, it was your fault, even if you cant accept it, it is. You could have avoided that.\n\nBut at the end, does it really matter at all?\n\nAlso, this game is REALLY harsh, this wont end up like typical "And the heroes entered the bad guy's base and killed him and the galaxy was free!

No, sometimes you got to accept the harsh reality.\n\nNo matter how many times you try, you know you cant change that, no matter how many times you wish it.\n\n\nIn my opinion, it had the best ending for a game.

A really simple mechanic (point-and-click) to offer a whole new level of resource management. I must confess the story is not extremely original, yet its esential for the game to work correctly, and honestly, I loved it. The ost is just the kind of music and auditive feedback you wanna listen to while you're repeating a chapter and action over and over again. The pixel art style, animations and setting give it a distinct aesthetic.

And if you want to get metaphysical: How much free will do we really have?\n\nSo before purchasing this game or choosing one of its many gameplay mode (some were added post-release), all you needed to ask yourself are these 2 questions:\n\n1. Will I be OK that, after being tortured and torturing others, after losing not only to my own mistakes but also to random number generators, after going from deeply disturbed by its graphical content to constantly skipping the same content with blind eyes, that my blood-soaked sweat-stained decisions, are yet a mechanism to move its narrative forward?\n\n2. Will I be OK that, with all the positivity I try to instill with my decisions, this game ultimately decides to cast a grim outlook on free will?\n\nIf you are ready for this taoist-esque afterthought, then maybe, you will enjoy playing "Gods Will Be Watching" in its normal (read: most unforgiving) difficulty.\n\nPS: If you decide to do so, just remember neither luck nor keyboard are on your side.","October 25, 2014","true","12.7"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

It is absolutely not the game described or aluded to in the trailer: it is a turn-based strategy game: not an adventure.  At best, it is an interesting story with beautiful presentation which requires unreasonable investment of patience from the player to progress.  At worst, it is a tedious, repetetive exercise in keeping counters above a threshold by performing limited actions.  In each chapter, there are basically only about eight actions you have available to you, all of which will add or subtract a predictable amount to some victory condition counters.  This game could easily be represented as a series of numbers and buttons, which is pretty damnable given how the game is positioned - and what I believed it to be.\n\nThe game is not centred around story, and nor are the choices really that affecting: the only choices you are really making are how best to juggle the variables to keep them within the tolerance levels.  As far as I can see, in the first chapter, the only choice you can make that affects anything fundamentally is if you kill hostages rather than let them live when they do make a run for it, your man who is assigned to keeping the incoming forces at bay will refuse to shoot because he is morally damaged.\n\nIf you like resource management, you will potentially find something to like in this as it is very, very hard.  If you like story, you likely won't, because it requires so much effort and frustration to get to the story that you will, like me, feel as though you have been cheated into playing a very different game than you were expecting.\n\nAn experiment that doesn't work, for me, at least.","July 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 73 of 129 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","73","129","0","0"

Unfortunately, that backfired on them and they ended up having to patch in a bunch of different difficulties. But I can't hack it.

It is a VERY interesting approach to point and click. Let me start off by saying that the game is very hard. Usually, it is not to the point that it gets too frustrating, but it actually encourages you to try something different or improve on what has worked until you beat the stage. Although the game does base a lot of its mechanics on luck, there is a certain amount of thrill to some of the gambling aspects in the game. In fact, I do not quite understand why this surprises so many people: luck has always been involved in almost all turn based games. Yet what is much more important than raw luck, is logic and time management, and using your resources in the best way possible. Besides, I always felt like I needed skills and tactics to proceed, with each failure I improved at the game and got a bit further, until I eventually beat the chapter that I was stuck on. Each stage plays very different to the last, which is important, because after failing a few times (which you will, trust me), each stage can get pretty repetetive and variety is desperatly needed. Sometimes it feels like you are just fullfilling a bunch of chores, rather than doing some ethical decision making, and the "ethical dlimena" aspect of the game slightly drowns in the mix. I think that this is also the reason that a lot of people are disliking the game: They were expecting a "Telltale Games" type of product (me included, as I should add), yet this game is actually challenging and requires more thinking than people wanted it to. The idea of loosing in a point and click discouraged a lot of people, but I find it very refreshing and something new. Personally, I would like to see more adventures that challenge and put pressure on the player.\nMisc. Aspects:\nThe asthetic works in my opinion, the art style works, but obviously its not something mind blowing. The sounds are very good, the soundtrack is nice but can get a bit repetetive after replaying the same level severall times, the dialogue is well written. At the end of every stage, you get to see your decisions compared to other people's, which is a good addition.\nConclusion:\nOverall, I can recommend the game, although it is deffinatly not for everyone. Especially casuals will have a hard time and might rage after the first few failed attempts and give up.","July 25, 2014","true","14.2"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

You have immediate, unarguable feedback to where you went wrong, and how you can improve so that doesn't happen again.\n\nGWBW, doesn't have that. If you fail, it's unexplained why one of the many integers caused you to lose.\n\nGWBW is all too happy, try and explain the vast majority of what it is, through visual cues and if you can't pick up on them, well tough ♥♥♥♥. You just wasted 30 minutes trying to do scenario? well now you're dead, and you go straight back to the start.\n\nAnd the developers know it, when you start the game you are presented with two difficulty options. Normal wherein the developers say that you will die a lot. And Easy, wherein the devs say, you've tried normal and you now hate us. Cute, but not an accurate representation of difficulty.\n\nIf you were to ask me, for a story based adventure game in where you make critical decisions that affect the outcome of the story. There are many more fun, viable options out there. I can't recommend GWBW, to only the most seasoned of masochists.","August 4, 2014","false","1.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's a simple point and click adventure game and it does try it's best to give you lots to do, and thanks to that some stuff are easier to solve than others.\nI really hate it when this type of game has nothing to offer and is very bland and boring. but here it's pretty nice and helpful. (Examples: In level 5 you can send a soldier to explore if there are any enemy bases around and if he comes back he tells you everything you need to know.)\n\n\nStory and CharactersGreat story, might have a few flaws but it keeps you on edge and feels real good to explore stuff, there are alot of intresting characters, mostly the antagonists but other than that everyone are pretty intresting.\nLiam is our main antagonist for the most part. Irving is an antagonist for Episode 2 and the difficulty is the villain of this entire god damn game. All the other characters can be annoying and down spirited at one point but other than that they are pretty good.\n\nThe GraphicsThe graphics are beautiful and the character designs are intesting. The overall set and background are amazing and feel genuine and nothing disappointed me me about it.\n\n\nThe SoundtrackThe soundtrack is amazing. every song in this game is beautiful and awesome, I could listen to all of the songs a few times and not get tired from listening. It fits well with the style, story and things that are happening at the moment and I love it.\n\nOverallI love this game, besides the difficulty I like everything about it. Sadly the difficulty highly affects the other things and makes it very unpleasant and irritating and made me ♥♥♥♥ the game off alot of times. you'll be mad at this game alot but overall you'd be happy to finish it.\nIf you can spare 10 bucks and want to waste hours screaming "WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS AND THAT?" give it a try and you will like it.\n\nI enjoyed it and I give it an 8/10","April 22","true","11.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Not for all (or even most) tastes. I'll start this review off with a series of cautions.\n\nThe biggest difficulty with Gods Will Be Watching is it is going to appeal to a very small audience. GWBW is a game where you aren't the all-conquering hero, where people will die through your actions, and where your only satisfaction will come from doing the best you can in the circumstances you draw. In other words, it's a lot like life, and asks deeper questions about why we game or what we expect to take away from a gaming experience, not to mention the 'heroic' avatars we play over and over in games that are so much ego food. GWBW has much more in common with your typical Jason Rohrer game than it does the average indie, let alone AAA title.\n\nFurthermore, do not be fooled by anyone calling this a ' point-and-click adventure game'... it has almost nothing to do with that genre. This is a turn-based strategy game with very strict rules, although utterly unlike any other one out there in the minimalism of its style, substance, and execution.\n\nGWBW itself consists of seven different scenarios, ranging from a hostage crisis, to enduring torture, to wilderness survival, and so on. This is not a 'happy game'. The scenarios are harrowing, to say the least, and many players are going to struggle with a game where they not only don't get to win, but can only hope to minimize loss.\n\nThe goal is simply to get through each scenario in any way the player can, with consequences that you can live with. This sets up a rapidly shifting moral boundary, as necessity will rapidly come to outweigh morality.\n\nThe game boils down to effectively managing all of the variables in these scenarios while trying to keep any of them from falling into a fail-state... which they inevitably will. The scenarios themselves, however--unlike the one-offs of a time/resource management game or a 'quest' game like Oregon Trail--are complex and intertwined. The player will not only need to work to understand those relationships, but also to recognize cues when the situation is tipping too far in any of multiple directions, and to plan and react accordingly.\n\nThis means, to pick one example:\n-understanding what will cause a hostage's emotional state to improve/deteroriate\n-monitoring the visual cues that indicate that hostage's emotional state\n-planning in advance how to control/manipulate that hostage's emotional state\n-having contingencies ready (in mind) if external circumstances interfere with that plan\n-making hard decisions when all of this breaks down due to flawed planning or bad luck\n\nTo some players, the small element of luck/bad luck will be an exhiliarting thrill--an element that twists the story and changes possibilities, taking away control (similar to the great roguelikes) in order to generate emergent story. To others, taht same luck/bad luck will lead to exasperation or a feelign of malicious unfairness, and frequent reloads (especialy if they obsess about 'perfecting' each level). Buyer beware.\n\nThe most succinct thing I can say about this game to help you choose to buy it or not to buy it is: this game IS the choices you make. It's not about the story, or mastering each scenario, or working your way to a pay-off at the end (again, be warned, the ending is going to ♥♥♥♥ off a lot of you if you're looking for validation there). It is about making choices without knowing if the choice you made is 'right' or 'wrong'.\n\nThe soundtrack and pixel art are bar none some of the best of the genre, and much of the dialogue is engaging (when it doesn't fall into tropes) and the debates about the ending will undoubtedly keep the Steam message boards raging for a long time.\n\nIgnore them, play the free Ludum Dare version of the game, and form your own judgment. If you like that, give GWBW a try. It goes well with a nice glass of Chianti and any dog-eared copy of Sartre or Nietzsche.","August 4, 2014","true","12.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

I happily paid for the pre-order just on how much I respected their work and their ambition. I'm happy with that payment even as I regret to say, the full game did not pan out well.\n\nI get that it's not much of a point-and-click adventure...but there are ways to do resource-management-clicky games without the baffling design decisions made by Deconstructeam. There's a random-number-generator event in the second level that, no matter how well you've planned out your clicking strategy (which by this point, is dozens and dozens), one roll of the dice immediately kills you and sends you back to the beginning of a 15 minute long click fest. It's perhaps the dumbest, most bewildering design decision I've ever seen in a game (at least, in this decade). It's more fun to turn off the game and contemplate what exactly was going through the designers' minds when they thought that would be a worthwhile addition. I pity the game testers that had to sit through that part. But that assumes there were even any game testers, which I think is a questionable assumption given how clunky this game turned out to be. The sad part is, the problems are so endemic to the design that I don't see how a "bug patch" will fix them without completely changing the game.\n\nThat said, again, I'm happy with my pre-order purchase...indie games need support and hopefully GWBW will be a footstep for this studio to go on and create much better games in the future.","July 26, 2014","false","3.2"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","0"

It's not the graphics style or controls I am fine with those my issue is that I was expecting from the video was a set of scenarios I could choose to play out and experiment with but sadly that is not the case.\n\nInstead what we have here is a series of scenarios you play through in order - tried to play through the first in the recommended difficulty and I just repeatedly failed, it did not seem to matter what I chose and the biggest issue was the lack of visual clues of how well you were doing and how the hostages were responding. One minute all seems to go well and in a second later the hostages run one by one and you can either let them go free or shoot them - all winding up wth you having no hostages and failing soon after. Alternately you concentrate on the hostages and the guards take you out.\n\nWhat looked like a game where I could play out these scenes with some experimentation end enjoy different narrative outcomes is in fact a linear experience - someone will no doubt post a guide up that you have to follow to get a win for each scenario - but where is the real fun in that?

(The story is good until the end)\n\nDon't get me wrong here, I think GWBW is (for the most part) a good game to some degree, It offers an experience that many games fail to capture and create, a gritty and intense point 'n' click game that will have you on the edge of your seat and make your hands sweat and the thought of some of the decisions you will have to make, or at least, that is what I first thought.\n\n( Before I continue, I am not saying the developers were lying about this, this is Gods Will Be Watching, not The War Z, but as I continue, you will see what I mean. )\n\nAll of that is merely and illusion, at first, you will be grinding your teeth like a madman, and twitching like a hyperactive 5 year old, but then you see the bigger picture, and you realize the fact that all those things simply aren't true anymore.\n\nFor Example, there are choices you will have to make, choices that at first seem important, but these choices don't even matter in the long run. ( i.e: ***SPOILERS*** There are multiple decisions in the game that can lead to the deaths of certain members of your posse, but in the next chapter, they can all be back and ready to go, even though the just died in the last chapter/ And yes I know about the ending, I will get to that later. ***SPOILERS***  )\n\nThe choices only matter for the chapter you are on, it no longer makes the game intense and nerve-racking, it turns the game into a resource management game, where you have to restart every time something goes wrong, it sucks out all the fun I had with the game.\n\nThe games has no checkpoints, great for all you hardcore gamers and dark souls elitists, but for me, it was just another sucker-punch to the gut every time I failed. And yes I realize 'that is the way the game is meant to be', but is it really, you could of at least put in a few save points, like when you get to the second stage in chapter 3. It can get frustrating having to play the same mission over and over again to get to the point you were last at.\n\nLike this one time, I was 2 days away from escaping the planet in chapter 4, and everyone was fine, healthy and mostly happy, the campfire looked like it had one or two more days in it, ( The last day flame looks pretty big for what it is ) so I talked to everyone and cooked some food, but boy was I wrong, the next day the fire went cold, not to worry I thought, I'll just make a new one, so I got some wood and placed it one the campfire, now time to light it, but wait, no more bullets left, and Sgt. Burden being the mong he is said the fire couldn't be re-lit without bullets, so we all froze to death with one day left. Couldn't be re-lit, what was that bloody flame torch Donald has to repair the radio, and don't tell me it isn't a torch, 'cause it both looked and sounded like one, I would place my bets that it also tasted, smelt and felt like one too.\n\nSo fast-forward a few chapters and you get to chapter 7, the big bad boss of the game, what will the final chapter be? A combination of all that we have learn't from the other chapters, rolled into one hard-as-nails mega chapter. No, a prolonged game of Simon ♥♥♥♥ing Says, not joke, go to Youtube and watch it if you haven't already beat the game, I'll wait for you.\n\nYes the climax of the game is Simon Says. ***SPOILERS*** In this chapter, Burden starts to dribble story and exposition about how he has done this a million times, where Liam said the same thing I was thinking, 'Burden are you insane', this is the part where it only confirmed my suspicions, Burden was crazy and this was all some twisted perspective on the story, and that Burden was really Alexander or something, but much to my surprise, no. ***SPOILERS***\n\nNow I am going to spoil the ending, look away now if you don't want it spoiled, don't say I didn't warn you. ***SPOILERS*** It turns out that Burden is stuck in some looping paradox, where he  replays the the events, or chapters if you will, over and over. Aside from this being the worst way anyone could possibly end anything, apart from maybe it was all a dream or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it turns the game into a one big '♥♥♥♥ You!' to the player. It was like the nice men and women from Deconstructeam offered me a deal that was too good to refuse, then they quickly beat me with socks stuffed with the frozen tears of the last guy or girl.\n\nAfter you beat Liam in a game of Simon Says, Burden spouts some more about what he is doing is the right thing, and if this is all meaningless if he is just going to do it again, but this time he finally beat Liam, and I thought he had broken the cycle, Burden says a few last words to Liam before choosing to cure the planet or to let Xenolifer do its thing, ( The endings are no different, it is just what direction the cure floats in ) and letting himself get carried away to the void of space and time.\n\nI was genuinely sad at this, the music in the background was perfect and you could just imagine Burden's thoughts and feels, that maybe he had finally broken the cycle, and in some heart-breaking final stand of emotion, commit suicide. So I sat there, all depressed at the ending, I liked Burden, really I did, then all of a sudden, wormhole portal that continues the loop, ( from what I understand ) and Burden just floats into it, I was no longer sad, I was angry, come on he beat them, he won, but he still has to do all that again. It turned that '♥♥♥♥ You!' into  a massive flaming '♥♥♥♥ You!' with twisty nip-tassels.\n\nIf I have misunderstood the ending, and he really when into a black-hole and was atomically destroyed, then that makes it even sadder.

I'm on chapter 4 in original mode (the hard mode and i have never tried easy mode) and I don't feel this game is too frustrating. The game is all about risk management and figuring out the mechanics. I've managed to keep my entire team alive just with proper micro-management. This game's strategy is all about micro-management and assessing your risks. It is not a point and click adventure like what many have been led to believe. This is a good game to pick up if you're looking for a puzzle game (which is what it should have been advertised as). It's not a game about "moral dilemma with hard choices" like many believed. Indeed, people who were "sacrificed" come back to life in the next chapter. Just keep in mind what kind of game this really is before buying it.\n\nThere is an RNG factor in the game but there are plenty of ways around it. SPOILER: The one exception is the russian roullette part. There is still a higher chance of winning at this part if you know what you are doing, but I still agree that it's kinda cheap. When you get good at this game, you will realize that the chances of RNG completely screwing you over is actually extremely slim. I actually found Chapter 3 to be easier than the first two chapters. That may be because I'm learning how the game works instead of complaining about the RNG.\n\nLosing is actually not frustrating in this game as long as you learn from it. You learn from how you failed at the game's "puzzle" and what you can do next time. This leads to some trial and error but not really in a frustrating way in my opinion. You're trying to figure out how to solve a puzzle which means finding what fails and what works.\n\nI give the game an 8/10. Working around the game's RNG can be fun but there are certain parts where it's just cheap (like the russian roullette). I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games but that's about it.","July 30, 2014","true","10.0"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","21","36","0","1"

That is ridiculous. People are different. My recommendation to a person should be based on what I know about that person.\n\nI'll post here what I posted to my guildmates. This game is different. It is not for everyone. It is not a matter of the game/story/etc. being either good or bad. The game is what it is and some can appreciate that while others cannot.\n\nThe best rule of thumb is to play the free demo/ludum dare entry. Liked it? Then you should like what awaits in the new scenarios. If you didn't like it, then don't expect to feel differently about the product for sale. This warning shouldn't be necessary, but if you don't have any tolerance for trial and error, then perhaps don't bother even playing the demo.\n\nThis game has its roots in minimalism, and deals with difficult subject matter. Your experience(s) will be unique to your personality. If you don't like to have your beliefs challenged, then stay away. If you want the game to tell you what to think, rather than thinking for yourself, then stay away.\n\nI'll even go so far to say that if you are at all inclined to think of things as being good or bad, rather than accepting the fact that not everything can please everyone (and therefore is not required to do so), then just stay away. There's no need to trash the game on the basis of nothing but your petty bias.\n\nIt is hardly relevant to you, but I very much enjoyed it.

Based on that, you may or may not disagree with my assessment as this is NOT A BAD GAME, simply not what was advertised.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW:\n\nIf you want a story-based experience of tough choices: do yourself a favor and play Unrest instead.\n\nI bought Gods Will Be Watching assuming it to capture at least some of the hard human decision-making that made games like Always Sometimes Monsters, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, Mass Effect and others so unique and brilliant. Unfortunately, Gods Will be Watching had none of this.\n\nStraight away, the game throws the player into a situation that may seem morally interesting at first, but is soon realized to be nothing other than a simple (as in: not complicated, but still very hard) time management game. It is at this point where it dawned on me that this was, in fact, competing not with the games mentioned above but with Cook, Serve, Delicious and the like - only that it was doing so badly.\n\nAs the player never really learns about their character or has any chance to immerse themselves in the setting, the "moral choices" one has to make are appropriately bland and meaningless. Even worse, some decisions turn out to actually have no effect - for example, in at least one instance, a dead crew member comes back to life in the level after they were killed without a mention and sticks around to provide dialogue. Decision-making is limited to the aforementioned time management and resource exchanges (shooting a hostage earns more time, but costs a hostage). Moral dilemmas? Not really.\n\nWhat the game has going for it are its beautiful pixel graphics and its soundtrack. If you are looking for a challenging time-management puzzle game, Gods Will Be Watching can be an interesting distraction. I, personally, was disappointed by its lack of character and narrative.","July 24, 2014","false","2.1"," 94 of 176 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","94","176","0","0"

Eventually, I did like the atmosphere and I approve of the art, music and even the setting as the game's greatest merits. However, the systems and the story told simply don't play along nice.\n\n\nTake Chapter 2 for instance. You're captured and are brutally tortured. The retort between your torturer who explains himself and the way you hold out by crafting an elaborate web of lies are actually pretty riveting... for the first 3 times.\n\nThen the game falls flat and literally pulls out its own carpet out from under itself in this dialogue:\n\n"There has to be a pattern to his torture. Most psychopats have."\n"Yeah, if only I had a dozen lives to figure it out."\n\n\nAnd you do! And its such a disappointment in its own way. Took me getting beaten to death twice to figure out begging actually works when you're in the bleeding posture, took me 6 drawn molars to realize I'm pretty safe lying after constructing a ruse by thinking twice.\nI've now been killed thrice by getting ripped in half on the torture rack.\nIf that sounds extreme; don't worry. You'll get used to it. The game loses a lot of its charm and all investment you could have had for the plight of your characters, as you conquer its systems instead of enjoy the experience, which is the exact opposite of what I wanted. The survival horror is still present, but the game fails to marry it with the mechanics.\n\n\nNow, this is a tough game. I recognize that. I'm not even punishing it for that and I'm not part of the conga-line of people that blame the game for being too hard or random. I'm the kind of guy that whips out a pen and paper whenever the game befuddles me and I can promise you that a lot of these actions aren't as random as you might think, or can be compensated for by mastering other factors.\nAnd very rarely, yes, it is simply Russian Roulette - literally so in Chapter two torture scene where a seven bullet gun with one chamber loaded is placed against your head. Things like that are the only factors that are completely random (inside an otherwise predetermined routine mind you), but oddly enough this was the only situation that after neatly figuring out how to survive the entire jount and the most grizzly tortures on paper, that still managed to get a kick out of me and made me deeply empathize with what was on-screen. Didn't bat an eyelash being tore in two on the rack or getting an arm lobbed off since I know how to avoid that, but damn if that gun didn't made me turn away and close my eyes every frackin time. Its been a long time a game made me do that.\n\n\nBut do hostages that detailed truly add to the situation, or do they simply become faceless fickle systems you need to master? And why are their random failstates in a game I've learned to play as a spreadsheet system, even though those are sometimes the best moments? Should they be? Can I truly feel for characters I've seen die and resurrect more times than I care to count? (Even though I still really enjoy seeing these characters getting fleshed out under such bizarre circumstances.)\n\nAll of it is simply too disjointed.\n\n\n\nI still think there are moments of brilliance though. The concept sounded really good on paper and some of the systems work brilliantly, even though not unified enough to create an end-product that I can recommend or understand.\n\nIf Gods Will Be Watching can be compared to a failed product other than a game, than it would be a wrongly crafted piece of jewelry where all the gemstones poke haphazardly out of an ugly clump of gold.\nI just wish someone would take note of the design and not the result, to create the game that I would have liked Gods Will be Watching to be.","July 28, 2014","false","20.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Because it is not as advertised. It is no 'open choice point and click adventure' of any sorts.\n\nWhat it is, in fact, is a 2D pixel game where you use trial and error in the hopes of not ♥♥♥♥ing up a given scenario. This may sound fun, but within 20 minutes it becomes damn frustrating. There's no sign of the open world, choice driven, multiple storyline plot that the game advertised itself as being.\n\nThe learning curve is also incredible. I managed to barely scrape by after about 20 attempts on Easy, but on Normal I'm seriously unsure of what I'm doing wrong - again, I don't have much room to actually make my own choices, I just learn from dying over and over until the scenario can be beat. Some of it doesn't even make sense - choices that should have a positive outcome by any logical standard ruin everything for no reason.\n\nI'd describe it as..a very pretty 2D game, sure, but more of a linear, 'don't shoot hostage A because you've learned hostage B will run after your fiftieth death' kinda game. The graphics, characters, and plot are all there (although the plot could be described as choppy at best.)\n\nThe bugs in the game, as there are many, that are frequent (random white screens, sound issues, crashes) can be fixed with patches, the core mechanics of this game cannot. If you are looking for a game that is adequately 'a game' but does nothing it advertised, this game is perfect for you. If you're looking for the game described, keep looking.\n\n5/10.

The game records the actions you are using to be succesful in that scenario and if you do complete it, it will display actions that other players had to do to be succesful in %.\nHence the name Gods Will Be Watching.\n\nThe puzzle part comes from how can you keep the scenario under control while achieving 1 goal. For example:\nFirst Scenario has you managing hostages: keep them too relax or nervous and they will try to escape or attack your team\nMaganing a hack: you have to keep a security bar at the highest or risk a system shutdown while trying to get a hack boost bar at it highest.\nKeeping a swat team away from the doors of the office your team is barricaded in.\nYour team might panic and you will need to calm them down\n\nIf you fail, lose all hostages, swat team attacks, you get attacked and die or your team panic, you will restart the whole scenario. And everytime you restart the scenario you will be having the same conversation with the hostages, the swat and your team. Plus the scenarios can have random factors in it, kicking a hostage might make the other 3 nervous in this playthrough.... or not. It gets repetitive and stale pretty fast.\n\nGets so stale that when you get the stat screen, showing the % of what other did in that scenario, you really dont much care since you did whatever it took to get out of that level and just move on with the story.\n\nI would not recommend because of its scenario restart, repetitive gameplay and random elements to completing scenarios.

But that's part of its beauty.\nAt first, I too had the impression that the HEAVY emphasis on difficulty and the amount of focus on succeeding unecessarily distracts you from actually questioning the morality of your actions, but after a while I begin to realize that this is EXACTLY the point;\nthe game is hard and cruel and unforgiving, and it is up to you whether you will lose your cool and become a ruthless, abusive monster driven by nothing than your wish to beat the game, or whether you will maintain your solidarity and humanity even against such impossible odds.\nAnd it IS possible to win and yet do things right, never doubt it!\n\nSo that's the biggest, greatest plus of Gods Will Be Watching - to sum it up in different words, the game will put ridiculous pressure on you, and the real beauty of it is not so much in beating each chapter as rather in HOW you beat each chapter, how hard you will try find the right balance between being effective and being self-destructively kind and naive.\nIt is fair to say that the main strenght of the game is not so much in what happens on the screen as in what happens within you while you struggle with frustration. (though, to be fair, not once have I gotten frustrated to the point of being angry at the game, despite having to repeat each level good three to eight times)\n\nThe second thing that I feel I must praise is the incredible diversity.\nEvery chapter has entirely different setting, mood and atmosphere, and that is rare to say at least. Thanks to this, the game never gets boring or repetetive - I mean, DAMN! Just when I thought I had a pretty good idea about what I am into, after resorting to terrorist actions for nonetheless decent cause, through surviving in extremely hostile enviroment and withstanding torture, BAM! I find myself stranded in the middle of the desert in hopeless battle against both the enemy forces and the never-ceasing heat.\nI can't really find the words to describe this aspect of the game, so let me just call it what I feel it is: MAGIC! DONWRIGHT MAGIC!\n\nFinally, the writting is excellent. The plot is grown-up and doesn't resort to dividing characters into good guys and bad guys, the characters you meet are all unique, believable and relatable (not to mention likeable - Liam! You magnificent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!),\nand quite soon you will find yourself caring for them.\n\nBrazillion outta ten; I am happy beyond words to see a game such as this, and wish to see many more in the future.\nThis is where gaming meets art. This is where gaming becomes an instrument that further encourages exploration of the human nature and nudges you towards unsettling and unusual questions about yourself and the world around you, rather than being just means of entertainment.","July 25, 2014","true","8.9"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

If you were intrigued by this game's gripping premise, and the idea of making solid moral choices, stay away, because this is not the game you thought it was.\n\nWhat was sold as a "thriller" where players "face intriguing puzzles and tough decisions" is actually just a repetitive puzzle game. It places you in situations which are ripe with difficult moral choices, except none of the choices are actually choices - they're decisions that function as mechanics to a predetermined goal. Saving or killing a hostage is not a choice, but instead a method of keeping the guards at bay. Succeeding or failing at your missions are not complex dillemas that were made on the back of your hard decisions - they're calculated and mathematical uses of the mechanics in your surroundings to accomplish an objective, with a failure resulting in a simple Game Over screen.\n\nIt's just sad. This game had so much potential, and it just did not live up to expectations or the merits with which is was sold on. Although the premise is good, the writing is janky; although the art is beautiful, the execution of the game mechanics are convoluted; although the story is intriguing, it's also ham-handed, repetitive, and not very expressive.

It's a game of tough decisions. Ultimately it is possible to save everyone but it will often require practice, planning and a bit of luck to pull off. Speaking of luck, the game has a degree of RNG that ensures that you are never certain that everything will go according to plan, however you are usually given tools to avoid risking too much as well. This is however still something that can put people off, so the developer was kind enough to add a 'puzzle mode' which reduces the effect of RNG. The game is still however pretty difficult, expect to fail a few times till you get through it. The game does come with an 'easy' mode that makes the challenges noticeably easier to overcome, but there's a reason the developer states that the game should be played on normal and I also feel it ruins the experience to go 'puzzle mode' or 'easy mode'.\n\nIn the end I recommend it provided you're not put off by the difficulty, particularly if making tough decisions is your thing.","December 3, 2015","true","17.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quixoticsamio/recommended/274290/","quixoticsamio","Samio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quixoticsamio/","128 products in account","Overview\nGames are usually fun activities. People are presented with challenges, given a set of tools, the promise of a winning state (or several) and through the use of those tools the player is expected to reach that win state. This process may be hard or easy, complex or simple, but it's bound by explicit rules and the player is expected to have a fair shot at victory. Also, it's expected that though the process might imply some frustration, the overall experience is pleasant and fun.\n\nThat's the usual fare for videogames.\n\nGods Will Be Watching is not like those videogames.\n\nNot all human art is pleasant. Some is unpleasant due to a lack of skill, it's just bad art. But some art has as its goal to  be unpleasant. Example: horror movies produce fear (...or camp), so do horror games. Or, say, Lars von Trier movies also tend to involve the darker, unwelcome parts of the emotional range. And some people like those experiences. Not all people, but some do. And while movies that seek to explore the emotional range of paranoia, fear, shame, etc., are not for everyone, it is good that those subjects are explored. And just like some of those movies try from design to produce unpleasant emotions, Gods Will Be Watching has as its intended artistic goal to make the player experience anguish, stress, frustration and despair.\n\nGods Will Be Watching [GWBW from now on] is not a game everyone should play. But GWBW is a good game. GWBW takes a hard bet, it sets out to evoke emotions of futility and frustration on the player, through the unique aesthetic channel of videogames: interaction. GWBW's original (and intended) mode will sometimes force you into unwinnable scenarios. It has internal randomness. It is arbitrary. It is unfair. It is cold and uncaring. It will make you feel like you just wasted hours of your life in a task that, in the end, you didn't have any choice in overcoming.\n\nBut that's exactly what GWBW sets  out to do. It's the aesthetic and moral lesson of the game. If this is not something you want to experience, skip GWBW. But if you have an appreciation for existentialism and think Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus was not hardcore enough, GWBW is exactly the experience you're looking for.\n\nVisuals\nThe pixel art helps soothe what would be an unbearable experience. It's beautiful and well animated. Every character is given a unique presence. Given the constraints of the game, it does a lot with very little. I can't see the game presenting its style through anything other than these pixel visuals. Less and it'd take away from the visual cues, more complexity and the game would suffer from it.\n\nAudio\nGoodness, the game's music is amazing. Given the strong role of emotions in this game, music had to have a strong presence and it pays off perfectly. The soundtrack is closest to space ambient, it's always dark, alien and melancholy. Some tracks are plain oppressive, some more intense and some carry a feeling of keeping a small ember of hope against a hostile reality. Fingerspit does an excellent job. Experiencing the soundtrack along with the game's narrative is worth the game's price alone.\n\nGameplay\nWhile the interface may seem like a more traditional point and click adventure game, there are no item oriented puzzles or riddles. The gameplay centers around survival and resource management. It involves calculation, experimentation and trial-and-error. Failure is part of this game's narrative. You are expected to be overwhelmed by choices with no clear indication of their results, fail, learn from that failure and eventually overcome what's essentially an economical challenge - one that involves incredibly cruel moral dilemmas.\n\nAgain, from the overview, this is not for everyone. But what it plans out to do, it does so spectacularly.\n\nStory & Narrative\nAnother stellar feature of this game. The game has very little text or dialogue, but what little it has is presented with maximum efficiency. The story of the game, including the DLC Chapter, is very rich and will leave you thinking for a long time. Philosophers, mathematicians and fans of science-fiction especially will get a lot from this game.\n\nOverall\nGods Will Be Watching is everything the mainstream gaming market is not. It's audacious, creative, does not pander to fans. It springs from an artistic need to express and explore emotions not everyone wants to consider. GWBW is cruel, unforgiving, many times frustrating - it does not provide escapism, it does not massage the ego of the player through power-fantasies. Its demographics are small and it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a lot of people off (just see other reviews for this game).\n\nAnd because of this, it deserves the mountains of praise I am giving it. It's not what everyone needs or wants, GWBW is everything videogames need right now.

No.  Is it for the sadistic?  Yes.\n\nThe casual mode I have yet to try maybe it's better.. Not sure. I'm sure the story by itself is fun, but the intergrity of the game's often lost in those senarios.  I would recommend this game for those die hard adventure quest genre people.

A lot of people seem to have similar complaints, but I'll try to keep this relatively condensed.\n\nWhat you are promised/expecting:\nA point-and-click adventure game, filled with moral dilemmas, something that will make you "feel bad" - as PC Gamer says in the little blurb given on Steam. This sounds fun, it sounds like a game that has a solid story, and very interesting psychological/ethical questions accompanying it.\n\nWhat you get:\nPerhaps the only quote that is really accurate is "There's no good or evil, just decisions, with only you and the gods as a judge to your actions." While this quote was probably meant to make the reader think "I'll be in such dire situations that any action can be justified!" What it comes to mean is that the game is a monotonous disaster, and none of your choices are really evil or good, by the end of the game you're going through the motions. The game is compromised of several ball-breaking puzzles, and there is certainly some incentive to make moral decisions at first. However, it quickly becomes clear that there are very few options, by the end you don't care if you're shooting the civilian, or calming them, it's whatever you have to do to get to the next level. Why? Because you've seen all of this dialogue and these situations over and over again. The game is at its worst when you are killed half a dozen times, and you have to read through the same dialogue time and time again.\n\n\nI myself played through one level, and part of the second. The dialogue wasn't particularly engaging, and the story was a bit dull. The dialogue sometimes feels very bland, or immature. The characters are not very believable, and having people tell you game mechanics in character destroys any immersion. I've had a hard time picking this game up again, and it'll probably sit unplayed in my library. One of the biggest disappointments I've come across in a long time.\n","January 3, 2015","false","1.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

It looked like someone took all those extreme "would-you-rather" or "what-if" nightmare scenarios that friends sometimes play and mashed it with the heavy moral weight ala Telltale's The Walking Dead. What will you do to survive? Will you sacrifice your humanity?\n\nSadly, this all falls flat in the execution. First off, this game is VERY difficult (which is not necessarily a bad thing). However, each  failure feels like a punishment as the game makes you start over from the very beginning of the chapter. This would not be an issue if each chapter weren't so long (it tooke me at least an hour and a half to complete the first chapter). Adding to this, the options available to you for each scenario is fairly limited. Add that to the frequent deaths going back to square one and each chapter can feel like a real drag. Whereas The Walking Dead made each decision have a real weight to it that would really affect your environment, this game makes each decision feel significantly less important. This is due to the fact that after a while you start to realize that you are going to be repeating that same decision every time you have to restart the chapter. The final episode of Telltale's the Walking Dead would have had a lot less emotional punch if you kept on having to ask Clementine to shoot you.\n\nFinally, it seems as though every scenario has a very narrow set of sequential actions that will allow you to move on to the next chapter. This results in each chapter feeling more like a guessing game rather than an actual scenario where each decision feels wholly your own. Ultimately, this was what really drove my decison to give this game a thumbs down. Stick with  Telltale's the Walking Dead if you want a game with weighty moral dilemmas.","July 24, 2014","false","8.9"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","30","55","0","0"

I happened to come across it and thought the style of the game was appealing, so I preordered it. However, after playing it for multiple hours and understanding the core concept and design philosophy, I can say that this is truly a gem among adventure games.\n\nStarting out the game, I was quickly introduced to the story and characters and then quickly placed into the first scenario. Without spoiling anything, I was tasked to, essentially, multimanage multiple situations in conjunction with completing the ultimate task at hand. It requires a lot (emphasis on LOT) of trial and error before you understand what exactly you need to do before accomplishing the goal. It took me around 20 times or so before I finally finished the first scenario, and that included a lower in difficulty at the half way mark.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. This game is incredibly difficult and oftentimes unforgiving. This works in sync with the story since it always places the protaganist in seemingly impossible situations. You could be nearly complete with a scenario and then suddenly have everything go wrong at the press of a button. Despite this issue, albeit frustrating, the difficulty is what makes the game. Through trial and error, you will figure out strategies from past mistakes and rethink your approach to the situation. I believe this to be the core design philosophy of the developers, however, this idea can be muddled if you become infuriated with the constant failure. To quell this frustration a little, I'd advise starting with Easy unless you are brave enough and want to suffer through the game repeatedly.\n\nAnyways, thats the jist of the game. It's difficult, but you defitinely feel a strong sense of relief after each scenario. Before you call the game off as bad, however, I advise really thinking about the game's design in conjunction with its storyline. I think if more players unlocks this "not-so-secret" secret, then they will feel a little more appreciative and connected to the game.\n\nAdvice for newcomers:\n- Start at Easy difficulty so you will enjoy what the game has to offer the first time through.\n- Take your time and really think through your options. Time progresses only when you do an action, therefore keep calm and breath through the situations.\n- Expect things to go wrong. Since a lot of the game relies on chance and probability, make sure you have a backup plan before you go all in.\n- Take extra time to read what the scenario instructions (if available) tell you to do.\n- Guessing is inevitable.","July 28, 2014","true","12.3"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

But to do this, the game would need to present you with various possibilities where its hard to decide what the moral thing to do. You can see that sort of thing in "The Walking Dead" or "Papers Please".\n\nInstead, we get something more akin to a 'pacifist' achievement that sometimes appears in AAA titles like Dishonored, Mirrors Edge or Metro. Im not against those kinds of achievements and options, however that is more akin to a difficuly level, rather than an exploration of ethics.\n\nFor example, the second mission is fantastic, you are being tortured and you must survive day after day of torture, but where is the ethics problem? You can try to survive at the cost of your friends life....or try to get both of you through.\n\nI was hoping for something more grey, e.g. Both live but let enemies gain information that endangers innocents, vs letting friend die.","June 21, 2015","false","2.5"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","19","34","0","2"

It was not.\n\nPros:\n*Decent looking story. I mean it's got it's originality.\n*Great pixel art. I'm a sucker for it.\n*Cool end-of-mission screeens. They can compare the actions you did on a level with everyone else who bought the game.\n*Ok # of outcomes.\n\nCons:\n*I can't connect with the characters due to their semi-bland personalities, fully bland jokes, and PLEASE SHUT THE FRONT DOOR dialogue. This makes testing my morality EXTREMELY easy.\n*Runs ENTIRELY on luck. If a game were to have luck integrated into it (like Fallout's VATS system), then I'd hold my tongue. BUT to consider a mission successful based on percentages is pure bull.\n\nI can tell how fun a game is based on whether I want to replay it and whether to increase the dificulty when I do so. This game says ITS REEAAAAAALLLLY RECCOMMENDED if you play it on "normal" dificulty to get the full experience, and then it kicks you in the balls with the borderline impossible gameplay. There are games out there where dying is constant and seemingly endless (Dark Souls), but this game determines your odds of success LITERALLY by a percentage and not by the skill of the gamer. If you play it on easy mode it makes a difference, but you're not enjoying the game the way the devs want you to.\n\ntl;dr: The developers made promises it couldn't keep up to, it relies soley on percentages and not skill, the characters are bland.

A few of the challenges seem to have very high impacting elements of luck involved which makes them more irritating but they are in the minority while the remainder, while still usually being impossible on the first attempt, do each offer ways to learn and improve and give you a better chance of success by doing so which is very satisfying. What may not be expected of a game about moral dilemma and sacrifice is that if you do happen to let one of your comrades die in a certain chapter of the story they will not continue to be dead. The chapters tell the story while you are tasked with trying to get the outcome where ideally nobody dies.\n\nThe graphics and music are lovely for complementing the characters and atmosphere. I've always thought that games with similar graphics to this tell their stories well. The music is bittersweet and reminds me almost of Chrono Trigger's which is of course amazing. The story is interesting and kept me hooked but was very blurry to begin with, coming together nicely at the end (Spoilers for this and Undertale: which has elements of what Undertale does best with temporal loops and it's use of the "fourth wall"). The extra mission is a must-play for the explanation it gives. Do not leave this game without completing it. It should be the last chapter not just labelled the "extra mission" because the game is incomplete without it.\n\nRecommended for those patient enough to get through some of the luck based encounters and who will enjoy replaying levels to adapt to succeed in them. In return you'll get a neat little bittersweet story looking at the lives of some impressive characters that deal with harsh situations and try desperately to avoid the inevitable. Also some nicely humourous moments through dialogue and gameplay (I laughed at two of the chapters where I failed instantly after ending the first turn). Again, play the extra mission.","January 2","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will be put in all sorts of situations where your survival will need sacrifice in one way or the other and you will have to choose between bad or worse. The problem for some people will be that these situations can drag on for a long time and require a lot of trail and error, but they also become extremely tense and rewarding.\nIn between chapters there is a text heavy and quite philosophical storyline, taking place in a dirty futuristic, intergalactical setting, which was intriguing for me, but might put some people off. While asking lots of big questions, the storyline is not very deep, but charming nontheless.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who want to feel something and know they have patience.

The player will make decisions that will result in a variety of outcomes: the loss of characters, the altering of the story, advancement or failure. It's actually more a mathematical exercise than anything in that it's pure crisis management. Each decision you make will maintain or improve certain aspects of the scenario while others decline (ex. using actions to go hunting for food may provide meals, at the expense of preparing camp for the night to fend off wolves or to make a fire to stay warm), and the player must manage each of them to the best of their ability in order to keep everyone alive.\n\nGods Will Be Watching gets a thumbs up from me just because it's something different and it executes its idea well, though is basically just a mathematical exercise with story laced into it.

And some games are such a dark, odd trip that after completing them I'm left just blinking and wondering what could possess someone to make it. Gods Will Be Watching ticks both those boxes on the grand list of "indie game weirdness", I'm happy to say.\n\nGWBW is sold as something of a point and click adventure game, but is sort of more turn-based crisis management simulator. Sure you can point and click on things to make things happen, but most interactions you can choose to make consume time, and the scenarios it puts you into are generally quite short on that. Though thankfully you can move at your own pace and real time isn't a factor in between decisions. Constantly spinning plates, you're tasked with maintaining several things at once, where neglecting even one for too long will send things spinning out of control towards disaster.\n\nFrom hostage situations, to torture rooms, to survival situations and more, each of the seven chapters across its space opera setting put you into what seem like almost impossible scenarios, and let you try to figure out a way to salvage things. There is no morality meter, and many scenarios offer you some very shady options should you feel you need to resort to them. You can sacrifice people for the good of the team, threaten or harm a child to make his parents talk, even resort to cannibalism. All these actions have downsides of their own, but the game's never going to call you a bad person if you use them.\n\nThe base game makes heavy use of randomness, meaning that even with a perfect strategy, if there is such a thing, things can fail. Frequent failure and experimentation until you get things right enough to get through the chapter is the intended experience, and ties into the overall themes of the narrative, but if you're the type who absolutely despises losing due to bad rolls, there are multiple options for you. Aside from the brutal rng-based "original" mode, there's an easier "light" mode which tones down the cruelty a bit. If you can't stand rng at all, there is also a "puzzle" mode which ditches rng and revises the scenarios so that the right strategy wins every time. Even beyond that, there is a "narrative" mode that ditches most of the challenge entirely so you can just see the story.\n\nWhile I fully approve of a game offering a choice of ways to experience it, the original mode does make the most sense when it comes to the overall story it's telling, creating a feeling of controlled helplessness as you pray to the random number gods that things work out this time. The story itself is about as bleak as things get, ramming home an overarching theme of nihilism and the insignificance of the individual on a cosmic level, but twists and turns along the way make for near-infinite replayability. It's very enjoyable to unravel, even if the storytelling can be a little confusing at times.\n\nOverall, while it may be too frustrating in its original intended form for some, and way too damn bleak for others, Gods Will Be Watching is a twisted, unique indie gem that will disturb and provoke if you give it the chance.\n\n","June 2","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To be fair, there should be a disclaimer: This game is built to make the player fail. You will fail. Repeatedly. Sometimes simply because RNG decides it so.\n\nIf that turns you away, then don't purchase this game. You are offered little to no direct instructions other than how to select commands, and you are presented with, at most, hints from other characters about how to proceed. The rest is completely up to you to figure out. And when you finally "get it", it will often be too late as half your party is either dead or about to die and the game over is seconds away. But every time you fail and restart (which, by the way, is incredibly smooth, putting you right back into the action by skipping any unneeded dialogue), you push forward with your newly found knowledge to beat the level. It could be as simple as memorizing the visual cues or realizing a pattern to how events sequence out. And it's not like you don't know what killed you. It is often extremely clear (I failed a chapter 1 minute in because I failed to light the campfire for the night, freezing everyone to death, with an accompanying message reminding me what I'm dumb). All this adds up to a "Eureka!" moment, when you finally get your own routine down to beat the level, where you understand how to keep that constantly rebelling hostage from attacking, and you are certain you can win.\n\n\n\n\n...And then you fail an action that has an 80% chance of success, giving you a game over.\n\nIt's all very reminiscent of the difficulty of retro games, where the only way to succeed is by dying to the traps that you can't possibly avoid without already knowing they are there.\n\nIt does what a "choose your adventure" point and click like The Walking Dead series was supposed to do: Your moral choices aren't simply governed by how much you like a character (Let's be real, every "save this character" choice in TWD was ultimately inconsequential if you survived or not), but by the fact that choosing to be benevolent can doom your entire group. Knowing you are one unlucky dice roll away from death certainly skews most people's moral compass.\n\nIn multiple chapters you are presented with a survival challenge: Keep everyone in your group well-rested, fed, and happy, otherwise there will be deaths. Easy enough, right? So when oxygen is running out and the only way to survive is by getting passwords from your hostages who refuse to talk, do you beat their kid and threaten to blast his head off to break his mother into telling, or do you let him free to earn the trust of your captives? Or what about when your hunter is unable to come up with food for the day, and you have to choose between feeding your party's doctor or another member who offers purely moral support? Do you let the doctor go hungry and risk him dying/deserting, leaving your party without medical aid, or do you feed him and let someone else starve to death? Suddenly, moral choices become much more impactful.\n\nFor me, the combination of "You can't save everyone" with RNG elements and vague mechanics makes the game much more immersive than your standard survival game. You aren't given clear instructions, consequences need to be learned (the hard way), and often times you don't even know what the win state is.\n\nWhich brings me to chapter 2.  Everyone is whinging about it, so if you read the reviews you'll probably know a little about it.  It's a torture chapter, where you need to endure (what you are told to be) 20 days of torture. And in the middle of it you have to play a literal, unbiased, beautifully cruel game of Russian roulette. Every time you choose to not answer a question, the guy aims the revolver loaded with one bullet at you, and the only thing keeping you alive is merciless Lady Luck herself. This segment of the chapter is fantastic because you have to plan around it. You are given a little bit of leeway, every time you are close to the brink of death you can tell your torturers a little bit about the truth so they give you a break. Give them too much though, and you fail anyway. So you can either use those confessions to make the rest of the sequence easier, hoping for good luck on the roulette, or you can save your confessions to basically bypass the roulette sequence. And when it comes down to it, the feeling of complete hopelessness you get when you're waiting for that click of the empty chamber is amazing.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing game. The minimalistic graphics are awesome, the soundtrack is superb, the story is a little cheesy, yeah, but still enjoyable. If you are patient and aren't turned off by the fact you can fail simply because the game said ♥♥♥♥ you, pick this game up. Definitely worth at least a try.\n\n","October 24, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's a good concept, and has cool art, a interesting play style, but it's just not right. It does this drama about characters you cant really care about because they are blurry pixel faces without voices, pulling random objects out of their asses and things and it just doesn't work. Also, its so freaking hard, playing it on the easiest mode is irritating, and anyone "good" at this game, simply has failed a thousand times and tried every fail combination possible. But the worst of this is the randomness. Random ♥♥♥♥ happens throughout the story just to screw you up. Ok, fine, but does the game have to be entirely dependent on this mechanic? And of alllll the times they could really use this random mechanic, like when you're being tortured, they don't. So it's simply two moves and they rip you in half every time. Yet, wandering the dessert, yes, you do this... you ♥♥♥♥ing do this... the whole ♥♥♥♥ is random, every area randomly chosen(or at least near random enough for me to not care to figure out a pattern, random sandstorms, random bs. At least you don't have to worry about people with more than half their morale taking off in the middle of the night because ya had them fix a radio? wtf ♥♥♥♥ this crap. And you retry and retry making your every effort to see them all through, just to find it doesnt even affect the story whether or not these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s took off... they show right the ♥♥♥♥ back up.\nNor did it seem to matter what info I gave during torture...\nI don't think anything matters about this game... and they dramatically talk about that from time to time. What's worse, is it's the kinda drama that would make you say "ugh get on with the movie already." And its non stop. Whoever wrote the game just thought that he could make something heartwrenching by being so dramatic, but it fails in that way. It is heartwrenching trying to deal with the gameplay. I just "thank the gods" that I managed to get all the right compounds in nearly the right order on the first try during the mission that makes you...get this...\n\nFirst you have to dig yourself out of a hole\nmanaging a bunch of people a robot and a dog to do the digging\nya have to have defibulators charged up which takes a guy to do\nya have to have a robot charge some other ♥♥♥♥ up from time to time\nmaking sure you dont blow him up\nya have to make seditives and adrenalins to make sure everyone gets rest and wakes up on time\nya have to synthesize a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ anti virus made of 4 of i think 6 latin letters in a specific order.\nya have to test that stuff on the people\nya have to make it a certain lethality to determine whether or not it works\nya may kill someone idk\n\n\nahhh man, and a dozen other things in a time limit.\nReally, the gameplay is obnoxious. The drama is pretentious and cheesy. It's just not fun. It's a headache, with expanding returns. If, this whole story was different, and instead of making choices in time limits about peoples lives, it was about something humorous, and the choices realllly didn't matter, this would be great. BUT I wouldn't trust these guys to write good humor either.","November 30, 2014","false","3.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Finding the right pattern of choices will make you feel pretty damn smart. There are some elements of chance, which I grant might be frustrating to some. For me, though, those same elements of chance made the game a downright thrill ride at certain points. It was exciting enough that it never even really felt like a point-and-click.

The original idea of this game came from the 26th Ludum Dare based on Minimalism.\n\nPlot\nThe writing on this game, in my opinion, is lacking. The whole was through was a confusing mess. No matter who was killed one chapter, the game threw them back into the next chapter with little to no explaination with only the ending giving  any  clarity. What the game does have going for it is the down to earth sections. The "lore" behind it was well planned and thought out, but it never did make up for the confusion of the story. It just seemed like average sci-fi story with a twisted dark side to it.\n\nGameplay\nThis is mainly where the flesh of the game is tainted. The game is broken up into 7 chapters. Each chapter is very different to the next, each one introducing a lot of new ideas and something you definitely haven't done before. It's exciting and fresh. Except when you have to redo it  OVER AND OVER  again. This game is built around the idea of trial and error. So you will screw up. A lot. And this is where issues began. The chapters were mainly built on managing work and items. Who does what and what do we do with these items. Various chapters splash in specks of random. This is where the gameplay falls apart. You'll end up replaying chapters over and over again, failing each time to this random element. Frustrating gameplay doesn't equal having fun.\n\nGraphics\nDevolver Digital has done it again! Made a visually appealing game out of something my SNES could run! Congratulations! But all jokes aside, this game is a looker. The different colors blend the pixels in well, and with each death lying there from my hands made my stomach churn with how it blended in well! The art team did a great job on this one.\n\nSound\nThe plinks and plonks of this game can really immerse you into the science fiction story. Each action seemed to be complimented with a gratifying audio sound. The music is easily compared to that of FTL, but less fast paced. It was lacking that sense of urgency on certain missions, but none the less blended in well.\n\nGenre\nDid this game fit in well with it's genre. Yes and no. Yes to the point and click adventure, and no to the moral choice gameplay. It is a dark game full of dark awful people, but aren't well all disgusting people? Well, no game. We are not. The game tends to put you into these hard choice moments,  BUT NONE OF THEM EVEN MATTER !\nSlight spoiler alert for this bit so tread lightly!\n[spolier] Death in this game is parshily pointless! Whenever a character dies, they just get up and brush it off to appear in the next chapter! I shot and killed my engineer in the group, just to have him aboard my ship after being rescued without him! [/spoiler]\n\nBreakdown\n\n1.) Did I have fun? Yes. I had fun in a dark sense, but I was also frustrated and felt as though I wasted time.\n2.) Is the money worth the length? $10 or Euro/Pound equvilant for about 8 hours of gameplay... (Unless you're like me and always get screwed in a certain chapter of the game for four hours)\n\nOverall  Gods Will Be Watching is a game that is worth a watch on YouTube, but is a  no buy.\n\n","July 27, 2014","false","10.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It's supposed to be a game about talking your way through tense, high stakes, dramatic scenarios by reading the characters' behaviors to gain the upper hand. It almost get, too. The problem is that the actions you take will do different things each time you play. Outcomes rely too much on hidden dice rolls for the punishing checkpoints to be bearable.\n\nSome situations are explicitly RNG based. The game will even tell you "you have a 1 in X chance of failing this". If you do fail, you have to start the chapter over again (losing 10-20 minutes of progress). Other situations are balancing acts, where you essentially have to keep between 1 and 4 meters from getting too high or too low. Unfortunately, the actions that you choose from will impact each meter different amounts and in different directions each time you do them. Doing action X might lower all of the meters a little bit the first time, but the second time it might make one meter spike up and another meter dramatically fall. This is all interesting to poke at and explore the first few times, but after a while it becomes dull and frustrating.","July 26, 2014","false","7.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scribblerdee/recommended/274290/","scribblerdee","nop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scribblerdee/","267 products in account","Gods Will Be Watching is an interesting concept for an adventure game marred heavily by some really dumb design decisions.\nThe premise is you are Sgt. Burden (no ♥♥♥♥), leader of men in a bleak far future where you have to make tough utilitarian choices to survive. Beyond this interesting idea though there isn't a whole lot worth paying for.\n\nThe game is too difficult in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t of manners. At the outset you have a choice between "easy" or "original" difficulties, with original being devoid of any hints or help and said to be how the devs want you to play. I chose original because I enjoy challenging games, but this is another level. For a game that consists of fairly long scenarios where you are sent back to the start if you die, far too many outcomes are based on chance. For example, the 2nd scenario you have to survive torture for several days and one method used on you is Russian Roulette. I had gotten to this part before, had a plan and went to execute it, however on my second turn I got my head blown off because there was a 1 in 6 chance of it happenening. At this point I looked to the sky and said "Thank you Jesus for bestowing me with these hard-hitting, quality independently developed games". This wouldn't be such a big deal if it wasn't for the fact you have to run through scenarios several times till you know what is happening.\n\nThe torture scenario, again, I had to play several times till I eventually had no choice but to write down the order torture methods were used in order to succeed. It was actually clever and there was logic to it but it didn't become apparent until over an hour or so of experimenting and dealing with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG deaths, which made the cleverness substantially less impressive. The manner in which you have to repeat these scenarios is also detrimental to the game's core theme. Any tension that exists as part of making these choices is dulled by frustration and rigmorale. You get to a point where you don't give a ♥♥♥♥ how many puppies you have to kick, you just want to see the next screen. Considering this was "playing the game the way the developer intended", I wonder if they played it themselves because it is not enjoyable.\n\nIn general the game could use more polish. There's plenty of typos and graphical errors like sprites shooting 180 degrees behind them without turning around. Speaking of graphics, the backgrounds look great but the character sprites and animations could use more effort. In a game where caring about the characters is a big deal, maybe giving them actual faces would have helped. This could be more of a personal gripe though because I think games that do this (Superbrothers etc.) are downright ♥♥♥♥ing lazy. All that time spent on background and yet no one could be bothered to draw just two dots and a line on some faces. Some people will say this is "minimalism" as the game was a Ludum Dare game with that very theme, but you could ask someone to make a Ludum Dare game about cheeses at this point and they will just make whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want and relate it back somehow.\n\nOverall, super disappointing. Do not buy for less than five bucks.\n\nEDIT: I do have to give this game credit though for having consequences that carry over between scenarios and actually have an impact on your situation. In that sense it's better than what Telltale has been doing. Just a shame it's so damn frustrating.","July 24, 2014","false","4.2"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

THIS REVIEW IS (SADLY !!!!) LEGIT :-(\n\nAND IT SEEMS ROCKPAPERSHOTGUN CERTAINLY AGREES WITH MY REVIEW WHICH THEY POSTED SOME HOURS AFTER I DID. I HAVE ADDED THEIR POINT AT THE END OF MINE AND THEY HAVE COME TO ALL THE SAME CONCLUSIONS! .. So suck it, downvoters!\n\nHi devs or fans of this game. Been looking forward to the release of this game for about 5 months, since i first heard about it. And Devolver, one of my favorite publishers are publishing it? Great right..\n\nExcept I'm gutted..\n\nFirst of all. This game is much less about decision than it is micro management and grinding..\n\nI thought this was a meaningful experience that challenged your morals but instead, i found a grinding game that was incredibly hard to progress in. Stuck in the first level for almost an hour (I've played through 5 levels now) because it was seemingly impossible to beat it, so I had to go through the shame of playing it on easy, only to find that there were seamingly no meaningful choices at my disposal, while still being difficult... (And I play Hitman Absolution on second highest difficulty. And I loved all three of the Souls games, so I'm not a newbie gamer who only plays shooters or something like that. )\n\nThis game is nothing like what was advertised, at least not to me, and I'm absolutely gutted. I chose to preorder this game, first game i've ever pre-ordered because I don't believe in the practice, and now I'm sure I'll never do so again...\n\nAll this is a shame as the sprites a beautiful and the game is generally pretty with some nice environments in the different levels (that get repeated near the end). Writing is passable and the soundtrack is pretty decent. It's not Hotline Miami (One of my favorite experiences and favorite soundtracks)\n\n\nSorry, but I just can't justify having bought this game at all and I doubt I'll be spending more time with it.. After waiting all day for it to be able to install, i'm incredibly dissappointed.\n\n\n(RPS REVIEW POINT: It’s beautiful, no doubt. The pixel art is wonderful, and the soundtrack is splendid. Looking at just the screenshots, I’d be reaching for my wallet. But the core game is just so tedious. By the fifth chapter, you’re literally wandering through near-identical scenes of desert, and at this point I’m honestly wondering if maybe this is the point? Maybe it’s some arch commentary on gaming, on our repeating tasks because we’re told to, for meaningless rewards? There’s certainly enough meta-stuff going on along the way to imply this is where it’s heading, but dear me, if so, then the smugness would burst the walls. I really cannot find the will to keep putting myself through it to find out if the point was how much I’m wasting my time putting myself through it. During my fifth go the game announced it was out of memory, and closed itself, and yeah, that will do.\n\nI’m really gutted about this. I’ve been interested in the project since the first screenshots, and there’s unquestionably a huge amount of potential for someone to try to combine long-term survival with resource management in this form. But this is a tiresomely repetitive affair, and snarky with it. Perhaps the big reveal that lies at the end would astonish me, but there’s been nothing to earn the persistence I already put in, let alone any more. Let the gods judge me for that.)","July 24, 2014","false","1.1"," 75 of 146 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","75","146","0","21"

This is not a game about tough choices, this is an extremely difficult, tedious and simply frustrating micro-management game!\n\nI was looking forward to his game. Actually so much that I've backed it on indiegogo. I like games with dark storylines that force me to make tough choices and sacrifices. And while the game succeeds in areas like aesthetics - the minimalist pixel art is fantastic - and sound, the gameplay is anything but about tough choices. It's a game about monotonous micro-management.\n\nAgain, I think the trailers and the description are both misleading and as a result, this game is going to surprise people that didn't play the original flash game. (Which was similar but undoubtedly better) You're not presented with difficult moral choices but a couple of things you have to micro-manage in parallel in order to progress while being fed small amounts of story.\n\nAnd the difficulty is legendary. "Original" mode is for people that want to fall into a coma and/or have fever dreams. On easy, I was able to handle the game so far but it's still a chore and extremely tedious. As of yet, I can't say if I even want to continue playing this.\n\nSome people were claiming that this game is incredibly rewarding if you stick with it. I absolutely disagree. My reactions when I finished Chapter 1 and 2 were "Ugh. F- this. I'm glad this is over". I wasn't satisfied and it didn't feel rewarding at all.\n\nThe third redeeming quality besides the fantastic art-style and the amazing soundtrack is the plot. The premise really resonates with me and I'd love to know how everything pans out... but the gameplay might prevent me from finding out.\n\n\nIt may sound like it but I'm not saying this is a bad game. The only bad thing is that there was some massive miscommunication between the devs and their audience. What they presented as buildup in forms of trailers etc. absolutely not represent what this game actually is.\n\nAs a result I can't recommend this game.\n\nBottom line:An incredibly difficult, tedious micro-management game with an interesting plot and pleasing aesthetics.

What interesting moral dilemmas the player might face are rendered insignificant by gameplay mechanics that rely too hard on percent chance and the "Game Over, try again?" screen. The extreme difficulty and lengthy dialogue clash awkwardly: You'll have to repeat "levels" over and over again, meaning you'll have to read the same dialogue over and over again. This repetition lessens whatever effect the situations may have on you, and forces you to focus instead on micromanaging character statuses. This undermines the moral dilemmas the game tries to put the player in, forcing them to rewatch the same grisly violence over and over again and rendering its effect meaningless.\n\nFor a game that relies so heavily on character statuses, it does a poor job of informing the player of those statuses. Art can be vague, and characters don't react consistently. This would be fine if the game's failstates didn't rely so heavily on the actions of these characters.\n\nNot fun. Not effective.

The original flash game was an amazing mood piece. The unforgiving gameplay drove it. The dialogue was terse, the options few and you'd learn immediately the odds as you died over and over again. The point of the demo was not winning (there was barely any reward screen), but to instill in the player that dread of being barely alive and see your options dwindling, your mates losing their mind and hope slowly evaporate. Great stuff.\n\nThis sequel flips the concept disastrously on its head. The gameplay is just as unforgiving and random based, but you are required to win if you want to make sense of the plot. Besides being frustrating, it is extremely gimmicky. Oh really, the sarge gets locked in a room again for the fourth time? And as you repeat the chapter for the nth time you start to wonder. Why wouldn't the terrorist tie up the hostages? Why would a torturer ever put a live round in the revolver? Why can't the group multitask?\nThe link between the narrative and the underlying puzzle is so weak and feels so forced. It was okay in the demo because mood was god, but here it just doesn't work.\n\nAnd the writing isn't very good either. Forget the typos.\nYou can't have a very tense torture scene and end it with the torturer saying "I had too many jalapeno". Really? A poop joke? Why not a benny hill music to go with it?\nYou can't have an undercover spy start its trasmissions by reporting its real name, its rank, its location and its mission. That's just poor espionage. That's  just you screaming at me "exposition tiiime".\nYou can't postpone explaining so much of the plot in a game where obstacles are so frustating. Why people come back to life? Why am I seeing ghosts? Why should I care if you keep not explaining it to me?\nYou can't have so few dialogues in a game whose sections you know will have to be repeated again and again.\n\nJust skip it","July 26, 2014","false","6.6"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

It seemed challenging and it does have an interesting story with some neat and amusing characters so I thought for the price it might be a decent pick up to tide myself over for some big name releases.\n\nUpon playing I found that there are only sound options, and nothing for windowed mode; how I tend to plamost if not ALL of y PC games. So I went into the directory to see if there were any files that might allow me to fix this.\n\nAnd low and behold, I find something astounding; Every chapter has its own seperate folder out in the open with all the data it relies on completely present and, get this, editable by the user. I don't know much, heck, I don't know ANYTHING about programming but I can recognize numbers and quantities when I see them.\n\nYou see, each folder has a 'control' file, for instance chapter 3's is labeled 'p3_control'. Go into this file and you can edit various factors about the mission. In doing so I could make any mission so hilariously easy it doesn't warrant the challenge. Now, this isn't me saying that this how you beat the game.\nBut this is incredibly exploitable and easy to do.\n\nSo why am I saying this in a review? Because I wanted it to be known that trial and error can be fun, and in games like Dark Souls and Monster Hunter learning how to handle situations is exciting. In this game you sit and try again and again as what worked once seemingly fails to consistently get the same results. Things changing a bit is nice, but I don't think such inconsistency in methods that seemingly work is a good thing.\n\nIs the story worth the price? Maybe.\nIs the game worth a look?

I am not new to games that require multiple tries and may cause frustration (I'm looking at you, Binding of Isaac, Papers Please). I am not new to games that try to teach you things through long trial and error and difficult decisions (Always Sometimes Monsters, anyone?). I really looked forward to this game as an awesome mesh of possibilities, going down many different paths to many different endings, all based on your moral standing.\n\nThat is, sadly, not what I got. Maybe it's just me, but I could not get into the moral portion of this game. For one thing, your decisions don't seem to offer you much of a moral choice. There's not many "right answers", or so it feels, and its hard to get through the game without playing a specific way. I probably haven't explored the game enough, but the other thing is, there's nothing that makes me really want to. Sure the dark humor is great, and sure the characters are pretty memorable, but they're also kind of...bland. Not really as deep as I had hoped.\n\nAnd the gameplaay itself. Not the path traveling and searching I had hoped for. More of a trial and error (as above descibed) micromanagement game, which is not bad in and of itself, but really disappointed me. The micromanagement is annoying as heck to get around, and usually requires a few trial and error. The game ends up being very dedication-based; as long as you keep hitting it with your forehead, you'll get to the end, and never mind how many bodies and limbs you have to leave in your path.\n\nEvery game I've got, even the ones I ended up not playing very much, even the ones I can't run on my computer because I don't have the graphics card (♥♥♥♥ you, Mortal Kombat), have left me with some sort of satisfaction or resolution. A sort of resignation, even, but at least a satisfied close. Maybe I'm a shopaholic on Steam, but anyways, this game just didn't do it for me. I was left staring at it, wanting something...tangible, damn it.

I like the retro art style, the music is good and the adult themes are very much up my alley. The story seems to be somewhat compelling also. Unfortunately this is all overshadowed by extremely frustrating gameplay. There is a very narrow margin for error for your decisions if you want to complete a scenario. Some visual cues provide hints as to how best to proceed but other factors are completely unknown and will require you to fail the scenario dozens of times before you figure out how they play into the equation. There is also a percentage based system on certain actions which may cause you to fail a scenario for no other reason that bad luck. This may force you to repeat a long drawn out sequence from the very beginning which is rather tedious and frustrating when it happens multiple times. I enjoy challenging games but I don't get a sense of satisfaction from completing a scenario.

Burden has the tough job of not only getting himself, but those under his care through the situations by any and every means possible.  The game is divided into 7 chapters, each with it's own dillemma, resources, and time restraints that will challenge you, make you take notes, and question to what lengths you will go to complete the chapter.  For instance, in Chapter 1 you are responcible for maintaining hostages while your team retrieves data.  If one breaks and runs away, do you shoot the unarmed civillian increasing the chances the remainder revolts and attacks you, or do you let them run to saftey, and making the others not percieve you as a threat? Either are options, and there are no morals that you are judged by in game.  After each chapter, a Statistics screen shows your results compared to the community's.\n\nThe game is ment to be difficult, as the rules of each chapter are not always clearly presented.  There are also no mid-chapter saves, as the intention is for you to learn by trial and error.  I would recommend the "Original Light" difficulty for your first run through, and be aware there is a "Chapter Selection" feature if you would like to change the difficulty and play any reached chapter, allowing you to change difficulty on the fly if needed.\n\nIf you want a strangely intriguing plot, learning by trial and error, and bizzare survival scenarios, Gods Will Be Watching is worth the price of admission.\nIf you want a straight forward plot, clearly explained rules, and consistant experiance, you may want to look elsewhere.

I rarely buy games that get below a 70% rating with either of these reviewers.  That being said, I bought this game despite the 64/100 on metacritic, I played it not knowing what to expect, and thankfully, I really enjoyed it.\n\nAs many of the other reviewers will tell you, this game is not for everyone.  I purchased it because I loved Hotline Miami and seeing the previews for this game I was drawn to the brutal violence and artistic style.  It's a very challanging game, and it forces you to pick up on little trends and nuances during the gameplay if you want to win.\n\nTo explain further, this game requires patience. Just as you start getting really mad because you're getting your tail handed to you, you realize that something you're failing in isn't just RNG, it's something you just haven't been paying attention to.  Sure there are parts that are randomized (which you can disable if you want), but the changing factors with each restart keep you on your toes.\n\nThe story is interesting enough to follow and it actually kind of makes you look at the way you play ruthless games such as this one that force you to die or fail over and over again in order to discover a solution.  Things you do will make you feel bad, they'll make you feel like you could have done more, and they certainly make you feel helpless.\n\nBottom line, you feel like you're in a Cormac McCarthy novel.  Despiration, violence, and death on death on death.  Love it.\n\nPlay it for yourself, but with one stipulation: DO NOT LOOK UP WALK-THROUGHS.

It went right under my radar when it was first released and a friend pointed it out to me, so I'm also spreading awareness.

You make decisions with time always-dwindling, but in a turn-based way so that each decision is the product of how much you thought about it, which is good because you never have to make a snap decision, but it also means each outcome is the fault of your planning alone. For fans of games like Telltale's The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, GWBW similarly shows how your decisions compare to other players'.\n\nWhat makes it really interesting is that each chapter (of which there are seven) uses completely different choice mechanics, although they use the same interface. All have an element of time running out, but beyond that, the choices you must evaluate differ entirely. You might have to manage your crew's morale in one chapter, or just keep them well-rested in another. Each of these sections almost feels like they're in completely different genres, despite sharing similar decision systems; I wonder if they were designed by different people. At least one of the sections plays kind of like a roguelike, and another like a long quicktime event.\n\nThe music and art are also fantastic and memorable, and I regret not buying the soundtrack DLC, but at least you can get .OGGs of the music in the game files. The plot is also interesting enough, but for me, the gameplay system is what stuck with me.","November 18, 2014","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While its story is rather short (If you manage to perfectly run the game it would take 2 hours max) I still thought that the message behind it is rather excellent. You play as Sgt. Burden, and you spend your time as a member of E.D.U.K trying to stop Xenolifer and there plot to release a virus upon an innocent world. This sounds like it would be the grounds for an action packed, teeth gritting, and emotional ride. It is, just not in the sense you would imagine it. The first mission puts you in charge of a hostage situtation about to go wrong, while you micromanage hostages, your hacking progress and security, the guards inching closer and closer down the hall, and most importantly, your ethics. These situations are designed in a way that is brutally unforgiving, one that is designed to make sure you dont make it out of anything scot free. Do you really want to shoot a hostage and spray his brains all over his co-workers? If you dont, his friends may get to complacent and attempt to fight back, and his life will be as good as over anyway. Fear, compassion, brutality, calculation, all worked into a formula of sort to keep the hostages complacent. Then add 2 other things you have to keep an eye on in the form of a rescue team and the security of your hacking connection, and you'll find a situation getting more and more out of hand. You cant just scold and embrace people over and over, and you cant just shoot everyone in the head, you have to find a middle. However, the game is designed to throw so much stuff in your path, you will never find it. Thats the thing here, there is no perfection, sacrifice will either be of your choice, or the games. It will kill your friends, and you will watch and get frustrated, however the deeper narritive at play here will be something most indie titles lack. Im delving into spoiler territory here, but the final 2 missions are when this becomes most apparent. Everytime you lose, everytime you die, Burden does too. He gets frustrated with you, he knows what attacks Liam is going to throw and physically tells him much to his suprise. He is living the same hell you are, and thats when you find yourself thinking. Many people never gave the game enough chance to find this deeper narritive, and many don't care either way, but for people like me interested in the human psyche I cant stress enough how this game sticks with you. It deserves the time of day, just dont come to me if you punch through a monitor in rage.","September 23, 2014","true","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I didn't mind playing the same sequence over and over but I can see how it could get very boring very fast. It's not engaging but it is engrossing.

I imagine I'll eventually shoot to get all the achievements when I want a slightly mind-numbing activity.\n\nStory is great on a surface level and even more awesome if you like brainfood type videogame stories and take pleasure in thinking about the who what why and how. But it doesn't push the pretentious indie brainfood at all, you can just enjoy it as a story about a dude in space and be entertained.\n\nAlso the music and graphics are amazing and veeery mood-setting.\n\nOne weird complaint I have is that I couldn't upgrade to the collector's edition without rebuying the base game (so I didn't buy it at all :C) but that's a steam thing not a game thing.","December 8, 2014","true","11.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game has some great visuals, but it doesn't redeem the amount of frustration you'll experience in the "gameplay", the trailer is misleading which is unforgiveable and I feel burned because of it, but I actually feel even more burned over the fact that I wasted 8 hours on this with the hope that it'd get better than over the money I spent on it.\n\nThe first level was okay, but after that the 'gameplay' relies too much RNG, not in the good way Darkest Dungeon implemented it either (where adequate preparation can soften the impact of the RNG, as well as the fact that Darkest Dungeon seems fair in it's own morbid way because the enemy can get ♥♥♥♥ed over by RNG just as much as you can), and unlike Darkest Dungeon the RNG here doesn't add to the replay value, after you finish a scenario here all you remember is what a painful experience you had to endure... and in Gods Will Be Watching the RNG is on the forefront, and often the deciding factor on winning a scenario is pure luck.

This is not pixel art interactive fiction or a straight adventure game where any number of choices will all allow the player to proceed to discover the effects of their choices.\n\nInstead, the closest analogy that I can draw is to a brutally difficult Choose Your Own Adventure book. Each chapter requires a lot of trial and error to suss out the background mechanics to the point where I quickly lost immersion in the game and reverted to metagaming analysis in order to plan a series of actions in order to proceed. The narrative impact of dialogue quickly loses its potency after the second or third loop.\n\nThe impact of random chance in the 5th chapter is especially egregious and there are some notable lapses in game logic. Starting a camp fire by using your pistol to shoot a log or adding an already collected log costs an action equivilent to a hunting expedition or collecting firewood.\n\nIn the torture/interrogation sequence, the characters apparently cannot think of lies when not actively being tortured (a more logical route would have been for the game to give a single substantial boost (maybe even to 100%) to the credibility of your lie if the question being asked in a subsequent session is the same as the quetion being asked during the previous day.\n\nFinally, the background of the setting isn't explained quite well enough to make the context of the game clear in parts.","August 2, 2014","false","15.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Burden (wink wink) who will have to decide on how to survive 6 dangerous scenarios. The gameplay is entirely micromanagement: you have a group of factors that need attention, and only so much time/actions/resources you can have to use to prevent things from spiraling out of control. On top of which lies a factor of chance, as actions are accompanied with varying levels of benefits with a chance of failure. It has a dark tone and is repetitive, and the gameplay forces you to make some ethical decisions if you fail to make the most flawless ones. The repetition works very well to project a feeling of the monotony and struggle of surviving without resources. It is similar to “Papers Please” in style and in that they both are repetitive, dark, and have morale choices; but its primary difference is while "Papers Please" evolves in difficulty, the micromanagement completely changes in the levels of "Gods Will Be Watching".\n\nThe visuals are an abstract form of pixel, and everything is iconic, which allows the player to imagine how characters look in terms of detailing, which inherently creates a greater investment of emotions tied to each character. The music is repetitive and consistent, and it works in great effect especially as the gameplay deals a lot with straining time and resources, giving a sense of struggle and inevitable doom.\n\nThe biggest flaw of the game is the writing. It is not poor but it’s not great, especially the conversations held by the characters feel like they are all the same person. No one in this game has a unique personality, in fact many of the characters have the same dialogue lines when interacting with them. The uniqueness each character receives is from their appearance and their abilities alone, you simply could not tell the characters apart without describing their occupation, look, and purpose. For example, at the beginning of the game, Sgt. Burden holds four people hostage, and when you want to calm them down, he says a line about how their crying reminds him of his dear sister; which makes sense when he talks to the female hostage but it doesn't make sense when he is talking to the fat bloke. Some of the scenes just don’t make sense, and I will continue if you don’t mind the spoiler. If you do mind just take my word and blink over my example.\n\n–SPOILER BEINGS-\nThe E.C.U.K. has been tracking the leader of the Xenolifer, Liam for a while now and has demanded that Sgt. Burden kill him due to his maniacal hijacking of a super weapon (the virus) which Sgt. Burden helped him get in the first place. Sgt Burden, being the idealist he is, vehemently disagrees stating that this act will make Liam a martyr and spark a war, which shows how smart Sgt. Burden is for helping him get the weapon of mass destruction in the first place, and how much he knows about making good choices for the greater good. The E.C.U.K. declares that he is bound by his obligations and in not killing Liam soon that he will become a traitor, later Burden gets caught and tortured and days later is finally saved by the E.C.U.K. who then decides to take him back anyway after branding him a traitor. Furthermore they fail to recognize the leader, Liam lying a few feet away from Burden, which would be tantamount to a US soldier in the Middle East failing to recognize Bin Laden in 2008.\n-SPOILER ENDS-\n\nOn original difficulty this game is actually very difficult, with many hidden parameters that you will not understand without playing the scenario a few times around. While the difficulty is not a bad thing, the frequency of hidden parameters demonstrating the game’s lack of instruction and intuition is more detrimental than creative. For example, in the beginning part of the game you can shoot the guards and the hostages will panic, this is a good use of intuitive and creative gameplay. After apologizing to Jack, and having Jack lose the ability to shoot the guards is a demonstration of detrimental lack of information, which I found would force me to restart.\nDespite these flaws, I felt a strong sense of will in trying to beat Day 2, which led me to staying up till 5 AM. I must really feel an investment to the game if I am willing to go to such lengths in playing it in both plot and gameplay. I would recommend it to people who like plot driven gameplay, as well as gamers who are comfortable playing more abstract indie games similar to “Papers Please”.\n","May 10, 2015","true","9.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

The gameplay mechanics are primarily figuring out how to ideally manage scarce resources (there are no typical point-and-click adventure puzzles to speak of), and the story is integrated wonderfully with these mechanics; it was enough to draw me in and keep me going when the game had very nearly pushed me beyond the edge of despair, and the themes in the narrative often influenced my gameplay decisions. Likewise, my own experience mirrored the protagonist's closely enough that I found myself identifying with him easily, and when I finally triumphed against all odds I felt pretty good about myself.\n\nThe game requires quite a bit of trial and error - almost no mechanics are explained, and you are almost guaranteed to fail repeatedly. If you're easily discouraged, I would advise you to avoid this. I played this on Original difficulty, so I can't speak towards the experience on easy mode. My biggest gripe with this game is the fifth chapter: unlike every other chapter, it incorporates a big element of luck which compounds the difficulty and renders it into an exercise in frustration. It was enough to nearly make me stop playing, since the RNG could doom you from very early on and it's long enough to make restarting from the beginning (which you WILL do more than once) a giant pain in the ♥♥♥. There is also a memory leak present in that chapter at the time of writing, which really doesn't really help.\n\nBeyond that and an abundance of small typos, I can't really fault the game. It was interesting, it looks nice, and I was entirely distracted from the pointlessness of my life for the period of time that I was playing it.

I don't mind difficult games at all since I really enjoyed playing games like Hotline Miami 1 and 2, Super Meat Boy and Dark Souls, but this game is only difficult because of its RNG factor, It's unbelievably frustrating. When you fail the level you need to play it all over from the start and fast forward all the dialogues, it's annoying as hell. To me this game felt like watching a sexy Kate Upton video at first when I started playing it, right, but the more I played the game the more it looked like Kate started eating poo in that video and it all turned into a 2 girls 1 cup video with Kate Upton. After all that you just can't love her anymore, not in the wildest dreams will you watch her with the same eyes. Too bad it disappointed me.","April 21","false","5.1"," 30 of 59 people (51%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","51","30","59","26","2"

Extremely involving storyline and while the difficulty is staggering in "original mode", it is extremely gratifying. The immersion and intensity of the story makes me want more and more. The game is broken down into 7 chapters which are all games in themselves where you are stuck in an extreme situation with limited resources, and have to make choices, HARD choices.","November 8, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has some stupid mistakes, like characters staying with you after their death, which is kinda disappointing, but in general it's fun and exciting to play. If you're into point-n-click games, you won't regret buying it.","November 10, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Very unforgiving. But no matter how severe your losses are, you can probably still pull through, if you keep your cool - that's why you're in charge.\n\nExcept for chapter 2. Seriously, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI didn't like the interface at times, found it clunky.\nNot much else.\n\nNow go and buy it.","November 11, 2014","true","29.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At times it can be very frustrating but when you clear the stage its worth it. Loved the story and the animations. It definitely is not for everyone, its one of those games that you either love or hate.","November 12, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Despite some rough edges in the design and a structure that sometimes feels too compartmentalized, it is definitely a work that shows tons of potential and that develops its ideas in pretty interesting directions. Add that to the great care for details that seems to have been gone into the whole production (small quirks, like the sound of things you’re hovering your mouse on being louder, are quite nice to notice) and you have a really solid game that manages to do the most important thing that a videogame should do: communicate emotions.\n\n7/10\n\nFull review: http://www.scriptaludica.com/2014/09/gods-will-be-watching.html","September 15, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
