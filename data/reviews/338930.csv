Gates, energy barriers, and floating obstacles that need to be smashed, shot, or rammed before getting to the next area take up alot of time.\n\nThe age really shows in the voice acting. You almost think that Frank Welker (Megatron and Soundwave) might actually be sick.\n\nIt doesn't feel like a huge game, which might explain the pricetag.\n\nI'll end up playing this game all the way through. It's not the perfect transformers game, but it's a step in the right direction, and it's a great way to get people who only know the transformers in MBay form to enjoy the originals.\n\n8/10 would Transform and  Roll out again.\n\nEdit: It took 21 hours to beat the game with all 5 characters.","October 6, 2015","true","33.2"," 237 of 270 people (88%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","88","237","270","24","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uraizen/recommended/338930/","uraizen","uraizen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uraizen/","1711 products in account","A game based on the G1 series Transformers made by Platinum Games. So let's start out with the stuff everybody cares about. There is witch time, parry (bayonetta style), dodge offset, and all of your usual platinum combat mechanics. Each weapon has its own stats, some have special effects, others have elemental effects, and they can all be upgraded. Weapons have their own variations as well. Some have the ability to charge light attacks and one in particular can shoot out projectiles. Each character plays different and has their own special attack and ultimate attack. For example, Optimus does an AoE attack with his trailer attached as his special and his ultimate attack is a ground pound which is another AoE attack. The guns automatically lock-on, so it makes shooting easy. You can also blind fire like you would in MGR. Each character is capable of holding four weapons total and has their own attachments and stats.\n\nThe stages vary from being open-ended, to morphing rooms, and linear corridors. There's also some sections that take place in special areas, but I won't spoil those. There are also hidden missions if you backtrack or find a special area on the map like Bayonetta or MGR. Think of them as hidden verses. There are a good amount of collectibles as well that you can get by destroying decepticon logos, picking up cards, etc. The upgrade system gives you plenty of reason to explore so you can find rare weapons or just fodder weapons to synthesize. There's also this little mini-game you play with wheeljack where he creates chips that you can attach to upgrade your character. It's entirely RNG-based, so expect some disappointment before getting a godly chip.\n\nThere's 50 challenges you can play post-game which are unlocked by playing the game. I also unlocked some by playing the challenges themselves. They're what you would expect from challenges. Beat enemies/bosses and do you best. The better grade you get, the better the reward. The challenges reward you with weapons and the grades go up to SS. Don't worry, the rewards stack, so you don't have to get specific grades.\n\nThe story is bla bla bla MEGATRON! bla bla bla OPTIMUS! bla bla bla Save the world.\n\nIt felt like the majority of the game you were fighting bosses which I am totally okay with. Hearing (some) of the original VAs fight it out to rockin' music was fantastic.\n\nIt took me 4 hours to beat on my first playthrough on normal. So if you're a "one and done" type of gamer with character action games, it's probably not worth the $50 to you. If you like to replay your games, wants to beat it with multiple characters, do all the missions, etc. It is very much worth the price tag. Either way, it's always quality over quantity for me and I feel I got my money's worth with this game.\n\nP.S. I don't know about the skins, but I managed to obtain one of the pre-order weapons via a loot crate. So don't worry about missing out on those.","October 6, 2015","true","9.4"," 107 of 124 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","107","124","6","0"

Go buy something else.\n\nWant the video game equivalent of the most sugar-filled but delicious bowl of kids cereal you can find? Buy Transformers Devastation. It's a bowl of Fruity Pepples with a side of a Saturday morning cartoon. And everyting about it is stupid and fun.\n\nDon't believe folks that say it's a 4 hour game. Beating the campaign once (on medium difficulty with one character of five) is 4 hours. If you want to beat it with all the characters, on all the difficulties (the 3 base + 2 hidden harder difficulties), do all 50 challenge modes, craft the best weapons , and get highest rank in everything (SS), it's considerably longer. Probably closer to 100. It's a real grind though. But a fun one.\n\nBasically this game is what you make it. Want a pure diversion... a simple game that is just a joy to play and is nothing if not lovingly done? Play it in short intervals. Want to play this game for many, many hours? You can do that too.\n\nIf nothing else, you'll have a game that you can sit down and play for 30 minutes if you're bored or feeling down that will make you grin ear to ear every time with how fun it is. Deep? No. Fun? You'll find few games more fun.

Look at the screenshots, view the trailer - Platinum Games ♥♥♥♥ing nailed the G1 style. It could hardly be truer to the source material - crazy good stuff.\n\nThe game is basically a beat'em up with a MAJOR grinding component.\n\nThe beat'em up has all the elements of earlier Platinum Titles: dodges, parries, slowmotion and counterattacks after successful evades. New elements have been added to accomodate the fact that Autobots can transform into cars - basically, you can race around (to charge up an uppercut that punches right through defenses like shields) or add an extra transformation attack to a successful combo. Takes a few tries to get used to it, but becomes second nature fast.\n\nCombat is fun, suffers from a really crappy camera though and tends to be really chaotic at times - when the battle-action pulls out all the stops the screen EXPLODES in color and effects - it's ridiculously awesome looking but doesn't help with careful dodging / parries  / whatever. This can be frustrating if you go for maximum ranking and top score (and here's the catch - you WILL do that at some point, otherwise you won't be spending much time with Transformers: Devastation).\n\nWhat sucks, in my opinion, is the entire crafting / looting / roleplaying-aspect of the game that adds DREADFUL GRIND to  Transformers: Devastation. Sure, that stuff waters down a game that is essentially 4 hours long and adds REPLAY VALUE or some ♥♥♥♥ - but WHY IS THAT NECESSARY? See, I am a-okay with a deep game that wants you to play it on max-difficulty for score and ranks. What I am not okay with is random weapon drops that can be merged, weird "perk"-chips that you get by basically winning them in a quicktime-event lottery and 5 or 6 different stats that you can raise through battle but also alter them by directly paying ingame-money for it. The real downside of this is that high stats and high-level weapons trivialize actual combat-skills. Really dislike this and hope that their upcoming Turtles game will scale this back to early Bayonetta-levels. In the end you don't play so much for mastery, but for grabbing enough cash to afford X. A design decision I do not agree with.\n\nTalking about earlier Platinum Games, I also find the whole "staging" of the story in Transformers: Devastation to be somewhat lacking. It's pretty close to the TV show but it lacks the "epicness" of a game like "Fall of Cybertron" (just thinking about Metroplex heeding the call of the last Prime *goosebumps*) which I find weird since Platinum has shown time and time again that they know EVERYTHING about over the top-badassery turned videogame but decided to tone it down here - the storymode just doesn't feel as awesome and mindblowing as it could have been. Also cliffhanger-ending. Meh.\n\nLet's sum it up - the game is good, the fighting is fun, the action ridiculous, the presentation is top-notch and jaw-dropping gorgeous almost all the time. It's flawed though and I am really no fan of the grind-aspect (your mileage may vary) and the campaign feels like it's missing something to make it really memorable. Good stuff and worth (some of) it's money, but not as incredible as I had hoped it would be.","December 4, 2015","true","5.1"," 72 of 79 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","72","79","4","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makutateridax/recommended/338930/","makutateridax","Arcos Of Blackheart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makutateridax/","378 products in account","Prepare for an amazing G1 experience!!\nI LOVE this game, I'm debating whether to call it better than the Cybertron games, but that's a discussion for another time. With the cast of the original television series, taking their roles back and doing a damn good job at being the Transformers we all love, this is one that you really ought not miss. And I'll say this now, It's NOT 4 hours long, unless you speed through it and miss the content.\n\n"But why is it amazing?"I hear you asking, Well I'll tell you, starting with combat!!\nThe Combat systemFirst of all, the combat not only looks gorgeous, but it's fluid. You can easily bash or slash your way from enemy to enemy, with just the press of a button. You can chain together light and heavy attacks, dodge, and even transform from robot mode to vehicle mode quickly...Albeit, you gotta hold down the transform button.You have blaster too, but there's a small catch. Blasters are a bit harder to use during combat, as it slows you down a tad to switch into aiming mode, which leaves you open for enemy attacks. Now the bright side is, it's easier (And more stylish) to use them after a successful dodge. Upon a successful dodge, time will stop for a few seconds, allowing you the much needed time to put your blasters to use, safely, before time resumes. At the end of combos, you'll get a visual cue that will tell you it's time for a vehicle attack. On top of all that, each character has their own two unique abilities. An ultimate attack, and (Since I forgot the name) We'll call it a power attack. Bumblebee can slide behind enemies for a back attack, or throw a flurry of bombs for a devastating finisher, Optimus will slam enemies with his Semi trailer, or do an act that I can only describe as going super saiyan, as he emits a powerful explosion, And Grimlock Charges at enemies to grab them and slam them, or Releases a destructive fireball of death. With this fantastic arsenal of moves, it'll be easy to show those Decepti-Creeps who's boss. And speaking of arsenals..\n\nFeaturesThis is where I'll tell you what gives the game re-playability!! (To an extent)\n\nAlong with the amazing combat system, there's a whole treasure trove of weapons to collect, all based on weapons from the Transformers toys, and universe.There are Hammers, swords, knuckles, dual pistols, Sniper rifles, etc. This allows you to customize your loadout in a variety of ways. Go full heavy hitter with hammers, rocket launchers and shotguns, or be a flurry of strikes with dual swords, bladed knuckles and SMG's. But wait, there's more!! You can find weapons in various shapes, AND elements!! There are three elements. Electric, Fire, and Ice. Sadly though,aside from certain exceptions, elements don't apply any visible effects to enemies. In other words, you're not going to see an enemy catch fire just because you whacked them with that giant blazing hammer.\n\nThere are 5 playable Autobots, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Sideswipe, Grimlock, and Wheeljack, all with their own unique abilities (I mentioned a few earlier). Aside from their unique abilities, they all handle the same, with Grimlock being the only exception. Where as every other character, your disguise mode is primarily for transportation, since it's combat abilities are very limited, because Grimlocks disguise is a dinosaur, he's capable of performing effective combat in both modes.\n\nThroughout the game, you'll unlock challenge missions, and find collectibles of various kinds, that unlock text logs, and even some fantastic Transformers artwork.\n\nMusic and story\nThe story, in a nutshell, Is that Megatron is trying to turn Earth into a new Cybertron, by using the Insecticons and a crashed Cybertronian ship, called The Proudstar, and you as the autobots, must stop him. On the way, you'll encounter many famous Decepticons, such as Starscream, the Constructicons (It IS called Devastation after all), even Blitzwing and Soundwave, all of it leading up to one of the GREATEST battles between Optimus Prime and Megatron EVER (In my humble opinion)!! Every boss has his own unique theme, some of them epic, some are rockin', and others...Super frantic (I'm lookin' at you Soundwave theme!). Almost every track perfectly fits the battle it's featured in, I can't think of a single one that felt out of place.\n\nConclusion\nThis is where I tell you..GO BUY IT, NOW!!!\n\nOkay, seriously now. I highly recommend this game, at ANY price tag, it's just that good if you're a fan. If you're NOT a transformers fan, or just don't want to spend 50 dollars, then I'll say wait for a sale of 20 dollars, then you won't regret the purchase. If you happen to see it for 15 dollars or less...GRAB IT!!!! It's a steal at that price!!\n\nLeave a comment down below if this review helped you, or if you have any suggestions to help me improve it.","October 23, 2015","true","30.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","30","33","3","2"

The inclusion of some weapons from other Transformers franchises such as Beast Wars is a nice touch and pure fan service.

The driving is the smoothest I've ever seen and attacking enemies while in vehicle mode is just great. Finally, small min-games like shooting from a turret at Insecticons which come at you in the style of Space Invaders (that's a game your grandpa once played) almost made me shed tears of joy...almost.\n\nMy only complaint?

I can't even express how happy I am with this.\nPlatinum could have just phoned it in and made a quick cash-in game with lackluster gameplay, but this game's combat is pretty deep and rewarding. Pulling off a dodge into a combo the finishes with a vehicle strike and then moving into the character's super move is immensely satisfying. Controls are smooth and responsive, and the game plays perfectly with a Xbox 360 controller. It also has a stat and weapon upgrade system that lets you boost the character's power as you progress (and you'll need it, I've already run into a few points where I had to stop and go back to the Ark and upgrade in order to beat a boss). I'm playing on Normal difficulty, but I'm sure I'll do another playthrough on Hard later.\nVisually the game is a treat, with bright colorful graphics and perfectly on-model characters. My only complaint is that sometimes the clipping is a little odd, either on the characters themselves or with background elements clipping through the ground slightly. Also the background destruction in the cutscenes could maybe use a little more visual oomph (ie: more debris falling, particle effects, etc.) I get the impression this was a deliberate stylistic choice to emulate the look of the cartoon, though. These are mostly nitpicks, however, and the game has a definite visual polish that really does look like you're playing an episode of the 80s cartoon.\nThe game's sound is also impressive. First, most of the character voices are done by the actors from the original show, and although Frank Welker sounds a bit rougher now than he did back in the 80s, his Megatron is still great and Peter Cullen is of course perfect as Optimus. The only character that sounds really off is Starscream, which is understandable since the original voice actor for him, Chris Latta, sadly died a number of years ago.\nThe music is energetic and upbeat, written by Transformers: The Movie score composer Vince DiCola in a welcome surprise. It's not as memorable as his music for the 1986 movie, but it's still good.\nThe story is pretty standard, playing out much like an extra long episode of the cartoon, complete with great cheesy dialog and one-liners. It'll do.\nI haven't finished the game yet, but so far it's had some decent challenge and is loads of fun. The only thing it's missing is more character variety (I'm assuming there will be some DLC characters for this later, which I will probably pick up if they're not too pricy) and a Decepticon campaign. Perhaps in the sequel...\nPlatinum has definitely impressed me with this game, the first from them that I've really enjoyed (sorry guys, just wasn't a fan of Bayonetta). So, do I recommend it? Heartily. If you love Transformers, if you love action games, if you just want to see some awesome cel-shaded robots beat the hell out of each other, buy this immediately.","October 7, 2015","true","20.6"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","34","44","2","0"

Once again they've combined the best of all worlds with PlatinumGames bringing in their signature fast, combo heavy, and challenging gameplay with Activision and Hasbro bringing the 80's nostalgia of Transformers G1. This time there seems to be more fan service brought into this game this time around with familiar voice actors, refferences from G1 and even the intense rock 80's like music that will almost make you feel like a kid again.\n\nPros:\n\n-5 Playable characters each with their own special abilities and weapon types each can use\n-Gameplay feels like a mix of Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising with a little Vanquish added.\n-5 Difficulty levels ( 3 you start with and 2 to unlock).\n-Default Difficulty is fair, but challenging. Though you may die a good few times on your first run.\n-A simple but surprising gear loot system with customization on your melee and sub-weapons with different perks.\n-The visuals, sound effects and music help to compliment the feel of the G1 Transformers cartoons.\n-A fair amount of variety on side missions\n-Fun, intense boss fights\n-Minimal QTEs! A First for PlatinumGames!\n-A decent variety of enemy types that range from mostly medium ground and air types to huge, bulky bosses.\n\nCons:\n\n-Average playthrough will be around 4-6 hours on your first playthrough ( depending if you do the side missions )\n-Combat isnt quite as varied or complex\n-Cant play as the Decepticons\n-Transforming between the 2 forms can be awkward at first, especially since that same button is also the dodge button.\n-The game can feel like a gauntlet with constant boss fights towards the end of the game\n-The story, while simple to follow, feels too familiar.\n-There is some replayability with the 5 playable characters and varied difficulty levels, but not much else aside of the main game and sub-missions if you dont care much for getting the best possible score on your playthroughs.\n\n\n\nOverall: This is an instant thumbs up from me! This is a must play for both PlatinumGames and G1 Transformers fans. However the $50 price tag is stretching it some considering the short length, the thin replayability, and somewhat limited combat mechanics. If the price tag is too much for you, there's nothing wrong on waiting for a sale. Not the best PlatinumGames title, but this is a step up from the limited budget that was put forth on The Legend of Korra. I do hope they make a sequel to this game and make it an even better, more grand title.","October 8, 2015","true","24.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","24","27","3","1"

I'm replacing weapons constantly with new better things i'm finding in Commander.\n\nThe game has an "RPG - lite" feeling with the TECH upgrades where you play a minigame to craft items that improve your attack skills, defensive skills or give you thinks like +credits or +item rarity.  You can also combine weapons to level them up and add abilities to them similar to the TECH upgrades.\n\nI've already put another 5 or 6 hours in after beating the story mode on normal between doing challenges and starting to redo the story on Commander, I just completed Chapter 1 again.\n\nTL;DR, highly recommend","October 8, 2015","true","38.2"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","0"

Activision didn’t do much to dissuade the public either, as the game had a quiet launch this past week in between much bigger releases. However, I’m pleased to report that Devastation may be the sleeper hit of the holiday season, a character action game that lives up to Platinum’s history of excellence and a Transformers game designed from the ground up as a tribute to the 80s cartoon that started it all. There are missteps here and there, particularly when you’re doing anything besides punching and shooting Decepticons, but the core action of the game is a delight that shouldn’t be missed.\n\nWant to know more?

The gameplay feels a bit less tight/refined than those games, and there haven't been any 'setpiece' moments yet like fighting RAY in Revengeance or hell every other boss fight in Bayonetta. But it's a Platinum game at core, and the combat system is still among the best of character action games out there. Just tone down your expectations a little from the highs that Bayonetta and Revengeance brought and you should have an enjoyable time of it.\n\nThe soundtrack is also weaker than either of the other games, but the Transformers all sound like you remember them. Not that there's, uh. Much going on with that Transformers thing here. They do make some use of the fact that they can turn into vehicles and have guns but the Cybertron line is what you're looking for if you want something that expands on the Transformers universe and makes full use of it. Devastation could have easily been called Robots Punch Each Other and nothing would have been lost.\n\nAs there's not many character action games on Steam, and this is Platinum at their competent, not best, I will give it a recommendation for fans of the genre.\n\nEDIT: I have since beaten the game since posting the review. Clocked a total of 4.5 hours on it. For a fifty dollar price you'll need to ask yourself if that is worth it. There are five Autobots that have mild-moderate playstyle differences between them and harder difficulties to replay on and higher ranks to try and achieve, so there is definitely a lot more to this game if you want to push yourself. But ifyou're a one and done gamer, then yes, it's 4.5 hours to six if you're particularly slow/bad/explorative. Setpiece moments do happen later on in the game but nothing to the scale that other Platinum titles have. I stillr ecommend it fully to fans of the developer.","October 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 63 of 98 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","63","98","9","3"

I owned several of the action-figures, but I rarely watched the show, and still haven't seen the 1986 animated movie. Worst of all, I saw two of the Michael Bay movies. My recommendation of Transformers: Devastation is not due to nostalgia for the original series. This is a superb game, simply because it has phenomenal action, great controls, and a relatively high level of replay-value.\n\nThe plot is perfectly cheesy. Megatron has unearthed ancient Cybertronian technology. He intends to recreate earth in the image of his home-planet. "Cyber-forming" the planet will result in the extinction of all non-bot life. Needless to say, Optimus Prime and the Autobots aren't down with this plan. What follows is about what you'd expect from the show. We're talking about giant robots with laser cannons and swords here, this conflict will be resolved using everything but diplomacy. Over 7 chapters, 5 difficulties, dozens of side-missions, and the obligatory challenge mode, the Decepticons should get put in their place.\n\nAs you know, Transfomers: Devastation was developed by Platinum. For Bayonetta fans, the feeling of familiarity is going to hit like a semi. Both games emphasize fast-paced hack & slash action. You'll be doing a lot of invincible dodge-rolls, because getting hit can take huge chunks of health away. Dodging attacks at the right moment triggers a state known as "focused". When Optimus and his pals are focused, this causes everything to slow down for a hot second. This creates an opportune moment for getting a lot of damage in. Why call it "focused" anyway? Because "witch-time-but-not-really" doesn't have the same ring to it.\n\nFor the first few hours of this game, I made the mistake of considering it a re-packaged Bayonetta. There are a lot of ideas and design-decisions that make Devastation a distinctly Transformers game. A number of moves and abilities are shared, but the action feels more frenetic, and it's designed around both the player and enemies being able to transform at will.  Early on, the player will have to contend with shielded enemies. Outside of a few exceptions, the key to handling these bots is via a dash-attack. As the player becomes more skilled, they'll find a myriad of other uses for the dash-attack. Since dash-attacks require that the player build up some speed in their vehicle-state, they'll also have to understand the slight changes in mechanics. These can affect everything from the player's recovery after a dodge to their aim when firing a long-range weapon. Absorbing these details while contending with adversity can be a difficult process, but it's never frustrating or un-fun.\n\nDespite the hack & slash moniker, guns can be just as important if not moreso in battle. First of all, tapping the left-trigger targets the nearest enemy. This is the easiest method for keeping your camera situated. Targeting is extremely fast, which makes it a viable technique if you want to get a few quick shots on the enemy. At first you'll use it to aimbot roof-top snipers, but then you'll discover ways to incorporate it into the rest of the game, such as in the middle of combos. You also have to consider the gun you're using. Right now I'm using a rifle that's designed for maximum damage on headshots. Landing a headshot in this game usually requires "focus" or leaping counter-shots. I'm also trying to find a weapon with plenty of splash damage, for better crowd management.\n\nYes, there are a lot of melee weapons to obtain as well. This leads into the other unique aspect of this game: Phat Loot (tm). As you play, you'll undoubtedly collect weapons, rare or otherwise. Up to four can be equipped at a time, and your survival will depend on the combination that suits your play-style and current situation. Weapons have ranks (from D to SS) and can be leveled up via synthesis. At first it's a little unwieldy, and the results aren't immediately apparent, but good weapons make a big difference, especially on harder difficulties. The Autobots can also level-up, which affects their ability to do and take damage.\n\nNormally when it comes to action games, I'm not too enthused about acquiring rare-drops and leveling. RPG elements tend to take away from the core-design of a game. Why bother learning a difficult game, when you can just grind out stats to make it easy? Surprisingly, it works here. Part of the reason why is that weapons have their own move-sets, and some have unique attacks. This lends a sense of exploration to the combat. While playing this game, you might stumble upon a unique combination, or find a particular attack especially effective against certain bosses. Unlike a number of other Platinum titles, Devastation plays things fairly loose. Getting high ranks doesn't have to involve flawless reflexes. With a machine-gun, you can shoot bots several times in the face and rack up tons of bonus points. Different weapons can also create different challenges. That sniper rifle I mentioned earlier? It's not very good unless I can land the headshot. I have to work a little bit harder to get the benefits of using such a particular weapon. The results are always worth it.\n\nWhile the enemy variety is not as strong as in some other Platinum titles, the Decepticons play off of each other very well. This becomes very apparent in the challenge mode, because of all of the varying combat situations that it creates. In one battle I had to fight Shockwave and Soundwave together. This team-up proved to be really interesting, because Soundwave has some keepaway abilities, and Shockwave relies on a number of complex giant laser set-ups. Certain other enemies such as the Insecticons that spit explosive goo can also create interesting scenarios. Using long-range weapons as a counter can be dangerous, because you're trading the second or two to make a difficult shot, for the brief invulnerability of being "focused". There's a lot of thought put into the encounter-design of this game, which adds to the replay-value.\n\nThe major complaint that I have with this game is the level-design. Platinum can craft a thoroughly enjoyable fight with little to no effort, but everything in-between is usually a mish-mash of ehhh, meh, & bleah. The bulk of Devastation's campaign takes place in NYC, but you wouldn't know it due to how bland the city looks. Over time it gets more ruined and cyber-formed, but mostly it resembles a claustrophobic maze of hall-ways. The tunnels that make up the Proudstar aren't any more interesting. The story mode attempts to break up the monotonous level-design with a race, a couple "Protect Bumblebee/Wheeljack" battles, and a turret section. These are the times where I wonder if it would've been possible to get a new type of enemy to battle, or a different area to explore, or...well anything else would have been preferable.\n\nThere's also something to be said about the retail price of this game. Yes, we live in an age where games frequently drop to 50% or less within a year, and $2 indie bundles do a heckuva job padding out our library. With all that in mind, $50 isn't a suitable price. The combat, as fantastic as it is, takes place in a drearily-designed world. There's a fair amount of repetition, and the lack of unique assets is rather bothersome. I've already gotten 20 hours out of this game, and I'm sure I could easily get 20 more, but that isn't the point. The story-mode is lacking, and being the first taste of the game, is liable to leave gamers wanting. As important as replay-value is, having an epic and satisfying campaign should not be overlooked.\n\nIf you're not a fan of Platinum's games, then I doubt you got this far into the review. They have their own style, and I think it works perfectly for Transformers. While it has some issues, this title is still a finely-crafted love-letter to fans of the show and action games.","January 13","true","21.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmwarwolf/recommended/338930/","tmwarwolf","tmwarwolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmwarwolf/","173 products in account","This game should not exist.\n\nIt's an affectionate homage to a childhood favourite from a ruthless publisher best known for its factory assembly line approach to games development.\n\nBut much in the same way the original Transformers toyline was a phenomenal success thanks to Takara's toy engineering brilliance and Hasbro's marketing genius, the best parts of Transformers: Devastation can be attributed to the painstaking craftsmanship of its Japanese developer and the financial muscle of its American publisher.\n\nThe younger set, more accustomed to Michael Bay's sensitive arthouse interpretation of the franchise, might be utterly baffled by an Optimus Prime who isn't prone to viciousness and a Bumblebee not given to vindictive micturation. That's because the game pays tribute to Transformers: Generation 1 (G1) and thus draws upon on the comics, the Transformers Generations toyline, the old cartoons and most of all, the 1986 animated movie featuring those characters. So, Optimus Prime is his old G1 self (a character so noble he once insisted on being executed because he cheated at a videogame) and Bumblebee is cheery and earnest.\n\nThe game looks stunning thanks to its art direction. The cel-animated look has been done before but it's used here to evoke a very specific style from a very specific time. In a way, it's hilarious to see all that CPU power, GPU iron and software wizardry being utilised to emulate a goofy error-prone cartoon. Nevertheless the visual style works so well you might be thrashed in the game because you're too busy gawping at how cool it all looks.\n\nThere are two main gameplay modes: Story Mode and Challenge Mode. The Story Mode is divided into seven chapters with each chapter comprised of three main elements: the battles, the intermediate parts and the cutscenes.\n\nThe battles, against classic G1 Decepticons and generic fodder, are fantastic. The arenas tend to have ample room to manoeuvre around in vehicle mode and this allows for some great hit-and-run tactics when combined with the quick transformations and the rush attack move. Close-in slugfests are enjoyable as well due to the quick-fire combo system and the Focus mechanic (which slows time upon a successful dodge).\n\nThere are some minor issues. Pressing X and Y frenetically to cycle through the same efficient combos does occasionally get tiresome in the protracted boss battles against giant combiners and the reaction-sensitive gameplay might cause older, slower gamers to inadvertently kill Optimus Prime more times than the Decepticons ever did. For the most part, however, smashing Decepticons until they explode remains deeply satisfying so these battles represent Transformers: Devastation at its very best.\n\nThe intermediate gameplay portions that bridge those battles come across as filler material and these are the game at its worst. You signed up for giant robots pounding the circuits out of each other but suddenly, there are tedious platforming sections, middling overhead-view racing bits and exasperating sequences where you're dodging neon lasers or leaping through closing doorways. This could charitably be viewed as a nod to the simpler games of yesteryear in the same way the game itself is an affectionate look back at G1; a more cynical reading would be Platinum was running out of money, Activision refused to spend more and the Japanese developer was forced to scale back.\n\nThe cutscenes that bookend the Story Mode battles are uninspired. The story itself is forgettable but that never was going to be the main draw of a game inspired by an Eighties cartoon. If the dialogue minimises the cheesy humour of the old 'toons (e.g. "I didn't know human teeth had skin"), unintentional humour sometimes compensates. You just have to laugh when the gigantic combiner Devastator, a walking embodiment of pure destruction, comes across as a twerp from Dota 2 (e.g. "2ez").\n\nThat aside, it's really great Activision made a concerted effort to get the original voice actors. They're getting on in age so this might be the last time they get the opportunity to voice these classic characters. A few like Casey Kasem (Teletraan-1) and Chris Latta (Starscream) are sadly "one with the Matrix" but their replacements do a reasonable job.\n\nMind you, it's not like they had a lot of work to do because the Story Mode is over quickly. Anyone adept at action games could complete it in four hours or so. The Story Mode happens to be replayable if you're determined to earn the highest rating for battles or complete a playthrough with a specific character but this might not be persuasive argument for anyone whose appreciation of games is predicated mainly on game length. On the other hand, anyone who's slogged through games which have dragged on interminably might be grateful for a game that leaves you wanting more once it's over.\n\nAnyone who loves the battle system but is loath to replay the filler bits in Story Mode should opt for Challenge Mode missions. These are arena battles against one or more waves of opponents with the aim of earning a good score and a better rating (which results in better loot). Some of these challenge missions are based on Story Mode battles but the best of them feature some interesting new variations. Mission 14, for example, sees you taking on Autobot clones while the brilliant Mission 34 is a wild melee pitting all the Autobots against multiple waves of Decepticons.\n\nThe game isn't too difficult at the default Warrior difficulty but playing at higher difficulties will require canny use of the crafting system. The Synthesize option turns weapons, obtained through loot drops or purchased in the Lab, into veritable instruments of destruction that have increased damage and special abilities. While playing the game at higher difficulties also increases the likelihood of getting some nifty weapons with unusual properties (for example, the Slow Gel Gun mimics Mixmaster's slowdown ability), you generally have to rely on crafting to turn good weapons into great ones.\n\nIt's hard to shake off the suspicion Platinum could have easily turned Transformers: Devastation, a good game, into a great one if Activision had allocated more resources for it. A bigger budget, more development time and a greater emphasis on robot-on-robot action would have resulted in a game that's easier to recommend to gamers who aren't Transformers fans.\n\nLet's hope Platinum gets another shot at Transformers because there's certainly something very compelling about the transformation mechanic in a brawler and the Japanese developer's stylish take on it absolutely merits further embellishment and refinement. Plus, who wouldn't want a sequel that sees the heroic Autobots taking on their most dangerous foe, a powerful god-like being with an insatiable appetite?\n\n(Unicron would be an acceptable substitute if the Activision CEO is too busy.)\n\nIf you're a Transformers fan, especially one who retains a fondness for G1, get this now. No matter the cost. The Story Mode is as short as everyone says it is but you've probably spent more money for a Masterpiece figure and spent less time with that.\n\nAs for everyone else, read a few negative reviews and watch a few videos to get a balanced view. The game is so short some gamers will spend more time downloading than playing. As tricky as it is to justify the 50-dollar price in the US, it's almost impossible to justify elsewhere. However, as others have pointed out, the price will plunge eventually so just wait for the sales.\n\nTransformers fans had to wait over three decades for this game; anyone on the fence can certainly wait a few months.\n\nStrongly recommended for: anyone who secretly believes cinematic perfection was achieved when a truck launched itself into the air and transformed into a giant robot as Stan Bush reminded everyone after all that's said and done, you never walk, you never run, you're a winner.\n\nNot recommended for: Gobots fans.","May 14","true","52.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mutagene/recommended/338930/","mutagene","Mutagene (Dead PC)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mutagene/","455 products in account","Transformers: Devastation is an incredibly satisfying game with a stellar soundtrack and massive nostalgia for G1 Transformers fans. What's there is absolutely fantastic, the only thing weighing it down is that it feels like the budget was strained, and the end result suffered for it.\n\nThe credits are about as all-star a list as you could ever get. The Metal Gear Rising director and most of his team, the Bayonetta gameplay designer and Bayonetta 2 composer, main themes by Vince DiCola and Kenny Meriedeth, battle music by the Devil May Cry composer and his sound design company, story and script by the Transformers comics writer, and almost all of the surviving voice actors from the original series. It's absolutely clear that they put their all into this game, and it's wonderful.\n\nThe problems come in with presentation and general variety. While they got the surviving voice actors and great soundalikes, there are very few cutscenes to showcase them. Like MGR, the cutscenes use the game's assets and engine, but are prerendered videos, and it's fairly jarring against the silky-smooth 60fps gameplay. While they're all used very well, there's no denying that bosses are recycled many times. They get different attacks and vastly different setpieces, but in the end you're still fighting Starscream or Blitzwing again, which can be a killjoy for a lot of people. The lack of environments is frequently criticized, and while I think they're interesting enough to not become stale, I can definitely understand those complaints. Lastly, the collectibles feel shoehorned more than any other Platinum game, which is both good and bad since they're abundant and easy to find.\n\nPretty much the whole rest of the game is superb. The art design is incredibly bright and colorful, with great attention to detail in both the characters and environments. Make sure to keep an eye out for all the references to the original series scattered in the city. The story, while certainly very cheesy, is true to the source and provides great setpieces. There's not very many games with the balls to have a powerful antagonist like Devastator as the first chapter boss. The variety of weapons is already impressive by itself, but some of the legendary weapons will tickle fans' nostalgia to the bone, with appearances from fan favorite eras. The playable cast isn't large, but it covers the best variety they could have gotten, and it's worthwhile to try them all with their unique abilities and usable weapons.\n\nThe gameplay isn't revolutionary for Platinum; in fact, it's probably the most by-the-numbers combat they've done. This is by no means a bad thing in any way though, because it blends Bayonetta and Vanquish with light RPG elements to make an incredibly satisfying experience. Vehicle attacks seem silly at first, but once you try them yourself, chances are the impact of the attacks will be felt through the whole body. Hits are hard and crunchy, with every weapon type feeling perfectly tuned and a joy to wield. Guns aren't just a necessity, but also provide immense utility with the right guns and builds, and also allow for a huge amount of stylish variety when integrated into the melee combat. The variety of guns is even larger than the melee weapons, with some outlandish and truly brutal armaments available. There's nothing quite like using a gatling missile to tear through your most hated enemy types with reckless abandon.\n\nI have few complaints about the gameplay, but they do drag it down a bit. Weapons have a solid variety of combos, but the animations aren't as stylish as you'd expect. It probably wouldn't fit for Optimus Prime to do breakdances, but for Platinum fans it could be a disappointment. Another minor complaint is that the command specials (Tetsuzanko and the 360 attack from Bayo return) don't utilize your equipped weapon, instead reverting to bare metal fists for the animations.\n\nThe campaign is 7 chapters of varying length. The game is about 5-6 hours on a first run, so players who don't care about replay value will be left disappointed. For those who want to do and find everything, though, there's easily 30+ hours here. I got over 20 hours and I've yet to even beat Magnus difficulty or half of the challenges.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, though; BOY does this game have it. The normal difficulty is a healthy challenge when you start fresh and don't have good gear yet. The hardest default difficulty is a HUGE step up and requires incredible patience and agility to do for your first run. After completing that difficulty, another is unlocked. There are two additional difficulties unlocked by clearing the last hardest one, and both are brutal and completely unforgiving. For anyone familiar with Bayonetta's difficulty levels, the unlockable difficulties in Devastation also remix enemy placement and numbers, with some of the hardest enemies appearing at the beginning and many parts swarming you with incredibly aggressive waves of them. On these difficulties, your max HP and defense stats mean nothing--you will always die in 3 (or 2 on the highest difficulty) hits. If you can't dodge or parry flawlessly, you will not even make it past the tutorial section on Magnus difficulty. It's frustrating at first, but because the mechanics are so fluid and skill-based, it's also incredibly rewarding to succeed in. However, there are issues with the super high-end gear crafting making weapons that are really strong even for Magnus difficulty, which reminds me of how the Musou games with weapon crafting tend to have the same issue. Here it's not as glaring an issue, because your offense is largely secondary to your defense; you're absolutely required to learn enemy patterns and the openings to either dodge/parry or retaliate, because there is no room for error.\n\nIn addition to the campaign, there's 50 unique challenge missions, which range from simple "defeat all Decepticon soldiers," to fighting several bosses at once, to more outlandish things like playing Decepticon Darts. There's a lot to be had here as well, and some challenges also provide lucrative opportunities to acquire money and gear. Unlike a lot of games, your character progress is totally universal between modes and difficulties. Challenges will reward you with items and gear depending on your completion rank, which ends up being the best way to gear up, and within the mode you have access to all the crafting and leveling systems of your home base (dubbed the Ark, identical in function to the Gates of Hell from Bayonetta).\n\nFor hardcore character action game players, the ranking system might prove a disappointment. There are bonuses for finishing quickly and without taking damage, but far more points will come from the variety of options you used during the fight. Sometimes, this can mean purposely using weaker weapons and prolonging the fight to get the most bonuses. This is something that has annoyed some players and should be considered if you're one of them.\n\nNow, as far as the PC port goes, it's very solid. As others are quick to point out, 60fps is the maximum framerate, and some resolution options are missing. Performance is excellent though, and I rarely have any issues at all on my outdated rig. It's definitely a game that can be played on budget builds, which was a very welcome and smart move on Platinum's part. After all, more people being able to run the game means more sales, and this is a game that requires the highest framerate to be at its best.\n\nWithout going into direct spoilers, the ending and especially the post-credits stinger are a blatant sequel hook. The story is self-contained enough that a sequel isn't necessary for that, but I do very much hope that Activision eventually greenlight a sequel and provide a higher budget.\n\n\nP.S. Activision, please for the love of the Allspark, release the soundtrack for purchase. I would pay top dollar for it, and I know plenty of other people would as well.","November 26, 2015","true","25.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","0"

You don’t need to be a Transformers fan to appreciate the great things in this game, so you should definitely buy it — very few people did.\n\nEverything in this game screams of awesome: bright and colorful graphics; flashy effects; great characters; nice level design and marvelous music. By the way, many of the characters are voiced by their original actors, which reinforces the original cartoon feeling that much more.\n\nCore gameplay is a very intense, mostly hack-n-slash, action combat with giant badass robots fighting each other. The combat itself is straightforward, but challenging and has some hidden complexity. There are different types of attacks, multiple combos, a wide variety of melee and ranged weapons, four playable characters (you can switch between them almost at any time) with different playstyle and weapons, and, of course, a bunch of different enemies which need their special approach. Also, you can transform. Which shouldn’t be a surprise to you. And transformation is useful. Which was a surprise for me. Transformation is used both in attack combos and general level navigation. The game also has a very basic weapon crafting system. Oh, well.\n\nWhile keyboard and mouse controls are available and do work, I would strongly recommend to use a gamepad. At least I found it more comfortable.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the gameplay isn’t limited just to regular third-person combat — there’ll be turret sections, tunnel sections, top-down camera sections and forced scrolling sections to break up the flow of the game.\n\nThe locations are usually huge (sometimes it feels like an open-world). However, when you get in a serious fight (such as, but not limited to, boss fights), the part of the level is sealed off, creating a small arena for you.\n\nThe main story campaign is approximately 10 hours long and doesn’t outstay its welcome. The overall story is both epic, action packed and a dash silly, just like alien transforming robots are themselves. If you want more, this game can offer you a bunch of side missions, challenges, collectibles, unlockables, etc.\n\nOverall, Transformers: Devastation is a great example of a hidden gem — everything about it is great, yet almost nobody even gave it a shot. At the time of this review SteamSpy estimates sales at ~17.5K copies. It just boggles my mind how badly this game sold. It's not like there's an abundance of this type of games on PC.\n\nP.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the CRIMINALLY Low Sales steam curator.","February 27","true","9.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Even for Transformers fans, $50 is a lot to ask for. However, for Platinum Games fans, this is a title with tons of depth and dozens of hours of playtime. The five characters behave very uniquely and the amount of customization the RPG and weapon smithing systems allow really surprised me, and it helps Devastation stand out amongst Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising. Combat is smooth and the controls are nearly air-tight, though switching between robot and vehicle modes can get a little messy sometimes in crazier situations.\n\nEven with its G1 throwback aesthetic and straightforward story, the dialog and cut-scenes don't capture the silly magic of the 80s cartoon, nor does the game really attempt to tackle Transformers' more contemporary and sophisticated storytelling found in the IDW comics. Instead, the character interactions come off as dry and forgettable, and merely a means to connect one objective to the next. Though the returning voices are great (and the stand ins aren't half-bad either), the Transformers license isn't put to great use here for the game's presentation. The fluidness of attacks, dodges, and slick transformations however make it perhaps the best-playing TF game to date.\n\nAn absolutely must buy for fans of Platinum Games and beat em' up titles, but probably worth a bit more consideration if you're not diving it primarily for the gameplay.","October 6, 2015","true","17.9"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","33","55","0","2"

Mechanically, this is a full-on Platinum action game, think a simplified cross between Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising, and you're pretty much there. But the simplicity works in the game's favor, allowing you to immediately begin transforming and pulverising Decepticons. The crafting and secondary systems leave a little to be desired, and this is not the most polished effort ever from Platinum, but it has a whole lot of heart and soul. You'll feel like a kid again if you were a fan back in the day, and if you're new to Transformers, this will show you what all the fuss is really about.\n\nForget Michael Bay, this is the real deal.","October 8, 2015","true","4.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

But honestly, even then, I would suggest to wait till the sales.\n\nNow, I have to say that I really wanted to love the game (since it's from Platinum Games, which is one of my favourite studios out there), but I just couldn't. It's a good Transformers game, but it is way worse than any other Spectacle Fighter game from Platinum (still better than Legend Of Korra).\n\nPros:\nVery stylish and appealing cartoon visuals\nOriginal VAs from the cartoon series\nSoundtrack is great\nFluid Platinum Games combat\nPresence of a "Challenge Mode"?..\nCons:\nGameplay is a cluste♥♥♥♥ at times.\nIn addition to standard combat gameplay, you will get top-down racing missions, side-scrolling shoot'em'up missions and a turret section. Of course these types of gameplay feel very clunky. It seems like they didn't have time to implement it properly and decided to leave it as it is.\nPoor combat variety.\nWhile combat is quite good for a Spectacle Fighter game, again, it pales in comparison to depth of Bayonneta. There are very few moves and combos. In addition, for some reason, they’ve decided that it’ll be a good idea to have «Dodge», «Transform» and «Finishing move» on the same 1 button.\nLack of exciting battles.\nLast 2 boss battles (Soundwave / Megatron) were quite fun though.\n"Story Mode" is ~4 hours long.\nEven on "Commander" (Hard) difficulty.\nStory itself is a throwaway.\nMegatron wants to destroy the Earth. Autobots want to stop him. Bla-bla-bla.\nIt's cheesy cartoon plot - I get it. It could be done better regardless though.\nCutscenes are a throwaway too.\nCharacters just stand and talk. That's it. Not only will you not find any epic moments in these cutscenes - you will barely find any movement.\nPoor environments.\nThere are 2 types of areas in this game - a city area and a "spaceship" area. Both are dull and not exciting,\nThe city area is a wannabe open world.\nThat means that you will have to run back and forth through the same locations over and over again.\nLove / Hate:\nRPG loot system does not go well with a Spectacle Fighter.\nWhile this can be subjective, I don't think there is a place in this genre for hunting random loot and doing useless side quests just to get new gear. Spectacle Fighter  should be about the execution of combos, dodging, using various powers and just generally "having a skill". It should not be about how much I've leveled up my weapon with random loot drops. It was beyond awful in Darksiders 2 and it's awful here too.\nP.S.\nI hope that at some point there will be a game with Star Saber in it. I hope it will follow Victory plot. And I also hope it will be actually good.","October 8, 2015","false","9.5"," 95 of 172 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","95","172","7","5"

I love G1 Transformers and I love Platinum Games. This was basically a dream come true for me.\n\nGood things: Graphically, it's great. It rocks it's own art style hella hard, and runs well even on low-spec computers. The game is a lot of fun, if a little bit repetitive, and the five playable characters offer a pretty significant difference in playstyle between them (Grimlock in particular). The game has a lot of replayability due to the aforementioned five distinct playable characters, as well as loot drops that leave you eternally hoping for the best possible drop of a weapon you want and fodder weapons to mix with it. The game starts with Easy, Normal, and Hard available, and after you beat it on Hard you unlock Very Hard, and after beating Very Hard you unlock Very Very Hard, also adding to replayability. There are some light RPG elements in leveling up your equipment (which does become a necessity at higher difficulties), but other than that it's a straightforward beat 'em up that takes most of the good elements from Bayonetta 2 (lots of variation in melee weaponry, dodging + timeslow), Vanquish (varied firearms and slick gunplay, high speed mobility), and Metal Gear Rising (the sheer scale, intensity, and insanity of some of the fights), and mashes them all together. It's a pure-blooded nostalgia trip for fans of the original cartoon, as well, featuring pretty much ever member of the original voice cast who hasn't died since 1986. The difficulty is also pretty nice, if a bit unforgiving on occasion.\n\nBad things: The game is not very long, so if you're not the type to replay games, it's not a great investment. My first playthrough took me about 12 hours, subsequent runs (even on Very Very Hard) take me 3-4 hours now, sometimes even less. Grinding for the best perks on gear drops for fodder weapons can get tedious if you don't get the weapon you want right away. Not every character's playstyle is going to click with you (I've put 60 hours into the game and I still can't use Grimlock well). Some fights can be very frustrating, requiring you to play nearly perfectly, especially on the unlockable difficulties.\n\n\ntl;dr:\nGood:\n-Fun\n-Great nostalgia trip, lots of references to the old show\n-Good combat, both melee and ranged\n-Lots of replay value\n-Runs like silk even on low-spec rigs\n-Story is a lot like episodes of the 1984 TV series\n\nBad:\n-Game is short and relies on players wanting to replay it to get their money's worth\n-Grinding for loot can be tedious\n-Story is a lot like episodes of the 1984 TV series","May 20","true","63.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

In Devastation you can play as Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Sideswipe, Wheeljack and Grimlock. Gameplay vise it's a character action game made by Platinum Games and if you've played any other games made by them, you know what you can expect here but keep in mind that this game is a Platinum's side project with a very tight budget, time and resources put in to it, so don't expect something like Bayonetta or Vanquish from it in terms of overall game quality and scale, it's more like The Legend of Korra but a much better game.\n\nBut to me and no matter how much I love the G1 Transformers, Cybertron series from High Moon Studios will always be the best Transformers games ever made just because the amount of effort, love and attention to detail put in to them. Those games were like a dream come true. As of Devastation... despite the fact that it is really short and have some cool but underdeveloped ideas, it is still really fun to play and I can safely recommend it to any fans of old school Transformers out there, just don't expect too much from it in terms of scale and enjoy it for what it is.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10","October 25, 2015","true","7.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Let's ROCK OUT!! Once upon a time, Activision approached Platinum Star and asked them nicely to make a Transformers game. As long as it was awesome, Platinum were given free reign on development (barring time and budget, of course).\nSo they did. And delivered.\n\nTransformers: Devastation is a frantic beat-em-up in the same vein as hack-n-slashers Devil May Cry and Bayonetta (helps that the creator was one who helped make the previous two games and characters) as well as Metal Gear Rising. If you have played any of the three (or all of those three), the similarities with the combat system will immediately stand out.\nFirst, the obvious. Graphics, the sounds and heck, the voices will immediately bring back nostalgiac feelings of those who have watched the Generation 1 series long ago. Even if you're not a fan of Transformers (or even of that particular series), playing this game is akin to being on a special lengthy TV episode. Heck, they even got the footstep sounds right!\n\nThe meat of the game, obviously, is how much you're going to kick ♥♥♥. Similar to high-speed action games made by Platinum, you're going in with fists, feet, swords, guns, flamehtrowers as you blow apart the no-name mooks (and have nice boss fights against the named ones) while rocking it to ROCKING music that'll get your blood flowin. True to the series, you can seamlessly transform from vehicle mode and back, with one major feature being able to ram into enemies in your vehicle mode to extend your massive combos (and you'll be doing this often). By default, you have a dodge button, which with last-minute timing will let you enter Focus mode, slowing down time while you can choose whatever way you want to counter-attack your enemies. Game will kinda want you to do this a lot, as said enemies can get numerous and WILL attack you at all possible angles.\n\nYou get five Autobots to choose from, as well as numerous weapons to equip for each (though certain ones are unable to use certain weapons). Each bot and weapon you give them (up to 4 slots, however you're limited to 3 of same weapon category, melee and guns) have mostly their own combos and moves, as well as everyone having their own unique action move as well as a super attack to use in order to pile on the damage.\n\nAlong with the above, you can also level up your characters AND synthesize weapons AND buy special moves (like parries) to make yourself into something fierce. Which, due to how the game starts, seems to want you to go in that direction. Even starting fresh on the normal (Warrior) difficulty, the robot mooks will give newbies respectable challenge and the first boss WILL make you learn how to use the Focus dodge.\n\nThere's just soo much, yet of course people are going to complain the game is short. It's both a curse and a blessing, but seeing as there are multiple achievements PLUS challenge modes you can find through the game, the product practically begs the player to replay the game half to death with ALL of the characters, so that when you feel you have mastered the combat and ranked up enough weapons to max stats, then the hardest difficulty will be the final undertaking for true bragging rights.\n\nWish I could say more, but my fingers are getting tired and this post is long. While in this person's view that Bayonetta and Metal Gear Rising are still the better games, Transformers: Devastation takes Platinum's well-used formula and adds on some nifty things that one hopes can make its way in any of their future titles.\n\nTL;DR version: Hurry up and ROLL OUT, already.","October 8, 2015","true","11.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game plays like something you would expect from other Platinum Games titles. There is insane over the top action throughout the game. Transformers: Devastation has amazing cell shaded graphics that looks like I am playing the Transformers series that I watched in the 80's. I had a lot of fun from start to finish. I would recommend this game to those who are fans of Platinum Games and Transformers. However, I do need to say that I was able to finish the  campaign in about 5 hours. Today writing this review is the launch day for Transformers: Devastation and I know a lot of people are considering if they should buy it. For many people out there that are not too interested in Transformers or Platinum Games past titles I would say wait until this game is on sale. In addition to the 5 hour story mode there are also 50 challenges that you can play. Many of these 50 challenges were simply sections that were taken out of the games campaign. But I know that for many reading this review that $50 is way too much for a 5 hour campaign. If the game just had 2-3 hours more content in the story I would recommend Transformers: Devastation to everyone. An early press copy of Transformers: Devastation was provided to me to review.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nFiQUU6VNA","October 6, 2015","true","21.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It’s a good thing that Devastation focuses on the fun part first and foremost. The relatively short campaign and the lack of any multiplayer option make the $49.99 price tag seem a bit steep, but this is mitigated by replay value and added challenge missions. At the end of the day, this is a game that feels right in all the important places and maintains the usual Platinum quality.

I originally disliked the game mostly because the artstyle and platinums over the top style. However after sinking just a few hours into the game im already hooked. The combat system is more than just a button masher due to the Ill just say it witch dodge, mixing in light and heavy attacks. While also using character specific features and of course slamming into them as cars. The map is actually a mini hubworld you go around in looking for whatever objective you need to go to, collectables, secrets and the lot. You know the stuff games SHOULD come with in most cases.\n\nYou can actually buy moves and upgrade your combat to have various combos, parries, and shockingly weapon drops. Literally it has diablo styled weapon drops and character upgrades. Each character can use various weapons and some are locked per character. It makes sense because I cant see bumble bee using a hammer or mace twice his size.\n\nMy own personal like for the game is the fact that it uses alot of the actors from the original G1 cartoon!\n\nI would say the games story is almost pretty much not much to go on, Autobots must stop the bad guys. Pretty much sums up the entire story so if you want this for story...I uhh I mean its platinum games..And though yes the game is fun I PERSONALLY am distracted by the blocky bulky frames of the transformers from the G1 era doing these limber and flexible dodges...its silly as hell but hell its a video game and again thats just me, its not a huge enough negative to even come close to telling people NOT to buy the game.\n\nThe only real negative is the graphics and some sound issues. Yes it has that glossy shiney cel shaded look, but thats pretty much it. Not much detail and things sometimes looks plastic and frankly like an old dreamcast game. However the game runs great on my pc and it does have some optimization and runs at a constant 59-60fps. If it could be unlocked thatd be great! As for the sound at one occasion I did see it get out of sync with the cutscenes, and when you are going through some menus, because of how they have it styled it becomes muffled and quieter but you will notice some staticy noise. The music also is nothing to go home about, the typical butt-rock and plenty of guitar rifts to go with the action but its nothing stellar. I would have loved some memorable tracks to go with this game like the Cybertron series before it.\n\n8.5/10 Buy this game now!

Watching the story as well, gives you the feeling watching an old episodes from the 80`s. So the cartoon look of this game, is a delight for old school formers fans as my self.\n\nBut there are some things I don`t like about it. It is to short for the price, I finished it in 4 hrs. It was entertaining during that time. The camra view can be annoying from times, at one mission you have to get some Energone for blowing up a bridge. Here the camara is placed from top looking down at the streets. Just annoying as hell. It is a ported game, so it probably better to use a controller then a keyboard. And the game doesn`t tell you much about how the upgrading of weapons and techs or even how to make the techs.\n\nBeing this short, I can`t give it a high grade. So I wont give it more then a 5,5/10.

If you speedrun it, it might be but take some time to actually appreciate the game. There's so much more to do than just the fights. Try the different difficulties, play through as the other characters to improve score. Don't turn away this game just because of the supposed 5 hours of gameplay. 50 USD is overkill but I think this is one of the best Transformers games to arise.\n\nFirstly, the visuals. I am so glad Platinum Games decided to go with the classic Generation 1 look. As much as I loved High Moon's pre-earth designs, Platinum Games takes the cake for the nostalgia. The art style was amazing. If there's any criticisms I have with the style, it was the lip sync. Sometimes when a character was talking there was an outline of the lips going through the mouth. This wasn't a big problem, just something I had to nitpick at.\n\nThe combat is pretty fast paced. In my defense, a lot of button mashing and vehicle attacks. A lot of the combat ended up being above ground so it felt more like playing 'the floor is lava'. I really didn't get into the store/combos until the second playthrough, which added some more fun to combat.\n\nThe storyline was great, felt like an episode of Gen 1. I was surprised at the amount of individual characters we got to see on the Decepticons. Never would have thought we would get to see the individual Constructicons or even Motormaster. Characters were pretty true to their canon selves from Starscream's snarky comments to Thundercracker's questionable loyalty. Wishing there were a few more Autobot cameos but what we got was pretty good.\n\nA lot of recycled maps, bosses, and lines. It became pretty repetitive and boring. Would've loved to hear more character lines other than the same 3 sentences.\n\nThe DLC is alright, nothing really exciting. Three reskins and a few weapons. It wasn't worth the 5 USD for me but whatever.\n\nI am already looking forward to a sequel that expands on this story since the ending reveals we have just kickstarted a bigger plot. Hope to see some more characters and greater fights.","May 16","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miker525/recommended/338930/","miker525","Miker525","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miker525/","400 products in account","So forget all that you know about your modern day Shia Labeouf Transformers and your Fall/War of Cybertron Transformers because these are the old original Transformers. Everything about this game is original from the voice actors to the graphics. And it works great. Admittedly I wasn’t even too huge on the transformers as a kid, when gen one was still a thing, but as soon as I heard Optimus Prime talk in Transformers: Devastation I was sent back to the early 90’s. Having the original voice actors back (for the most part) was huge but it really was only in addition to everything else that was awesome with the game. For the most part I haven’t been a fan of past Transformers games and though I thought Fall of Cybertron was good it still wasn’t great. Transformers: Devastation is far from a perfect game but I can say that overall this has been my best Transformers experience yet.\n\nThe main story line in Devastation is that Megatron and the Decepticons want to turn earth into a new version of Cybertron. Your job as the Autobots is to stop this from happening. There are of course many events that occur within that overarching plot line but I’m going to avoid those to try and prevent any spoilers. The game plays out as a hack and slash type game fighting all Decepticons that get in your way, playing as any one of the Autobots you so choose. You’ll travel from location to location completing your main quests while fighting, discovering loot and secrets hidden along the way, and playing through a series of side quests should you choose to do them. The side quests weren’t overly elaborate and mostly revolved around killing more Decepticons for whatever the current purpose might be. Throughout the game however there were quite a few nice little changes in gameplay, like a segment where you have to race a Decepticon to an objective and where the game switched over from a third person perspective to a top down camera. While the changes in gameplay weren’t the most exciting they did do a nice job at changing the game up enough to keep it feeling fresh.\n\nSo since the game is nearly completely combat does the combat handle well at least? For the most part the answer is yes. While fighting land based opponents combat was as solid as could be. The ability to quickly change between primary and secondary weapons and projectiles on the fly was nice and painless and making sure your attacks hit was never a concern. Dodging is probably the most important skill in the game which takes precise timing and it definitely took me a little bit to get dodging down well but once I got it it became a must use. If you dodge an attack at the exact right moment you’ll not only avoid taking damage, but will activate a temporary slow motion system which allows you to get some real good combos off on your enemies. The issues I had came about with flying enemies, specifically when they were packed into a group with ground based enemies. Trying to dodge the attacks from flying enemies was a bit of a challenge because the rotation of the camera just never seemed to want to function properly while there were other enemies surrounding me. In cases like this I found it was the best option to back away from combat so I could snipe the flying enemies out of the sky before proceeding. It wasn’t a huge issue but was definitely something that could have been done better. Another somewhat odd thing was that combat among regular Decepticons was very rarely a problem. I could get attacked by swarms of them and leave the battle with just a pinch of health missing but that somewhat ease was very much made up for in the boss battles, where only three or four hits will get you killed. Almost every single boss battle took me multiple attempts, and I wasn’t even playing on the hardest difficulty. Now this also wasn’t too big of a complaint. The checkpoint system saves your status very frequently so even when you die you don’t have to retread too much ground. Having to battle a boss four or five times gave me plenty of time to adjust my methods until I could kill the boss no problem.\n\nTransformers: Devastation isn’t an overly long game either. The game consists of seven chapters which depending on how quickly you try and play through the game can take you anywhere from 6 to 8 hours. The game tends to have chapters get shorter the farther in you are. Being a game from Platinum Games, the studio behind Bayonetta and the more recent The Legend of Korra game it seems they hope players will go back and replay the game multiple times to try and uncover all of the hidden secrets and collect all the weapons but that kind of replay-ability isn’t for everyone. Speaking of weapons however, the weapon system in the game is certainly vast. There are endless weapons of each type giving you a whole lot of freedom in how you play and what weapons you use. You can upgrade and customize each Autobot to your liking, which is both great and somewhat flawed. While the ability to customize each Autobot as you like the upgrading system works on a per Autobot system, meaning that as you play through you’ll likely end up sticking to one single Autobot as opposed to switching off more frequently. It would have been a nice change to have a universal level making it easier to switch Autobots at a later level rather than the existing requirement to grind them up to point.\n\nTransformers: Devastation is beautiful. In fact my favorite part of the game is it’s look. It truly is a great looking game which still feels incredibly authentic with the Gen one transformers. The titles biggest downfall is the actual level layout. You will constantly see assets being re-used and even bits of the level being copied and duplicated. The world just isn’t that original and luckily you have the minimap to tell you where your objective is otherwise you’d be lost trying to determine where you actually are. The world looks nice, it just could have used far more variety than it has. In its current state the world just seems kind of bland.\n\nOverall Transformers: Devastation is a solid game. If you’re a hard core fan of Transformers, especially gen one then this one is a must buy. If your a fan of hack and slashes and don’t really care about following the story then this is also totally up your ally. That said if you’re looking for a huge game with vast and varied locations and non repetitive gameplay you’ll want to turn the other direction on this one. Platinum Games did a bang up job with the game and though it isn’t without flaws it definitely is a great service to those who’ve been waiting for some serious old school transformers action. Transformers: Devastation is especially something you’ll want to dive into if you’ve got any interest in the new Transformers Prime War Trilogy that was recently announced by Hasbro and was reported on by Mike McWhertor here.\n\nI give Transformers: Devastation a 7.5 out of 10\n\nPROS:\n– Graphics. They’re wonderful\n– Original Gen 1 voice cast is back\n– Vast weapons to play how you want to play\n– Fighting is, for the most part, very solid\n\nCONS:\n– Levels are very similar and reuse assets too often.\n– Game is relatively short\n– Boss difficulty seems to be scaled a bit too high","October 15, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is the Transformer game we've all needed in our lives. For those who have played Metal Gear Rising, this is basically a more expansive version of that in terms of gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe music in this game is amazing, the graphics are beautiful, everything just feels very well done. You can tell a lot of time and effort went into the making of this game, as it shows.\n\nEDIT- after 6 hours of gameplay, I can honestly say this game is a keeper. The story is engaging, and there seems to be a new twist at each turn. The gameplay and weapon customization options are pretty good, the music is wild, and there is plenty of extras to be had outside of the main story. It's also just a gorgeous game as well, and the essence of G1 Transformers is captured pretty well. 10/10.","October 6, 2015","true","32.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The combat is fast and tight, while having to do the same thing, mashing the attack button and dodging, can get repeptivie. Although, The punching and slamming seems so very powerful with the flashing lights and all, but the guns seem very week in a sense that they don't seem to show how much power each has. Each Character also has their own special ability, For Example: Optimus' Ground Pound, and their own ranking system. Seeing how repeptitive the game maybe, it's only really worth it to level up one character.\n\nThe Story is similar to some of the 1980s serials such as Megatron Cyber-Forming Earth is similmilar to the story" The Key to Vector Sigma Parts 1/2" and "City of Steel". It was nice to see many old characters like Skywarp an THundercracker, but some other characters like The Seeker Elites are really Ramjet. The Story is also quite short as I was able to finish it in about 4 hours. Some of the voice acting is also odd as Soundwave's voice seems to be distorted.\n\nIt's also nice that they incorperated the current "Combiner Wars" Toy line into it as a sort of hidden promotion. I mean heck! They have a promotion for the Toy Devastator. They also seem to set up the ending to a possible sequel showing Optimus Maximus, Superion, and Defensor.\n\nAll in all, the story is alright, seeing how I've watched the episodes, the gameplay is repeptitive yet powerful, Voice Acting Meh, and overall a decent game for both Non-TF fans and Die-Hard ones. If you're a diehard fan I highly recommend getting this game. However, if you're casual, I suggest waiting for the game to come on sale, in the mean time I suggest playing both War/Fall of Cybertron games.\n\nRating: 8.7/10","October 6, 2015","true","5.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The trailer was great, showing off classic characters like Blitzwing, Starscream and Shockwave, and the news surrounding it built up how it would remain faithful to the classic Transformers of old.\nI also recall a lot of people nitpicking certain things that didn't look right to them and others automatically panning it for such obscene reasons such as "HI MOON STUDEOS DIDENT MAEK ITTTZ". I guess the best way to describe the final product, from my point of view, is that it lived up to the expectations for everyone, including those who felt they'd hate it.\n\nBut I digress. What Transformers Devastation offers is an incredible joy-ride all about Transformers. The controls are responsive and very comfortable-- save for when you try to make a tight turn in vehicle mode sometimes-- and the combat is perfect for the Transformers. There are dozens of different ways you can attack enemies, with even more that you can acquire during the game. This and the way Decepticons adapt to your combat discourages button mashing and makes it all the more rewarding when you take down some of the tougher enemies.\n\nI must say, like others before me, that the Story Mode is a little bit short, offering roughly 4 hours of gameplay if you just go from Point A to Point B without looking for side missions or collectibles... which are everywhere. The story itself is admittedly lackluster, too. But the game does have an expansive Challenge Mode and several tiers of difficulty, which is great for completionists and people who just generally love Transformers or this type of fighting game.\n\nNow onto the characters themselves. They are all awesome. Save for the generic troopers, each notable Decepticon in the game is unique and has their own fighting style which perfectly suits their personality. For example: Starscream is quick and prefers to keep his distance from you, Shockwave has a more experimental attack pattern and capitalizes on the fact that he's a gun, Megatron is all about brute strength and Motormaster kind of mirrors Optimus, just like he did in the G1 cartoon.\nIt's wonderful hearing all these old voices back together again, and the voice actors standing in for those who aren't available do a pretty good job too, despite what people might think.You can tell that Platinum Games did their homework given there are several nods to even the very BIBLE of Transformers!\n\nSo is Transformers Devastation worth the £32? It depends. If you like Transformers and/or you're a completionist looking for a challenge, then absolutely. But if you're only interested in playing Story Mode and then moving on, then no; Devastation has a lot of challenges which may come across as too repetitive for those who aren't really into the game and those who aren't too familiar with Transformers lore will find it all very confusing.\n\nOther than that, there's a ton that this game has to offer, it remains as faithful to the source material as possible while giving it a slight modern edge, and was a nice change of pace for the Transformers franchise.","October 11, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are a fan of Transformers born in the 80s or 90s then you won't regret picking up this game for your collection. If you are looking for a game that plays like the cybertron trilogy then this won't be that game. This game is MUCH more faced paced as you will be moving and dodging almost constanty. (and I mean don't let that finger wander too far from the dodge button. It's your only means of survival) That and your main means of combat will be melee rather than blasters. The fast paced combat plus the amazing soundtrack really gets you pumped as you hack your way through waves of enemies. The G1 characters are a real treat for those who grew up on the original show. The only way it could be more like old times would be with the "pew pew" blasters. (if you adult fans know what i'm sayin' *nudge nudge*) Overall my opinion of the game is this:\n\nPros:\nSuper fast gameplay with awesome soundtrack\nThe original voice actors from the 80s show are back to voice their respective characters!\nIt has trading cards! Which means, finally transformers profile backgrounds and emotes!\nColorful and comicbook-y world while still having a unique depth unlike other games\nEach character plays uniquely and varies in stats so it is possible to be great with one character but terrible with others\nIt's Transformers FFS!\n\nCons:\nSome of the lines feel a little cheesy\nThe selection of characters isn't that expansive. Really wish they added Jazz (personal problem)\nThe physics are wack. (wouldn't post this as a pro or con. It's just weird doing burnout donuts mid-air) It's whatever.\nDoesn't (as of this review) have the ability to play as Decepticons.\nThe controls feel a little wonky at first, it takes a bit of getting used to\n\nPersonal score: 8.7/10\nIt's not the perfect Transformers game to be worshipped for years to come, but its fun and I have no regrets adding this game to my collection.

Specifically, I finished the campaign on medium difficulty (difficulty options are Easy, Medium, and Hard) in under six hours, and there was several deaths, messing around in the menus, and a dinner break added into that total. There is loot to get, weapons to upgrade, and challenge missions to do so I may come back to this, but I think a lot of people may feel like there is not a long enough story mode to justify a $50 price tag.\n\nThe only people I would recommend this to at full price are combination Platinum and Transformers fans, who likely will have bought this already anyway. Everyone else, wait for a discount.

It's hard to say that this is better than FoC and WFC, but if it isn't it's amazingly close if not just as equal. It sort of sucks that this doesn't have a Multiplayer, I think this would be an amazing game for a co-op story. Also it would be cool to play as the Decepticon bosses such as Megatron, Soundwave, Starscream, Shockwave, etc.\n\nPros:\nIt feels and plays as a Transformer game should, bringing back the G1 characters is an amazing idea and some of the old voice actors was an amazing touch! Hearing everyone again from my childhood is beautiful no matter what character! Transformers: Devastation fast pace fighting makes it feel like you are re-watching the cartoons again however you get to control Optimus Prime, Bumble Bee, Sideswipe, Wheeljack, Grimlock, (DLC) Nemesis Prime, (DLC) Goldfire and (DLC) Red Alert. All the character designs are fantasic, using the shading just like the first G1 movie did was such a cool touch!\nThis game is very difficult on Commander (Highest Setting), it is a real challenge, that mode isn't for the faint of hearts.\n\nI just still can't believe how many voice actors they brought back into this game. Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumble Bee, Soundwave and many more! This game would have to be my favorite out of all the Transformer games if not ever. I think this is slightly better than WFC and FoC. Mostly because Generation One was my favorite era of Transformers and Cartoons at the time!\n\nAnd I liked the touch of the old transmission in some of the cutsceens!\n\nCons:\nI hate to admit it to games like this however this game has a few problems. The main problem that the story is too short. But you could see they opened it to another game which hopefully comes out. Basically the main plot is that Megatron has discovered the Proud Star which is a ship hiddien under the Earth which was comanded by Nova Prime himself, however he and his crew were corrupted. Megatron decide to use this opportunity to take the ship and to turn Earth into Cybertron.\nThe story is amazing don't get me wrong however I have a feeling this plot for Transformers is used quiet a bit in previous Shows/Movies/Video Games. It would be nice if they spiced a little bit more into it.\nAlso one other thing, they should of put at least more Autobots in such as all the Dinobots, Hound, Air Raid, Prowl, Jazz, Ironhide, Tailbreaker and many more, but I understand that they couldn't put all of them in but I thought maybe 10 characters at least but it doesn't matter this game is amazing.\n\nResult:\nThis game will bring joy into people who used to watch G1 when it was on the TV every Saturday morning. Their has been G1 games in the past but this game moves all the past games aside, this game is a must buy!\n9.5/10","October 9, 2015","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I should also admit that Transformers Devastation has one of the worst camera systems that I have ever seen in a game.

I could probably get used to it after a while, but it doesn't feel nearly as natural as playing as Bumblebee.\n-The story was pretty weak. Like I said, I'm not really a Transformers fan, but I could still pretty much tell what was going on, and it wasn't anything too interesting from my perspective. That's definitely not what I play this type of game for, though, so not a huge issue.\n-It's pretty short, I finished my Bumblebee playthrough in about 7 hours. Like I said before, though, there's plenty of reasons to do a second or maybe even a third playthrough with different characters.\n\nSo in conclusion, this game was really fun, action-packed, and well presented, with only a few cons that didn't really matter to me in the bigger picture. Overall it was one of the best licensed games I've ever played. Reccomended to anybody who likes beat-em-ups, especially if it's on sale.\n","April 24","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've ever wanted a game that featured a single player storyline with massive, epic battles between sentient robots, and bigger sentient robots, and sentient robots that combine into bigger sentient robots, and all that battling over the fate of the earth, this is the game for you.\n\nIf you like Transformers, same deal.\n\nIf you love Transformers, you already have this game.\n\nUnlike it's predecessor, but much like those that came before that mistake, this game is not a marketing tie in with a movie release. This is a full fledged story about the epic war between the heroic Autobots and the conquest bent Decepticons. The story is pulled from the comics, which themselves are a branch off from the first and second seasons of the highly acclaimed 1980s television show.\n\nIt has everything you'd expect from an epic, earth based battle between two warring, robotic, transforming, million year old alien factions: nail biting race/chase sequences, exploration of derelict alien ships, no win scenarios that are turned into chances to live, and facing the choice of whether to destroy the last remnants of your own civilization in order to save the future of another, all with the music to make you feel the panic, fear, epicness, success, and failures that go along with them.\n\nPlay it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuffinsForAll/recommended/338930/","MuffinsForAll","Princess Fabulous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuffinsForAll/","106 products in account","I had been a longtime Transformers fan that collected the comics, figures, TV series, movies, video games, novels, clothing, and had went to several Transformers fan events.  That's why when this hack and slash styled Transformers game was announced I was quite excited due to the fact that I was a big fan of the hand-to-hand combat sequences of the Transformers series.\n\n\nThe Game:\n\nThe Graphics and Visuals:  Amazing and nostalgic at the same time.  The cell-shaded cartoon styled look fits in witht he G1 theme and makes for some great visuals.\n\nCharacter Selection and fighting mechanics:  You can choose from Optimus, Sideswipe, Bumblebee, Grimlock, and Wheeljack.  For the most part the different characters and their combat abilities are handled very well, allowing each character to shine in their own way with either speed or strength.  The vehicles modes in terms of combat are quite fun as well.  However,Grimlock's dino form, in my opinion, has clunky controls with the constant tapping of a button to get him to run rather than the buttonless accerlation based on time and momentum of the automobile characters and the awkward melee attacks of the mode.  The fighting mechanics are not very complex but are still fun and enjoyable, whiel being easy to pick up for the most part.  The gun mechanics may be awkward to deal with at first, but over time you will probably get the hang of it and might actually find them quite easy.\n\nStory:  A simple "Megatron wants to destroy the world" kind of story just like the original cartoon series episodes.\n\nBoss battles:  Fun and provide a healthy challenge.  Enjoy as you fight memorable characters in battle that provide variety in how you fight them.\n\nI have not experienced any freezing and crashing or major performance issues on my poor excuse of a computer.\n\nCons:\nRecycling: Of bosses/enemies and settings.  There is enough enemy and boss variety for the game to make it enjoyable, but i feel that this should still be mentioned for the game does do the whole "fight this boss then fight it again with another past boss" thing.  The settings are however quite mundane with not many of them really changing how you play/fight and the game requires you to traverse through similar or even the exact same areas again and again.\n\nLength of the game:  This can be seen as not a flaw due to the replay value and enjoyability of the game as a whole.  However, the lack of a Decepticon campaign (which is sort of a tradition by now for transformers games) shortens the game and takes away fromt the maximum potential of the game in terms of characters, story, and length of the game.\n\nLoot and Loot combining system:  the rng nature of the loot system and the information-void loot/inventory system makes the overall system pointless and a lack-of-effort filled way to pull gamers into replaying the game (though the desire to replay it is still there, but not because the loot).\n\nIn the end, Transformers: devastation is a great game for any transformers fan especially for g1 fans.  Though there is some waisted potential in the mix, the game is an overall fun experience due to the enjoyable fighting mechanics of the game.  However , if you more of a fan of the third person shooting mechanics of the preivious Transformer game titles, this may be one that you should pass, or if you arent exactly a g1 fan, you may want to pass this one as well.  Also, it would probably be better to get this game on sale due to the short length of the game.\n\n8/10 Its got more than meets the eye.","May 2","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the game you didn't know you've been waiting for.\n\nIt's faithful to G1 in just about every way.  The voices of all of the Autobots and most of the Decepticons are supplied by their original actors, making it seem as though you're living in the cartoon from 30 years ago.  The setting is absolutely spot-on, complete with the Ark and Teletraan I.\n\nThere are flaws, but they're mostly forgivable.  The difficulty spikes sharply after the second boss fight, and most enemies start to seem overpowered compared to your characters' stat progression.  The action is lightning-fast and over-the-top, but starts to feel repetitive.\n\nMany characters are glaringly absent.  For example, you won't find Ironhide, Ratchet, Prowl, or Jazz.  With many characters being recolors of each other, it seems like a missed opportunity to include Cliffjumper as an alternate to Bumblebee.  Hopefully we get the chance to see these characters resurface in DLC's or sequels.\n\nAnyway, great game.

In typical action game style you make your way through levels looking for goodies while smashing baddies. Playing with a 360 controller it works fine, the camera controls aren't bad at all like some people say. They're no different than any other third-person action game. I don't know about the comparisons to Bayonetta - I've played both and I don't really see that here other than it uses combo attacks and a mix of ranged and melee. It's as much like Bayonetta as Warhammer Space Marine or X-Blades.  The first boss fight was tough on Normal/Medium difficulty. It took me two or three tries before I finally got it, but I don't play a lot of games like this.\n\nI love the voice acting, the 80's nostalgia, the sound effects, the art style, the controls, and the combat. This is a great game. I wish it was co-op, then it would be perfect, and it seems a little pricy for what you get. There are RPG elements, a leveling system of some kind, with gear and stats, but it's not the most intuitive system. I'd give it a solid 8/10. If you really love action games and/or classic Generation 1 Transformers, get it. If you're on the fence about either of those elements, wait for a sale. It's at least as good as the Cybertron games.","October 6, 2015","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Do you think the grim, serious direction they've gone in is great? Well, listen up you turbo revvin' young punk, Platinum Games will straighten you out yet.\n\nThis is nearly the perfect Transformers game. It forgoes the recent Cybertron games' style of dull, sad characters in drab environments for the fast-paced and colorful G1 aeschetic. The characters are lively and full of personality, just the way you remember them. There are some weird moments that seem out of character(such as Optimus gunning down a horde of insecticons and yelling "Keep coming, I'll keep shooting you down!") but for the most part the characters are really on point. The old voices are a great touch, though I wish they could have a found someone who does a better Starscream impression. Honestly, I think you could edit this game down to just cutscenes and boss fight footage and it would look pretty much like you're watching the original show. There's plenty of nods to the original series, and you can tell a lot of love went in to crafting a great G1 experience.\n\nIt's not totally perfect, though. From what I understand it is fairly short, but I don't think length holds this style of game back. Revengeance wasn't too long either, and it's the best game in its' franchise. It would be nice to have a larger cast of Autobots to play as, even if they're just reskins; more named Decepticons for you to fight in each level would be really cool too. There are some clear missed opportunities here. Why not have Skywarp and Thundercracker backing up Starscream? Hordes of Reflectors like in the first episode? Wheeljack has a shield ability, so why not reskin him into Trailblazer and make it a full 360 degree forcefield? These are just a few ideas, and I'm hoping they release more playable Autobots as DLC in the future.\n\nTelling where you are in the city area can be kind of tough, as it's sort of open-ended. You always have a specific, linear objective, but you can run around in extra areas, or ones you've already explored in a different section of the chapter, to find extra items. The item drop system, by the way, is great. Upgrading the various weapon types, with their elemental damage, is very fun. If you're not into seeing Prime without his signature gun, don't worry, you can get a better version later on. I've already gotten a random drop of an improved version of Wheeljack's melee weapon.\n\nThe gameplay is tight and stylish as you'd expect from Platinum, and the overall experience gives you the impression that they love The Transformers. This is easily the greatest Transformers video game to be released to date, and I only hope its' success encourages Hasbro and Activision to give Platinum a shot at making a sequel far larger in scope. Maybe it's not quite my dream Transformers game, but it's real close.\n\n10/10, Till All Are One","October 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"

The pluses are that it looks amazing and handles pretty well.  The original voice actors are here too.  You can customize and upgrade your weapons, which is cool.  The downside is that this is a short game, have no illusions.  Also, no multiplayer and sadly none of the original music from the show (but this being the PC, I have no doubt someone will fix on their own).  Also, This is an autobot storyline, so you can't play as decepticons, which sucks.  I prefer the autobots, but it's nice to change things up.  Still, this game feels like Platinum was testing the waters and if things do well, I think in the future we'll get the multiplayer and decepticons that we want.  Until then, ROLL OUT!","October 6, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The campaign is short, only clocking in at 4 hours if you rush through in the easy difficulty, but like any proper character action game there's lots of incentive to replay on harder difficulties and really master the gameplay systems. There's also the usual very large set of bonus challenges and a long series of unlocks and upgrades.\n\nWorth a full $50-60? Unless you're an absolute fanatic for this kind of gameplay, probably not. It's a fantastic play though, and very much worth your time if you can find it in a sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/338930/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\nOld Transformers will be happy to know that Transformers: Devastation is exactly what you'd want out of a Licensed game. It not only does the subject justice in terms of the cartoon Transformers, but it hits the style out of the park. And in Platinum Games case, you can expect a certain quality out of them: great action gameplay with Platinum's unique style to complement the combat. The port quality is good, it performs well despite a couple lack of options. But, this has Activision's hands on the game: the game does have length problems, and the game shows signs of being rushed to market with a story line that rushes to its conclusion in the second half of the game. And the game does have some good moments of variety, but in the bigger picture, you'll feel like the game stretched out its content with the resources it had, maybe a little bit too far. In the end, I can't help but recommend it, because despite my concerns of it being rushed, it still does too many good things in the overall picture. I just can't help but wonder what it could have been.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/JnRNTUHs_34\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nNostalgia, Nostalgia, Nostalgia. Those fans of the original cartoons? Will love everything this game has to offer, in its cheesy lines and goofy nature.\nCombat system at its core is exactly what you want it to be from a Platinum game. Going from enemy to enemy is fantastic, as the natural pacing in combat feels like a raging river: action packed, but  flowing with no resistance.\nTransformed mode works into combat fantastically, and feels like a natural addition. Really surprised with this one: even though the combat is Bayonetta-lite, I was really surprised that it fit in so well into the existing combat.\nThe ranged fighting helps in supplementing the focus on melee fighting, especially as a combo extender.\nGood weapon variety in terms of ranged weaponry that does change up fights.\nI do wish there were more of them, but the chase fights work rather well with the transforming element combined with the high speed elements.\nWhen the game changes its perspective, it helps the game feel so fresh. And yet, it still is able to work rather well. Even the turret section. And I'm saying this about a turret section. I feel dirty, but it frankly works in this case.\nMusic is typical Platinum: High action, but having a touch of class. Very appropriate in most every situation.\nThe humor is cringeworthy at times. And I love it.\n-:\nThe game shows Activision's hand in this: this game was rushed. The typical weaving of Platinum games quality products is missing here, as things feel disconnected at times.\nNot sure if the RPG elements really helped the game in the end. Felt so disconnected from everything else and not really necessary in the game.\nLength of the main campaign is short. Reasonably short. And there's a lot of filler in terms of the challenges, which rehashes a lot of the scenarios from the main story mode.\nYou can't help but reminded of Bayonetta 2 with the fighting, and there will always be a hint of it not living up to one of the best games of 2014.\nThe menus, in particular with the weapons and synthesizing element, is confusing and misleading at times. It's hard to tell which equipment is equipped to who you're working with. While the information is there, it's muddy and hard to pick out from everything else there.","October 12, 2015","true","10.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rascus/recommended/338930/","rascus","Rafiki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rascus/","188 products in account",""A great take on the old Transformers cartoon TV series with more focus on melee combat than most transformers games. Although a bit short, the game never stopped to entertain and just like when you were a 10 year old, you sit through the whole thing with a big grin on your face."\n\n\nThis is actually the first game from Platinum Games that I've played, never getting MG Revengance or any of the console games (due to them being exclusive to a console I don't own at the time), but I've heard good things about them. Also since I've never played any game in the "Spectacle Fighter" genre before, I didn't really know what to expect. I was also a bit sceptic to the Transformers part, since licensed titles have been a mixed experience over the years. But slowly as I got in to it I realised how good the game was. The core gameplay felt great and at most times really fast paced. Coupled together with the incredible cartoon TV series rock music in the fights and the sheer atmosphere build up for the big boss battles, it makes for a great experience that takes you back to when you where 10 years old, sitting in front of the TV on a saturday morning going - WOW! Although some of the fights could be a bit tedious I ended the game with a big smile on my face and felt happy that I gave the game a chance.\n\nThe graphics feels taken straight out of the cartoon series. It's very sharp and colourful.The music and sound is excellent and really enhances the experience. The story might be a bit short for some people, seeing as I finished it in just over 4 hours, but to me it was just long enough that I felt satisfied with playing at the end. There is replayability however, since there are 5 different characters to play, that all play a bit differently, with achievments for finishing all missions with the same character, with one achievment for each character. Which means that if you like the gameplay, the game should be able to keep you entertained for at least 20-30 hours, which is quite good for a game of this cost.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that like the Transformers TV series, and probably those who like other games in this genre. Also as a newcommer to the genre, I would also recommend it to anyone else who haven't played this type of games before but are interested in trying it out, since it wasn't too complicated or difficult to learn.","January 1","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I LOVE G1 Transformers and flipped when I heard this game was coming out.  I was less than heppy when I head Activision was developing it, but held out hope.  My hope was not misplaced... for the most part.\nIf you love G1 like me, you will love this game.  Original cast, the design, the story, it's like a sock full of nostalgia bashing you hover the head.  If you like Bayformers (you should first off reconsider your life choices), you will not enjoy this game.\n\nPros:\n-Fun, fast paced combat system\n-Good graphics with the retro, cell-shaded deco\n-fun weapons with an... interesting... upgrade system\n-Amaze-balls cinimatics (most of the time)\n-The story is put together like a big G1 episode\n-all original cast (for the main chatracters at least; Optimus, Bee, Sideswipe, Wheeljack, Grimlock, Megatron, Starscream,        and those are all the ones I can say for sure)\n-The all round feel of this game is like being in a G1 episode.  It is a really fun  ride for fans\n\nCons:\n-Still some Activison lazyness (a few bugs that can be lived with, some weird looks to cinimatics here and there, some sound effects seem a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)\n-My graphics card couldn't handle the game at high graphics, I have a dinky Intel HD so your's will probably suffice better than mine.  If you have an Intel HD like me (you can check through devices and drivers on a PC), it will run balls slow at ultra and high, and even medium.  It still runs a little slow on low, but it's not bad.  Even with running it on low, the in-game cinimatics (not the cut scenes) ran slow and the sounds played before the action was done in the scene (again, livable)\n-Probably the one that most people will be put off by, even though I am fine with it, the game is a little short.  Not as short as people say it is.  I sawe a review that said the story was 4 hours long.  No. It took me 9.5 hours to complete the story on easy.  there is also a battle area game mode where you can just go in and enjoy some of that Platnium games combat.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game, and if you like Transformers, I am sure you will too.  This was a nostalgic treasure trove for me, but if your put off by som eActivison lazyness or a relitivly short story mode, you probably won't like it.  I would suggest getting this game on sale if you can, because for $50 (what I got it for) it is a pretty small game.  If it is $30 and under, pick it up.","February 6","true","11.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","2"

This game is the closest you will ever get to playing a cartoon storyarc of Transformers. This game is not without its flaws, for sure, the combat can get repetitive, it is a little short, and I wish there were a few more characters in the mix, but the love for the source material that was put into this game is there. I didn't mind the linear aspect so much as I felt I was playing through a series of episodes rather than creating my own destiny, as it were. The music and animation feel beautifully dated to bring back that 1980s Saturday morning cartoon feel, and I love that they brought back the surviving voice actors. I hope they make a sequel and that all games trying to catch that feeling of nostalgia were up to this level.","March 26","true","7.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The voice acting and writing feel authentically saturday morning in a plot whose only purpose is to excuse animated robot violence, so that's all as it should be.  I really can't find fault with the "Transformers" half of this game, and would highly recommend it to anyone whose primary concern is playing a passable character action game set in the Transformers universe, although it is short and you'll probably be disappointed with its length if you don't give it multiple playthroughs.\n\nUnfortunately, if I'm to critique this game as a "veteran" character action fan (whatever that means), then I have to say it lacks depth and mostly prioritizes slick and stylish presentation of combat over meaningful gameplay options.  Dodging any attack (for which there is a fairly forgiving window even on the second-highest difficulty) launches the player into slow-motion that renders them nearly (if not totally) invincible for its duration.  Finishing nearly any combo ("combo" in this case translating to any combination of light and heavy attacks the player chooses to mash out) slows gameplay for a few frames, which queues the player (if the player so chooses) to launch into a special, highly damaging attack that, once again, renders the player invulnerable for its duration and more often than not leaves enemies stunned.  This combo finisher is not difficult to execute, so be assured that a player of any skill level will be able to do it.\n\nBetween these two mechanics, both of which are more or less the central gimmicks of the physical combat in the game, novices and pros alike will be spending the majority of their time in some state of invulnerability with enemies largely powerless to resist.  The basic flow of gameplay is "mash any attack buttons to perform combos in order to perform combo finishers, if an enemy happens to get an attack off before the combo finisher stuns them then dodge it and punish with slow-motion combo mashing into combo finishers".  There are other techniques, like the ability to parry, but they are rendered obsolete by the "focus" dodge system and combo finishers.  By making these two types of techniques so easy to access/execute the game allows the player to utilize the most powerful parts of their arsenal without much investment of effort or skill, something I find to be fairly disappointing.\n\nThere are also some very mild third-person shooting elements (players can manually aim their ranged weapons and shoot enemies from afar), and while they don't feel "tacked on" I don't think they add significantly to the game; Those with a quick hand will be able to get some extra damage in on enemies when they find themselves at a distance.  The player can also shoot without needing to aim, so the third-person shooting elements are in no way a mandatory part of the experience, though they're certainly expected to be utilized.\n\nAdditionally, the game features a fairly standard random loot system.  Weapons (both melee and ranged) of various rarities drop randomly from item chests and enemies, some with modifiers like the ability to slow or freeze enemies, and can be combined together to create more powerful weapons.  I'm not as offended by the concept of random loot in a character action game as some people are, and I think the execution is acceptable.  Unless I misunderstand the weapon combination system, it's not really possible to take a flame shotgun and slap a slowing-gel gun onto it and make some sort of super-flame-gel-slowing-shotgun, or to take a sniper rifle and slap a machinegun onto it and make a sniper-machinegun, so that might be a disappointment to some.  Still, I'm entertained by the number of permutations the game allows for, and I wish there were more depth to the physical combat in order to better utilize them.\n\nThe "point" of the random loot system, aside from encouraging grinding to lengthen the playtime of obsessive loot♥♥♥♥♥s like myself, is to enable players to choose and craft weapons that give stat bonuses, to the end of making character "builds" (I use the term lightly).  Between weapons stat bonuses and equippable accessories that are ALSO randomly generated (you can begin to picture the amount of chaff you'll have to sift through to find genuinely useful items), players can customize their characters within reasonable parameters.  It doesn't radically affect gameplay (at least up to and through the second highest difficulty) but it's an entertaining diversion.\n\nThe game is perhaps ostensibly "open world", but this doesn't amount to much.  Going slightly off the beaten path can lead to extra "shoot these targets" or "beat up these robots" missions, but the areas are all homogeneous enough that exploration is mostly a point A to point B affair.  I'm not sure how much of a selling point this was meant to be, so whatever.  It doesn't bother me.\n\nIf you aren't as critical of your action games as I am then you will probably enjoy this game, but you might find it too short if you don't typically heavily invest yourself into these sorts of things.  If you enjoy Transformers, as I do, then you will probably enjoy this game.  If you don't care about Transformers, are at least moderately critical of character actions games, and are wondering whether this is a good or mediocre Platinum action game?  Eh, probably mediocre.  If you're chomping at the bit for something in this vein, are willing to play for style in a game that doesn't even come close to forcing it, or are enticed by the ability to grind for combinable weapons, then get it on discount, otherwise I'd skip it.","December 27, 2015","false","25.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

It is very enjoyable even when sometimes to start spamming the dodge button on the later bosses and dang, they get hard. I only played Medium dificulty and I prolonged a maybe 4 Hour game to 6 Hours. Maybe I'm just bad. One thing is bad is that they reused a few maps over and over. Not too much to make it feel repetitive but just enough that you'll notice.\n\nMusic is amazing. Somewhat catchy and always sets the tone. I can feel the tension along with the endless action that complement each other.\n\nOverall a great buy.

You can customize a lot of guns and blades but there are no combos ... the combat gameplay revolves all around dodging and button mashing until you get to the super attack, it's tedious and in my opinion the worst Platinum Games ever made.\n\nOne of the many issues in the gameplay is the fact that they bind the same button for transformation, dodging and super attack, this is disastrous since at hardest difficulty every hit you take drains almost half you total hp making dodging even more important and it happens many times that you have a super attack moment where when you press the dodge button it makes you attack and this lets you vulnerable to the next enemy hit that you will have no way to dodge if this happens.\n\nThe absence of a targeting is really detrimenting to many fights, you won't be able to attack what you want, making destroying objects to get heal a total nightmare in many scenarios.\n\nI have no idea how the Korra game had so low receptions while this is so acclaimed, the Korra game was short and the level design was bad, but it had a solid, really deep combat system to evolve and master.\n\nI am not a fan of the Transformer series and i picked this up only because it's from Platinum Games, i think most of the people praising this game are really driven by nostalgia.","March 23","false","6.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

I've played a lot of the games over the years and have enjoyed many of them. Each thing brings its own unique attributes to the table.\n\nHere are the good things about this game:\nG1 Nostalgic value. Excellent animation, design, coloring and voice acting. If you are a G1 fan, this is visually/audio wise a very loving tribute to it. The music, while not super memorable is very mood appropriate.\n\nThe bad: Everything else.\n\nThe game is what I would describe as "twitchy" controls. Meaning that it is all split second, reaction timing.\n\nYou had full health? Oops, sorry, you didn't hit the -exact- combination of moves needed in order to avoid this combo of hits that kill you almost instantly.\n\nIt's like that for every...single...boss.\n\nThe game looks and feels like it should have a nice upgrade system (there's plenty of collectibles, lore to find, upgrades to be had) but at the same time they all feel rather useless.\n\nYou are playing giant, robot aliens who turn into cars and trucks. You should FEEL like you're a tank (the gaming version of that, I mean.) Instead, it feels like you're made of glass, waiting for one wrong string of button hits to cause you to die.\n\nI've seen some people go "Well it's a platinum game." That doesn't excuse it. I play most of my video games on expert mode and I can barely make it through EASY for this game.\n\nIf you're a fan of the old days where arcade games were unnecessarily difficult and unforgiving, in an effort to force you to throw more quarters at it, then this is your game. If you're wanting an enjoyable narrative, or satisfying control experience, I advise you to look elsewhere.","April 27","false","2.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

The plot, while not even close to being as important as the actual gameplay, seems like an episode of the old show (think "The Ultimate Doom" and "Megatron's Master Plan"). Of course, since this is Platinum, the part you're going to be interested in is doing sick combos to insane bosses. A good chunk of gameplay will feel familliar, but it's so expertly crafted that you don't care, and just enjoy the exhilaration of beating the everloving nuts and bolts out of Devastator on level 1. Replay value is off the charts, with 5 difficulty levels, 5 characters, and a full toyline of moves and weapons, including the MGR parry and FRICKIN DRILLS THAT SHOOT OTHER DRILLS.

Why? The story and voice acting are weak, though it delivers great nostalgia and decent action. But it's a straight beat-em-up, and doesn't really have anything like special powers or great set pieces. Just your favorite 5 Autobots shooting (none-too-accurately) and beating up on the same Deceps over and over.\n\nI'm going to strongly recommend Fall of Cybertron over this, if you're going to play one Transformers game. It's probably the only good Transformers game ever. I know that's not Generation 1, but it's also not Michael Bay, and it's just a damn good game. Great set pieces and special missions built around specific character powers, and you really feel like the swingin' swashbucklin' Jazz, or the badass and proud Grimlock. This one's just okay. I feel better about it because I got it during the Thanksgiving sale--I'd have been disappointed if I'd paid full price for it.","December 3, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although it is short, you can just play this game over and over again, but accomplishing different goals like "Just completed in scout mode, now to complete it in warrior mode." or "Now to beat the game using only one character." There's even challenges to unlock and play in the game. You can just complete campaign mode 18 times while using different gaols. The G1 style of the game just gives me good vibes. Although I'm just young, I've been a fan of the G1 serires. Having all the original voice actors from G1 to this game just makes it so charming. All the features here will just make you want to play again and again. Such as collecting and upgrading weapons (or buying them from Wheeljack's lab), and developing Tech to apply to your characters for boosts, such as greater jump height and more credit drops. This game is just so amazing. Thanks for reading my review, and have fun playing this awesome game.","February 14","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is just megatron trying to turn the planet into cybertron again.  no biggie.   You stop him and there is drama and a big ending finish.  Not a selling part of the game.  Honeslty, I watched the story on my first play through just because but I could have skipped it and been happy.\n\nThe CHARACTERS:\nYou get to play as the transformers DUH!  You get to be a dinosaur, a VW beetle, a Ferrari, a jet, a semi truck.  I mean come on.  One good thing that seperates this from the stupid ♥♥♥ movie transformers is that bumble bee is his old goofy self again.  He is also literally the only transformer I like.  If you like the transformers than that is great.\n\nThe GAMEPLAY:\nOK.  THis is where ti shines.  The gameplay is absolutely amazing.  I have not played a game with gameplay this fast in a very long time.  It is very refreshing knowing that people still make games like this.  You play as a transformer, who through his actions must fight off the bad guys.  I mean its not deeper than that, but that is all you need.  The fighting, at times, is so fast, it is almost impossible for my brain to keep up.  The dodging has to be spot on, the aiming has to be spot on.  It is a game that actually takes skill to play.  It is very fast paced and I have noticed that it overall made me a better video game player because of it.  It has made my reflexes much faster.  I would compare the fighting to hard mode on DDR.  If you havent played that, then try it.  The fighting needs your constant attention, if you look away for 1 second you are sure to die.  This of course is on hard mode.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME BELOW HARD.  I tried it on easy and it was waaaaaaay to easy.  I had to reset after chapter 1.  Here is an example of how hard it is.  I beat chapter 1 in like 10 minutes on easy.  It took me like 3 hours on hard.  I beat the VERY first fight in the game where you just fight grunts on easy in no time at all.  After setting it to hard, I died 4 times.  I died probably over 30 times fighting the last battle of chapter 1.  After the game I was like, "cool.  I just beat it on hard I am a cool guy".  Then it told me I unlocked 2 harder difficulties.  Great!  So hard mode is VERY hard but it is not unobtainable hard.  These new modes I am sure will make me wish I was dead.  In the hardest mode you die if you get hit even once.  There is also TONS of unlockables.  You get challenge mode which lets you play different challenges with different characters to unlock cool weapons and stuff.  It is super fun.  50 challenges in all.  It took me an hour just to do 4 on all difficulty modes.  You get to keep your weapons and stuff to help you through the harder things.  There is NO tutorial.  You can upgrade your weapons and even make your own weapons and perks and even your characters level and stats, like strength, speed, courage, int, ect.  It is very RPG based like that.  Once again, there is no tutorial but you can figure it out.  I had no idea you could upgrade stuff until the middle of the game.  I figured it out after just messing around in the menu and I became a BEAST and I was one bad a## mofo ready to take on all the constructobots at the same time.  You also get tons of weapons and perks.  They are limitless all with different attributes and whatnot.  It's crazy.  If you wanted to level every character to max and get all the best weapons and beat everything on the hardest difficulties, it would literally take thousands of hours.  I almost forgot, there are 2 space battles in the game.  Almost made me J*ZZ.\n\nThe MUSIC:  It is a ROCK and TECHNO mix.  It is pretty cool actually.\n\nThe GRAPHICS:  It is amazing.  At times I wasnt sure whether I was watching an actual drawn video game or the cell shaded graphics.  It is a throw back to G1 Transformers.  It is very nastalgic and very exciting and fun.  The graphics will do 60 fps at 1080.  It makes for very fluid gameplay.\n\nThe CONS: (none really)\nSo the main complaint about this game is that it is very short.  This is true, if you only play it on the easiest difficulty.  The first time I played it, it took me about 12 hours.  That is just the main story.  You have challenges and perks to get and all kinds of stuff.  It will take you about 10-12 hours to beat on hard, but then you got 2 more difficulties to beat and 50 challenges.  I don't even want to think about how long that is going to tae me, but I will have so much fun doing it.\n\nThe VERDICT:\nAmazing game.  I waited for it to be 50% off because of all the bad reviews on steam.  It is way worth the 50 dollars.  I loved it so much I bought it for a friend, so I spent 50 bucks anyway.  My only regret for this game is, I wish I would have bought it earlier when I wasn't in school so I could play it all day.  I would have gladly paid 50 dollars for it.  It has loads of content.  Loads and loads.  DO NOT LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVES.  I am telling you, if you like brawlers and very fast hard gameplay, get this.  It is super fun.\n\n95/100","February 14","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say the Platinum games once agian out did themselves with just how glorious this game looks and feels play. Lets split it up into sections.\n\nSection 1: Story\nThe story is played like an episode from the show, which can be summerized like this; Megatron evil, make him pay. Without spoilers Megatron has some how managed to start turning a city into metal which in game is dubbed "Cyberforming". Optimus Prime, along with Bumblebee, Sideswipe, Wheeljack, and Grimlock, have to stop him from doing that and roll out on this epic adventure. I for one am a person that loves story in gaming and for being a kind of bare bones story, i still love it because it reminds me of the show. (Keep in mind im a 22 year old who watched the show way after it was released through the G1 series box set, but i still love it just the same). This game seems to take place sometime after the season 2 finale but before the movie. I also find it funny because i just recently saw an episode in season 2 that, towards the last half of the episode Megatron actually got the ability to start turning the entire earth into metal, just a funny side note.\n\nSection 2: The Gameplay\nWhy are you all here if not to know how this game handles. Its great. i love it all. well theres some things i can gripe about but that can come later. Optimus, is a big guy with lots of power but kinda slow, Bumblebee is quick but doesnt do that much damage, Wheeljack is medium speed with medium attacking power, While Sideswipe, Oh my god, Sideswipe, hes fast, strong, and super good at what he does (no sexual inuendo intendo). The controls are okay, definitly go and set the fire button for ranged weapons to something like R, i dont now whose idea it was to map that to the middle mouse button but no, just no. Hold shift to transform, press it to dodge, and hold it down in the air to do a slam down attack. Ranged weapons are pretty responsive and so is melee. It all brilliant. Except Grimlock. Yes sadly i dont think he handles the best. his attack just handle really awkwardly and his dodge is the same way. i dont know if im doing something wrong but hes not my favorite, but that doesnt destory the game.\n\nSection 3: The Levels\nAll the levels, at least what ive played, are connected. The City is big and theres alot of items scattered around the area that you can collect to make the bots better. Every so often youll encounter a boss character like Devastator, and Megatron, and even a very fun boss fight with Soundwave, Laserbeark, and Ravage. The levels are huge and allow plenty of room to transformer and fight. i never feel like im cramped in. There are Kremzeeks, Decepticon Logos, and Spy Ops that you can shoot and collect for concept art and special files, that you can collect to learn more about the Transformers Mythos. Some are well hidden as well.\n\nSection 4: The Ark\nThe Ark is where the Autobots go to gear up. Here you can choose your bot, equip weapons, combine weapons to make them better, make special upgrades to give increased health or speed boosts with Wheeljacks tinkering, The bots can hav 4 weapons in total, with 2 types, Melee and Ranged. Both types can have 4 types of special typings, Basic, Ice, Fire, and Electricity. There are also several types of weapons for both classes, including Hammes, duel swords, duel blasters, grenade launchers, grapple hooks, and many more. The weapon inventory has a max of 200 which i reached in a matter of hours, as i took the time to explore every inch of the level before continuing. i still had fun even while doing that. The 200 cap is a little low in my mind because of that as i have to sell weapons in order to make space. Weapons have a rank and a level D being the lowest rank and S being the highest. ive seen alot of D rank weapons and im not yet sure how to get higher ranked ones. Wheeljack can tinker with some motherboards to add power ups to the bots like health boosts and faster reloading or even faster movement speed.\n\nSection 5: Conclusion\nThis game is amazing. Go play it, complete it all. AGE IS OUT! PEEEACE!","October 15, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable.  The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there.  Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One.\n\nBut aside from that, it's actually a very fun game.  The combat mechanics are extremely well done.  Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike High Moon's excellent War for/Fall of Cybertron games.  Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.\n\nThere are plenty of side missions available, and some of the main game's brief forays into side-scroller, GTA1 top-down, and take-out-the-horde-with-a-turret-gun are nice changes of pace.","October 16, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Transformers Devastation is a lovingly crafted game that came straight out of an episode of the original Gen 1 cartoon, with the original designs spruced up with a colourful and shiny coat of paint and as much of the returning voice cast as humanly possible, whether you’re a transformers fan or a platinum games fan, this game is up your alley.\n\nIn robot form it’s your standard platinum game with combos and dodges ripped straight out of Bayonetta with the same quality of animation and sound design that makes every dent in a decepti-creeps face satisfying, but this game provides something unique that neither the transformers’ shows nor games have delivered, where the cars and transformations are more than just a disguise. You can finish all of your combos with a devastating vehicle attack with the potential to hit multiple enemies or even switch targets. The best aspect of this combat is how all the gameplay elements naturally feeds into each other; the finishers can leave you in vehicle form and with enough momentum to loop round and start another string of attacks, at any point you can quickly pull out your blasters and pop a few servos without stopping your combo and in some cases giving you an opportunity to launch another vehicle attack.\n\nWhile the campaign may come across as surprisingly short compared to most games, it’s remedied by being compact and tightly paced with boss fights being just as common as normal enemies, for instance you will only have two fights under your belt before you have to test your metal against Devastator. These boss fights hold the best moments in the game, they’re fun, frequent and backed up by a kickass sound track which while sadly missing the touch provides a mix of rock, metal and even classical music that’s appropriate for the carnage on screen. And once you’re done fighting through the two unlockable difficulty settings (Magnus being very hard and Prime being “I hope you’re made of sterner stuff”), there’s also 50 challenge missions which offer unique bosses and enemy compositions. Ever want Grimlock to pile drive Optimus prime and Megatron AT THE SAME TIME?!!!... Mission 16.\n\nUnfortunately between the fast and frenetic combat you will have to deal with a needlessly complex and time consuming upgrade system, throughout the game you will find heaps and heaps of loot that can be equipped or synthesised to upgrade existing weapons. I have a lot of issues with this style of progression, ultimately all the upgrades and new weapons are only raising stats that you will vaguely notice in combat, and this has the potential to throw new players into scenarios under geared, stretching a 5 minute boss fight into a 15 minute fight due to pitiful damage, and vice versa. Also seeing as how all the playable autobots can equip the same weapons (with a few limitations), there isn’t as much variety in playstyles between them besides special abilities, vehicle attacks and stats, so you will likely stick with one character throughout the game. Oh and the stats screen, you’re going to love the stats screen and the insanely slow speed that it takes to level up an autobots attributes, you can probably re-watch the 1986 movie in the time it takes to level up your second favourite character to keep up with your main. To be fair the loot does occasionally provide a novel weapon, such as Devastators’ drills or Megatrons’ fusion cannon and these weapons do add a little spice to the combat.\n\nAnother significant issue with the combat and its difficulty is that enemies can and will attack you off screen with little to no warning, the camera used in devastation is a little underwhelming with no lock-on and only designed to keep you and the current punching bag in frame and in the case of a few chase sequences it has a hard time coping with the speeds you can reach. It doesn’t so much as add challenge to the game but instead creates an air of paranoia when tackling multiple enemies, I will say that this isn’t a significant problem on a normal walkthrough but on challenge mode, where fighting multiple bosses at once with attacks that are only properly telegraphed if you’re focusing on them specifically (shockwave being a particular thorn in challenge modes because of this). This is also irritating on prime difficulty, where two off screen jabs are all that’s needed to kick you back to the last checkpoint.\n\nAnd the last issue is a matter of the games length, my first play through took 10 hours on commander difficulty but if you aren’t willing to challenge yourself a normal play through can take 6 hours on average, for those who don’t intend to stick around after the campaign this would be a significant turn off but as with most platinum games, part of the fun is optimising your playstyle and taking on harder and harder challenges. I would also like to note that in good old blighty, I’ve seen 360 and ps3 versions of the game being sold for as cheap as £25, meaning if you don’t think Devastations content can justify the steam price there are possible cheaper alternatives, but don’t tell lord Gaben I said that, I hear they throw traitorous steam bots in a trash compactor.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the original gen 1 cartoon or platinum games or both, I would definitely recommend this game, at the time of writing this review I’ve gotten more than 30 hours out of this game and I haven’t regretted my purchase for one second. But if you’re not particularly interested in the franchise, the initial asking price may seem steep, so wait for a sale to pique your interest.","October 17, 2015","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recommend Transformers at a lower price point for those seeking nostalgia.\n\nThe most common complaint people seem to have for this game is that it's brief. Let me explain why that works to this game's favor. At 12 hours in, I've beaten the game three times and earned roughly 20% of the achievements. The game has a rich weapon crafting system that encourages you to farm items playing on harder difficulties and beating challenges. It looks gorgeous too. If I'm bored and I have two hours, I can replay this entire game to farm some sweet loot for the next time I'm bored.\n\nThe controls are also very tight. Parries work well for me, as long as I time them well, and I don't often find myself using attacks I don't want to. As usual, Platinum has done a great job creating a combat system that is responsive and flexible. Combos end in a vehicle smash, which can break shields and cause knockbacks. I would say that my vehicle smash attacks don't always hit the targets or direction I want, but hitting that extra button is too much fun. I'm glad they put it in the game, it's like they made a mini-game for combat.\n\nEach Autobot plays pretty differently, and weapons are (mostly) interchangable. The crafting system I mentioned earlier really offers power hunters a reason to replay, or to seek out the Challenges. You can also spend credits you acquire to upgrade your autobots and synthesize tech to buff them. If you consistently land on the gold tiles in synthesize, you'll be rewarded with some interesting and useful perks. It's worth a try cooling down between missions.\n\nNow for the downsides:\n\nThe story is basically just sorta there, but that might have been how that cartoon was. It's been a while for me, so I don't remember if plot structure and dramatic tension were really a thing with the cartoon. Most of you will be able to guess the outcome about midway through. That said, the lore tablets offer quite a bit of insight if you care to read them.\n\nIt is brief, so people who do not enjoy re-playing a game are probably not going to like the game at its original price point. This game offers a rich experience, but you have to want it. Still, as brief as it is, they managed to re-use backgrounds and maps somehow. I know, I'm shocked too.\n\nI heard a complaint somewhere that the game was repetitive. The structure of this game is the same as most other Platinum titles, so you'll fight some dudes, walk to a place, fight more dudes, activate a switch/solve some small puzzle, move to another place and then fight more dudes. Oh yeah, and then a boss bottle. Every level is basically this format to longer or shorter degrees. It's the combat that is supposed to sustain the game and entertain you. I'm not sure if this is a pro or con. For me, it's a pro.\n\nAnd the platforming in Chapter three or four can die in a fire.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nIf you're the type to replay a game for the purpose of mastering it, then Transformers is probably a game you'll love and should buy immediately.\nIf you're expecting an epic campaign, maybe try the earlier Transformer titles instead.\nThose here for the nostalgia should probably wait for a price drop, especially if you have never played a Platinum game before.","November 7, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a way I find it understandable since when Megatron was in gun mode he shrinks down to the size of a gun and needs to be fired by another Transformer. I find the tank form forgivable and gives Megatron an vehicle mode that makes him more interactive when fighting him.

If You are a kid of the 80's and loved Transformers G1 cartoon this is a must have. It's better than watching the cartoon... it's like living it. So much nostalgia. Remember when You were a kid and wanted to be Optimus Prime? This is it. Now You can! The game looks like the original cartoon, feels like G1 cartoon and also sounds like it. Transformations sound perfect and as they should sound. Not like pieces of junk cluncking together in Michael Bay films. I often catch myself transforming over and over again just to hear it :) Another plus - the original voices of Optimus and Megatron (Peter Cullen and Frank Welker are great in this). Not sure about the rest of Autobots but they also sound fine. This game is developed by Platinum Games. Need I say more? Fighting mechanics are great - combos, transforming between hits, good camera and overal control - all these thing are fine.

If you like OG Transformers, great action, and Platinum Games, this is definitely worth picking up.\n\nWhile I was never a big Transformers fan myself, those that were will appreciate the cast, returning voice actors (unfortunately, not all), and a plot practically straight out of their Saturday morning cartoons.\n\nFor the character action fans, this game feels great to get your hands on right away. For those less experienced, it might take some time to get used to. Fortunately for those less atuned, the Focus system (similar to Witch Time from Bayonetta) gives a nice reward during battle by slowing down time briefly.\n\nThere are a couple negatives, however.\nUnfortunately, like most character actions games, this game is quite short for a single playthrough. If you're not the kind of person who enjoys playing a game multiple times and ramping up the difficulty, it might be better for you to wait until the price drops.\nThere's also the fact that there's really only two environments in the game, the city and the Proudstar (a Cybertronian space ship). While they're both pretty large and the city is very open (the Proudstar is quite linear), some people may be turned off by the repetitive environments.\n\nAll in all, a great game but maybe a little over priced by Activision.","October 7, 2015","true","73.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has balanced aspects of melee and ranged weaponry. The vehicle mode is useful in combat and not just a gimic that has been tossed in. I've heard complaints about the game being short, but on hard mode it will stretch that out quite a bit; I even got the re-enact the Hot Rod vs Galvatron scene from the 1986 movie by ramming into Megatron then proceeded to get my ♥♥♥ handed to me for a day. If you do get stuck at a part, you don't have to grind too long to beef up your Autobot of choice. There is also a Dark Cloud-esque weapon crafting system.\n\nThe levels are mostly corridorish, but still have arena like areas. Its better than the series of mini-sandboxes from the first two Bayformers games. It's similar to Rise of the Dark Spark.\n\nThe combat feels challenging and rewarding; Arkham Assylum comes to mind. Even the base enemies know how to fight rather than waves of Zap Brannigans men charging at killbots.There are more mini-bosses than Ocarina of Time.\n\nFinal word: You don't have to hold down a button the entire time that you are in vehicle mode, and it doesn't have that vehicle strafing-on-shoppingcart-wheels mode from the last few Transformers games. It is much more melee focused with the option to fire off a few rounds of ammo while the enemy closes the distance on you.","October 11, 2015","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a way I find it understandable since when Megatron was in gun mode he shrinks down to the size of a gun and needs to be fired by another Transformer.

So overall 8.5/10. The fanboy bias would be 9/10 but a few things were missing on my first playthrough. Its a great game even if you dont know anything about Transformers.  Its a great game if you like boss fight after boss fight, and then you get to a big boss fight.  Its an awesome game if you like both. I played on the PC version obviously.\n\nThe fighting is fun.  the trick is to learn the tells and time the dodge to avoid the hit.  Then you get "focused." Time slows down and you can get a few more hits in.  You also get a bonus attack if you finish a combination.  You transform and hit them harder. You can play as one of 5 characters. They have slightly different stats, but the fighting rules still apply. So you can find the style you like.  I played mostly as sideswipe/red alert. On the first playthrough you start out as prime and then change characters and eventually unlock the other playable characters and your home base, the ARK. After that you can swap to the ones you like.\n\nWeapons and inventory:  You pick up your loot drops and you can have up to 200 items.  I didn't fill up my inventory on my first playthough. I was on "Warrior" mode.  Medium setting. The heal items and how to use them were not very clear.  Sometimes I would just get auto healed during a boss fight. There was something about a "sub menu" but i didnt know where it was.  I think the PC port was not fully looked over. There are some upgrades you can get wheeljack to craft for you, but the mini game where you press enter to stop a moving slider bar on a colored area seems random.  I just collected credits and then kept spending them on the upgrade chips until i got a few i liked.  Then put them on my favorite character.  That got me throught the game.  Im sure on later playthroughs, inventory management and upgrades will be more important.\n\nTroublesome parts: I didnt really know what i was getting from loot. Id kill something and sometimes i would AOE suck it up.  I would run out of ammo on my ranged weapons, then vacuum up some from somewhere,but not know i could use my guns again.  As i said the fighting is fun.  I was always looking at the enemy for the tell, and ready to dodge and counter.  So maybe i missed notification that i had reloaded my guns. As a result I played the game in mostly melee. Swords dont need ammo. Also the *tap B " for grimlock didnt seem to do anything. I played grimlock during the top view mission.  I dont know if the PC version is just bugged.  maybe a console based tool tip that made it to the PC port.\n\nFanboy spoiler stuff; SEQUEL!!! they have built a good system.  It maybe just new models on an existing system but it works.  7 Chapters, was a long enough story.  DLC more chapters?  The Wheeljack Optimus with the diagram of his Energon combiner form Prime force. Plus Defensor and Superion at the end.  No Jazz, Hound, Mirage, Ironhide, or Ratchet, but... that leave them avaiable for DLC or the sequel.  I just hope they move away and stay away from the nonsense of the live action movies.   Finally, No humans were harmed in the making of this game.  There are no humans in the game. All Robots babycakes!","October 9, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I honestly felt like I was playing an episode of The Transformers. My only complaint they made Megatron a Tank like the G2 Transformers but atleast they kept the color scheme from the original TV series. In a way I find it understandable since when Megatron was in gun mode he shrinks down to the size of a gun and needs to be fired by another Transformer. I find the tank form forgivable and gives Megatron an vehicle mode that makes him more interactive when fighting him.

I really like the cut scenes and the use of the original voice actors. Sure, they're 30 years older than they were when G1 came out, but so are you! The constructicons are particularly bad-♥♥♥.\nI'm only through chapter one, but so far I really like the challenge (I have it set on the second hardest setting). Wouldn't it be great to see another Transformers game like this, one that includes locations and characters from the original movie? Hot-Rod, Galvatron, Ultra Magnus, Unicron...\nDevastation looks great. It runs extremely smooth on my Geforce 960 and the way the game renders the larger transformers and objects is awesome. I also dig the music - fast-paced metal with ripping guitars, which fits perfectly.

I recommend Transformers at a lower price point for those seeking nostalgia.\n\nThe most common complaint people seem to have for this game is that it's brief. Let me explain why that works to this game's favor. At 12 hours in, I've beaten the game three times and earned roughly 20% of the achievements. The game has a rich weapon crafting system that encourages you to farm items playing on harder difficulties and beating challenges. It looks gorgeous too. If I'm bored and I have two hours, I can replay this entire game to farm some sweet loot for the next time I'm bored.\n\nThe controls are also very tight. Parries work well for me, as long as I time them well, and I don't often find myself using attacks I don't want to. As usual, Platinum has done a great job creating a combat system that is responsive and flexible. Combos end in a vehicle smash, which can break shields and cause knockbacks. I would say that my vehicle smash attacks don't always hit the targets or direction I want, but hitting that extra button is too much fun. I'm glad they put it in the game, it's like they made a mini-game for combat.\n\nEach Autobot plays pretty differently, and weapons are (mostly) interchangable. The crafting system I mentioned earlier really offers power hunters a reason to replay, or to seek out the Challenges. You can also spend credits you acquire to upgrade your autobots and synthesize tech to buff them. If you consistently land on the gold tiles in synthesize, you'll be rewarded with some interesting and useful perks. It's worth a try cooling down between missions.\n\nNow for the downsides:\n\nThe story is basically just sorta there, but that might have been how that cartoon was. It's been a while for me, so I don't remember if plot structure and dramatic tension were really a thing with the cartoon. Most of you will be able to guess the outcome about midway through. That said, the lore tablets offer quite a bit of insight if you care to read them.\n\nIt is brief, so people who do not enjoy re-playing a game are probably not going to like the game at its original price point. This game offers a rich experience, but you have to want it. Still, as brief as it is, they managed to re-use backgrounds and maps somehow. I know, I'm shocked too.\n\nI heard a complaint somewhere that the game was repetitive. The structure of this game is the same as most other Platinum titles, so you'll fight some dudes, walk to a place, fight more dudes, activate a switch/solve some small puzzle, move to another place and then fight more dudes. Oh yeah, and then a boss bottle. Every level is basically this format to longer or shorter degrees. It's the combat that is supposed to sustain the game and entertain you. I'm not sure if this is a pro or con. For me, it's a pro.\n\nAnd the platforming in Chapter three or four can die in a fire.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nIf you're the type to replay a game for the purpose of mastering it, then Transformers is probably a game you'll love and should buy immediately.\nIf you're expecting an epic campaign, maybe try the earlier Transformer titles instead.\nThose here for the nostalgia should probably wait for a price drop, especially if you have never played a Platinum game before.","November 7, 2015","true","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's less so in some chapters, but at that point the story is in full swing.\n\nPut on top of that the challenges and gathering of loot (something that I think I've not really seen in a character action game before), you can keep coming back well after going through the story the first time around.\n\nHighly recommended.","November 7, 2015","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When Activision announced that Platinum was developing it, it made sense to be wary, especially after the last time they made a character-action game based on a licensed property. However, Transformers: Devastation certainly has a lot of great things going for it, which are listed below:\nPROS\n-Multiple playable characters (and so many weapons to boot)\n-Quite a few G1 voice actors come back (It's a lot like Ducktales Remastered in that way)\n-Cel-shaded artstyle (seriously, why has it taken this long to make a Transformers game like this?)\n-It's actually a mix of various G1 things (The cartoon, the toys, even the IDW comics)\n-Challenge mode\n-Multiple difficulties and level-up system ensure replayability, along with the character variety\n-Hidden secrets and easter eggs (They remenbered Kremzeek!)\n\nWith all that said, it's not perfect. There are quite a few glaring problems with the game:\nCONS\n-Autobots are only playable (A tad petty, but still...)\n-200-weapon limit\n-Story mode is WAAAAAAAY too short (I was hoping in vain that there would be a surprise last boss after the credits)\n-Some of the playable character choices are a bit weird (They play fine, but I don't know what Bumblebee is doing here when he's not in the Combiner Wars toyline)\n\nIt's still a great game, one of Platinum's finest; as long as fans know what they're expecting, they should be fine. Speaking of which, the only way I can recommend it is to hardcore Transformers fans, hardcore Platinum fans, or softer-core fans of either or both when the price is dropped. Bayonetta and Revengeance are more polished, but this is good for a few hours of mindless fun, taking a trip down memory lane, or remembering that there are good things about the Transformers brand (Bayformers and Kiss Players can't bring me down when I've got something like this!).","October 11, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other than that, this is how Transformers should be, and I'm glad that this isn't a Bayformers product.  Or refers to the manga where Starscream becomes a Japanese schoolgirl.\n\nThe upgrade system is alright, though you'll be cursing the RNG to get good tech upgrades.  At least you can transfer modifiers to weapons when you combine them, as long as enough slots are open.  Most of the weapons are fine, but don't expect to hit anything with hammers or hyperhammers at the start as they're extremely slow to the point where the throw away enemies can avoid them.  The ammo on the rangted weapons is very limited as well, meaning you'll be in melee most of the time.","December 26, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game begins as Optimus Prime and his Autobots rush to the city where Megatron and his Decepticons are again causing havoc. G1 anime classic setup in other words, though the character models are more based off of the current Transformers Combiner Wars/Unite line and not all original voice actors are present. The city is where you'll spend a large part of the game, even as its being cyberformed into an environment for Cybertronian life. Nothing wrong with that, but sadly enough it is somewhat bland and feels more like a model made with wooden blocks than a city where humans are supposed to dwell.  That's not to say that there are no nice spots at all, the overall is just underwhelming.\n\nSo, is combat better? Somewhat, it is very satisfying to take down bosses and the intro fights for the newest 'regular baddies' are not that bad either. But you have to face them countless times and there's VERY LITTLE variation in the regular foes. Beyond that, there's the fact that gravity is completely optional in this game. It feels like you are battling as the Balloonbots against the Blimpcons. You get more airtime than Michael Jordan on spacecake tbh.\nAlso, concerning boss battles, Its awesome to fight Devastator and Menasor, but you fight them too often and of the individual Stunticons you only face Motor Master. The final boss also leaves a lot to be desired. The others though are definitely awesome.\n\nSo... Did they get the characters right? Though they are a bit older, Frank Welker and Peter Cullen do their utmost best and they do spark that G1 feel that skyrocketed the franchise in the '80's. Not all is well though. Bumblebee feels more like his Transformers Animated counterpart, though the voice is a-okay. Starscream though... Okay, Chris Latta's obviously not available as he died years ago, but the current VA has no feel for the character. Starscream behaves far more like a mix of Beast Wars Waspinator and Animated Wasp in any case than the G1 character everyone loves to hate. Thundercracker and Skywarp get less lines, but they at least feel a bit more in tune. *sighs* I do hate to bring the next bit up, but why did they not ask Corey Burton to reprise Shockwave? Yeah it's just one boss battle and associated scenes, but still. The current VA sounds constipated at best.\n\nMy single biggest complaint though has to be about Grimlock. In a word, he's not the G1 badass, but the season 3 clown in terms of dialogue and the most NERFED character available. I'm serious, he has trouble munching spongecake, nevermind metal. You feel as if BUMBLEBEE is a superior combatant. And this for the leader of the Dinobots, one of the few characters in G1 who could take on Optimus Prime and Megatron as an equal in combat.\n\nSo... Buy or not buy? If you like Transformers  G1, yes you would like it enough to buy it. If you like 3d Brawlers, yes as well. If you're not over the moon for either though... Tough call, best bet is to wait for a sale in that case. This game is not perfect and it does hinge somewhat on the gamer being a TF fan.","December 25, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is something you could expect from the cartoon, but hey, it keeps up the game and the original voice actors are back to their roles.\n\nThe only negative I can say are:\n*No Decepticon campaign. With previous TF games had a Decepticon campaign, so why not here? I am sure people would like to play as Megatron or Soundwave.\n\n*Very short. The campaign is short and the best you can do after beating it is replaying them with each different Autobot each playthrough. Then, there are some challenges you can unlock, but nobdoy likes them.\n\n*No Stan Bush. I consider a big crime for any TF game not to have Stan Bush. The music it has it's great and all, but it misses Stan Bush and "You'v got the Touch".\n\nOverall, it's a great game, but buy it at a better price.","January 23","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't get me wrong I think  it's the best Transformers video game ever made, which makes it that more painful to see how it is being handled by Platinum games and Activision.   Where are these people?  there are NO updates, NO fixes, NO customer service either from Activision or Platinum games. This game has been poorly ported and abandonned.\n\nMy biggest issue is that the resolution options are terrible, in my case it is impossible to run in 1440p.\n\nI admit the gameplay is really fun, if you play on a Full HD or lower resolution monitor, sure go ahead and enjoy the game: the action is great, fast-paced and addictive. But if you are a PC enthusiast playing on a QHD monitor, like me, this game might feel like the most frustrating one ever as you will not be able to run it in your native resolution. I've tried everything and found no reliable method to run this title properly on my system.\n\nMy review is negative simply because I can't accept this behavior of studios releasing a title and not caring for it in the least afterwards. I would switch to a positive one if they ever released a patch that fixes the graphics settings but I'm not getting my hopes up. The studio just seems to care about consoles and Activision doesn't give a rat's ♥♥♥. 1080p on a native QHD monitor looks awful, a AAA game not supporting higher resolutions in 2016 is unacceptable.\n\nI would rather  recommend the console version, this port is just  not as good as it deserved to be.","January 20","false","15.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're all in, so you can't stay still for long, and you have to watch your back. However, there are times where your character gets lost in a maelstrom of explosions and metal bodies. Also the arenas are a bit cramped and should be bigger.\n\nThe weapon upgrade system is tedious, and the tech development felt a bit pointless too. Even if your timing is good you have no control over the attributes of the tech you make, and I found myself making many that I didn't want to use.\n\nThe campaign story is weak, and traversing from one area to another is boring, but I found the arena style battles and boss battles to be really, really fun. You really have to mix up ranged weapons, melee weapons and vehicle attacks to go the distance. Due to his vehicle speed, I found Sideswipe the most fun to use.\n\nI felt the campaign isn't worth more than one playthrough, but I was surprised how fun a lot of the challenges have been. most of them are just arenas with a few waves to fight off, but they just have this arcade-y beat-em up feel that is really fun.\n\nThe voice acting is GREAT and the graphics and art style make the perfect Generation 1 atmosphere. Even the modernized soundtrack fits really well.\n\nIf you like slow paced games or stories you won't like this game. If you like beat-em ups or Transformers, I recommend.","May 17","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
