I am a veteran of Iraq and I remember all too well the hardships it brought upon the civilians, especially in the beginning of the war. I remember being heartbroken at the sight of children crying and begging for food on the side of the road.\n\nThis "game" puts you square in the middle of the experiences of those civilians. It is a brutal, kill or be killed world - where an act of unimaginable violence may let you live another day, but it can also break your heart and soul. Some days, you are offered a chance at compassion - and if you take that chance, risking your own safety and resources for others, you may find you feel a bit better about yourself.\n\nThen there are the times where you are stuck between a rock and a hard place. You are unarmed, scavenging for anything to save your friends, and you peep through a keyhole and see a soldier brutally beating - and possible worse - a woman. He has an AK-47, you have a lockpick and a rumbling stomach. So you sit there and watch - afraid that any noise may turn his violent attention upon you. When it is all done, you hide until he leaves and then, shamefully, pick over the bloodied body of the woman for anything she may have scavenged before the soldier got to her.\n\nThis is "This War of Mine" - a dark, beautiful, haunting, exhilerating, and horrible tale.\n\nWhat's that tagline, "The first casualty of war is innocence"? It applies here - in a way you would have never imagined coming from a computer game.","November 20, 2014","true","328.0"," 4,574 of 4,702 people (97%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","97","574","4","83","83"

It was recommended to me by a close friend because, me being a former war refugee from the Balkans, he thought I might find the content "a bit familiar." It went a bit further than that, in fact it kind turned out to be some uncanny early-childhood simulator for me. I still remember the visceral terror of being a child in that war; I will never forget howling and begging my mother not to go outside to buy bread, out of fear that she would be shot dead by a sniper. Asking why my grandmother couldn't go instead.\n\nThis game captures moments like that with a masterful hand. It is never heavy or hamfisted. I can't explain how well the developers have encapsulated the hoplessness and the mundane brutality of the Balkan civil war, and it leads me to think that at least one key person involved in the development of this game had to have lived through it, too. The tone is just perfect, striking that difficult balance between terror and absurdity, and reminds me of all the films I love that came out of Former Yugoslavia after the war. This is not Angelina Jolie painting Balkan politics with a broad brush dipped in ignorance and a skewed western perspective insensitive of nuance--this is an authentic work of art that is sensitive to the complexities of its subject matter and the individual stories of the thousands of people whose lives were shaped and altered forever by this horrible, unnecessary war.\n\nIt's an emotional playthrough, even for people who haven't had any experience with the historical event. It is a "war game" like no other and I can't recommend it enough. Take it from someone who was there.","October 27, 2015","true","9.7"," 2,088 of 2,148 people (97%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","97","088","2","78","27"

It shows war from a citizen perspective. We start surviving with 3 or 4 chosen characters (first we have only one group and we unlock next people by surviving next days). Players group lives in destroyed house. They have to seek any food or medicaments in their house, but this source ends very fast. So what to do?       We have to steal everything we need to survive. Sure, there are abandon houses, but almost nothing is there. We start hiding in shadows, and preying to noone spot us. And now is very hard choice: what about killing. I played two times (now i was playing the second one). First time, i got into pensioners house. They saw me and came to me. My friends were starving. I had no choice. I attacked the man with fists. Two strikes in head and he died. Woman ran to the toillet and locked in there. I took food and left the house. I remember this moment all the time. In "This War of Mine" there is lot of choices. Is better killing to get food or starving? It' s a good game, I enjoy it, but it' s hard and... very sad. Buy it, but don't think it will be funny. Sure, I play CoDs and CS, but it changed my observance of war.

Three weeks since I last saw any members of my family; two since my last hot meal; one since Katia was gunned down scavenging for food and medicine. Bruno hasn't fared well. The illness is no longer confined to his body – now his soul is sick, broken. The snows have come, and we're feeding the heater every day now... I wept when we burned our only two books. Bruno scoffed. “They're children's books,” he muttered from his sick bed. “It's not as if we read them.” He didn't bother asking whose books they had been.\n\nDay 25: I scavenged last night. We're both starving. I remembered a house, untouched by the violence. I had come weeks earlier in the hopes of getting supplies only to find it occupied by an old couple... living as they had before war came. They reminded me of my grandparents, and I left. Katia and Bruno had not been happy, and we did not eat that night. I returned this evening in the hopes that they had fled... or worse, shamefully. But they had not. The old man struggled, wouldn't let me steal his wife's medicine. I tried to tell the proud ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I only needed a little, for my friend. I struck him and he hit the floor hard, unmoving. His wife screamed. “Why have you done this?” I am not sure if this was directed at me or God. What little food was left in my stomach came up, and I fled with what little I could carry. We'll eat tonight, and Bruno will have medicine.\n\nDay 27: Bruno passed sometime during the night. He looks at peace. It is better this way, I suppose. I shall join him. Hana, Emira, Lejla – I shall see you all soon.\n\nThis War of Mine is an indie title set in an unspecified city that's been besieged. You and a random set of survivors brought together by chance stumble upon a bombed-out building. You control these characters by clicking on them or their photographs (which also provides a daily bio) and clicking on an interactive prompt. It is at this point that every game of This War of Mine will diverge. As you walk around your new home, shifting rubble and unlocking armoires, you'll find supplies: lumber, food, medicine, and all important components. Components (and lumber) are your primary building tools in the beginning, with which you can craft beds and chairs. These may seem luxurious in a time of war, but creature comforts help keep morale up. Advanced items, such as machine parts and electronics, will allow you to construct a metalwork, stove, heater, radio, and oven. But you'll never have enough for several of these items – not in a single day.\n\nIt's up to you to decide what should come first. Do you build beds, so everyone can have a good night's sleep? Sure, you can sleep on the floor – but it's not as good as a warm bed. Do you eat cans and raw food, which are not very filling or comforting, or do you build a stove to make hot meals? Do you construct a weapon with which to defend yourself, or do you choose to build a herbal crafting station or moonshine still, which are great for future bartering?\n\nYou'll busy yourself during the days with these tasks, and how to divvy them up. Some characters might be sick or slightly wounded, and keeping them in bed all day can help with recovery. But someone is going to have to craft and dig through rubble. When day turns to night (8 PM), you'll have further decisions to make. In the bombed-out city there are sites – villas, apartments, houses, hospitals – with potential supplies, some more promising than others. Each carries with them the risk of human habitation. Some people are willing to barter uneasily, while others are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ deserters from the army. Pillaging an empty building has no repercussions, but robbing people is generally frowned upon, and justice is swift and cruel. Worse still, there are looters who may just shoot on sight.\n\nSo, who will go? Sending your fastest runner means they'll have a better shot at outrunning would-be murderers. Send your best scavenger and you'll have more room to carry supplies. Send your best trader/negotiator and they may be able to strike a deal. But if any of these characters are sick, wounded, tired, or feeling blue, they'll have a tougher go of it. Worse still, you're not exactly living in a fortress. There's a risk each night of looters coming to take what little you have. Some players will choose to use precious lumber to board up holes, others will craft knives and shovels, putting one or more characters on guard duty during the night. Others still will be forced to let everyone sleep, if exhaustion and illness are setting in, and you can't have your wounded staying up all night, guarding; they'll never heal. These raids can range from desperate scavengers that will flee from a single guard, to well-armed bandits that will wound or kill anyone in their way.\n\nYou'll have to survive for a long time, upwards of forty days. And it's no easy task. Each playthrough will give you different survivors, different weather patterns, and different challenges when scavenging. It's fun and highly replayable, but the subject matter is heavy enough that you won't likely spend more than a dozen hours with this title.\n\nThis War of Mine is a macabre juggling game, and just when you think you've found your rhythm, the weather or a sniper hits you like a greased up chainsaw. You will never find yourself thriving, just scraping by. And when supplies are low and days turn to weeks, you'll have to make some tough choices. The opening scenario I described is one that can happen in your game. You may decide to help neighbors initially; sending a survivor off to board up a woman's home while her husband is away, feeding an isolated artist, or helping the victim of a sniper attack. But your heart will turn to stone in time as living becomes a prolonged struggle. That old couple? They're no longer off limits. The hospital? They're wounded, dying – my people need this more than they do. And that is what This War of Mine does most effectively. It shows you the cost of war – body, mind, and soul. I've read plenty of great anti-war novels, seen plenty of great anti-war films. This War of Mine joins Spec Ops: The Line in a growing, prestigious genre of anti-war games. It speaks for the most silent, unrepresented victims of war unflinchingly, sincerely. It reveals the cost of war; not with the over-the-top set pieces and faceless macho protagonists, but with quiet moments.\n\nNear the end of my first playthrough, day 25, I had two survivors left from our original four. One had fled in the night; the other succumbed to a lethal injury. One survivor was utterly broken, rocking upstairs, muttering to himself. I sent my other depressed, ill survivor to comfort him, to rouse him from his depressed state. She sat and comforted him for an hour, and it gave him a little hope. But I knew it was all for naught. They were going to die, inevitably. We had no food. We had no medicine. So why? Why bother comforting him? Why not reset the game? I couldn't. I couldn't leave their story unfinished, untold. They both slept in beds that night, and both passed in the morning. The night had been calm, perhaps the calmest night since day one.","November 18, 2014","true","5.4"," 1,409 of 1,497 people (94%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","94","409","1","21","52"

Most survival games I've played are either pretty forgiving, or shallow in character.\n\nThis one is neither. In the beginning of my hours I was hopeful and treated others I met with the same kidness I normally would, as the going was good. I shared my supplies, and took in others that needed shelter. Food was used daily and luxuries were built.\n\n36 days later (and still going) the survivors that are left are battered men; hungry, sick and tired. We've had to kill to survive, even innocent people, because the only other option was our own death. We have stolen and traded our way through the cold-snap, and the outlook is grim.\n\nAll that matters now is lasting the few days until outside aid arrives. But in the end, will that really matter? We're not the same people we started as, and the atrocities we've commited are ones we have to live with forever.\n\n\nI highly reccomend this game, but be warned: Your decisions WILL have severe consequences, you WILL hate yourself for the evils you have done, necissary as they may feel. You will learn to know the survivors, what things they find acceptable, who can talk to whom best. Most of all you will think "Maybe next run, I can do things differently..". I know I am at this point, as it looks like my first run will end in failure and misery.\n\n10/10, am now broken, tired and hungry IRL. Soundtrack matches the atmosphere, graphics are a little jarring at first but become normal after a little bit. Gameplay is solid and needs very little introduction, and you will want to think your decisions through a few times...

I've played a few hours of this game, but decided that I would share my most recent experience, in which I ended up dying trying to save a young girl from getting ♥♥♥♥♥...:\n\nIt was the third day of this living hell. I was staying with an old highschool friend who I just happened to run into after the city went to ♥♥♥♥. After scavanging an old abandoned house the first two days and gathering gathering us enough food for the next few nights, I decided to head to the supermarket under the cover of dark. I creeped in through the entrance and heard the faint sound of shifting rubble behind a closed door. I slowly approached the door, being very careful not to make much noice. As I got down on one knee and peeked through the keyhole, my heart jumped. Not two feet ahead was a large, military-clad man weilding an ak-47 assault rifle. In front of him a young girl was sifting through some rubble, and mumbling about food.\n\n"What is that you're looking for, sweetheart?" the man asked.\n\n"Please... food. I need food"\n\n"Hey, I've got food. All the food you need. Maybe I can trade you some for a favor?"\n\n"I... I... don't think so"\n\n"We can dine together, then have some fun"\n\n"I... better be going home now"\n\nAs she begins to walk away, he runs up behind her yelling "get back here ♥♥♥♥♥!" and smacks her across the face with the butt of his rifle, knocking her to the ground.\n\n"Get up now! Or I will shoot you!"\n\nWimpering, she crawls to her feet and he escorts her out the back of the supermarket with the rifle in her back. After making sure the coast was clear, I carefully opened the door, and proceeded to loot the main store isle for any food and supplies I could find. After filling my backpack to its full capacity, I began my walk back towards the entrance when I heard loud crying coming from the back of the store. Being a curious fellow, I decided to investigate. Outside the back of the store, there is a small shed with a large sheet metal door. I press my ears up to the large door, and I can hear lots of shuffling and crying. My heart sinks as I realize what's happening. This poor girl is about to get ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI had to make a decision at this point. Do I leave with my supplies and live another day, or do I attempt to liberate this young woman? Without skipping a beat, I drew my crowbar and began prying open the sheet metal door. Finally, after what felt like forever, the door gave way and I finally saw what was unfolding.\n\nMaking eye contact with me, the girl screams "Please! Help me!"\n\nTo which the man immediatly turns and sprays my chest full of lead.\n\nAs I lie dying, gasping my final breaths, I see the girl climb up onto some broken carts and jump over the fence. She had escaped.

Each of your civilians has different backgrounds, inventory space and a main skill for example good cook or skilled scavenger. Your first objective is to scavenge through the house and find materials so you can build basic equipment like a cooker for food, beds, heater and other essentials.\n\nThe aim of the game is to get your group of civilians to survive through the war or if they all die the game will end. Each time you play the game you are assigned a random group of characters. Not only is this random but the length of the play-through is random, sometimes the war can last 30 days other times it can last months like in real life the length of a war is never certain. Both the location on the map and the things you find there are randomly generated too, which ensures replay-ability so each play-through you have will differ in some way.\n\nGraphically the game is fantastic, the way the art direction has been done is very well thought out. The game is a grim one and its reflecting in its dark color palate. The game looks like it has been done with a charcoal scheme and then they've added a pencil shaded overlay which blurs the lines between computer generated graphics and hand drawn art. Sound effects are top notch everything from bombs going off in the background to the opening of doors. The soundtrack to the game is wondrous providing great atmosphere and emotion in the background as you play.\n\nThe controls are fairly simplistic and nearly everything simply requires a mouse click. Once a character is selected you can use the left mouse button move them or interact with an object. Clicking with the right mouse button has the same effect but makes the character run instead of walk so keep your fingers nimble as you never know when you might need to get away quickly.\n\nThe game works from off a day and night cycle. Its too dangerous to venture out in the war torn city during the day. The day is used for keeping your civilians needs met like feeding them, making sure those who were up all night guarding or scavenging get some sleep and of course treating the sick and wounded. The day is the only time you can make equipment and build items.\n\nIn terms of crafting you automatically start off with a basic workshop in your base from which you can build basic things you need to survive such as a heater, beds, water collectors etc. You can also build other more specialized workshops such as the metal workshop which you can use and upgrade to craft weapons, ammo and armor. All these workshops can be upgraded so you can gain access to more items to craft such as upgrading the herbal station will eventually allow you to craft your own medicine and bandages.\n\nEverything costs something in the game after all its all about survival. Crafting items will cost you parts and materials which you will have to gather or trade for. But before you even consider crafting more complex items or even basic ones you first need to see to the needs of your group. Each member will need food and this can be done in various ways. First should you come across raw uncooked food and vegetables you can cook these at a cooker to create meals you'll also need water and fuel. You can also eat vegetables and such without cooking them but it does not satisfy hunger like a proper meal. You also have canned food which is usually pretty rare to find and very valuable, just one canned food counts as a complete meal and can be a life saver if your low on other food supplies.\n\nOnce night comes along its time to decide what you want to do with your people. The night, like the day is dangerous but its safe enough to try and scavenge for food and resources. When the night comes you'll enter the city map screen. This is where you can assign who does what for the night be it guarding the shelter from looters, sleeping and of course assigning someone to go out scavenging.\n\nTruthfully scavenging is where the game comes alive. The locations you can scavenge vary and more are added as your progress. You can visit everything from houses, schools and hospitals to supermarkets, military outposts and more. Moving your cursor over a location will tell you what you can expect in that location, not only does it give you an idea of what supplies can be found there but it will also tell you if there have been reports of people inside and if there's possible danger.\n\nOnce your selected character is at a scavenging location they will automatically be in scavenging mode which includes the sneak stance. It's often best to try and get what you need quickly and quietly as drawing unwanted attention can have lethal consequences. So you scour the location you will come across various obstacles like mounds of rubble, locked doors or even grates and bars. With the right tools which you can craft at your home base you can overcome these problems however tools are either one use like lock-picks or have limited durability like the shovel.\n\nYou will be able to scavenge the same location more than once after all you won't be able to fit an entire locations resources into your little backpack. This is helpful as it means you know the lay of the land when returning to a previous location but don't get complacent, just because the location was void of life the first time doesn't mean other scavengers or worse won't be there upon your return.\n\nWhile out in the city you will come across all manners of people who are just like you and trying to get through. Inevitably you may come across individuals who will want to do you harm, this may be some looters, raiders or soldiers. Dealing with hostiles very much depends on the situation, factors include how well armed you are, how armed they are and how many enemies your facing. Often sneaking past or making a run for it will ensure survival but you may find yourself having to fight. Sounds from rooms you have no line of sight in can be heard and seen with a red circle appearing. If you hear footsteps, it could be an armed soldier or just a scurrying rat, you never know until you look.\n\nI certainly feel that the games vision has been achieved. As a video game it hits all the right marks, solid mechanics, great art and sound but what tops it for me is the events and it's sandbox nature. Not only are you creating your own story as you go through but it's a deeply meaningful one. The game has both feel good experiences and experiences that make you sick to your stomach. Through the characters, events and game play a powerful message is sent to you as the player. I grew attached to every character I had in my party and the people I met. The whole game was a gripping experience that left me as a gamer wanting more but as a human being truly distraught at the realities of civilian life in a war torn city. For all these reasons and more This War Of Mine has easily become one of my favorite games of the year and is probably my indie game of the year by leaps and bounds.

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:'This War of Mine' is a side-scrolling survival game developed and self-published by 11 bit studios back in 2014. The game's overall theme is based on a war-torn city with player activity focused on civilian survival through scavenging, trading, crafting and resource management rather than direct military action.\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers):The game places you in control of three starting survivors in one of the default scenarios with more  joining as the story progresses. The game starts by scavenging and fortifying a derelict house which will act as the player's base of operations. During the day the player can construct basic survival necessities such as beds, food production facilities and water collecting devices and at night, the player can elect to send a member of the team to scavenge for supplies or trade with known traders in the area. Survive the harsh conditions, defend against bandit attacks, scavenge supplies and keep your survivors sane and healthy until the peacekeepers arrive to resolve the conflict and put an end to the war.\n\nPROS:+ Great art style that blends well with the theme\n+ Challenging survival game mechanics but...(see CON #1)\n+ Refreshing new theme for a survival game (by that I mean, no zombies, monsters or ghosts)\n+ Adequate base upgrade and item crafting mechanic (although I wish there were more items to craft)\n+ Good resource management mechanic\n+ Random events that add replayability but...(see CON #2)\n+ Good survivor skill variety but... (see NEUTRAL #1)\n+ Morality and state of mind system\n+ Good scavenging and combat mechanic that works well with the side-scrolling system\n+ Atmospheric with good sound effects and lighting\n\nCONS:- The challenge wears out after you get past the learning curve (which is not that steep)\n- The game becomes repetitive after a few playthroughs...dare I say, tedious at some points\n- No speed up time (only an option to end the day and start the night game)\n- Limited construction space in each room of your base\n- Some of the game mechanics are highly exploitable\n\nNEUTRAL:+/- Limited survivor customization\n+/- Autosave is too far in between\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT SURVIVAL GAME. This War of Mine is essentially for people looking for an authentic but not too realistic survival experience since it has the basic elements of a survival game while at the same time having the resource management mechanics of simulation title.\n\nIS IT WORTH IT?:I can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price so if you see it on a sale, then it's a no-brainer. It's a good game to experience and provides a good amount of enjoyable game time for its price.\nThe game's system requirement is not that heavy and can be played even on lower-end desktops or non-gaming laptops but to be safe, make sure to check it out.\n\nThe game key was given by the developer for review purposes.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike our Reviews?

It was my first playthrough, and I thought "stealing" stuff was maybe like it was in Fallout or Skyrim. If someone sees me do it, they get hostile, and I kill them. Shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nI was skulking around when I was spotted by a guy who yelled at me to get out. He had a gun, so I thought he was a bad guy. I blew him away with my shotgun. I started to loot his corpse when when voices started shouting upstairs. I quickly hid and waited for the ambush, but what came around the corner weren't more armed guards. No, it was much worse. It was his parents.\n\nThey were wailing about their lost son and how they couldn't survive without him. I couldn't speak to them. I wanted so badly to tell them that they could come back to our place, that I had killed him accidentally, something, anything. I walked out without taking what little they had left, in fact leaving my shotgun and rounds in their refrigerator to help them, hoping that maybe I didn't doom them entirely, but what was the point of survival for them anymore? Why would they want to survive in a world without their son who laid his life on the line for their safety?\n\nI never went back there. I was probably as affected as Marko was. He was depressed. I had to atone. I ran to the City Hospital to donate as much of our medical supplies as we could spare. I risked my life to free prisoners held by armed thugs. Night after night, in my attempt to atone, I tried to do as much good as I possibly could manage, if only to mitigate the incredible horror I had performed. We all survived, and I never went back to their apartment. I couldn't face them again.

Pavle, the ex-footballer. Katia, the journalist. And Bruno, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ professional chef. They came together during the siege purely by chance, and used their collective skills to improve their survival chances. Over the next 2 weeks they struggled to stay fed. Always low on supplies, and usually having one or more go hungry each day. Then Marko arrived, seeking shelter. The survivors knew they would struggle to support a 4th person, but welcomed him anyways. Marko then proved his worth after bringing home more food and medicine in one night than Pavle had managed in a week. Then he managed to bring home enough supplies to build some more furniture, and a radio. He helped the group not only survive, but flourish. He even at one point rescued a girl under the assault of a drunken soldier, earning him the status of "hero" amongst the people of Pogoren. Then one night he went scavenging in a dangerous area, known to be inhabited by brutal bandits. He had done this many times before, and felt safe enough to travel indoors. While searching through a cabinet, he was spotted. While he managed to kill 2 of the bandits, the remaineder proved to be too much for him. The group was devastated by his death. They never really recovered. A little over 2 weeks later, the siege had been lifted. The group had survived, and all went back to try to pick up where they left off before the war.\n\n\nExcept for one. Whose body silently lies in a shallow, unmarked grave.\n\n\nRIP Marko.

It shows everything in a different angle... it deals with the normal citizen and how war can affect und brutally change their life. You have to question yourself...how far would you go to survive? My group was starving in my first game, one was ill and another one wounded. I decided to raid some obviously empty houses at night due to my misery, but the house wasn't empty. There lived a old couple. The old man told me that his wife was ill and I should leave. He didn't want to help me or at least trade with me, but I couldn't leave, because otherwise it would have been the death of me and my party. I started to explore the house while the old man was begging me to not hurt anyone. I found a huge amount of food and medical equipment, more than the couple would need in a long time. I took some food to survive two more days and only the really needed medical stuff to get well soon. Everything else remained untouched, so they could easily live on too and I moved on with a bad feeling. In the same night I got raided myself. Karma. During the next day I had some visitors, friendly neighbors. They gifted me some vegetables and didn't want anything in return. Karma, I regretted my nightly activity even more. This was just one tricky and remarkable situation out of many.\n\nA day in 'The War of Mine' is split into two parts, the day and night time. During day time you're in your house and you have time to work on new and helpful stuff for your party, manage the needs of your people and from time to time you will get some visitors. Before the night starts you'll have to choose, if you want to go on raid or completely stay at home, which person is allowed to sleep and which one(s) should guard the house. After you've made your decision you'll either start your raid (with time limit) or directly switch to the next day. This system works pretty well. How many days you have to play to finish the game can vary. (45 days in my first game)\n\nThanks to some randomization it's worth it to start another round. I'm currently in my second playthrough and it's still interesting and the game came up with different and new situations, which I haven't experienced in my first game. Great!\n\n\nPro:\nvery good, interesting and unique game topic/setting\ngreat atmosphere\ngreat survival feeling\ngood art style\ndark, sad, melancholic and overall fitting OST\ninteresting and very different characters with own stories\nsome characters have addictions (take care of it ... or not)\ntough moral decisions which are completely up to you\nyou're often pushed to limits how to handle things (especially if you're starving, sick or wounded)\nyour actions can affect various situations and people will react to it\nkeep building offers various different ways to handle and specialize your 'production'\nrandom generated world/loot and different starting parties\nenvironment and item prices will change from time to time\ngood replay value (my first playthrough was about 10-11 hours)\nno bugs, crashes or glitches in my play time\n\nContra:\nyour keep always looks the same and only the starting loot and some furniture are randomized\nthe 'end' can come kinda suddenly, if you have no radio (you finish the last day and boom...end)\ncombat can be a bit awkward and random sometimes\nunexplained character skills (some are self-explanatory, some not)\nyou can only raid with one person at night\n\nConclusion:\nPure quality! The devs have successfully turned a very interesting, but difficult topic into a great survival game with loads of moral aspects. It made me question my actions and behavior several times and even as a good and helpful person there were decisions I'm not very proud of, but sometimes things need to be done to survive in a cruel world. Hands down, 'This War of Mine' is one of the best gaming experiences I had in this year. Absolutely recommendable!\n\n\n9/10\n\n----------------------\n~ Do you want to add something to the review or do you want to share your opinion?

I didn't answer him.  He got more worried after each item I would pick up or opening his refrigerator.

I found him huddled and sobbing.  I brought my shovel down on him, he cried out for help and ran to a locked door.

War is about actual real people dying, whether they're soldiers or not, and this game makes a good job of portraying it.\n\nIt could be longer, it could be deeper, but as it is it's a good game and well worth the price, if only to show that gamers are ready for the medium to grow a little more mature.

You begin with three survivors in a city under siege during a civil war, supplies are running low and they just arrived at an abandonned building. This will be their holdout for the war.\n\nYou will then manage their daily lives, making workbenches, chairs, beds, and everything else they need to get through the war. Of course, with supplies low, you need to prioritise. Do you really need a second bed? Maybe that material can best be spend on something else..\n\nAt night, you go out to scavenge supplies. You bring one (Only one per night) of your survivors to a location that you hope has supplies you can use. Once there, you can encounter many things. It could be an abandonned building with nothing there. There could be a friendly (But well armed) trader, there could be civilians like you just trying to survive, or you could be shot on sight by the locals. Or there can be any other event... Or nothing. There is plenty of variation to be had.\n\nPersonally, I went to a church, unarmed, as I had nothing yet. The priest told me about how the place was robbed, and asked me not to disturb the refugees under the church. So I went on to the ruined building behind the church. Scavenging up supplies, when I notice there's sound outside the door. It's just standing there, so I creep to the door and look through the keyhole. Just then, a man with a pistol turned around and made for the door. I looked for a place to run and hide and set off, just as he opened the door.\n\n"Oh, Hello there. Don't worry, I'm just looking around"\n\nHe seemed pretty friendly. So I just went on my way to pick out some more nails and wood for my own business. It went alright this time. But plenty of people are less friendly than this guy.\n\nCombat, which you will at some point get into, is not explained in any way. So you will likely have to take a bit to learn about it, and stock up on bandages as you do so. At the same time, the stealth system is not explained, but easy enough to understand.\n\nWith all this, you are tasked with making your group survive the war. Or at least as long as you can. It can be easy, challenging, or at times nearly impossible. But that's war, and neither the government nor the rebel forces will help you there - You're not their problem.\nAnd once you've gone through the game, you can ask yourself if you really did win. Did you end up stealing from old people to let them starve? Did you rob a priest for fuel? Shanked a doctor for a bandage? You can ask yourself what winning really means in war. And if just surviving is all you should try to do.","December 1, 2014","true","12.5"," 434 of 477 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","434","477","0","0"

Here's a little taste:\n\nDay 17. I'm desperately low on food and the survivors are starving. I decide to raid a nearby house in the hopes of stockpiling food. Uponarriving, I find the jouse inhabited by two brothers and their elder parents. I sneak in through the back unnoticed. One of the brothers is about to walk through the door so I ascend to the second. Through the keyhole, I see an old woman come down from the attic and approach the door. I ready my knife and pray that she doesn't come any closer to the door. I don't want to kill her. She stops, idles for a moment in self pity, and then turns back around and enters a different room. I enter and scavenge for supplies when the same brother enters, causing me to hide. He finds the place suspicious and approaches my hiding place. I panic and lunge at him from hiding. He dies noisily, and his brother hears. He runs to apprehend me, but he is unarmed. I dispatch him quickly. The old mother hears and comes down. She sees one of her dead sons and weeps above him. I pause before her as I realize what I've done to them. She cries as she says their names. In one final act of pity, I kill her where she kneels. I loot the rest of the house and escape to my shelter, food in tow. The father, out of earshot to it all and asleep, I've left to awaken to the massacre.\n\nThis game touches me so deeply that these actions of mine caused me to ask myself, "what if this was a choice that I couldn't just hit the resatrt button to?"

It will try to take you to the breaking point where you finally begin to consider robbing/killing your helpful neighbor for a few cans of food. This is good, because it makes the game a fantastic war simulator.\n\nDespite my massive backlog, I had decided to pick up This War of Mine because the premise really, really intrigued me - I absolutely love survival games. To emphasize this, I had purchased The Long Dark, then Eternal Winter, then This War of Mine. Although the first two games were a lot of fun, they were still fairly barebones due to early-access status.\n\nI played This War of Mine for 7 hours straight when I first tried it - 3 playthroughs. I love this game so much that I will be adding immersion-stories to the comments of this review, as well as in my steam group. As an avid reviewer, I play A LOT of games in a short amount of time, and this is easily one of my favorite ones.\n\nIf you like grim survival gameplay in a war-torn country, deep immersion potential, testing the limits of your emotions, dark atmospheric themes, and elements from the rogue-like genres, then you will thoroughly enjoy this wonderful, macabre game. I was extremely impressed that an indie game was able to capture the essence of the brutalities and ugliness of war on such an artistic scale.\n\nThe aesthetics are fantastic! If you've played the atmospheric platformer Deadlight, you will notice some similarities in the side-scrolling environments. The level of detail in the areas and character models are great, however, I wish there was an option of changing your characters' clothing and appearance (not a big deal). A pencil-shading effect (similar to grain-filter effect seen in games like Mass Effect) adds a very nice touch to the dark and sombre atmosphere - you can adjust this to be soft or more obvious. The music and sounds are great and suit the theme of the game very well. You can also build a radio and leave one of two stations on - one classical and the other more of a general music genre. There is no voice-acting, which I found to flow well with the playstyle.\n\nThe game is point-and-click based, so the controls are fairly easy to familiarize yourself with. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, your experience with survival games and how to plan your actions will really affect how successful you may be - keep in mind that the game strongly encourages a pacifist (excluding self-defence) approach. When you start the game, there is no tutorial - you are immediately thrown right into your safehouse. You start off with (usually) 3 survivors randomly chosen from the grand survivor pool - each with a specific skill and weakness (or vice). For example, Arica has a much higher stealth rating and likes to smoke to calm down. You also start in a random season (usually NOT winter). The loot is randomized in each area, however, the layout of each location you can visit remains static.\n\nThe game operates on a day/night cycle (you can fast forward to night) - during the day, you will be in your safehouse and do things like build structures, eat, sleep, etc. During the night, you will give your group members different orders: have some sleep, guard, or scavenge (only one may visit an area per night). The areas you can visit are randomized each playthrough, and will sometimes be inaccessible if the civil war leaks over into certain areas. Something I just found out today was that, after  the militia pushes the government's army out of the city, some areas may show signs of war. For example, the church will be devastated and have construction ladders around the outside of it, with armed looters present. This impressed me immensely. (I read up on this, and apparently some areas have more than 1 possible layout, randomized each time you play through)\n\nAs you progress through the game, traders and recruit-able survivors will periodically visit your safehouse (limited to one event per day). Various neighbours will also come and ask for your help -  assisting them usually yields immediate or future rewards; and also boosts morale.\n\nEach character needs to eat and sleep - being deprived of either for too long may result in their death or desertion. When you kill, or if a group member is injured/killed, remaining group members will usually experience a blow to morale. Morale falls from "sad" -> "depressed" -> "broken." When a character is broken (and sometimes depressed), they will be unresponsive to your commands - you will have to have other characters deliver food and medication to them. They will also be unusable as scavengers. To combat this, you can have any of your group members talk to the broken character - you can also try having two characters drink together to alleviate some stress.\n\nBuilding and crafting is a major element of this game, and you will really have to plan out your build and scavenge routes to maximize your time. Trying to simply rush to the highest craft tier will most likely result in your quick death. On the city map, each visit-able location will have a list of items available to scavenge. Items do not respawn or restock in the different areas, and it is generally a bad idea to rely on randomness if you are in dire need of a specific item, like medicine for example. There are many areas where you can trade/steal from others, however, be advised that (at least early) violent/aggressive playstyles make the game exceedingly difficult if you are unprepared. Killing even one person damages group morale significantly, and it is very easy to find yourself with a group of mostly depressed/broken individuals.\n\nThe game adds amazing immersion in the character cards - the different members will record their opinions on what's happening. For example: if the group is starving, but Pavle has eaten, then he will have a comment saying something like: I must find my friends food since I am not hungry. The reactions when someone has committed murder or died are very interesting to see as well.\n\nOverall, This War of Mine paints what I would expect an accurate, emotion-driven picture of what life would be like for unfortunate individuals caught in a war, and the tribulations they have to face to simply survive. If you are interested in war simulation and/or survival elements at all, then I implore you to try this game. You will not come out feeling good after playing it (more of an anti-catharsis), but you will not be disappointed.\n\nABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","November 27, 2014","true","15.9"," 255 of 276 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","255","276","2","8"

After finally jumping in, I have to say — delaying this is was a huge mistake. Great atmosphere, excellent attention to detail, and a ton of variety to gameplay elements make it easily one of the best games I've played this year. While it lacks the lustre and grandeur of AAA titles, This War of Mine still spares nothing in its devious crafting of a dangerous, war-torn world and a phenomenal survival experience not like anything I’ve played.\n\nThis War of Mine opens with the ruined skyline of an unnamed city, and a single button that reads not “Play”, but “Survive”. As soon as you press it, the scene pans right to a trio of ragged-looking survivors, who’ll be your protagonists. From the onset you’re given a trial-by-fire tutorial that begins the game with one member of your randomized crew injured, and another sick. Offering the supplies you’ll need to tend to these is all the help the game offers, leaving it to your abilities to learn how to use them and which ones you need to stock up on.\n\nThis War of Mine uses a simple day/night cycle to break up gameplay modes. During the day, everything happens at the home base. Crafting supplies, furniture, and other necessities dominates this time. Resting and patching up wounded or sick group members happens here, as well. At night, you’re offered a chance to send one of your group on a scavenging run into the city. Each party member can opt to sleep, guard the base, or head out to search for much-needed supplies and materials. Danger fills the embattled landscape, but the rewards can often outweigh the risk.\n\nSurviving in This War of Mine is no simple task. With sickness and injury as the most obvious threats, hunger, tiredness, and other factors have a lot to do with progress. One of my early scavenging runs left the returning Pavle wracked with guilt, represented by a ‘Sad’ status condition that lowered his productivity after walking into an elderly couple’s home and leaving with a full load of food. This moral angle keeps things interesting; you’ll also encounter other survivors wanting trade, asking for help, or outright hostile and trying to take your possessions.\n\nI’m being entirely honest - This War of Mine is one of the best all-around games I’ve played all year. A crisp, consistent atmosphere, intuitive gameplay, and surprising depth create a fantastic experience. While the pretty steep difficulty may cause some to shy away, I enjoyed myself even as my group was falling apart — it all began when Marko was killed on a scavenging run. Filled with difficult moral and survivalist choices, it keeps you on your toes and thinking the entire time. While the 18,99€ price tag on Steam may be higher than many indie titles, it’s easy for me to say it’s entirely worth it. If you’re on the fence, wait for a sale — but jump on it as soon as one pops up.","October 11, 2015","true","42.8"," 203 of 217 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","203","217","8","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tellhimtogotohell/recommended/282070/","tellhimtogotohell","2Dictator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tellhimtogotohell/","235 products in account","Marko had spent last night scoping the place out. He clutched his pistol tightly with a pair of sweaty plams. This was it. Slowly, he edged towards the door and out of the rain, opening it with a gentle sigh from the hinges. It was dingy inside; the gloom was heavy. Taking slow steps forwards he made his way to the next door.\n\nKnelling down and looking through the grimy keyhole, he saw no one. Good, he thought to himself. Nudging the door open with his pistol, the hooded survivor krept down the hall. Footsteps! Quickly hiding in the gloom of an alcove, he held his breath tightly as a young woman walked past.\n\nSome part of him was screaming in anguish over the moral dilema. It's not right, the voice spoke to him. His conscience needed to be suffed, and he ignored it as the door closed. The woman was inside the kitchen. He just needed to wait, and-\n\n"Emil!" she screamed suddenly. Marko bit his lip as she locked eyes with him, only to run upstairs. Grasping the weapon as his breathing became hard, the young man ran through the open kitchen door, slid down the ladder, and burst into the basement. Turning and looking for a place to hide, he wanted to cry. There was nowhere.\n\n"Not here," came a strong masculine voice from above. Markos slowly turned to face the door, his eyes shaking in their sockets. Some bloke in a blue shirt ran into the room, holding a knife high. "Bandit!" Marko was up against the wall. He couldn't hold the pistol properly because his hands were shaking so hard.\n\nTwo shots burst through the gloom. One hit the man square in the chest, the other in his knee. Although wounded he charged, stabbing Marko twice as they grappled for freedom. Life and death. Markos raised his pistol to fire and...\n\n...He missed.\n\n\nHe died before he could realize the folly, falling limp with a soft plod as the knife sunk into his neck. Marko had been a hero, always willing to brave danger to feed his fellow survivors, always volunteering to scavange, and never letting anyone go hungry. He'd been a hero.\n\nPavle realized his best friend was dead the moment he didn't come back. He was distraught. Waiting by the door all day, sitting on the floor and listening for hours. The young sports star had only eaten once, and his face was grim.\n\n"I'm sure he's just la-" began Bruce.\n\nPavle sucked his breath in sharply, cutting Bruce off. "No," he said slowly. "Marko is never late. Ever since this started he was always back on time." Taking a knife from the floor besides him, Pavle looked Bruce in the eye. They knew it had to be done.\n\nIt was raining again. The journey to the house had been uneventful, and Pavle knew roughly what was up, thanks to Marko's work two nights before. Slowly but surely he crept into the dark building, illuminated only by the blinking lights and fire. Creeping into the kitchen the football player could see food. He was glad. Sliding down the ladder and turning around, however, his mood plumeted.\n\nThere lay Marko; his corpse pale in the darkness. Blood was all across the floor and up the back wall, with the body slumped slightly against it. His face was frozen in time, eyes wide in fear. Pavle was... calm. He knew what he need to do now.\n\nGoing back up the ladder and shunting the kitchen door open, with no regard for stealth, he charged up the stairs. Up and up he went, his breathing becoming savage as he reached the very top floor. Pavle heard groaning and the moving of objects, but he didn't care, bursting through the door he stared a bandaged and bloody man in the eyes.\n\n"No... you can't!" cried a female voice behind him. Running forwards with his knife in hand, Pavle screamed as tears streamed down his angry face. The blade sunk deep into the wounded man, killing him instantly. Turning to face the woman, and watching her run out of the room, Pavle ran after her.\n\nShe was too slow, and his blade was very sharp. Her body fell limp about as fast as he used to score a goal. Checking both their bodies with no respect, the sports star cursed. They had nothing on them.\n\nWhen he got back to the safehouse, Pavle was covered in blood. Alica asked him what happened, but Bruce merely handed him a drink. Placing the knife off to one side, Pavle just sat down, and wept. They had killed his best friend... and he had killed them.\n\n-------\n\nEDIT: Complaints and whatnot, decided to do a little proper review down here.\n\nThis War of Mine is powerful because of how it handles itself. There's an overtone of helplessness and regret, characters lamenting over their uselessness. Often when someone dies, they'll hope the next one isn't them.\n\nMarko is dead.\n\nThose three words gave off more emotion than every other war game I've played. I didn't need to twoniner my foxtrot, I wasn't "getting my ♥♥♥" down to 'bravo point', there wasn't some black hawk down, and my 'LZ' wasn't 'too hot'. I didn't even have to press [F] to pay respects.\n\nMarko is dead. I just saw these three words as my screen faded to black. Then I was back at camp, and the others knew something was up.\n\nI can't really express how profound that was. Perhaps because of how subtle the game was, the moment it outright told me someone was dead, then moved on... maybe that's why it was so powerful.\n\nThis War of Mine allows you to build characters up. It's literally an open book and it'll allow you to draw as many conclusions as you want. Because of that, I feel, it was made much more personal. Let me explain: I'm a writer, see? I write characters, get attatched to them, and sometimes watch them die. I'm constantly close to my own creations.\n\nI feel like this game lets everyone else do that, too. If you want to make your own characters with it, that's totally fine, and it will let you. If not? That's still fine, because the game tells you enough on its own to invest you regardless.\n\nI'm kind of rambling here, so I'll end this edit thus: This was not the game I wanted, this was the game I needed.","November 19, 2014","true","21.4"," 253 of 282 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","253","282","0","23"

You crafted a rough-shod bunker out of dirt and leaves in 7-days to die. You managed to log off of Rust for 5 minutes without losing everything you worked so hard for, for 9 straight hours. None of that has prepared you to survive just 5 days in This War Of Mine.\n\nYou start the game with just a small group of survivors in the war-torn country of possibly Russia. I'm only going by what the names of the characters resemble. I didn't actually read anything. Your starting point is a bombed-out "home" (In quotes because it's a damned big home) in which you have multiple rooms to clear for the purpose of scavaging and having space to build things such as rain-water filters, beds and cook stoves. Building these items requires parts such as wood, scrap and gears(?). Some of which you will find in your shelter on day one, the rest you have to scavange from other locations.\n\nMechanics\nThe mechnanics of the game is simply point-and-click. The game is divided into two parts; Day and night. The daytime is when you build up your shelter (protect it with patched up holes, upgrade your cook-stove or work bench, build furniture to make people happier), cook food, apply medicine or various other things to keep your group happy/healthy. Nighttime is dedicated mostly to scavaging, but also allows to to allocate who gets rest, and who guards your shelter. The day is divied into ten-minute increments and you are allowed 12 hours per day/night. Everything happens in "real-time" but that is a bit of a misnomer as it takes ten minutes to take 5 steps or to climb a ladder. Double-clicking allows you to run to your destination, which speeds you up my a factor of two, and I have yet to see any downside to doing this (i.e. fatigue). Clicking on piles of rubbles, doors, bars, etc. allows you to perform a contextual based action such as sift through rubble, open/close doors, pick locks or pry open doors with a crowbar, saw through metal bars, etc.\n\nGameplay\nYour goal, from what I have seen so far, is to simply survive. Something we have all done in countless games before. Only his time, it is brutal, gritty, real, and unforgiving. You are constantly battling hunger, exhaustion, sickness, depression, wounds and more. Balancing the act of taking care of your group, as well as sending people out to scavange (so that you CAN take care of your group) becomes an excercise of patience, frustration, and futility. You will lose people, you will get frustrated, you will die, and you will hate the game as you click "try again".\n\nControls\nAgain, just point and click. It's simple enough without taking anything away from the game.\n\nGraphics\nGritty, pencil-drawn-esque style artwork really works here.The game is a bit of a 2-D sidescroller, s don't expect a whole lot.\n\nSound\nThis is one area where I was a bit let down. The sound design leaves a lot to be desired, when using the radio. The sound is alright until then.\n\nWhat sets it apart?\nSo what is it that makes this game unique? It's the fact that the game actually makes you FEEL the consequences of your actions. Remember that old couple who's home you raided and who's food you stole? Your group will. And they will talk about how aweful it was. Return to thier home? Now they are dead because YOU took thier food and medicine. You will not feel good about it. Niether will your group, as actions like this will affect them in a negative way. It's up to you to decide how you survive, and what kind of person you will be. Just remember: you will not survive by being the nice guy.\n\nOverall\nAreaScoreGraphics7/10Sound7/10Gameplay8/10Fun9/10Replay Value10/10","December 26, 2014","true","21.4"," 264 of 297 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","264","297","12","18"

Then some of us got drafted, like my best friend Leon, others like me volunteered for the militia, it was going to be the ultimate showdown and every single one of us wanted a piece of the action" - Roman (Playable character)\nThis is a game I've been waiting for so long.\nUsually when you hear someone mention war and games you automatically think about games like Call of Duty, Battlefield or Medal of Honor since those are the games we are used to.\n\n"Why isn't there any game out there where you don't run around guns blazing but actually have to survive war as a civilian?"\nThat's what I was always thinking when I heared another Call of Duty or Battlefield hits the market.\nThen some time later I found This war of mine.\nEver since that day I was really excited for it because that was exactly what I wanted.\nA game where you aren't the chosen one. Where you don't become a hero and save a nation or the whole world.\nYou're also not a survival specialist. You're just a normal person caught in the shadow of war trying your very best every day and every night to survive. Where you actually have to think of every consequence. Do I go out tonight to gather some stuff? Who get's to eat and sleep? Should I give this shady looking guy shelter?\n\nYou start the game with nothing of value. All you have are three civilians you have to take care off.\nAfter you got to know the character by reading their Biography you'll notice that some of the characters have some traits like Good Cook or Runner for example. That means that some characters are better suited for specific tasks and situations then others and it's up to you to find out how to exactly put the characters and their traits to good use.\n\nWhat really got me was the situation on Day 3.\nI had to decide whether or not I rob the house of an elderly couple.  The moment I entered the house the husband was following me around,asking me what I'm doing, what I'm looking for and begged me to not hurt his ill wife. Needlessly to say I never thought that would bother me since we're used to such situation where we would actually rob this couple laughing... but it did. I felt terrible. I needed medicine since one of my characters got wounded at night when he was out scavenging and I didn't want to let him suffer and slowly die\nThe old man basically asked me not to take to much since he needs it for his wife. Now I could decide. Whose life do I value more? The guy who went scavenging last night to get some resources and who really tries to help his group or the life of the old Lady I basically know nothing off. So I took the medicine. After I left the house and came back the bio of my character was updated and he actually felt sad that he had to do this in order to survive. Even the other two were torn whether or not he made the right decision and the woman in my group actually felt sad as well while the other guy supported his decision to take the medicine.\n\nThere are several other instances that got to me like when I found an abandoned hospital and there were actual Doctors and Nurses which tried their best to help the people in need ... And I had to rob them in order for my group to survive.\n\nYou encounter a lot of characters which are just in the need of help since they're also stuck in hell on earth that is war but you simply can't trust them at times.\n\nAlso another positive aspect of the game is that you have to keep your characters warm and in good condition at all times if possible. Since it gets colder as the game progresses and the difficulty really increases once you reach winter.\nAfter I survived my first run I was a bit torn. I don't know how many people I screwed over in order for just one of my group to survive. We were four at some point\n\nWar is hell.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/282070/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","952 products in account","Overview:This War of Mine is a strategic, tactical, point & click 2D-sidescroller with traits of life-sim, but it practices a different theme compared to other war games. The title is developed and published by polish devs 11 bit studios. It's a game that doesn’t look at either military side of a war, it looks at what's in the middle – innocent victims caught amidst somebody else’s conflict. It’s available on Steam, the App Store and Google Play Store.\n\n\nStory:The story in This War of Mine changes every time you begin a new campaign. The player begins with a group of people who have shelter, some food and some tools; after that the game plays out day by day, and it’s the player's task to manage resources and make the characters survive as long as they possibly can. They’re in the middle of a city used as a battleground for a war in an eastern-European country.\n\nFor this section I’ll write about one campaign that I went through:\nDay 1: I begin with Marin, Katia, and Arica in an abandoned building. Arica sneaks, Katia bargains, and Marin builds. Each of them have personal backstories. The first day everyone searches through the building. Arica leaves to scavenge a gas station. Marin and Katia stay and guard. Arica gets food, components, fuel, and herbs.\nDay 2: All three are tired and hungry; Arica and Katia eat, Marin makes two beds. Arica and Katia sleep, Marin builds a Workshop, a heater, then eats. Arica goes out, Marin sleeps, Katia guards. Arica goesto the gas station.\nDay 3: The shelter was raided, Marin is slightly wounded, but they stole nothing. Arica and Katia sleep, Marin builds an Herbal Workshop, Metal Workshop, makes a knife. Arica wakes up, eats. Marin and Katia eat and guard. Arica goes to the gas station. She finds a soldier harassing a girl. Arica uses her knife to fight the soldier and kills him, he severely wounded Arica. The girl is saved. Arica keeps the man's gun.\nDay 4: Arica is severely wounded. Marin is sick. Katia bargains with someone. Despite lack of food, fuel, and Arica's wounds, all three are content. Arica stays and sleeps, Marin guards, Katia goes out to a supermarket. She sees someone but gets by unnoticed. On her way out she bumps into and kills him out of fear.\nDay 5: Arica is severely injured, Marin is sicker, Katia is now sad. Food is low, fuel is high. Marin and Katia sleep. Katia goes out with a gun in hand. She goes to the military outpost. When trading doesn’t work, she shoots and kills one, severely wounds another, and gets killed.\nDay 6: Katia is dead, Marin is sick, and Arica is severely wounded. No food, little fuel, gun was lost. Arica goes out, Marin stays to sleep. She moves slowly at a nearby church already robbed. As a last ditch effort to bring back medicine for Marin she kills three men, robs them. On her way back and another thief appears claiming to be friendly. He shoots Arica and she dies.\nDay 7: Everything has gone to ♥♥♥♥. Marin was raided and is now severely ill and wounded. He has no food, no fuel, and is depressed. He can’t even go out to scavenge.\nDay 8: Marin is terminally ill. He sleeps all day in bed.\nDay 9: Marin is dead.\n\nI didn’t make it.\n\n\nGameplay:You need to find supplies: food/consumables, crafting materials, electronics, weapons, valuables, etc… To do that you must leave the shelter and look for it in houses, schools, hospitals, and churches, among other city structures. There is a Day & Night system at play: During the day your characters are forced to stay inside because of snipers which prey on people out in the open; inside they can eat, build, rest, smoke, talk to each other, etc... Traders, beggars, and people looking for shelter will knock on the door often, it’s something that might kill you or help you live another day, you could ignore it; it’s also how one can acquire more characters, or just another mouth to feed. During the night your characters can sleep, guard the shelter, or go out scavenging. Since you have more than one character, each can do something different. However, bandits can and will raid your shelter during the night while you’re scavenging, and you won’t know this happened until the beginning of the next day. Characters can get different conditions of varying levels: Hunger (still hungry, hungry, very hungry, starving, extremely starving), Fatigue (tired, very tired, and exhausted), Emotion (content, normal, sad, depressed, and broken), and Health (slightly sick, sick, severely ill, terminally ill, slightly wounded, wounded, severely wounded, lethally wounded). And some other states that I’m likely forgetting about…\n\nThe thrilling gameplay takes place mainly while one or more of the characters is out scavenging for supplies. Technically anything goes, but there are always consequences. Anything out of the line of sight will be blurry or foggy (like past a door, or on a higher floor). Entering an owned property will require sneaking; walking is silent, but running causes noise. There are some hiding places to hide from other survivors. If they hear any noise you made or spot you in their line of sight they will check it out, but they might give up thinking it’s a rat, as they make some noise when scurrying around too. You can also hear steps and they will be visible on-screen, it might be a person or a rat. If it’s a person and you are revealed to them it will trigger different events, either a fight or a discussion on whether to trade, or maybe extortion. This is where trust is tested.\n\nOnce a character has gone through different experiences, like helping out a neighbor pull his family out of rubble, the morale of the group will change, and they might become content; if a character steals or kills someone during a night of scavenging, the opposite will happen, and when a character reaches the state of ‘broken’, they will not have the will to eat, sleep, or even move – they’ll have given up on life - and might escape the shelter (disappear), or commit suicide.\n\n\nVisual:2.5D is was you would call this game, since it’s built in 3D but is viewed from the side. You can zoom-in just enough to see the detail in the environments and the characters. The HUD is clear and though sometimes there might be a lot of icons on the screen, it never feels too in-your-face. Animations are for sure the biggest plus that this game has in graphics, the animations are amazing; from simple knocks on the door to grabbing someone from behind, throwing them on the ground, and stabbing them to death. The art style doesn’t chase realism very much, but it isn’t stylized by any means; it’s the perfect blend of semi-realism and atmospheric feel.\n\n\nSound:This game has got the environmental sounds among silence completely nailed. Sounds like making food, opening and closing doors, all the way to the way stabs sound, it is simply superb.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:It never lets you win. You either finish a campaign completely dissatisfied or you finish a campaign with the vaguest feeling on dissatisfactory satisfaction. For those who crave a challenging resource management mechanic, this game should scratch that itch mighty well.\n\nYou might do things in this game that will surely surprise you, things you wouldn’t expect yourself to even think about doing, but you can do it because it’s simply a game; how nice it is to sit in your cozy chair in your cozy house and experience this awful world, without ramifications; makes you think about things, doesn’t it?\n\nThe game is an unforgiving and emotionally wrenching experience that shows how psychopathic human nature can be once humanity is pushed back to primal environments. It's made to reflect the realities of living in a war-torn city.\n\nIs this a game that’s fun to play? No.\nIs this a game you should play? Yes.","November 20, 2014","true","6.3"," 182 of 198 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","182","198","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gitorian/recommended/282070/","gitorian","Gitorian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gitorian/","107 products in account","This War Of Mine is a harsh, unforgiving and absolutely delightful game.\n\nYou begin with a small group of ordinary people, each having their own skills and weaknesses and try to survive through a civil war that has left you with barely no resources. At it's core, the concept of the game is quite simple (yet innovative for all I know): during the day, you must make the best of what you have to organize your shelter in order to tend to the needs of your group while at night, you go scavenging for the resources you are in dire need of.\n\nWhere all this really takes off, is how the game mechanics have been fine tuned so that each and every day, the stakes are to the max. As it is the case for any realistic survival situation, every bits of food and material is vital and must be carefully managed, every step you make while scavenging can be deadly and have irreversible consequences - this is a rogue-like game: you cannot save and everything you do generally have irreversible consequences.\n\nFor instance: you must have water to cook food (per the game's mechanics, raw food is less nourishing) and given a group of four people, you hence might need a certain amount of water to feed them well. Let's say one day you forget to tend to your water collector, the raw food you have might then not be sufficient to nourish everyone in your group. Being malnourished, someone might get sick so that, on your scavenging night, instead of simply having to find a little amount of food, you now must find water, lots of food and some meds. Meds are usually rare and chances are you'll have to sneak your way in some dangerous place to find some (and perhaps even kill someone if you get caught stealing), all this because you forgot to tend to your water collector!\n\nAdd to this mix a bunch of unexpected, random events such as kids begging for meds at your shelter, a friendly neighbor offering you a batch of vegetables, your well crafted survival plans can easily go south in the blinking of an eye. This is, in my opinion, what makes this game so addictive, intense, frustrating and yet deeply enjoyable.\n\nOn the technical side, there are very few bugs. The graphics are a perfect fit to the game's spirit; the environments are diverse and not repetitive and while the music themes can be a bit repetitive they do create a very good atmosphere.\n\nIn all, if you like survival games for the sense of vulnerability and intensity they provide, if you appreciate rogue-like games such as FTL, you will definitively love This War Of Mine.","December 23, 2014","true","21.7"," 160 of 170 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","160","170","6","0"

We were runing low on food and medication. Katia was sick and 'Severely Wounded' and I (Bruno) knew we had to do the unthinkable; after stealing most of the resources from the hospital I had to return to the 'Quiet House' where an old couple was living and steal what they had. In war it's neither them nor us, it's survival of the fittest, mates...\nAnyways, night came, I grabbed my trusty hatchet and pistol and went looting. As I entered their house the old man ran upstairs to look for a hiding spot. The old woman was sitting in an armchair and she looked kinda confused of what was happening and why he ran upstairs. I slowly approached her and with no hesitation I swing my hatchet into her ♥♥♥♥ing throat; blood spluttering everywhere on the floor and on me. She tried screaming but was choking on her own blood. Then, the old man came running downstairs and as he was stepping on each single stair, I drew out my pistol and shot him in the chest before he reached the ground floor where the dead body of his wife was lying. He screamed ''Bandits!'' before collapsing on the remaining stairs and reaching the ground floor. I looted his corpse and found 3 medication boxes. Then proceeded at looting his wife's corpse and found 2 diamonds. After that I stole what was left on the ground floor and basement and found 2 so much needed bandages. Last place to look for stuff was upstairs, I was hoping to find some food or medication but no, I found something... Something way more terrible... In the old couple's room, there was a letter on the table... A letter from ''Grandpa Bernard'' to Alen:\n\n''We're happy to learn that you've come to like living with auntie. This war is not that bad, it's just not fun for children. In fact, they say it will be over soon, so don't worry about us. Grandma is feeling better. She asked me not to tell you, but she's saving some flour to make you those cookies you like! And as for me... well, I promise you to repair the swing when you are back.''\n\nIn that very moment I felt such a sadness... How could've I done something like that?!  Did this war drove me so insane?!  After trying to help people and after trying to be a kind person in the first 20 days after the war started... God... How did I became something like this?!...\n\n\nI really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. All I had to see at the game was the images from the steam store to make me buy it, haven't seen the trailer nor gameplay, I just felt that the game'll be a real masterpiece and my thought turned out to be right.\nThis is one of those games that show us how a good story, soundtrack and art style will always beat the so called ''fancy graphics'' games.\n\n9.7/10  Best survival game I played in many years, in my opinion.","November 17, 2014","true","22.0"," 184 of 203 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","184","203","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueDrank/recommended/282070/","BlueDrank","Bluedrank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueDrank/","183 products in account","Initially, I wanted to play the game peacefully; scavenging but never stealing, growing foods when I could, trading for whatever else I needed by growing tobacco and crafting cigarettes. After repeatedly failing to keep my characters alive, as they met fates such as freezing to death, starvation, sucumbing to sickness, or being murdered by armed thugs, my morals began to fade.\n\nI started a new game, and I was done being the victim. I crafted a knife for Pavle, my chosen assassin, each night going out in search of trouble. Like a trained hunter, I’d stalk bad guys as they made their rounds in a building. I'd jump out of the shadows, the armed thug caught totally off guard as he smoked a cigarette, quickly stabbing them to death. I was ruthless, meticulous, and my characters were living great. That is, until I slipped up and one of them shot Pavle in the back as he tried to escape. Things went downhill after that. Pavle survived, but nursing him back to health slowly depleted my limited resources.\n\nAnother night, as Pavle climbed through the window of a fortified home, he came face to face with an armed female guard. Pavle quickly dispatched of the girl, but what came next chilled me to the bone. As the girl’s lifeless body lay on the floor of the home, I heard footsteps coming from the floor above. Pavle hid in the shadows, waiting for the next victim to show their face. This time though, instead of a heavily armed thug, all Pavle saw was a grieving mother. She ran to her daughter’s body, falling to the floor in tears as she held her murdered child. As Pavle emerged from his hiding place, she screamed at him, just wanting to know why he was doing this. The unfortunate reality of the situation was that Pavle still needed the shotgun that poor girl was carrying, and nobody was going to stop him from getting it.\n\nThe profound weight of his actions had begun to take a toll on Pavle. Severe depression and sickness had started to creep in. Still, when Pavle was physically able, I sent him back out into the night. More dangerous encounters led to Pavle suffering another gunshot, this time worse than the first. As he returned home, empty handed and bleeding profusely, I knew what would come next for my once glorious killer.\n\nWith Pavle returning with an empty backpack, I only had enough food to feed 2 people. Someone would need to go without. As I looked over my 3 survivors, all hungry, Pavle stuck out as being a particular problem. He was very hungry, bleeding at an unprecedented level, and severely depressed. With the extremely limited resources on hand, I knew there was little that I could do to get poor Pavle back to 100%. So I stopped feeding him, and I stopped bandaging his wounds. I told myself it would be much easier with him gone, scavenging for 2 should be much easier than for 3. He died 2 days later from his injuries, a hero to some, monster to countless others.\n\nThese horrible actions weren't Pavels though, they were mine. I was the monster responsible for murdering a mother and child. I was the executioner of countless men and women that were likely doing the same as I was, whatever was needed to survive another day. In my quest to keep my companions alive during the war, I lost something just as important. My humanity.\n\nRead the rest of my review at http://gamecrastinate.com/review/war-mine-review/","November 14, 2014","true","22.0"," 211 of 238 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","211","238","0","3"

He was caught there when the Siege started in April 1992 as he tried to help a friend flee the city and ended up being stuck there until 1996, and he has a number of... troubling... stories to tell about the Siege.

This factored heavily into my enjoyment of the game itself, as, along with excellent audios it drew me further into the game and made me connect far more with the characters.\n\nThis connection with the characters is what really made this game shine. From intially not knowing the various people you control very well, you get fed tidbits about their past, and some of their personalities are apparent from how they react to things you might make one of the characters, or indeed, themselves, do. The immersion was so great that when two characters died (actually my third and fourth to die, my first two had died pretty early on and thus I hadn't grown attached to them yet), which prompted a third to leave and never come back, I actually cheered as I wouldn't have to watch him suffer the slow deaths that his friend had. Of course, this enthusiasm was short lived as it suddenly dawned on me, he had left me with only one character, who was also dying of her wounds. The first playthrough ended therefore after five hours of me bumbling about blindly, failing miserably, and being utterly captivated as events unfolded; fighting desperately against the odds to save the lives of my characters.\n\nAnother plus was the fact that not every single NPC is a raving lunatic planning to murder and/or eat you as is so commonly done in other games set in survival based settings. There are some people with... issues, sure; there are a refreshing number of people who don't just shoot you or stab you in the back.\n\nAltogether, I found the game to be one of the best of its kind that I have ever played; I even enjoyed the more mundane moments such as chosing where to place my new furniture (Yeah, trading all my medical supplies to buy materials to make a few armchairs didn't back fire on me at all, honest!). The scavenging is intuitive - the NPCs don't mind too much if you just pick up a few bits of rubble which is strewn about the place, but start picking up stuff they've put in their cuboards? They might object just a little to that one.\n\nAs for the combat... Well, I sucked at it so can't really go into much detail. Turns out trying to punch someone in the face when they have a shotgun and a buddy armed with an AK standing next to them is a bad idea. I did manage to escape from several combat situations, though in one case 'escaping' meant a slow, lingering death as the wound gradually worsened over the course of several days as I had no bandages to treat him with. So yeah, combat exists, but with the risks of infections and so on, it can be risky to attempt.\n\nAltogether - I found the game excellent in virtually every way and far surpassing what I had even begun to expect. I look forward to spending the next few weeks playing it, as it has massively increased replayability by having randomness added not only to the daily events which can occur, but also to the various key events, even including the length of the wars (Sadly enough, I failed miserably despite having an apparently relatively short war to survive through, so I dread to think how badly I will fail at long ones).","November 14, 2014","true","15.6"," 103 of 107 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","103","107","0","1"

Tonight it was the quiet house. I peeked through the key hole and I saw an old couple who were reminiscing about old times, unaware of the intruder on their doorstep. I didn't see anyone else. After searching and looting all there were on a pile of rubbles nearby I decided to pay the old couple a visit. The door handle was broken so I just pushed it open. The door creaked like an old man's bones after a long rest. Both of the house's inhabitants were startled and jumped from their seats.\n\n"What do you want? We have nothing here."\n\nI ignored the old man and proceeded to search their cabinet. The old lady screamed in terror and scrambled hastily out of there, guided by her husband. "Quick! Upstairs!" I found several materials and food inside, but no bandages. I followed the old couple upstairs. They were hiding in a small room by the end of the corridor. They were sitting in a corner and the old man was facing his wife. He stopped whatever he was doing and turned around, blocking his wife from my sight. "Please, you can take anything. Just don't kill my wife." The old man followed me while I paced around the room looking for any sign of bandages. Nothing in the desk drawer. Nothing in the cupboard. Also nothing even in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. I returned to the room.\n\nAnd I saw it.\n\nThe old lady had it all along. She grabbed onto the bandage tightly and it was at that moment that I saw a wide gash on her skirt. They were wet with blood. She must have gotten the wound just now since it was not there earlier. So, the old man was treating his wife when I barged in. I reached out my hand. "Hand me the bandages." The old man was taken aback, "No, please. Anything but that. I need to treat her wound." He continued to beg me. I was at a loss. Damn! Katia was severely wounded by last night's raid and I had to patch her up quick or she won't last until tomorrow. It was either us or them. It was better us than them, right? Right?? With harsher tone, "Just hand me the bandages and I will leave you guys alone." The old man suddenly rushed towards me to attack. I was surprised but not for long. He was fast but I was faster. I reflexively reached to the knife I hid behind and it was all over in a matter of minutes.\n\nAs I stared at the pool of blood at my feet and the bandages in my hand I wonder what kind of monster that I have become. This was definitely not my most cheerful moment. In this life. Or in this war of mine.","November 17, 2014","true","29.9"," 132 of 147 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","132","147","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/recommended/282070/","More_Badass","More_Badass","http://steamcommunity.com/id/More_Badass/","624 products in account","A popular franchise once stated "War. War never changes". Maybe so, but for the people caught in the midst of the conflict, everything changes. This War of Mine explores the horrors of war from a perspective not explored in the medium till now and delivers one of the most tense, gripping, and bleak experiences I've played this year.\n\nGames like Call of Duty and the like tend to use war for the spectacle, creating big action set pieces from the chaos. You'll never see the war ravaging the country where This War of Mine is set, but its effects are ever present. A gutted war-torn city, all pencil-sketched shadows and ruined structures, reeking of desperation and hopelessness, as explosions thunder and flash ceaselessly outside.\n\nThis War of Mine is not fun. It's grueling. Unrelenting. Oppressive. You start each playthrough with three survivors. Sometimes one or more might already be sick or wounded. Sometimes it might be winter at the start, meaning fuel and heat will be utmost priorities. The game is divided into two phases: Day, where you're confined to your base because of snipers outside, and Night, where you can venture out and scavenge for supplies, The daytime hours are when you can maintain your survivors and home, crafting new tools and workshops, building defenses against looters, or simply keeping your group alive by making sure they rest, recover, eat. You're always on the back foot, always just barely eking out a miserable day-by-day existence; even when your group finally is healthy and has a good amount of food stored, there's always the sense that it can't last long.\n\nOnce night falls, you're free to travel to other locations with one survivor, while instructing the others to rest or guard against raiders. These places range from homes and apartment buildings to schools and hospitals, and each scavenging run is a slow intense affair. Similar to 2012's Mark of the Ninja, environments are cloaked in shadows, only areas in your line of sight being visible. New unexplored areas are foreboding, never knowing who resides within or if they're friendly or not.\n\nEven when you're equipped with a knife or gun, combat and violence in general feels like a last resort. Not simply because guns and ammo are a rarity or because you're untrained, but because you don't want to kill people or steal from them. A lot of games have moral choices or meters telling you if you're good or bad, but honestly, they've always felt artificial to me. In This War of Mine, there are only murky grey choices. Your actions matter, not just at that moment when you're desperate enough to kill and steal from people who are just trying to survive, people trying to keep their group alive just like you are, but also in the long term, as doing morally questionable things weighs on your characters. Building a radio or finding books and cigarettes can only distract and keep them occupied for so long. Survivors grow depressed, listless, broken, perhaps even suicidal.\n\nIf anything, that's War of Mine's greatest achievement: the way it makes you feel bad for crossing that moral line or makes intruding onto another group's home feel weird and wrong. You don't want to turn away children asking for help, or steal medicine from that elderly couple, or kill those people for their food. But your group is sick, and starving, and you desperately need fuel to stave off the winter cold, so you must.\n\nThe days go by. Winter comes and goes. As the war worsens, places that were once safe havens might be overtaken by bandits. Barter, scavenge, do what you must to endure. This War of Mine is the kind of game you might only be able to play in short sessions, due to the overwhelming bleakness and depressing nature. It can be slow and tedious and monotonous, but that only works in the game's favor, establishing a grim "We just need to last another day" tone. This War of Mine is not a fun game, but it is one hell of an engrossing, compelling, and atmospheric experience.","November 21, 2014","true","8.9"," 106 of 113 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","106","113","0","1"

Everytime I played this I discover something new (how to clean out Military Outpost, how to safely pass Sniper Junction, how to kill the bandits in St. Mary's Church, etc.). And on top of that, this is the only game that managed to give me something to think about: war is hell and I should be grateful for all of my comforts in life. After playing this game I even felt guilty having leftover food on my plate. Consider that as message delivered.\n\nBottomline, this game is BRILLIANT and I would recommend it to everyone I know. Really really worth the money. 5 stars!\n\nP.S. to the developers: I hope more content is added to this game in the future. Maybe more safehouses? More places to scavenge?

Armed with a shotgun, a knife and a bulletproof vest he ventured deeper into the depths of the church, "I can take them" I thought as Roman climbed the ladder which Marko's killer had descended from, upon reaching the next I witnessed a man descending the stairs to my right, Roman pulled out his knife and advanced, the foe fled, giving pursuit Roman witnessed another man pursuing him with pistol drawn, once he fired, miss\n\nKnowing he dare not turn back Roman continued his pursuit of the cowardly man, through several rooms he pursued him up until the man made it outside and jumped on the roof, the man with the pistol was almost to Roman, Roman closed the door and shotgun in hand waited for his foe to catch up, the door opened, I tried to attack him but the man fired first, frantically I continued to attempt to fire a shot, but alas I could not, second later I was almost dead, I panicked and tried to run! But I couldnt move, as with Marko I had to watch Roman die knowing I could do nothing and he would be gone for good.\n\nThe next day Bruno and Arica mourned yet another friends passing, actually not Arica, she didnt care, but still my grief and frustration at losing half of my group in 2 days was overwhelming, I quit out of the game, and began writing this review.\n\nThe morale of this story is that no matter how good your run is going, no matter how well supplied and armed you are, it can all go to ♥♥♥♥ pretty easily, believe me when I tell you that with only one or two survivors, you will die in a matter of days, if not by starvation or lack of sleep, by raids, you will lose your supplies, your people will be injured or killed, and then finally, it will end.....\n\nOn a side note great game! 10/10","November 16, 2014","true","14.8"," 114 of 125 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","114","125","0","0"

Searched our basement, found pretty things, made beds for everyone. Everyone was healthy.\n\nDay 2:\nNobody tried to rob us.  We built some cooker, traded tobacco for food, everyone had dinner. Everyone was happy.\n\nNight 2:\nTime for scavenging. Marko found homeless guy in garage. He was asking for some food, but Marko came without anything. Just with knife for protection. Left with plenty of wood and other stuff for building. Left that guy starving.\n\nDay 3:\nWe were raided, but  we were lucky, robbers didn´t steal anything. We had medical stuff like bandages, food for everyone, we were happy. Survivors aren't always the strongest; sometimes they're the smartest, but more often simply the luckiest\n\nNight 6:\nMarko visited some small quiet house. There were 2 pensionist, man and woman, begging to not steal their supplies. But we were low on food and medicines, so Marko had to take it. To keep his friends alive, no matter the price is. But brave old man, protecting his wife, attacked Marko. Marko had to kill him. Stopped nearby woman who was crying over her dead  husband. Marko couldn´t leave her just like that alone in this world full of misery. Stabbed her from behind.\n\nNight 9: Marko visited apartment building.He brought a knife with him. There were two guys with assault rifle and one woman. He knew, he has to kill them, because he would left empty handed or wouldn´t left at all. Took one guy on the stairs. Woman went to bed. She was sleeping. Marko came inside a room, closed the door and stabbed her, while she was sleeping. At least, she didn´t even know. The best, she could get. Then Marko shot last guy with rifle of the guy, he killed on the stairs. Took their supplies.\n\nNo one can tell what goes on in between the person you were and the person you become. No one can chart that blue and lonely section of hell. There are no maps of the change. You just come out the other side.\n\nDay 13:\nKatia couldn´t stand Markos killing spree, even that was best for her and bruno. She left during a night. Bruno is depressed and begging for cigarettes. Marko was sure, killing for supplies was right thing to keep them alive.\n\n\nNight 19:\nMarko decided to loot a church. Armed with assault rifle, powered by hunger, he went for food  through corpses. Shot 2 armored guys and a priest. While he was searching private cabinet, other guy with shotgun showed up. Marko was ready, confident to shot the guy. Pointed at him with rifle, puled the triger....... click. Marko was lying on the floor with holes in his body. Hunger made him blind. That mother ♥♥♥♥er forgot to check, if there are any bullets left in his rifle. Now you can rest in peace.\n\nDay 20:\nWe have been raided. Bruno was lethaly wounded. They took our water, the last bandage we had, almost everything. Bruno was crying, Begging for help... he was bleeding to death. He was affraid to die alone.\n\nknock.. knock...\n\n"Someone´s knocking ?  Or were those just bullet shots ? Have to check it"\n"Hi, I´m Pavle."\nBruno saw a little bit of hope in pavle. Let him stay inside.They talked to each other, wanted to get them out of deppresion.\n\nNight 20:\nPavle run to a hospital, to find some medical supplies, but he didn´t have anything to trade, so he had to steal. Saw a nurse. He was sure, he hear her talking about checking medical supplies. He followed her, into the room. She was there, checking some cabinet. He closed the door, pulled a knife out of his pocket and stabbed her from behind. Searched the cabinet and....... there were no ♥♥♥♥ing bandages... just some pills ! and herbs.... " I had to kill a nurse for... some. .... ♥♥♥♥ing .... grass !!!! I killed someone who could save many lives ! " Someone was coming, Pavle got out of the room, nobody noticed him. Left hospital.\n\nDay 21:\nPavle came back with bad news. Bruno was depressed much more. Pavle was hungry and tired, so went to sleep. Meanwhile there was someone knocking on the door. It were 2 guys, one was armed with rifle. Bruno opened. They were asking for a guy that robbed the hospital and got info, that robber was from our neighbour. They wanted to give a reward for info about that robber: 3 cans of food, 10 cigarettes. Bruno was heavy smoker.. but he didn´t want to betray Pavle. He said know.\n"Are you sure ? " armored guy asked.\nBruno was thinking... no.. he wasn´t thinking. He was dying from bleeding. He wanted his last cigarette before dead.\n" Just give me a second... "\n...\nCan they help me ? Will I die as a betrayer ?.. cigarettes.... I´m hungry...\n\n"No, I haven´t seen him."\n\nDay 22:\nBruno was sleeping and Pavle was guarding. He got depressed last night, Because he killed. He killed a young nurse. They said, they are like angels. He killed angel. Bruno woke up. They talked to each other.Got along. PAvle was sure, he has to find those bandages for bruno. They had almost nothing left after last night. Raided again. Only few herbs and picklock. We forgot. There is one cabinet locked in the basement. PAvle picked up the lock. There was a rifle... with ammo. He was thinking..... he has to help bruno.. he has to find bandages. It must .. must be somewhere in the hospital. He was ready to comeback to find it. He was ready to kill for it.\n\nNight 22:\nPavle returned to hospital. They didn´t recognize him as robber, who stole their supplies night ago. So he was looking in the hospital. Found private cabinet. Is someone around ? No. he tried to search it, but he was caught. By another nurse. He was afraid to be revealed, so he quickly pulled out the gun and shot the nurse. "What I´ve done ? I became a monster." Bu it´s too late.. there´s a guard with shotgun running towards you. It´s your choice - kill or be killed. SHOT HIM ! There´s guard.. lying on the ground with bullet in his head. Afraid patients running around... Afraid Pavle ... Do they have gun ? Do they want to kill you ?... kill them ! kill them all !! Search the place  ! Quickly ! ... There it is.\n3 Bandages in Pavles pocket. dead guard, 2 dead nurses, 4 dead patients. There´s no time for sorrow, the dawn comes. Pavle has tu run home.\n\nDay 23:\n\nPavle returned. He was running towards Brunos bed. He found him.. found him dead in a puddle of blood. Pavle couldn´t stand his life anymore, couldn´t stand the misery of war. He hanged himself.\n\n-this game shows other face of war, There aren´t just soldiers fighting for their lives, there are ordinary people too, fighting for their own life, this game will show you your true inside, show you, that you are not as nice as you thought,\n\nThis is not playing nice, this is ...\n\nSurvival of the fittest","November 17, 2014","true","27.2"," 110 of 120 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","110","120","0","0"

Sometimes when you're at the end of the road you're forced to make certain decisions to survive - and so do other people as well with you.\n\nThe grim looks of the game, careful management, 'ethics' perhaps since when you make a choice to kill, it will impact all those around you... And may have longer term consequences as well of which you have not imagined. In my two playthroughs, the last one almost got me to apparent freedom - until the last man standing died.\n\nMore about resource management: You start in a hideout with only a workshop, some barricaded doors, rubble, locked doors, locked closets and piles of materials. It's best if you clean it up as soon as possible so that you know with what kind of resources you start with.\n\nGenerally, you have enough to create the basics of basics: A bed. A metal workshop. Perhaps depending on what you have and like, another bed, maybe some more items, a shovel to clear up rubble. Or perhaps a knife for self-defense at your home, or safety out scavenging? Typically the three 'main' resources are:\n\nBuilding materials.\nThese can be components, lumber, parts, electric parts, everything to upgrade your benches, create more useful items such as weapons, single-use filters. I wonder why you can't create a re-usable filter. Because you REALLY need a LARGE amount of these for Luxery goods production, but also to filter out clean water for cooking use. Furthermore to board up your home. You'll really need a lot of these.\n\nLuxery goods. These are rather wanted and can be consumed by yourself as well.\nA few examples are cigarettes which has multiple 'tiers' or in easier terms, 'quality'. The better quality has better effects as well as more value for trade. Coffee beans and alcohol which also has different qualities. To consume either coffee or cigarettes you need to have an armchair (not sure if regular chairs have effect) and ofcourse a person who is either a coffee drinker or smoker. It will improve their morale drastically.\n\nAlso jewelry. An important thing to notice is that you cannot eat jewelry (don't make that weird face at me please). Although you can trade it for a lot of goods early on if the trader appears it is perhaps wise to stock it up if you survive long enough to visit a marketplace perhaps or another trader in which you see something very useful - but don't have anything valuable or useful to the other person to trade with.\n\nFood for Hunger, Medicine/Bandages for the Sick, Alcohol (from Luxery Goods!)\nFood. It's rather important. You'll be always short on these - even moreso if your group grows beyond the starting three. You'll find some raw meat, vegetables, canned food. All of these can be eaten, however not cooking raw meat is unwise, the same goes for vegetables. However, you can eat the canned food! (Be blessed you do NOT need a can opener! Inbefore this featured item is added to the game.) The canned food stills hunger greatly, does not require time to cook, is an useful trading item as well!\n\nNow over to Medicines, there are two of them: Herbal meds and the real Medicine bottles. The first one may have half/half chance to cure slightly sick to sick people. However, the latter can really cure very sick people. Although prevention, or curing before they reach that status is highly advised as you need daily doses of the bottles to ensure survival of said sick person.\n\nBandages are needed for wounds. You really don't want to fight too much with a wounded person as that'll affect your survival chances drastically. They're a valuable commodity as well for trading, however crafting these is rather hard and they are a rare find as well.\n\nRevisiting the alcohol part, if someone is depressed a chug of these can help as well. The better quality you have, the better it is. If you have two depressed people you can even chug down one bottle for both of them! Requires an action when you mouse over them if possible though, the one next to the speech bubble. *NOTICE: When they are Drunk they are highly slow during the Day, and may become totally useless during the Night! Has a high chance on curing 'poor morale' statusses! (Warning, there is a minor chance that it may not cure it fully)\n\nNow the few 'negative' parts of the game.\n\nReplayability value: After several times even when locations, people within, events and your starting party it may become dull. There is no speed up option during boring parts of the game, such as everyone working or when nothing special happens when you dig with your hands in rubble when you forgot your shovel. Or have no resources for a shovel.\n\nItems. There is this very annoying 'single use filter' in which I'd like to see a more permanent object, perhaps a 'Sink Filter' decoration for your home or a 'Multi-Use Filter' that requires an advanced workbench to create would be a nice thing to add. I must stress the point you need this filter to filter water, to create alcohol. They are both used heavily ingame. There's also a limited amount of items you can craft ingame - it is already hard enough as it is, but more diversity might be welcome. Also why can't I equip clothes for example, or a bigger bag, or maybe one use shopping bags or leather bags to get more loot back from scavenging places? (You can equip weapons though, or the rare body armour if you find/craft any during a scavenging trip...)\n\nCombat. Essentially I've tested out the melee portion and it does not have much logic into who hits who first exception that you may get stun-melee locked. The only way to nearly surefire kill someone who is not armored is to have a Knife or Hatchet and kill them from behind undetected (icon will become orange for this). Shooting is better. Also - the round circle may be either partially or fully white. This may indicate success chances into meleeing your opponent first before they do so to you. More testing is required, but above all a more detailed explanation may be required from the developers.\n\nRNG. But hey, if you're looking at this game you may like roguelike games right? Sometimes luck is in your favour, sometimes not, sometimes totally in your favour only to screw it up at the end =3\n\nThere's probably tons of gameplay video's and streams out there including mines if you want to see more of it =P Guide here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=342751399 You may see me still streaming this game or other games at Twitch.Tv/Themeadowz!

It offers quite unique experience vastly different from any kind of nowdays popular games of this genre.\n\nPostive sides:\n\nGameplay - Although combat overall might seem fairly clunky while trying to pinpoint your mouse click on a little bubble above enemy's head, the amount of stuff you can craft, way you can survive, and assets you can use to improve your life in a little house you call shelter is astonishing. Not only that there's a way to craft all the essential stuff necessary for survival, but you can craft guns,traps,filters, make your own chair,bed,heater and many more. Scavenging was never more dangerous and fun at the same time. Your decisions WILL have an impact on the behaviour of an individual, leaving him either sad, depressed or completely broken. It really shows what kind of effect war leaves on man who's struggling to survive in this cold and long period where fighting is imminent. Trading is also part of the options you can do in order to maintain your resources balanced. You will often find yourself in a situation where all the materials you managed to collect won't be even close to the value of the bandage/food.\n\nStory -  Although lackluster and not really detailed since your main goal is to survive through a certain period of time, you will encounter all the different variety of quests where you have to decide whether you want to either help someone, or accept them into your group. Depending on your pick, "story" will unfold itself and you'll have different man source at your disposal. It's not the strongest attribute of this game, but definitely not the weakest link out there.\n\nSoundtrack - Apsolutely amazing soundtrack that follows you throughly whether you are in a tense situation where you are fighting for your life and trying to escape from bandits, or it's just a chilling atmosphere in your house, music will leave you impressed nonetheless.\n\nNegative sides:\n\nIt's really hard for me to "highlight" the bad sides of this game, mostly because there aren't the bad sides if you overlook the clunky combat. Most of the people will draw special attention to replayability of the game itself, but considering the variety of places you can visit, and different people you can encounter and accept into your group, this game will give you a solid 15-20 hours of gameplay, which frankly, is a lot given that "This War of Mine" accomplishes something that many games nowdays are unable to.\n\nI would rate this game as a solid 9.5, definitely Game of The Year contender, and I'm happy that I played this gem and not overlooked it.","November 24, 2014","true","7.3"," 86 of 89 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","86","89","0","0"

This war of mine is loosely based off "The Siege of Sarajevo" During the Bosnian war.\n\n\nThe gameplay is a point and click, resource management, meaning you have to click your characters and get them to do tasks such as make tools, cook food, sleep, and bandage any injuries. The game is divided into day and night cycles, during the day you manage your characters, )feeding them and making them sleep) build necessities, and manage resources. Nighttime consists of scavenging for supplies, with a singular character in a variety of locations. These could be bombed out homes, abandoned schools, or other survivors shelters. Sometimes the player might come across other survivors, sometimes friendly, sometimes violent. During night time the player must collect as many resources as possible in order to maintain their shelter and their characters needs. Occasionally your shelter may be raided during the night. This can be prevented by patching holes in the walls, and having weapons accessible for whoever is still in your shelter.\n\n\nThe shelter the player starts with is locked to that play-through. Although, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. There are only 2 home bases available (acquired randomly) both approximately the same size with the same starting materials. The player will start building things. This includes metalworking benches, herb/vegetable gardens, animal traps, and makeshifts stoves. These all make surviving significantly easier.\n\n\nDepending on the scenario you were playing, different locations available on the map (to loot and explore) unlock at different times, usually after a few days. Each location is different, with randomly generated supplies to be found. Sometimes location can have different scenarios, such as one play through the grocery store might have the military in it, and in another play through there might just be some scavengers. This adds immense replayability.\n\n\nThe sound in the game is over all well done. It adds a feeling of stress or concern. The art direction in the game, although basic, is a perfect match for the 2D side Scroller. The charcoal effects ingame add a feeling of darkness and dread, with almost 0 colour to be seen. Overall the art direction and sound are extremely well done, and fifth the game well.\n\n\nDepending on the scenario you playing, you'll be given certain starting characters. Each with their own abilities, backpack size, and potentially addictions. These characters need to be fed, rested, and kept in a good mood. They also need to be in good health. Your characters may get injured from raiders or scavengers, or sick from lack of heat in the shelter. They can also fall into a depression if the player controls them and a negative fashion. An example of this would be having your character steal from other survivors, or kill other survivors. This can be counterbalanced by doing maintaining them/entertaining them  or helping other survivors. The counter side to this, is in the event that someone asks for your help, and you refuse, your characters feel sad, potentially falling into a deep depression, preventing them from doing basic tasks, like eating, or defending the shelter. The same can happen if you let your characters get to hurt, too sick, or not take care of them properly. This adds more difficult to the game, becoming less about keeping them healthy but also about keeping them happy.\n\n\nThe ingame combat system is minimal. Most situations you will engage in melee combat with a melee weapon. Guns and ammunition are extremely hard to come by. In most situations, The player will save weapons for defending their shelter at night. The game overall doesn't want you to fight other survivors, it's not good for the characters sanity, or health. However if you decide to go down a path of stealing at The game overall doesn't want you to fight other survivors, it's not good for the characters sanity, or health. However if you decide to go down a path of stealing of and murdering,  be prepared to deal with depressed characters.\n\n\n\nThis war of mine does many things right:\n\n\n\nThe games graphic design and Soundesign are fantastic for the genre\n\nThe game is challenging in a good way\n\nIt tugs at the heart strings\n\nImmersive\n\nThe controls are good\n\nSteam workshop compatible\n\nExtremely satisfying when your characters survive the end of the war\n\nCan create your own scenarios\n\nOne of the deepest games in 2014\n\nHas DLC were you donate too children in real life affected by real war\n\nLots of replayability\n\n\n\nThis war of mine also does a few things wrong\n\n\n\nThey game can screw you over very easily, causing you to restart\n\nMay be extremely frustrating to some players\n\nSome achievements are extremely hard to get, if you're into that kind of thing\n\nSometimes to randomly generated world is more harsh than you can handle (Like real life)\n\nHits the feels\n\n\n\nOverall this war of mine is a fantastic game. For the price of 21,99CAD, some people might not think it's worth it, but others would say it's a bargain. Overall I think a lot of people should try this game, if you have any interest in the genre. Pick it up on sale if you can.","November 28, 2015","true","38.4"," 93 of 106 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","93","106","9","0"

The choices you make need to be thought out as some actions have either positive or negitive effects on your suriviors. You start with 2 ~ 4 random people in a shelled out home in the middle of what seems to be a civil war. The games art design is fitting to set the emotion & the somber music helps with this a lot. The game cycles between day ~ night. Day you fix your home ~ build items ~ get rest for the night. Night hits and the fun begins. Pick one of the 3 members to go looting, one to stand guard at home and best to have the 3rd rest for day time activities. Pick what tools you want to bring with you as you go out looting (saw blade~lock pick~crowbar~etc.)\n\nYou pick where you want to head off too, sometimes you don't see anyone and looting goes smooth, but what fun is that. Some of the survivors you come across are harmless and are just out looking for surplies like you, others maybe living where you go and you need to decided to loot them or leave and of course there is the chance they are bandits. We all know they just want to sell you the best long distance plan. There is plenty of random events and every time you start over your 3 survivors could all be different, the weather might of changed and I can promise you while the locations on the map might be the same going there will not be. Giving this game plenty of re-play ability.\n\nAverage game time is between 30 -50 days, thats right a survival game where there is a goal! Finally you have an objective, outlast the war & win, Don't be fooled this is not an easy game and has the ability to make you care about your survivors wanting to see them live to the end & sometimes having to choose who eats and who don't.\n\nFinal verdict 9  ~ 10\nThe only thing I wish and would make this game better is more of the same type of music, not the same thing on a loop.","November 16, 2014","true","83.6"," 61 of 65 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","61","65","0","3"

It doesn't hold back and it covers very mature subjects. The developers have kept a lid on some of what is involved, but there is murder, violence, theft of the most vulnerable and sexual assault.\n\nIt is an extremely dark tale, and your characters can do quite horrible acts to survive or protect others. This all meshes quite well with the mechanics, and everything has a cost, or a risk.\n\nRobbing the poorly defended hospital is a very good idea - medicines, actually functioning medicines (not the could-work herbal nonsense) can be traded for some of the most useful items around, or a lot of building items like wood and tools. However, the rest of your party will be disgusted with the thief for robbing those most in need, and the whole shelter will take a morale hit. You will take many of these, so get used to them.\n\nWith many similarities to the sims, you have to keep your survivors fed, rested, treated (if injured or sick) and non-suicidal. Managing sleep is very important, and there are a variety of debilitating status effects that take your survivors down from 100%.\n\nI recommend this game, and it is better than it looks - although the artistic direction is quite gorgeous and perfectly tailored to the desired experience. While some say it is depressing, there are moment of humour and just surviving a day or escaping pursuers with a full backpack of loot is tremendously rewarding. The bigger the risk, the bigger the win!\n\nIn closing I want to add one little extra fact. There are no saves per se. If you quit your game saves, but there are no saves to manipulate and no backsies. So if you lose someone, they are gone for good. This is an excellent design decision, and it will surprise pc players when they want to just reload a save, and find they can not do this. Pavle is gone, that is the end of his story.

Kind of like a relationship. You don't judge the person right away (even though first impressions leave a big impact!), so you stick around, treat them nice, hope they treat you well in return. Basically, this game has been a wonderful date. We even had discussions of marriage, briefly. The only problem is, she called me overly emotional and attached. Though I liked to work through all our problems together well, she has continuously made me cry and feel depressed. So we are on a break.\n\nIn reality, this game is a slice of that. It hits home hard where the heart is. If you play this game without exhibiting any empathy/sympathy for these characters in the game you grow attached to, then you are either a sociopath or you have a painful past that requires therapy and not this game.\n\nYou try so hard to be a hero, the leader. Making decisions. Who goes, who stays. Who can eat today. Who needs the medicine more. Do we need a bed or grow tobacco for trading goods? Every decision matters. Every death matters. Every consequence is dire and prolongs the torment of being dragged away from the light at the end of the tunnel--only to find out the light at the end of that tunnel is inevitably more pain and death. If this game was in 1st person (full immersion), I would probably kill myself from the pain.\n\nI love these developers, I love the animation, I love the gameplay and style and the somber music.\n\nI have trouble with the controls sometimes when ya want them to do an action or go somewhere especially in a moment of danger and necessity, but it is forgivable because you die anyway.\n\nGet now.","June 12, 2015","true","12.3"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","91","61","67","10","2"

This is an absolutely beautiful game. No game has ever impacted me as much as this one has, despite how minimalistic it may seem at first. But it is this minimalism that makes it so much more powerful and therefore have a greater impact. Most war games nowadays just show the "glory" of war - whether it be shooters or strategy games where you must crush all opposition. The games in which the civilian toll of war is explored are few and far between. Even strategy games where you besiege a city or planet to force the population to surrender gloss over the civilian toll. Probably the most notable instance of civilians being involved in a conflict game would be *that* level in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. But even then, This War of Mine is completely unique in that you are controlling the civilians. While you may encounter combatants from either side, you don't participate in the conflict at all, you just try your best to survive on the peripheries of the unmentioned Civil War tearing the city and its population apart.\n\nThis is a very meaningful game in ways unlike most others. War is Hell, and no game demonstrates this as well as this one does. There are many conflicts in the world right now, and civilian casualties are a very real, and very sad part of this reality. Having a keen interest in military history, and knowing just how destructive city sieges are/were, let alone the bombing raids on cities, this game really does strike home just how terrible war is. The hard choices that civilians must make in order to survive in such situations is a really important part of this game, and truly one of the standouts. Just like in the real world, there is no black and white, just a whole lot of greys. You are unlikely to make it out of this game feeling like a champion; there are terrible decisions to make one after the other. The decisions you must make, and the consequences of these decisions, are incredible, and I needed to take a break after some of these decisions. No spoilers here, but you may feel like a disgusting monster, or a hero, and well... will either decision even affect the survival of your own group?\n\nThe playable characters, though with Eastern European names due to the geographical setting, all have excellent back stories and personalities which actually influence how they may react. Some characters may be more or less willing to do certain things, and certain actions will either positively or negatively your group's morale. Being caught on combatants aren't the only hazards, however, starvation, dehydration, and depression can be, and are real killers in This War of Mine. Depression is particularly well handled in this game, given the tough choices you must make, and the effect that these choices will have on your group. Special mention owing to the difficult nature of depression and other mental illnesses.\n\nThe graphics and sound may not be complex, but they convey the themes of the game excellently. For the game's theme, the simple 2d side view of the game works better than something which would be provided by either a first-person or third-person perspective. The 2d nature of the game allows you to better encapsulate what it is all about, from building your shelter to scavenging for supplies. The audio is also brilliant, with a haunting soundtrack punctuated by the sounds of combat in the distance.\n\nMeaningful and excellent in a way that few games are, I cannot recommend this game enough.","January 31, 2015","true","21.8"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","55","58","0","2"

You play as a group of civilians trapped in a city beseiged by an ongoing war. Scavenge, trade, craft and even lie and kill your way to survival. The question is, how far would you go to survive? This War of Mine asks this question constantly, and it means it.\n\nOne highlight is how good the game is in connecting you with your survivors. I have felt despair, anguish, sadness and hope in my playthroughs. It's remarkable how the game accomplishes this although each playthough can be very differerent. The game sets you up with a different set of survivors each time you play, and many events and locations are randomly generated to a certain extent. You may see the same location in a subsequent playthrough but the events and circumstances might be different, prompting you to use a different strategy whist visiting. A market square bustled with survivors eagerly engaging in black market trade might become a dangerous, deserted spot preyed upon by hostile snipers in your next game.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time with This War of Mine.

The actual movement is side-scroller like, but nothing like a jump and run platformer. It performs more like a rouge like game, at least for me.\n\n\nSo where is this mixed feeling coming from...\n\nThis definitely is one of the best games I have played in years. The last game that had such a great atmosphere, graphics that worked so well with the soundtrack and had such an impact on me was back in 1997.  I do like fancy graphics, but this one proves again, it is not all about FPS, ultra settings or 4k.\n\nThis War of Mine feels like a piece of living art, where you are in the middle of a living hell. Just played it for a few hours so far, but I definitely need breaks between the sessions. I can't really explain what it is, that makes this game so beautiful and terrifying at the same moment.\n\nThe most significant part about this game is the mood it creates. There is no jump-scare, no pointless zombie-slaying or raiding some random areas to simply pimp up your base. What is so scary about this game is the psychological atmosphere it creates. It is dark, it seems hopeless all the time and what ever you do, in some way you may feel guilty for it. In terms of immersion and realism it is just an awesome game, maybe the best I ever played.\n\nDevs, thank you for this great game. I'd love to see this in schools, to experience history in a different way.\n\nWorth the price? Playing 1 hour, can't stop thinking about the situations the entire day, so yes it is totally worth it - maybe even more, since personal experiences are hard to value.\n\nWARNING:\n\nIf there are veterans out there playing games, you might wanna skip this one.

I loved every minute of it and had a difficult time stopping. So I ddin't. I played the game through... over four hours. The first three died and then the final survivor gave up. Very sad ending.  The game launches straight in the action and story line, with zero splash screens or tutorials, etc. The positive of this is that there is no time wasted and you get a realistic feel for the lost and hopelessness of the situation for civilians in a homeland war. The only drawback is that I was uncertain on the first night what I was packing. After fumbling with the controls that first night, and getting it wrong, you probably have a great idea of what you should have done. Sadly, experience is not the best teacher for survivors. I was hooked instantly, however, so I will be going back for a second try tomorrow, and hopefully this time I will make better choices.

While I don't really enjoy playing it, I am in awe of its power.\n\nI have played a lot of games in my 30+ years of life. I've played fun, casual, silly games that make me laugh, I've played highly technical games requiring skill and accuracy that make me rage, I've played puzzle games that really make you think and slap your forehead once you figure something out that's taking you too long, I've even played horror games meant to scare me, and I some have really made me scream. The point is that all games touch some emotional side of us, some hit their intended nerves deeper than others, but regardless of how much a game has affected me in this past, I've been able to get past my emotions and continue playing.\n\nThis War Of Mine is the exception. After I killed an elderly couple to survive, I had to stop playing. I can't even pinpoint what certain mechanic in the game managed to ring this bell in me, but I have never had such a deep emotional reaction to a game. I felt digusted with myself, completely lost and buried under a mountain of despair. As I clicked the buttons to bash their heads in with a shovel, I felt my soul turning black. I try to think of all those koopas I used to eject from their shell as Mario and wonder why I didn't empathize on the same level because, at the root, the two actions are the same: preying on the weak to succeed. So, why does it feel so much worse when I do it in This War Of Mine?\n\nFor this reason alone I am recommending the game, because no other game has ever been able to strike this sort of reaction in me, but I will never play it again.","April 15","true","11.5"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","38","39","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/282070/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","This War of Mine is a survival game made by 11 bit studios, who used to be known mainly thanks to the Anomaly series ("tower offence" games). This time they went with something completely different, as you'll have to get into lives of people who try to survive in partially destroyed house, in the middle of a war zone.\n\nTo survive all the terror outside your house, you have to keep people in healthy state (to the extent possible) - you have to fight their hunger, thirst and depressions, but also keep them prepared for raids - being armed is helpful. From morning to evening, you'll be taking care of all basic needs of your characters by reasonable use of your collected resources like herbs, meat, wood and metal. It may seem complex but the whole crafting system is pretty simple and there isn't a huge amount of items you can have; you'll get known of most items in first hours. But where you'll get all those important resources? At the beginning, you'll find them in the ruined house you try to live in, but sooner or later you have to send out your characters to scavenge the other houses during the night.\n\nThat's the phase where the game swaps from resource management to 2D stealth game, where the whole outcome is only up to you. You can try to rob army deserters, or you can be afraid of them and rather pick the house where ill and old people live. But what will you do if somebody finds you and protects their property? There comes the important part of This War of Mine - all your scavenging brings even more depression to all characters that you control. Even though they have pretty limited amount of dialogues among themselves, you'll still feel the emotional press coming from your actions. Let's say that you won't mind killing other people for food - congratulations, character who kills will get truly depressed and other will be disgusted of him. And what if you don't kill? Congratulations, character will feel depressed because of stealing other people's things, and other will also get disgusted. Or you can just let them die, if you feel that's the better option.\n\nGraphic style of the game is a great one, it doesn't require a strong hardware to play it since it's a combination of 3D models and drawn textures and effects with a really specific style (you can see it in screenshots). Low HW requirement is also the positive fact for players not just on Steam, as This War of Mine is also ported for mobile platforms (Android, iOS) - that seems obvious from the controls, as they are really touch-friendly, maybe too much for PC standards. All movement is done just by clicking to a specific place, and all actions are done by clicking on small icons over every object that you can interact with.\n\nConclusion:This War of Mine isn't overall much complex and isn't even long (few hours for a single scenario is enough), but the game's quality tops at the atmosphere and story based on despair. You may think that you can survive without hurting others (somehow) but you'll be forced to compromise pretty soon. There's no good way, there's only "wrong" and "somehow lesser wrong" way, but at least you can manage to survive the war.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","April 22","true","13.0"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","0"

Survive at all costs...I thought.\n\n...\n\nWe have made it through...not without losses and tough choices though...\n\n\nAs many have asked, I will add short review as well.\n\nIn this game your target is to survive throughtout the war. With stylish graphics and soundtrack combination you will actually feel yourself in the war times. A lot of choices you will have to make during a single run will add up the atmosphere just as much as other things do. You will hate yourself for the choices you have made. You will search for an explanation for your violent crimes trying not to associate yourself with bandits. You will see how moral can be twisted and how people can change while fighting for survival. Game is extremely punishing for wrong choices. You can loose everything in just couple of days. Even if you have food, goods for trade, weapons, workshops etc. With several sets of starting characters, decent-sized world and several random events the game has a certain replayability. With all the drawbacks and flaws the game has it is still a truly unique experience in the Steam store and it is far deeper than many zombie/post-apocalypse or whatever survival games currently on the market. The overall great and deep atmosphere covers up all the flaws so you can easily name it an outstanding game. I do.\n\nOutstanding game.\n8,7/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/282070/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","With the proliferation of technologies such as computers, smartphones and the internet, it is easier to see and more apparent than ever that the world around us is constantly changing. And not always for the better. With militants ravaging the Middle East, rebels vying for control of Eastern Ukraine, and the conflict between Israel and Palestine still raging on, its difficult not to feel like things are sliding towards a tipping point, a new global conflict even. Games depict wars, real and fantasy, all the time, and, if the likes of Call of Duty and Battlefield are anything to go by, those kinds of experiences are very popular. But we don’t often find ourselves connecting or giving a second thought for the civilians caught in the crossfire, trying desperately to survive. This War of Mine turns things on its head, you aren’t a soldier, kitted out in the latest combat gear, you are average citizens trapped amongst the fighting, doing whatever is necessary to survive. It’s brutal, thought-provoking, and yet another sign that games have matured as an art medium.\n\nThis War of Mine doesn’t simply tell the tale of a lone survivor, caught in a war zone, instead you’ll have dominion over three randomly selected characters (initially) and guide them through each day, trying your best to keep them fed, healthy and as happy as they possibly can be. Luckily, they’ll have the relative safety of a small dilapidated house to take shelter in.  It’s not much but it’s a good starting point. By scavenging inside, or at other locations, you can collect materials to fix up the house to make life more comfortable for the inhabitants, and you can build beds, stoves, radios and workshops. These little extras help to keep morale up and depression at bay. Materials don’t come cheap in the middle of a war zone, though, and somebody is going to have to pay a price for them – be it in coin, or in blood.\n\nRunning low on food and medicine is not an option if everyone is going to make it to the other side of the war intact. The brutal lengths that you may have to go to are uncensored and unglorified, and while murdering an elderly couple for their food and jewellery may initially shock, it becomes second nature after a while. And that’s the grizzly reality of war: sometimes, you must be absolutely ruthless to survive.\n\nThese realisations can deeply affect your survivors, and they may become deeply troubled by the events going on around them. Each has their own mood indicators highlighting whether they are hungry, tired or depressed, and their effects are almost immediately apparent. Characters who have fallen into depression will drag their almost lifeless bodies around the squat ruminating over the events that have happened, asking themselves ‘why?’. Other characters may take note of this and try to help by talking with them. Each character also keeps a diary with details of the events from days gone by; depending on the situation you may see your characters attitudes change before your eyes. Characters whom have murdered others may initially regret their decision, only to accept it later as an inevitability, required in order to stay alive. This War of Mine may sound emotionally draining to play, and it is; 11 Bit Studios have struck a delicate balance and created a title that is as entertaining to play as it is emotionally compelling\n\nEach day is split into two sections which see your survivors fixing up the house to make it more comfortable during the day, and going out scavenging at night. Some aspects of the game have a “The Sims” feel to them, with you having to tend to everyone’s needs such as feeding them, keeping them comfortable and dispensing medication if they are sick. Scavenging at night can be very dangerous, especially if you intend to come home with anything useful, so it is wise to stay armed. A nifty crafting interface allows you to create all manner of different items such as lockpicks, axes, shovels and hack saws, which can be used to reach particularly valuable loot. Each scavenging location requires careful consideration before you set off though, and you’ll pay the price if you go out without the proper equipment. It is very easy to lose characters to militants or, other, better-armed survivors.\n\nSometimes, while out scavenging, you’ll encounter other violent and non-violent NPCs, and whether you engage them or no is up to you. Combat isn’t particularly in-depth but it doesn’t need to be. You can switch from scavenging mode to armed at the click of the mouse, but your adversary may become aware and attack you. Simply clicking on an enemy is enough to send you stabbing/punching/shooting in their direction. The impact doesn’t come from the combat itself, rather the effect it can have on your character – and you. As aforementioned, whilst out scavenging at an old cottage we found a friendly old couple, relaxing in their armchairs. Sadly, their number was up before we even caught sight of them; our fridge was empty, we had no valuables or medicine. Luring the old man down to the basement, we began beating him mercilessly with a shovel. “Don’t leave me!” cried his wife, as we set about her. We couldn’t help but pause for thought – would we do the same in a similar situation?\n\nThis War of Mine isn’t a delight to look at, but its aesthetic is expertly crafted. The city is awash in dark blacks and greys which inspire a feeling of desolation and despair. unfortunately we were subject to a number of graphical glitches and stuttering issues, which should be patched out post-launch.\n\nAs a game, This War of Mine is sensational, as a story it is gripping, but it is as a statement that it makes its biggest impact. Whilst most of us (hopefully) will never know what it is like to live in a war zone, it’s important to know that there are people, like us, out there surviving in horrific situations. It is an unforgettable survival horror game, but not as you know it. 11 Bit’s presentation of war is candid, undiluted and bound to leave a lasting impression.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReceived a review copy from the developers for review purposes.

Very fair price for a game which is very unique. If you are a fan of post apocalypse games then this is one for you. It will take a few play fews to get the hang of it as you are thrown in the deep end with no guide on how to play the game though.\n\nThis game brings you into a city caught in the middle of civil war, you get to witness events from the soldiers and rebels - some bad, some good and some you have to watch and can't do anything about. Every time you send one of your characters out to savange you are constantly worrying about what to pick up and what you need the most, every scavange matters!\n\nI normally don't enjoy games which tend to avoid combat, however "This War of Mine" has pulled it off in such an amazing way. The world really does pull you in, I love the encounters with the rebels or soldiers.\n\nSome key points:\n- Each play through is different, maps do change!\n- A decent amount of events.\n- Real sense of a post-apoc world.\n- Loads of crafting! (Weapons, ammo, armour, household objects, medical supplies, food)\n- Can't let your people die via starvation, health... they can even commit suicide if they become depressed (gain by killing innocent people, your people have decent morals).\n\nReal fun game, still playing it now.

Pavle found heaps of materials, spare parts, wood. Pretty soon we were able to fortify our home. We grew accustomed to it. In the beginning we got raided on what felt like a regular basis. And they always went for the food and water. It got tougher.\n\nEveryday we listened to the radio. Gotta know what's going on out there, right? Radio has been telling us about an increasing rate of crimes and robberies. No ♥♥♥♥, Sherlock...\nWe got hungry. Then we got very hungry. Night came and again our home was chosen for a raid. But not this time. We closed every hole in our walls and we were armed - well we had a shovel - but it worked. We managed to fend of our first raid. Things were looking up. Then it drew on us. What good is all our wood, fortification and our shovel, if we can't eat.\n\nWe've scavenged quite a few locations by now. Always came back with our backpacks filled to the brim, but lacking food and water. We grew sad. One of us grew ill. We gave him some medication and let him sleep it off. The rest of us sat down on our two armchairs around our radio, listening to classical music. It felt strange to sit on those comfy armchairs, fancy music echoing from the walls, while we were lacking the bare essentials. My stomach rumbled, then somebody knocked on the door.\n\nIt was a woman, self proclaimed singer. A cheery girl in a good physical condition. She asked if she could stay with us. We weren't even able to feed three people but hell, I liked her. We let her stay with us. She might be able to lift our spirits. A good girl she was.\n\nNight came once more. With all of us quite shaken up from the dire situation, we sent the new girl out to scavenge. The other three of us were close to starvation. What happened then, is what the new girl told us the next morning.\nWhile we fended off yet another raid, she did...well, what had to be done. You know, there was this lonely elderly couple living just a few blocks from us. Our new girl visited them. They asked her to leave, to spare their food. They begged her. When she began ransacking through their stuff, they fled to the attic. Waiting for everything to be over. We took their food, took their water. Even took some jewelry for bartering later down the road. We did not take their medical supplies...they would need them pretty soon...thanks to what we took from them.\n\nNext day the new girl told us about that night while we ate our first cooked meal in days. We were still hungry. What have we done? Depression took the better part of us and we spent the day together around the radio - comforting each other. That night, everybody stayed at home. Everybody slept.\n\nCouple of days later, things are not as bad. We're still kinda sad and food is an ongoing issue, but we managed to build a device to collect and filter rainwater and we caught our first small animals to fight the hunger. Supply around town is running low though and we need to take bigger risks. We built knives. Everyone of us has one now. Our home stands. Each night one of us is going out there to provide for the group. Until now, they've always returned. And until now, only once, we had to do the bad thing.

We were out of food and desperate.  We put our hopes in that there would be food in the apartment complex that was basically blown in half during the shelling.  One half was empty but we knew the other half had a group in it.  We often heard gunfire coming from the building meaning they might be hostile.  It was risky but we were desperate.\n\nIt was simple.  We would take from the empty half of the building and let the other half keep their stuff.  Marko went that night.  The only way he could approach was from the inhabited side.  I climbed the ruble to the second story and used a crowbar to break in.  I then headed to the next door inside and peaked through.  There were two women on the other side.  One told of a scavenger on the other half searching for items.  The other responded by saying that, "John" would kill them.  Kill them.  But it's just a scavenger.  He wasn't a bandit breaking into this side.\n\nOne of the women went upstairs and the other started walking towards my door.  I quickly got up and hid in the closet.  The women entered the room and checked her items, then left from the same door she came in.  I could hear her go upstairs.  Now was my chance.  I left the closet and opened the door.  Only stairs upwards and another door.  I went through the next door.  I opened it to see a man with a sniper rifle aimed at the next building.  This was John.  standing at the end of the building.  He screamed for the other scavenger to show themselves.  I considered going around but John would see me crossing to the other side.  And he would most likely kill me.  Was this what the gunshots were?  Not self defense but killing scavengers on the other half?\n\nI pulled out the crowbar.  If I don't get these supplies, we'll die.  If I cross to get them, John will kill me.  And he is already threatening to kill another.  This is justified right? I slowly approached him from behind, and swung.  I wounded him but didn't kill him.  He then yelled at me saying, "it would be the last thing I ever did" and brought his powerful rifle around to aim at me.  No.  I can't get shot.  We don't have any food let alone medical supplies.  With new found fear I swung again.  And again.  I saw that one last hit could do it.  And begun to swing.  He then yelled, "please don't kill me!" and began to let go of the rifle.  But it was too late.  I was already swinging at his head.  I hit him and he fell off the second story of the building and down to the ground. Dead.\n\nHe was giving up.  I could have taken the weapon and let him live.  If only I hadn't attacked to kill.  I might not have swung so eagerly.  But I was scared.  It was his fault.  He was going to shoot me.\n\nI then heard the women coming from downstairs.  I got ready for another fight.  But they ran right by me.  One got on her knees at the edge of the building and began crying.  The other stood between us.  Fear in her eyes with no weapon.  I paniced.  I did this.  He's dead because of me.  I ran.  Without any of the stuff I needed.  I headed back.  Marko entered the safehouse and the following message appeared.\n\nThe night was calm.","November 16, 2014","true","40.1"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","41","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/recommended/282070/","MTizzler","Dark MT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MTizzler/","483 products in account","As usual, a tl;dr for the lazy:\n+ Emotionally driven mechanics, very well executed\n+ Nice art style though nothing incredibly noteworthy\n+ Interesting concept in a popular gaming trope\n- Adolescent and frankly infantile writing\n- Characters are, honestly, very unlikeable\n- The "randomization" is severely limited\n- There is mundanity in the mechanics that does not exhibit an emotional response the same as 'Papers, Please' does.\n\nRead More:\n\nFirst off, I really don't think the game is particularly amazing. It is noteworthy in its mechanics and it does portray emotion relatively well but to write it off as something incredible is a frankly exaggerated overstatement made by typical reviewers in the indie sub-industry that supplements the credulous nature of its audience.\n\nThe writing, my biggest complaint:\nI think games such as these require a strong connection between players and the characters- in this particular game I have found perhaps two I could stand. Most if not all of them are beyond unlikeable (♥♥♥♥ bruno, seriously. And ♥♥♥♥ that edge-master militia guy too). Consequently, this ends up as a limit on the amount of empathy a player can muster to the "story" of the game. Those who don't have a larger necessity to character-build and personally develop a mental image of characters will be able to get away from this problem relatively well so take what I say with a grain of salt, it's personally subjective after all.\n\nAn Example: http://gyazo.com/4f9f347cb58c865e13924896493364bc\n\nAs for the comments many players hold about "a survival game without zombies, finally!" except you can imagine a zombie survival game, subtract all the zombies and this would be the exact same. Humans are potential threats, you struggle to survive and scavenge for essentials. That's it. There is little relatively relevant to a war in a mechanical sense so the context becomes frankly wasted, largely underutilised and superflous. Perhaps I missed something in my playthroughs but this appears to be the case.\n\nFurthermore, the game is by no means a piece that will represent the struggles and complexities of war because the writing, as I stated before, is incredibly infantile, limited and practically reads like an edgy story a teenager wrote in his late teens when one has just started learning the nature about the true atrocities of the world and history. This is exactly that, since all the game's storytelling, writing and efforts to set up a plot boil down to "♥♥♥♥ the war", "war is x", "look what the war is doing to us", hell the trope "war never changes" applies here perfectly and not in a good sense. I appreciate the attempts to try and provide a civilian perspective to war and to a certain extent it's achieved but only in a miniscule scope of the subject and in a very adolescent display.\n\nWhy not expand on the war itself? You have victims of this arbitrary entity that's seemingly wiped the nation and wrecked its civilian livelihood but such little context is given other than "both sides are bad guys because they ♥♥♥♥ us over", why are they bad? What do they do? What fighting was there? We don't know anything other than a basic evil that's displayed over us as a contextual cue. Please tell me if I'm wrong, I'll happily accept evidence of such but I got little more than some basic lines about "war is this" and "war is that" and "the militia is fighting them" and "we dont trust the militia" well, christ, why?\n\nMechanics:\nWhat the game does very well is the initial emotional shock you get playing, killing and scavenging. These are all superb by design and implementation, however, they are also very difficult to replicate thereafter. I would compare this to playing a game from the souls series for the first time, getting through the ropes and understanding the system is very satisfactory, whilst in this particular title it's very impactful emotionally. You are hit when you realise the actions you took had consequences far beyond what you could imagine. You are hit when you realise the game's mechanics will force you to almost keep everyone hungry or very hungry as you struggle to ration food out. I'll stop there to avoid spoiling the experience for you, but as I state, it's portrayed beautifully.\n\nBut there are also limitations here and they are certainly not to be ignored. There was no mechanic to display group mechanics on the move for example, only back at base. How groups tackle situations would have been far more interesting than one person who does not interact with the environment other than with what the player does. This means that the game wanted you to create your own story- a fallacious objective when all you can do is limited to scavenging, possibly murdering, bartering and perhaps sometimes helping someone in an odd encounter. The whole time I was playing I was wary of assisting people, I was sometimes rejecting assistance itself and not attempting to help others when they needed it, not because my group needed supplies or anything but because I was afraid of what they could potentially do. I would credit this to the nature of the game and to some degree the game is responsible but this is largely from my own experience, I don't know if the game has such encounters of betrayal but I certainly never saw such.\n\nFor the record, I come from Myanmar, a country that suffered war for a long time and I myself have lost loved ones under it. Playing through this game, I felt like the author simply wanted to display the absolute horror of it as opposed to the daily mundanity people have to live through, listening to the radio is worthless because it only updates in between every few days, days are so limited your characters are going through processes to ensure you finish building everything, they've eaten etc. within the time limit. You decide what to do on occasions with people who come to the door, and these are quite nice encounters that are well scripted for the most part, much more so than the characters and their backstories which I felt were the weakest point in the game.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks good, that's all I can say. Characters are gritty, they blink (which is creepy and quite cool that they implemented that), the war torn environment is done nicely I suppose and the graphics quality is quite well made. The game runs smoothly but that's unsurprising considering the indie nature of the art direction but it is still commendable. I have had one crash through my gameplay and for me that's relatively acceptable in an increasingly error heavy industry.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nAll in all a good game, but by no means an amazing piece of work nor game of the year material as many have stated, I would say it's better to buy it on a sale than at full retail. But that's me personally, if you were to ask me about the title without a price tag, I would tell you that it's worth a buy nonetheless. However, approaching this title with great expectations will leave many disappointed and I personally believe many of the steam reviews here are unsanitary in the nature they portray this game's emotional impact- there is so much more to a game than that, and sadly this particular title seems to have either forgotten or failed to drive attention to them. Between this title, Wasteland 2, The Last of Us, Fallout and The Walking Dead, there are very few titles of noteworthy mention in a very congested genre/trope that's become little more than a pile of drivel, consisting of poorly made titles that boast emotional prowess when in reality the capacity of such is usually little more than an initial impact of "well, humans are terrible".","November 17, 2014","true","4.8"," 55 of 71 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","55","71","0","0"

I was so pre-occupied with crafting, building, designing a safe haven, that I forgot to feed my people. I got desperate.\n\nA lazy cottage was not far, and it looked undisturbed. On my 3rd outing it was my choice as word was, there was a lot of food there. For some reason, I didn't send my regular guy, but instead someone more "fresh-faced". No idea why, perhaps she needed to get out more, spend less time sleeping or crafting.\n\nThe house is as quiet as expected... after looting through the rubbish outside, I suddenly spot a fire place... alight...? Surely that means that I won't be alone in the house... I take a peak through keyhole, lo and behold an elderly couple sit quietly, peaceful either side of the cosy flames, exchanging small talk.\n\nHusband - "I know, honey, I know"\nWife - "Maybe we'll have a nice dinner tomorrow?"\n\nF*ck... well, they might be peaceful after all, perhaps I could barter with them. Make an agreement. I make my own way into the house.\n\nHusband - "Oh... how did you enter...?"\n\nHe approaches me at the door, God, I hope this guy can help me out. All 3 of us need food... his wife calls after him,\n\nWife - "Is something wrong, my dear?"\n\nHe's at the door.\n\nHusband - "I'm afraid we can't do anything for you..."\n\nNo option to barter... no option to talk. I need this food, I need to eat, my guys back at the shelter are starving I don't know what to... the shovel is equipped....\n\nHusband - "What are you doing...? Put it down."\n*PAUSE*\nHusband - "Put it down, please"\n\nOh, Jesus, don't plead with me. I'm the desperate one here, I'm the one who should be pleading with you. But I can't. I'm so sorry...\n\nHusband - "Jelena, run!"\nWife - "BANDITS! HELP!"\n\nThe man bolts downstairs to the basement, but Jelena unwittingly heads straight for me.\n\nJelena - "I'm calling for help!"\n\nIt is a 'double-tap' affair. The lady hits the floor, after 1 more hit than I had predicted.\n\nHusband - "What was that...? No, it's can't be! Please, speak to me!"\n\nThe man runs back up from the basement to discover his own personal hell in front of him. Standing there, over his dead wife. He cries for help moments before the second blow, but I assume there is no help coming...\n\n--------\n\nThis place is a gold mine. There's enough food to take home, including some more to come back for. I rinse the refrigerator, and the closet, but my bag is full before I even reach the other 2 floors. On return, my scavenger is not in the high spirits of someone who has found enough food to last a few days. She wishes she had never left the shelter. It would appear her actions have taken over her, and she continues to regret her decisions. I knew there was a reason I should have build that ♥♥♥♥ing radio.\n\n--------\n\nOn return to the house, the new scavenger raids the leftovers and finds a letter.\n\n"A letter from Grandpa Bernard to Alen"\n\n"We're happy to learn that you've come to like living with auntie. The war is not that bad, it's just not for children. In fact, they say it will be over soon, so don't worry about us. Grandma is feeling better. She asked me not to tell you, but she's saving some flour to make you those cookies you like!

Scavanged old couple house (and hit the old man with a shovel of course), ignored to help a man who was going to save his baby (he was shot down by a sniper anyway and the baby couldn't make it), and one of my men got killed when he was trying to save a homeless guy.\n\nThose stuff, are the 3 examples of the situations you're going to see in this game. You need to choose a very tough decission. You may use your instinct to do that, but you'll regret it later. If you killed a guy, it will give your survivor(s) a morale hit. If the situations are worsen, they might commit suicide and the game ends.\n\nThe game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. There aren´t just soldiers fighting for their lives, there are groups of civilians too, fighting for their own life. Struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. You can't change the way the world works, but the world will push you to change the way you live. This game will show who you truly are. In the end of the day, as long as you live on this planet, you will realise, you are not as nice as you thought.\n\nTL;DR : Whatever decission i chose in the game, it gives my men and I a morale hit and makes me think what i have done to my life.

When I walked into the house I knew I was going into someone elses house. It wasn't abandoned, but I was just going in to get a few things sneakily and then I was going to leave. I needed some construction materials, maybe some food.\n\nWhen I walked upstairs I heard a noise. It was the guy I had heard talking to himself earlier, speaking of how he was taking care of his family, how his elderly grandmother didn't have anyone else who could take care of her at this point.\n\nI stood in the doorframe, out of sight, but he walked in, looking suspicious. He must have heard me. Within an instant he walked right up to the doorframe I was hiding in and I grabbed my knife. I had a second to choose between stabbing him while I still had the element of surprise, and letting this guy go. Maybe he'd just shoo me off if he found me. Maybe he'd shoot me dead in an instant.\n\nTerrified I lunged at him, stabbing him in the chest, killing him instantly. I found a gun on him and took it too, satisfied that I did the right thing, that this guy probably would have killed me.\n\nIt wasn't until I was running for the exit that in the last second I saw his mother walk in, and collapse next to his body.

It's not easy and most decisions are definitely not black and white.\n\nYou are tasked with controlling a group of survivors (I've heard you can unlock a solo variation) who are simply trying to make it in hopeless situation. Along with the variety of moral dilemmas that you face is a bit of mildly challenging resource management. When crafting, not only do you have to consider the materials needed but also the time it will take to accomplish goal x/y/z. The game also features a rich amount of dialogue from not only your characters (check out their cool biographies) but the places you visit at night during your looting runs. It adds a lot of character to the game and makes some decisions even harder to make.\n\nThere's a lot more to this game but it's honestly better to just take a look and see for yourself.

It really comes down to if you're going to see another day.\n\nThe first time of deciding should I bring home some scraps to build an upgraded stove, or the extra herbs to make some medicine for a member of my group who was wounded in a raid alone was a hard choice to make in the longevity of my groups survival.

It is a unique idea  for survival which is far away from Zombies and bravely detaches itself from the rest of the swarm - that is all the recent survival video games based on a Zombie apocalypse...\n\nHowever,  I can't recommend the game;  read on and you will realize why, and also  see at the end  the section called:  - IMPORTANT EDIT\n\nIn  'This War of Mine'  you take on the role of three survivors. Although I haven't played alot(~7hrs), I understand that they are 9 overall characters and each time you play, you get to control three different ones, each with his own, unique abilities, such as "Good Cook," "Good Scavenger," and so on, which give minor advantages to certain skills (The Good Scavenger has 5 more backpack slots, for example).\n\nAll this happens in the same building (same in every run) which serves as your outpost. During the day, you supposingly add/create stuff for your 2D outpost such as beds and chairs. During the night, you are supposed to go outside and scavenge from other 2D buildings that usually are occupied by other, friendly-or-not survivors IN ORDER TO BUILD during the day. However, your backpack space is so limited that there is no way you can scavenge the whole place in one run, you will have to wait another full day to get back to it, even if you scavenged for 1 hour and there are 6 more hours remaining until daylight (enough to return the supplies and go back for more).\n\nSO, YOU BUILD STUFF  (there are not that many options to build)  DURING THE DAY (or you simply do nothing cause you have no supplies 90% of the time) AND YOU SCAVENGE DURING THE NIGHT IN ORDER TO BUILD THE NEXT DAY (and eat).  And repeat.\n\nAnd, this is pretty much it.\n\nIt is fun for the first 4-5 in-game days but then it gets  pretty repetitive;  if you add on that  the game's extremely slow-pace  then there you have it.\n\nYou will find yourself almost MOST of the day doing nothing but watching your survivors sit idly around, tapping your foot on the floor while begging for a "Speed-up Time" button since materials to build stuff in your outpost and therefore DO SOMETHING (pass the time) are scarce, or you simply CAN'T take enough during the night because of the greatly limited inventory you have. So,  you will either  have to click "SKIP DAY" and miss the WHOLE day in order to go straight to night  (which you can go out and scavenge),  but at the same time, by skipping the day you are missing opportunities such as other survivors coming at your home to Trade, or seek help, etc.  OR  you will have to sit idly and watch the screen, waiting for the time to pass.\n\nIn addition, in all my attempted playthroughs, it is as if your outpost is cursed. Your survivors, 99% of the time will be both sick and wounded, always limbing and unable to do pretty much anything. I understand that it is a time of war, but lets be realistic, they are not soldiers to be hurt (you spend 90% of the time inside your outpost, like you would in your own home in your everyday life) AND there is  NOT  a plague to have you be sick all the freakin' time.\nIn order to test it, I had 1 out of the 3 survivors rest for days while a message said: 'recovering,' to find out that he never became well - as if bugged, so I am going to edit this part of my review if it turns out to be a bug, and not the actual gameplay.\n\nMoreover, another annoying element is that other survivors will raid your place while you are outside at night, stealing your stuff and 'wounding' your survivors. Even if you can't control it, can't you at least command your survivors not to fight back, so that they won't end-up hurt or miraculously sick after the raid all the time?\nOn that, the raids are  awkward.  You may have 5 items of food in your fridge (food is very rare and you will always be hungry - which is ok since there is a war going on) and instead of raiding your stuff and taking everything, as they would IRL, they grab x1 Chicken Breast and then leave... which is weird... so you call that a 'raid'?!\n\n\n------>  Finally,  for replayability reasons  (as most people state) the war may randomly end at any time.  However, I don't see how that adds to replayability. You will do the SAME stuff for either 15 in-game days, or you will do the same stuff for 30 in-game days. It's the same thing.  EVERYTHING else remains the same. Buildings, locations, people -  everything.\n\nWith this amount of content then, and its lack of replayability, the game does not, by any chance, excuse the 20 euro it costs. So, if I had to recommend it for a certain price, that would be 7 to 8 euros maximum!\n\nI am not gonna give a score to the game and I will restate that I believe it is a good one.\nHowever, to me, I simply can't find enjoyment by doing the same things over and over again, in  such a slow-paced  game while 40% of the time just watching the screen for the day to pass.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT:\nAs is the case with most  Overwhelmingly Positive  titles, feel free to start spamming the Down-Vote button as if you own the game and I suddenly 'hurt it' or 'insulted it' - I don't mind at all. One of my characteristics (or perhaps weaknesses) is my  honesty,  and I am not going to praise a title that I did not - myself - enjoy, just because they donated a small amount to charity  (DO NOT HATE, READ ON!)  I heard from people that, the money of their latest DLC (0.99) goes to charity,  and to me this TRULLY is awesome,  but this is not reason enough to give it a false and unrealistic review.\n\nSo, please, hear me out on this!\nIt is indeed an awesome move what they did , but here, I am reviewing the  GAME.  Even if the 20 euro for it all went to charity, I'd still down-vote it, because I am reviewing  the GAME itself,  and not the action behind it. If I wanted to spend money on charity (which I do once a year) I would do so immediately and not through a game.\n\nThe above is what I found in-game and represents my own and only opinion on the game:  I do NOT recommend it.\nI hope I've been helpful to you.","March 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 1,081 of 1,779 people (61%) found this review helpful 95 people found this review funny","61","081","1","95","70"

The whole game revolves around keeping a group of survivors alive for the duration of the war, which includes keeping them fed, rested, warm, treated for any sickness (meds) or wounds (bandages) and also keeping tabs on their mental wellbeing, which I learned early on is very important as I lost a character to suicide.\n\nThe gameplay basically revolves around activities in your safe house during the day, which include things like building beds, stoves, work benches, etc and then building and managing supplies like food, fuel for the heater, filters for clean water,  and ammo etc.  As night falls, you have to choose which characters will sleep, which will guard and which will go scavenging for supplies. You have to balance sleeping with guarding, as you can’t let your people get too tired, but you also run the risk of getting raided each night by bandits, which leaves you with supplies stolen and possibly wounded characters.\n\nScavenging at night, now this is where the real fun of it came in for me. You can’t go in guns blazing as you usually scored yourself a pretty quick death. In the end I found the most effective form of combat was to hide in the shadows, and bait each enemy close to me so I could finish them with my knife. But, you have to balance who you kill as killing can have huge consequences on your team’s mental health. In the end it was easier to only kill when needed, as I didn’t have to worry about anyone getting sad or depressed.\n\nAll in all I had a heap of fun learning the game, and after having just completed my first play through, I look forward to playing through again with all the tricks that I learnt.  I highly recommend this game for all fans of strategy or even just someone looking for something a little different. Even at full price, I think there is a lot of fun to be had.","January 8, 2015","true","30.8"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","28","31","0","3"

I didn't want to start playing this game.\n\nNot because this is a good game...It is a wonderfully made 2D suvival simulater set in a besiged city.\nYou are not soliders in the war but you are a team of one to four civilian survivor to do everything possible to survive..\n\nWill you steal? Will you murder? Will you rob the elderly and doom them to death?\n\nWonderfully pencil draw graphics .. awesome music/songs (some are sad...Will there be a dlc for original sound track in the future?). Simple survial element of crafting and building type of game play. Very basic combat situations that don't happen very offen.\n\nThere are practically everything done perfectly for this game... except it sets in a very sad background. Civilian in war is hard... Simulate in game is already hard enough for me to make a lot moral decision in order to survive. I cannot not even imaging what true war will bring if it happens to me in real life.\n\nGame play is quite simple but very unforgiving since there are no save option except a daily ironman type autosave.\n\nSurvive for those 45 days if you can! Once you finish this game and put it down.. make sure you make peace not war in RL.\n\n9.5/10 A masterpiece suvival game that survival fan must play!","June 3","true","39.3"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CryingMoon/recommended/282070/","CryingMoon","Crying","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CryingMoon/","109 products in account","I would like to start this review by stating the fact that this was the first game that I FULLY played through. Before I had good games, bad games, but I always restarted them after learning a new tip, or if somebody died, etc. So this was the first playthrough I went with all the way. Now we can begin.\n\nI had just unlocked a new story, with a set of some of my favorite characters, so of course I reset my current game to try out this new set of characters that I was rather excited to play as!\nBut, as the camera started to pan into the house, I noticed it was snowing.\nI got a winter start. I didn't know what to do, I had never survived to winter before! So I went about as usual, not noticing that I already had a furnace down in the bedroom. Night hit and I just did what I normally do, scavenge for materials then come back and build. But when I came back both of the people I had left at the base were ill, so I let them rest and rinse and repeat a few days.\n\nAt about Day 6, Marin became terminally ill, he was going to die. I scrounged up my tobbaco, made some cigs, and traded for some meds at the Military Outpost. But, apperantly I stayed to long, and after trading a soldier opened fire on me, hoping to get their supplies back. I ran back with the meds, albiet with Katia wounded, and was going to give them to Marin, but the other survivor, Arica, had also fallen terminally ill, and was dieing. I had to choose between Arica and Marin, and I chose Arica. She still had a chance, she could survive!\nThey both survived longer than expected, but Marin was constantly ill, and never did anything other than eat.\n\nAt around day 8-9, I went on a scavenging run with the now slightly better Arica, to an apartment building inhabited by a small family. I ran into the middle of the house, opened the fridge, stole everything in there, and ran out before the eldest son could shoot me. When I got back, everybody was absolutley torn at what I did, and they all sat on the floor and just stayed there, wasting a day, and a night, as they did nothing.\n\nThat night, Marin left the group, leaving a Broken Arica and a depressed Katia in his once home. I didnt have anything to do for the next 2 days-nights, so I waited.\n\nOn day 13, Arica died due to diesease, and then there was one, a heartbroken Katia. She sat on the floor all day, and did nothing. And that night, she commited suicide by cutting her wrists, and laying on her bed.\n\nThere was nobody left, the base was empty, other than the faint smell of blood.\n\nAt the end of the game, you get a runthrough of all the important events that happened, and what happened to the characters after the war, no matter if you win or lose.\n\nAs I sat and watched what happened during the game, I realized how much I would be torn if I had to do these things, and then I felt bad. I felt pity for pixels on my computer screen. They felt like real people, they had stories, and it tore at my heart. And as I read what happened to each of the people after the war, I nearly broke out in tears.\nMarin took a action figure toy talked about in his bio, and left. He was never found.\nIn Arica's section it talked about what she might have become if she lived.\nAnd in Katia's section, it said she couldn't take the war anymore, slit her wrists, and layed down in bed clutching her war diary, her parents also never found out what happened to her.\n\nThis War of Mine deserves all the praise it gets, as it tears at your hearts with its amazing storytelling and great gameplay. I recommend this game to the end of space and beyond.","March 29, 2015","true","24.4"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","22","22","0","0"

TWoM is a survival game with tough moral choices that actually /mean/ something.\n\nI have played this game four times now, and only one time did I manage to make it to the end so far. The other three times I either managed to get all my people killed, or lost because I made it otherwise impossible for them to survive. And yet even the losses were a "win" in a way.\n\nAs you play, you get choices like risking one of your people's life's in order to safe an innocent from an enemy, or to rob another surviver since your own people are starving... and these choices have consequences.\nSure, deciding to plunder the home of defenseless people of valuables and food means you get to eat for another few days, but this can cause emotional stress with one or more of your people, meaning they will be unable to work during the day or go out scavenging during the night.\n\nAnd taking the risk to gather resources inside enemy territory means your surviver can get wounded, leading to a dangerous and slow recovery -- if any -- or even death. And this will have consequences on the emotional wellbeing of the others.\n\nI am fortunate enough to never have been in a war zone, but after playing this I feel can empathize with the people who are living in a country torn apart by war. For that reason alone, I'd recommend you play it.","January 1, 2015","true","17.8"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","2"

And having to see a young girl get beaten by a soldier.\n\nThis game really shows the worst of you. SPOILER :  after the ceasefire, it shows all the important actions (for example, killing a person, helping some children) and the aftermath of your (alive) characters, some end up having a normal life again, some just end up homeless from depression and die.

It's a grim survival game where you have 3 survivors during a war. You need to scavenge for anything even remotely useful. Food, clean water, medicial supplies & building materials. You need to begin to craft yourself a shelter your group can actaully live in. Build beds, stoves and even cigarettes to help keep your group as comfortable as possible. All this is done during the day when you cannot go outside. At night you tone changes again you must split your group one will scavenge for resources away from your shetler, another may be assigned to guard your home from other scavengers/raiders and another may just simply sleep. With limited amount you can carry on scaevnging runs you have to pick and choose carefully what you bring back. Do you have enough food? Is anyone injured? Can you build enough to help survive? Is anyone sick? Can you defend yourself if attacked?

The artistic graphics give the game the right mood for a great experience.  I would recommend this game to all gamers who love the survival and story genres.","November 30, 2014","true","9.6"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","1"

The characters internalize the bad, and the struggles are difficult to watch and interact. I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Great game.

Its really good graphics i like the dark and very sad style. They really caught the perfect mood and i find myself being sad and felling bad for the actions i had to do for surviving.\n\nAs a little group civilians that is caught in the middel of a war, you need to find food and basic ressources to survive in a pretty sad hidding place, you need to improve your hidding to try and get a better mood and to try to forget the terrible war raging outside your door.\n\nWhen night comes you will have to scavenge, find places that are empty for people or go in and rob or even kill to get the stuff you need. But remember to have people to watch your own house, because every one is in need for stuff.\n\nThis game really caught so many forms of sadnes and regret, it makes me live in to the world and its really interesting made.

Unforgiving. Depressing. Dark.  ...Beautiful. Those are all the words that come to my mind when I think of this game. Not joking when I say that I legitamately cried when I killed a couple just for their food with a knife... in their own home. Even worse? I was doing what I would do in a situation like this IRL on that playthrough. I panicked IRL. Legit.\n\nUnlike games which claim to be about survival such as DayZ or H1Z1, this game is legitamately about survival. Your survivors get hungry. They get tired. They have emotions. Hell, they can even get addicted to drugs and alcohol. And they can even commit suicide if they get sad enough. Trust me when I say this is a true survival game. A ROLE MODEL for all survival games in the making, and already released. Not to mention, the replayability in this game is tremendous. I've played on different playthroughs about 5 or 6 times now. (thanks my friend Hoplite for reminding me of this)\n\nThough there are some bugs and not very much to do at your shelter during the day after you build everything you need and do everything you need to do in a day for your survivors, there is lots to do in this game. Remember to get several boxes of tissues though. Like, 10 boxes. Maybe 15.\n\n9.5/10 from me. If anything mentioned above is what interests you, get this game right now.

Is it worth killing helpless innocents for a couple days' worth of food? Will you help the weak out of kindness? Or will you rob everyone blind in the sheer desire to survive? Sure, you can say "it's just a game", but it's impossible to avoid the feeling that your actions here might well mirror your true inclinations. So what's more important, survival or your humanity? Or can you preserve both? There are moments of both incredible kindness and cruelty to be found within, and they stir something in the human soul that I've rarely seen in games. From running a gauntlet of sniper fire to help a wounded father reunite with his infant son to murdering an elderly couple for their meager goods, it's impossible to play this game without thinking, "Could that be me?

You are just another dude who don't have any influence on the outcome of the conflict.\n\nYou're not fighting for glory or honor, nor king or country. You're fighting for your life, in an unforgiving world where your enemies aren't just soldiers and criminals, but also hunger, sickness, cold and even depression.\n\nIt's too dangerous outside during the day, so you will spend the time building up your shelter and improving it with fancy amenities such as pallet beds, tin stoves and water filters. During the night, you'll step outside and scavenge the ruined city for food, ammo and resources to keep yourself and your group alive.\n\nBut it's a war zone after all and everything seems to be in short supply. And winter is right around the corner. Throughout the city, you will meet other people who are in the same situation - deranged loners, vulnerable families, fiercely territorial traders, gun-toting bands of criminals, the military.\n\nAs the pickings get slimmer by the day, you will have to make some hard choices. Sometimes those choices won't be clear. Sometimes you will have to take split-second decisions without fully understanding the situation and you will only know what really happened after the deed is done.\n\nWould you act against your principles and steal thy neighbour's food, dooming them to a slow, agonizing death?\n\nWould you share your scarce supplies to visit relief upon complete strangers?\n\nYou are free to pursue any path you choose, at any time.\n\nYou can barter and cooperate with friendly neighbours. You can isolate yourself and avoid contact with people outside of your group. You can hunt down criminals for awesome loot. And you can be ruled by your rumbling stomach, killing everyone you meet and stealing whatever you need.\n\nThe game won't try to steer you in either direction. Every good deed and every line crossed, it's all on you. It's a matter of survival, after all. It's a bleak, unforgiving world out there, and it can really bring out the best - and the worst - in people.\n\nWhen the war is over, how will YOU be remembered?\n\n...\n\nBesides the great concept, the game is very stable and offers good replay value, as you can have a different starting party, different characters may join your group and different locations will appear in the map in each playthrough.\n\nThe interface is clear and intuitive, but it will require some reading and trial/error for you to master all the mechanics, since the game doesn't offer a tutorial. Frankly, I don't think it needs one - you will learn fast from your mistakes.\n\nStealth is important, because death is usually sudden - and it's permanent. That is specially true for combat, as you will control only one character when you're out of your shelter. While it is possible to have full-blown shootouts, it's a very risky proposition against large groups (3+). A tactical, silent approach is preferred.\n\nLimited inventory space means you will have to make a few trips to the same location in order to pick them clean, so be ready to spend a good amount of time exploring and scavenging.\n\nOverall, This War of Mine offers an awesome (albeit a little short) experience for gamers who enjoy stealthy survival games with base management and a healthy dose of tactical combat.\n\nIf that's your thing, I highly recommend this game.","November 18, 2014","true","41.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

One might take things by force from others, kill them or rob them and deal with moral consequences afterwards. Another might wish to stick to scavenging and avoiding conflicts, using the gained resources in trading with other survivors to get the much needed items. There is no right way as survival is paramount and war is presented with all its anarchy and cruelty. The choice is based on current situation and willingness of player to follow up on it. Managing your safehouse, resources and characters, deciding every night who should heal/rest, who should guard the house and who would be the one to go out to scavenge or trade provides constant dynamic environment of choice.\n\nMechanics are thought through and hint deep realism of desperate situations - management of water, food, resource expenditure for most pressing issues is vital. As serious all of this might sound the game is fantastically fun as it presents every challenge with a solution and does not make player feel like doing chores, even thought that is what you are doing. The satisfaction of dealing with all the issues is immense and every little bit feels enjoyable - starting from a house full of rubble and thinking how to trap rats, cook food and stoke your boiler with firewood to eventually organizing a fortified safehouse with weapons and autonomous supply of resources and income of trade goods via scavenging.\n\nGame presents player with many random situations. Locations rotate from game to game (Diablo 1 quest style or most modern roguelike games) and have different events happening in them. As hospital being shelled in conflict between rebels and military (which you can hear about on crafted radio) giving player an opportunity to help refugees and either donate/trade or take for yourself medications found in the rubble. Almost every action has a moral consequence and characers react based on their background - rebel doesn't mind killing military personnel, former mathematician or lawyer rationalize every misdoing without losing morale, honest people go into depression after tragic events, etc.\n\nVisual aspect of the game is pleasant to say the least - pseudo-pencil drawning style with great animations and lighting effects, with slight issues appearing in specific locations due to line of sight. Mechanics are solid and entertaining, with many random factors affecting every playthrough, making gameplay extremely catchy and gravitating. And most importantly the choice and approach is fully in player's hands. Game presents player with difficult situation, how one chooses to go through it is completely up to him/her.\n\n9/10","December 21, 2014","true","35.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

You start off with three people hiding out in a ruined building with a war raging around them, and you have them craft during the day and go scavenging at night.  To me it feels like you're the cast of The Walking Dead except instead of zombies it's a war that's got you scrambling to survive.  Very fun and compelling, it's definitely got that "one more turn" feel that great games have and couples it with some choices you won't make in other games like "these cigarettes I just rolled... do I let my group smoke them all or do I take them over to the bombed out hotel to trade them for rat meat?"    I can see how parts of it might get repetitive after a while, but most games do.  I'm finding it highly entertaining if a little bit depressing.  I definitely recommend it.\n\nEdit/Addition 16 hours in:  I've been asked if it's fun. It's "fun" like Schindler's List was fun. Ok... not exactly like that but it's dark, it's depressing, and sometimes your game ends by having your last surviving character reach a point where she just can't take it any more and slits her wrists.

When the game first came into my radar I figured that this game would be a neat concept, but a quickly put together point and click; this is far from the case.\n\nThe replay ability is quite high, each run will have you wanting to try something new/different.\n\nThe mood and music are perfect for this type of game.  Also I cannot say that the game has ever cheated me. I have had moments of the game where I got upset that events played out the way they did but I was at fault for the results.\n\nI'd also like to point out that there are constant interactions with characters during the game, which is really cool. It'll take a while to find out what I mean there but I won't spoil anything, but when I saw it I was like oh cool.\n\n\nA few things that I'll bicker about. The game is too easily exploited. I found out during a crash, yes it does crash from time to time ( though I think it's due to a skype issue), that each day can be cheated. I'd say this is a total con point, but some people will like it. . . others won't but hey you're only cheating yourself, in a game like this.\n\nI'd totally say that if you are on the fence to get This War of Mine. I had three other games I picked up before the came out and this is the only one I've been thinking about getting back to play, after work.","November 23, 2014","true","21.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

During the day you're staying inside, building up your base, tending to your survivors' needs and occasionally haggling with a travelling trader or helping (or refusing to help) your neighbours. During night you assign your people a role - sleeping, guarding (which is quite important since you'll be raided a lot) or scavenging.\n\nFirst you'll most likely be scavenging in somewhat safe locations free of other people, but those will soon be picked clean and you'll have to make some tough choices. I tried to play as a good guy, buy that lasted me about 10 days after which I was running out of everything. Then I robbed some old folks blind, and for the next 35 days or so until the ceasefire I racked up 19 kills. Or should I say murders, because most of them were started by me. But what happens in Pogorsk stays in Pogorsk, and we survived, but it took frequent battles with our own conscience to get through that. I don't know if it's possible to 'win' the game without engaging in some very disgusting activities, maybe if you get your moonshine and cigarette production going?\n\nAnyway, the whole game is set in a 2.5D heavily desaturated, miserable world and the music and omnipresent sounds of distant fighting make it even more bleak.\n\nMy first and so far only playthrough took something around 7 hours, and the game does have some replayability.\n\n\nSloth academy: 4 golden sloths and a special 'Come and See' award.","January 24","true","8.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","1"

It takes those well-proven and simplistic tools and elevates them with what it accomplishes with them.  It's probably not going to be your jive if you're more mechanics-focussed in your gaming preferences, but if you can enjoy a compelling survival story, This War of Mine delivers.

However, as a survival fan, I've found an incredible amount of replayability in this game that I would not have expected.\n\nIf you are interested in the experience of war and the disturbing choices that you have to make to survive, you'll enjoy playing through this game multiple times with different "parties" of characters, each with their own personality.[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com] There's a nice sense of accomplishment in exploring all the locations on the map and making it through the 30-45 days that it takes to survive the war. (It varies by character group, meaning that each group of characters has a slightly different difficulty.)\n\nI figured that after I figured out how to survive in this game I would finish it and put it away. Not at all. I've been coming back to it quite frequently as a casual survival game. It's very well-balanced, and even once you figure out the mechanics of the game, it's still difficult to keep all of your characters healthy physically and mentally. If you don't, they don't get the happiest possible endings,[cloud-4.steamusercontent.com] and will also start to argue with each other or have trouble sleeping. I have tons of fun trying different crafting, scavenging, trading, and combat strategies, and still never kill innocent people in all my hours of playing. I'm slowly working on surviving with each combination of characters just for the satisfaction of getting a nice little "survived" badge on each one in the opening screen.\n\nWith all of the different combinations of characters to start with, and randomization of the areas you explore, there's a nice balance of consistency and surprise. For example, in one game a hotel might be occupied by a well-armed gang who tortures people; in another, an eccentric guy lives there and will trade with you, and the rest of the building is abandoned.\n\nOne of my pet peeves about the game is that you can only save at the beginning of each day (making it harder to save scum). However, this also makes it a good game to play in short bursts. You only need to use one hand for the mouse, which is nice. I've found it the ideal thing to play while watching Netflix shows I've already seen on my other monitor, etc. etc.\n\nSo whether you want to get really emotionally involved in a first playthrough, or want a balanced survival game that will keep you interested for quite a while--♥♥♥♥, I have 89 hours somehow--definitely check this game out. You can also support an indie studio, and if you want, buy an extra DLC that adds cool graffiti to the game and supports a charity for children affected by war.\n\ntl;dr: do you want to scavenge for parts to make moonshine? shoot a deserting soldier and steal the food in his fridge? slowly die of depression and gunshot wounds after protecting your herb garden from midnight raiders? this is your game","March 31, 2015","true","122.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpmrx/recommended/282070/","dpmrx","Viishnahn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpmrx/","159 products in account","Before I get into the details of this game, I would like to point out a few key things. You may or may not agree with me, but I will express my opinion on a few issues; you are entitled to your own. - FYI: Final Score is at the end -\n\nFirst, with the advent of 3D Shooter games and the phenomenal success of names such as Call of Duty and Halo, we as a culture have been led to believe that war is a glorified game, that there are black and white rights and wrongs and that the only lives that matter are our own. When I speak of the culture, I speak for the entire global gaming culture, not just the Americans, Europeans, Asians, etc.\n\nThis is simply not the case. War affects everyone, mostly in a negative way. Can we as humans totally avoid war? No, unfortunately. But we can seek to minimize the negative effects it has on the innocent and the civilian population, as well as supporting our soldiers. Let me be clear, I do not condemn soldiers for serving their respective nations' interests and doing their duty; I condemn war itself as an ugly, sometimes necessary evil to be avoided wherever plausible.\n\nTo return to the first point, popular FPS games have de-sensitized the culture to violence, especially violence against the innocent. This is why This War of Mine is absolutely phenomenal. It is more than just a game; it is a drama, a moral statement and a scream to draw people's attention to the horrors that victims in war-torn countries are facing every day. What's even better is that War Child, a charity that the developer 11bit Studios is teamed with, receives proceeds from every purchase of This War of Mine to help people in war-torn countries improve their lives. There's also a link directly to the War Child donation page on the game's main menu, should you decide to take action.\n\nI digress. Now for the part of this review that explains why this game is actually worth purchasing for gameplay value.\n\n- Overview -\n\nThis War of Mine is a survival-strategy game that incorporates time and character management with item development. The game is point and click from a 2D cut-away perspective. This allows you to see for a certain distance until an obstacle such as a closed door or a wall blocks your line of sight, showing only a haze or a black fog. You begin the game in an abandoned house with a few freebie goods to start off with and 2-4 characters, depending on which story you choose to play.\n\n- World Interaction -\n\nCharacters move to where you click, normal/sneak speed with one click and running speed with a double-click. Icons hover above interactable objects: a hand for lootables, open/close door, peek through to the other side of a door, etc. Some doors or cabinets will be locked and will require tools to open, or a door might be barred from one side. You will have to explore cautiously and keep track of time to survive and get a good haul each night.\n\n- Time System -\n\nTime moves rather quickly in this game, 10 game minutes elapses approximately every 3-4 seconds. Daytime lasts from about 7 AM to 8 PM. During this time, you are stuck inside your shelter due to snipers lining the streets. At night, 9 PM to 5 AM, you may choose a character and a location to scavenge for goods. Each character has a different amount of slots of items that they can take, the average number being 10. You can choose to bring tools or weapons along to help or unlock new routes, but that means that you cannot use those slots to bring something new back. The other characters will have to stay in the shelter, getting to sleep or stand guard for the night by your choice.\n\n-Characters and States -\n\nCharacters have realistic needs and personalities. They will get hungry and need to be fed at least once a day to maintain optimal health. They may get injured or sick and will need to rest to heal, preferably in a bed. Depression is also a looming spectre if you choose to go the absolutely self-centered route (stealing, killing, robbing the hospital, etc.), especially if you have kind-hearted characters. Some characters have addictions and will consume items such as brewed coffee or cigarettes. Each one is unique and some have helpful attributes.\n\n- Improvements -\n\nYou will need to construct everything from beds to gardens to water collectors in your shelter to survive and become more self-sufficient. Each improvement has its own cost in materials to build and will inform you the time needed to finish its construction. Stations, such as the workshop, that allow new items to be built can be upgraded, unlocking more designs for construction.\n\n- Music and Art -\n\nThis War of Mine has a very dark, reflective soundtrack comprised of mostly clean electric guitar with strings accompanying. Some have noted that the music is repetitive; they are correct. As a guitar player myself, I do not mind so much and do not believe it is repetitive enough to cause anyone any unmanageable angst. The art style is equally as edgy. The game's colors are mostly greyscale or brown with a splash of subdued color here or there, usually red. The fog where your character cannot see is made mysterious by a soft, wavering pencil sketch effect. The mood is definitely one of depression and hardship. You can hear different music if a character plays a guitar (well) or if you turn on the radio to a punk rock or classical music station.\n\n- Winning -\n\nThe game is concluded when you reach the randomly-generated ceasefire day. I've had games last from 25 days to 42, and I'm sure they could go shorter or longer.\n\n- Conclusion -\n\nI don't ever think I've spent a day of my life on something that's made me think about life and war so much. Most of us take a warm bed, three square meals a day and indoor heating for granted. I wholeheartedly recommend this war drama packaged as an enjoyable video game.\n\nFinal Score: 10/10","January 10, 2015","true","34.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I ran into Pavle and Katia, and we decided to set up camp together in an abandoned house nearby. We had heard reports of other groups of scavengers stealing, looting, even killing. We swore we would be different.\n\nWe were just trying to survive until the seige ended. Our goals were simple: find food, build a few things to make us more comfortable (beds, a stove), keep our hideout safe. We fixed up the house during the day, and at night one of us went out scavenging while the others tried to get some sleep. We traded for what we didn't have with the local priest, the owner of a garage nearby, a traveling peddler who showed up every few days. Mostly, we traded for food, and it wasn't cheap.\n\nWe got raided by local bandits several times that first week. Sometimes, we fought them off. Other times, we weren't so lucky. I got a nasty gash in my leg from one of their blades, and was bedridden for several days. Pavle was furious. "We need to fight back! It's not enough just to stay here and try to defend ourselves. Let's go take our supplies back!"\n\nThat night, Pavle went to steal from the raiders. He didn't come back. Katia did not take it well. A few days later, a girl named Arica came by, looking for a place to lay low. Shorthanded, we welcomed her in.\n\nWe had run out of food, and were low on supplies to trade for it. Arica had been living on the streets for several years, so she volunteered to go try to steal some food for us. We reluctantly agreed. She made it back that night emptyhanded; the bandits had discovered her and chased her away. The next night, she tried again, and failed again. I saw something change in her, but I wasn't thinking clearly enough to realize what was about to happen.\n\nOn the following night, Arica returned limping and bleeding, with a backpack full of food. "I killed him," she said in a soft voice. "The man who ran the garage. He answered the door with a gun in his hand and I stabbed him in the arm. He got two shots off before I slit his throat." Her voice broke, and she paused, collecting her thoughts. "His father just sat on the ground and wept as I searched the house." I was horrified. And yet, Anica had brought back enough food to last us a whole week. She had saved our lives, but at what cost?\n\nA wounded defector from the military came looking for a place to stay. Thinking that he might help protect us, we let him in. As it turned out, his wounds were more serious than they first appeared. Katia raided a hospital for medical supplies, but it was too late. He died within the week, as did Anica.\n\nNow, half the city is buried in snow, and it is growing even colder. I lack the strength to stand most days, and Katia just sits on the floor crying. We are running low on fuel for our stove, but I will not burn our books. They are the only bit of humanity we have left.","December 29, 2015","true","11.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

Then after my first night's scavenge mission I started to see the true complexity of the game. You have numerous places to visit, with new ones added overtime, each having finite resources to gather. Sometimes obtaining these resources can put you in a morale quandary, and other times they put your people at unnecessary risk. The game will save at the start of each new day so you can come back to a game at a later date. However, you can't undo decisions done before, a bit roguelike. Like taking on a heavily armed group with a shovel, RIP Pavle. It is a bit like the SIms as you need food and rest, but this time as oppose to just partying you actually have to survive in a harsh reality that isn't too far rremoved from some war-torn places in the world today.\nI think the game does convey a serious message, but does it subtly whilst also offering an enjoyable game to play and come back to.","March 9, 2015","true","2.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

No. Not just another survival simulation. This War of Mine takes a different approach to the survival genre, TWoM tries to convey the psychological aspect of living in a war ravaged city, you still need to collect resources, upgrade things and do all those fun OCD like things you love in this type of game, but it has a very real effect on the characters well being. Listening to a baby cry while you break down a door and steal a families food. This type of thing has an effect on your average person, and so it does in This War of Mine.\n\nYour little band of survivors still get hungry, hurt, ill and so on, but now their actions affect group moral too. For example, i sent Katia out to do some essential looting, food, since they were all starving, so she begins looting a small house. The house belonged to an old couple who pleaded me not to rob them, but having little choice, i did so anyway, leaving a little for them. Katia returned that night and felt bad for robbing them, a couple of others felt the same way, whilst the rest thought it was a necessary evil. However 2 weeks of ingame time later, i returned to the house, due to desperate need, only to find the occupants now dead. Actually, Katia found them. So now she's feeling sad and depressed. Sleeping a lot. She blames herself for their deaths? (...Is that a twinge of empathy for a computer game character i just felt?)\n\nThis game is good at eliciting emotional responses from you. If you let it. I suggest you do, it's great at drawing you in and is more than a game, it's an experience. Excuse me, must go check and make sure Katia hasn't done anything silly. Yep. that's in there too.","November 24, 2014","true","11.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I heard a lot of good things, but I had also many doubts...and even with current discount it's quite high price tag like for my standards[hello P(r)oland], but after those few hours of gameplay I don't regret it at all. Frankly speaking I see no reason why this game should be any cheaper in the nearest future, it's simply awesome and worth this price tag for sure.\n\nabout the game: it's kind of sims you know...start with 3 folks and have to make them happy...but there is a war so you don't try to make them happy, you try to make them alive.

This does not affect my review.~\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=656242226\nTags: Survival, War, Atmospheric, Simulation, Singleplayer, Strategy, Crafting, indie, Choices Matter, Adventure, Stealth, 2D, Post-apocalyptic, Side Scroller, Difficult, Point & Click, Open World, 2.5D, Platformer, Rogue-like.\n\nOverview (sorry for the weird organization, I'm lazy)Being 2D, this game can accomplish things much more easily than 3D games can. This War of Mine is very accessible; character’s actions are controlled by a simple click of your mouse and screen adjustment by using the scroll wheel to zoom in and out and the mouse to position the camera (by dragging the cursor to the edges to move the camera up, down, left, right).\n\nA micromanager’s dream. Starting out with 3 people, you are tasked with keeping them well fed, healthy, happy, well slept, and safe from bandit attacks. Any one of these variables, if left unchecked, can lead to the death of a person in your care. The constant need of each of your survivors forces you to manage our resources wisely. I found food to be my biggest struggle.\n\nEach playthrough will be different. When you start anew, characters and environments will be randomized. Included in this randomization are characters that come to your front door. In search of shelter, help, or trade (they can have some very useful items).\n\nThe characters are detailed; each has his/her own traits. Some characters are good at coking, others excel at running, some are good at bartering, and there are even characters who can help keep your civilians happy by boosting morale. The latter character trait is invaluable for keeping your group from spiraling into depression.\n\nSimple questions can force you to really think about what the consequences would be and if the cost is worth it. In many areas that you can visit to scavenge for materials, there are people just like you, trying their best to survive with what little food and other supplies they have. Will you steal the food from them or will you look in another, less occupied place in hopes of finding food? There are only so many abandoned areas, so you will eventually be forced to steal some rations from your next door neighbors or try your luck in more dangerous areas.\n\nVaried resources with in-depth crafting system. There are 8 workshops you can create that help you generate resources.  They are as follows: stove, garden, herbal workshop, moonshine still, alcohol distiller, metal workshop, animal trap, and rainwater collector.   For example, with the metal workshop you can make the crowbar, knife, lock pick, and many other useful tools by using weapon parts and scrap. These tools are a necessity to scavenge through the places that you visit at night.\n\nAfter the day cycle is over, the night comes upon you and you can choose to send one of your survivors out to scavenge nearby locations. In these areas there are valuable materials such as weapon parts, food, and medical supplies. Backpack size determines how much a person can carry back from scavenging. Most characters have a backpack size of 10-12. There are unoccupied areas, which require no caution, and also occupied areas where you will have to be careful what you take.\n\nWhen you aggravate people in an area (stealing valuables or attacking people), each time you go back to that area at night they will remember what you did. They will sometimes shoot on sight or give verbal warnings telling you to leave. This is where stealth becomes vital. There are also naturally dangerous areas occupied by soldiers and snipers. Previously unoccupied areas may become occupied by survivors such as yourself, looking for shelter.\n\nWhen snow comes, several things change. Most notably, the temperature drops to bone-chilling levels. It is advised to build multiple heaters and upgrade your existing ones to provide for the most efficient heating. You cannot collect water using conventional methods any longer. Instead, you have to go outside and collect snow, which can be melted and purified by using the stove.\n\nThe Child Charity DLC is a great way to contribute toward a worthy cause and will unlock an extra achievement (but you would buy the DLC to support the children and not just for an achievement, right?).\n\n\nSummaryThis game left a lasting impression, and for good reason. This War of Mine does an excellent job of simulating war and the horrible things that come with it. I applaud the developers for making such an engaging game that brings to light the things in war usually not covered. This game now has a permanent spot on my favorites list and I will definitely play it again after my second, more successful play through.\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10\nMust buy: 9-10/10\nThis game’s rating: 9/10. If you like simulation games, you will not regret picking this game up.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/282070/","April 2","true","12.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

You will soon remember who exactly will be at each location, and how they will response to your actions, what they have for sale if any.  You will know how many days you will need to survive and can start sitting on your stockage 10 days before that.

So when I felt the game was not as fun as I expected, I did not give up immediately.   Instead, I explored the game as much as possible to understand how everything is designed to be, so  I could be reasonable enough to my fellows on why I do not really like the game.\n\nFor the same reason, I do not write review on game that I have not fully explored and understood.\n\n2. Hours does not mean everything.  The game is slow paced and takes more time than necessary by nature.  It lack a good mechanism of speeding things up.  You either give up all your left day time or keep waiting things out.  If there were a 2x or 4x accelerate button with event driven pauses, you would surely see a dramatically smaller number on my game record.  This also means I am bored from time to time during the game play so I could get the feel of archivement in the end.

Same thing can happen If one of their friends gets killed.\nIf they become a total wreck, they will just sit whole day in a chair  and player cannot use them (Interactions between characters helps to calm these things down) , they can also leave your base during the night...\n\nThere are all sorts of things that can happen during the days, soldiers might be storm the city (which makes lots of places unavailable to loot, cus soldiers are there - obviously)\nWinter - Can't catch rain water, need to keep your place warm\nThere's probably even more, but these are the 2 I came across.\n\nHowever, the way the nightcycle works kinda dissapointed me...You pick ONLY ONE person to go Scavenging and the remaining people (Which is 3 cus the max is 4 as far as i can tell) can be chosen an action to perform during the night (Sleep, Guard)..

The game is very atmospheric, with a great art style and ambience and provides a unique slant on the horror survival genre.  I don't think I have ever cared about NPCs in a game before as much as I have with this game, it really makes you question and live with the decisions that you make.  Sneaking around discovering and interacting with other people who are trying to survive is good fun, if war can be fun I suppose, and the combat that I have seen so far is challenging if a little basic.  Maybe one or two special moves (kicking someones knee out, an elbow to the face etc, I'm not talking Street Fighter 2!) might add a little to the combat.\n\nThere are reportedly one or two bugs but I have seen none so far.\n\nI will be sinking many more hours into this game and I would totally recommend this game to my friends.  9/10.","December 8, 2014","true","93.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\n"This War of Mine" from the developer 11 Bit Studios. It places, the players, into a position that they never thought to find themselves in.\n\n'In war, not everyone is a soldier;' a civilian in a war torn country.\n\nSimulates what its like to be a civilian to be trapped in a war torn country. Survival becomes very critical because there's danger lurking at every turn. Everyday resources become ones' prized possession. As crimes runs rampant, the rule of logic and order, no longer exists.\n\nThere are plenty of pre-generated events for the players to choose from. The players can even create their own events and shared them with other players.\n\nMorality is heavily present in the game. This gives the players a freewill to choose whether they want to be a good person and help out or a bad person and not help out. The choices that the players makes it can have either a positive or negative influence on the civilians.\n\nThere are multiple endings to this game it's heavily affected by the players' morality and the course of action they've decide to take.\n\nThere's a downloadable content called "War Child Charity." It features various artwork from various graffiti artists. These artworks are scattered throughout game for the players to find them. They are to reflect the condition of civilians in war torn countries.\n\n[Please do note that there are different pricing for this downloadable content but they all have the same content. It depends on how much you want to spend on the downloadable content. It's a charity donation.]\n\nThere are twenty-two different achievements can be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements to completed before they can be obtained.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of six different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, I felt that this is a really great game to play and enjoy, it can really draws you into wanting more out of the game. As for the game's replay value it's definitely high. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","January 19","true","51.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Not due to difficulty spikes though the game does have its fair share of those but rather its one of the hardest games I've ever played due to the overall soul crushing tone this game has. More than multiple times I had to stop playing as I felt my willpower and strength drain away watching my survivors slowly dying as joy and hope turned to ruin much like their own surroundings.\n\nYou play as 3 survivors in a half destroyed building during a fictional war somewhere most likely in Europe for a good 4 to 6 weeks trying to survive. Each survivor has their own unique use to the player such as better cooking, trading skills, to playing the guitar, or in one survior's case being good with children which isnt all that useful. This works well for realism of this game as not everyone you come across is going to be helpful to you much like in real life and really sinks in the fact that at the end of the day these are normal people who are not really prepared for the brutality of war.\n\nAfter you start your game with your 3 survivors there are no tutorials for what you are to do which would be a negative save for the icons for all your actions are rather easy to figure out. You start breaking down rubble and locks on your doors to get to cabinets and dressers which may have useful materials,parts, food, medicine, or ammo all of which are nessessary to survive.\n\nThe real challenge in the game is proper management of resources. Do you burn a book for fuel for a heater? Do you build a patch in the wall now or save your supplies for an useful upgrade? Do you trade your last bandages for some food so you dont starve? Not every choice is gonna have a clear answer and what may pay off in the short term can and will mess you up down the line.\n\nAnother challenge is nighttime the second part of the game where one survivor must venture out to the bombed out city and scavenge for supplies. The very beginning areas are generous but eventually you're gonna have to go to hostile areas and attack bandits, soldiers, and rebels. It is best to avoid all combat when you can not because of the combat mechanics they are simple and work fine. It's more so most of your survivors are not soldiers they are civilians fighting more than one person at a time will more than likely end in your death especially if they have guns.\n\nThe final challenge is morality as this game will test everything you believe in and push them to its limits. I was astonished at how quickly my willpower faded within the first few weeks of playing. Within one week I had debated robbing an old couples house, killing everyone in the church, killed a vicious psychopath, gave away life saving medicine to a bunch of kids, prevented a soldier from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ a woman, and nearly died raiding a sniper junction.\n\nThis game is going to hurt you if you are the kind of person who gets emotional playing video games. You have to go in knowing full well everyone you are playing as is more than likely going to die and that all of your best efforts are going to be for nothing. There is no quick save either so no restarting if you didn't like how recent events turned out. The game benefits from this though as a quick save would've ruined all immersion with the game. This is one of those 'Live and learn" games where you'll have to learn from previous mistakes as it is unlikely to be able to a complete playthrough on the first try.\n\nHowever there is a beauty in this game, its art direction looks serene with pencil drawn monochromatic color scheme fitting the tone well and simple music in the background adding to the overall atmosphere. Your survivors have their own backstories and even multiple endings depending on if they survive, overall happiness, or if they died either by the winter, lack of food, or if they take their own life.\n\nUltimately i only have one issue with the game and that is taking only one survivor to scavenge at night. Everything else is close to perfection. I give the game 4.5 out of 5 and recommend this to everyone interested in the intial premise. If you can handle the depressing tone and heavy consequences This War Of Mine offers then it deserves a spot in your library.","March 18, 2015","true","36.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Food, shelter, beds and warmth. What more could you ask for?\nScavenged around buildings, only took what we need. Life was good considering.\nWe helped our neighbours out and in return they helped us.\n\nThen we were raided during the night, in which the two girls of the group were gravely injured. They lay in bed while the other two survivors picked up the slack, hoping to run into bandages to cure their fatal cuts. After two nights of no luck, sent one of the injured to a near by hospital - they bandaged her up and so she decided to help in return. She searched the rubbled for potential lost medical supplies and she found some!\n\nShe went to hand it in to the doctor who has helped her so many times... and then she started getting called a ***** by the guard. The guard proceeded to blast her head off with a shotgun.\n\nDown to three, drastic measures might have to be taken. A survivor travelled to the nearby church in lue of some aid only to find the priest shot down by a bandit. Rightly so, the survivor murdered said bandit with a shovel and aquired a gun. Searched the area for bandages, none to be found! He tip toed through the dark to a neighbouring building, only to be spotted by a bandit and chased. As the bandit closed in he shot the bandit twice in the chest... and paused, thinking that was all the death that would come of that night. He slowly crawled away beaten from this ordeal and promptly recieved a shot in the back by another bandit.\n\nBack at base, the female survivor is in and out of conciousness. Her companion, the chef, having to feed her and keep the place warm. After realising the other scavenger has not come back, he goes to seek revenge - taking down the last of the bandits and aquiring some more guns. No bandages to be seen to save his last friend.\n\nSo the next night he goes to a hotel, praying the tradesmen have stashed medical supplies somewhere near. In his depressed state he slaugthers them all in a gruesome battle of guns, barely making it out alive himself. Yet - no bandages to be found.\n\nHe travels home to find his friend has died of her wounds... Proceeds to drink some moonshine at 8am in the morning when there is a knock at the door. Two girls asking for medical supplies. The chef slams the door in their face and promptly heads downstairs to find some rope.\n\nGame over.\n\nCritic of the game follows:\nGreat game and I feel I have barely scratched the surface at 7 hours. You seem to gain a huge sense of attachment to your crew. Lot's of sneaking about to get your needed supplies and building your shelter. However, there is a small amount of storyline to it - however I have never survived long enough to find it :P If you have the cash, and liked the trailer, get the game. You won't regret it!\n\nPost 24 hours of play: After playing this game for such a long time there is no way I would change my recommendation. I managed to complete all the achievements (for those achievement nutters out there, this game is easily completable) and found most of the different variations to buildings. Sadly I have uninstalled the game - for now - because I cannot handle anymore depression from it. Hope you guys have as much fun in this game as I do!\n\nAlthough the game is challenging, once you understand how the AI works you can easily take any level down in one or two attempts. However, there is always the risk that you end up loosing one of your crew - go in prepared.

Cruelty of war, misery, human side of a conflict. This game is an artistic bomb that could affect your hearts. Maybe I'm excessive, or maybe you are insensible. Anyway, the choice is yours, and I'll tell you why.\n\nThis War of Mine is a survival adventure, your characters are civils in a besieged city. You need to scavenge to live another day, and needs are too many: hunger, sleep, mood, infected wounds, sickness...\n\nYou start in a refugee, playing 3 characters with their own bio, and a special skill. Those characters are random every time you play, giving you different beginnings. On day, you stay in your own refugee, trying to build a better home with beds, chairs, radio, workbenches. They can be updated to build items like shovels, crowbars, food, weapons... Everything seems necessary to survive, but you should ration all of it.\n\nAt night, you need to farm things, because bombs have ceased. And here is when true war starts. Different places, randomly unlocked, maybe inhabited, and maybe by monsters. Nor zombies, nor aliens, but humans. Mercenaries ready to kill on sight, soldiers patroling, other hostile scavengers. Will you kill them? Think twice. Will you go back home? In that case, maybe tomorrow nobody can eat.\n\nOr maybe you are too lucky, and there's nobody in, or there are just other people asking for help. You are free to choose, but do it carefully. This is a game about humans that never have grabbed a weapon (mostly). Don't be a monster, or it will take its toll.\n\nAnyway, next morning will tell. Depression is around the corner everytime.\n\nCan't say anything else. Play it, enjoy it, because this is a masterpiece.","November 16, 2014","true","9.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

One more absolute advantage is the atmosphere of the game: the stories of heroes about their pre-war lives, their thoughts about what is happening and hope for the best, or vice versa - experiences, depressions and frustrations. Everything looks very harmonious and logical. Characters react to each player's choice, on events happening around and accidents, experience food shortages or cigarettes if they need them, sympathize with each other - in a word, sometimes it could be rather difficult to break away from the game :) I am waiting for some new characters, new events and locations, and I hope that the developers will increase the level of complexity, because, despite the seemingly large number of the difficulties faced by the heroes, this game is not hardcore at all, so I want it to be more challenging :D\n\n9\10, I recommend this game to everyone, I am sure that you will enjoy it :)\n\nP.S. sorry for mistakes if there are any\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nЗахватывающая игра, главным плюсом которой, на мой взгляд, является рандомный разброс вещей, наполнение локаций, события, в общем, рандом - главная движущая сила игры :) Даже когда кажется, что игра становится скучноватой и однообразной - бац! и происходит что-нибудь интересное, что-нибудь кардинально меняющее привычный быт и задачи. Безусловным достоинством является и атмосфера игры: рассказы героев о своей довоенной жизни, их мысли о происходящем и надежды на лучшее, или же наоборот - переживания, депрессии и расстройства. Все смотрится очень гармонично и логично. Персонажи реагируют на каждый выбор игрока, на происходящие вокруг события и проишествия, переживают нехватку еды или сигарет, если они в таковых нуждаются, сочувствуют друг другу - одним словом, оторваться от игры бывает довольно сложно :) Жду от разработчиков новый персонажей, новые события и локации, а также не помешало бы некоторое увеличение уровня сложности, ибо, несмотря на казалось бы большое количество трудностей, с которыми сталкиваются герои, особой хардкорности у этой игры нет, а хотелось бы :D\n\n9\10, рекомендую всем :)","December 24, 2014","true","25.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Your goal is to survive, how you do this is up to you. The game begins with you arriving at an abandoned building, and you have to clear out piles of rocks and locked doors to open up the house, this in turn gives you resources you can use to build different things like beds, chairs, ovens, workshops and so forth.\n\nWhen the night arrives you have to venture out into the war filled city to scavenge for supplies where you will meet homeless people, or perhaps an elderly couple that is just trying to get by, do you steal their food? their medicine? and in turn leave them to their fate just so you can survive another day? There are also bandits, traders and people just trying to keep to themselves that will defend what is theirs.\n\nYou will also be visited by people that needs help, some children perhaps that needs medicine for their dying mom, do you give it to them and risk the chance of you not having enough for your own people, or do you turn them down? Your shelter will also get raided so you might want to put some people on guard duty during the nights unless you want to come back from your scavenging runs and all the food is gone.\n\nHow you survive is up to you, but be assured that your choices will have consequences for your group.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManMeetWolf/recommended/282070/","ManMeetWolf","insomniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ManMeetWolf/","169 products in account","This game is one of the best I’ve seen this year. Challenging, interesting, and heartbreaking, This War of Mine puts you in the battlefield, as a civilian struggling to stay alive. I have many stories I could share but I dont want to spoil much about the layout of the game so after you read this review, buy it, and play it so you can see for yourself.\n\nGraphics- 9/10. Love the 2.5 d graphics with a pencil shade to them. It looks like the trailer (one with soldiers running) when you zoom in close with maxed settings.\n\nControls- 8/10. Point-and-Click, I’ll explain why only 8 in a bit.\n\nHandling- 9/10. Sometimes when clicking on a character to move him/her you move a previously selected character to their position… A little annoying but not the worst thing ever. Still, otherwise the looting system works fenomonomly.\n\nStory- 7/10. Simple with background stories, but I wish there was more. I don’t know why. There is a radio with news on the war, interactive characters, and backstories but I wish there was like a cutscene or two of the arrival and departure of your shelter...\n\nGameplay- 8/10. 60% of game is looting/running around, 25% crafting/building, 5% trading… And then theres combat, the last crappy 10% that makes some people leave this game alone forever because they are trigger happy. Ok, let me explain fact from fiction;\n\nFacts:\n-Combat is (or so it seems) a 50/50 chance when not a sneak attack.\n-When you go to hit someone (not sneak) they most likely will hit you first because you are running at them (people don’t understand this)\n-Sneak attacks when hiding behind something (symbol with guy peeking around a corner) and using a knife/axe/shovel/ is a silent insta kill.\n-In cover you are still able to get hit and can be seen.\n-If you fall down you should run because the opponent will be able to get a few hits in on you with his weapon and vise versa.\n-Shooting with guns is accurate and you can only shoot/hit people.\n-When right in front of someone with a gun they won't shoot you but they will hit you and vise versa.\n-Character sometimes will run up to the person you are attacking and do nothing (melee only).\n\nFiction:\n-Sneaking does not work. Only one character is silent. At a close range people will otherwise hear you and if you can see them they can see you.\n\nOk now I want to talk about looting;\n\nYou can only bring one person to loot because if you could bring more then when you encounter hostels you would have to switch between both characters and that would be frustrating. After clearing an area, just go back and loot the crap out of it every night, but be careful because sometimes other people might take shelter there. I don’t know why people criticize the looting system because it is easy and fun in my opinion.\n\nCreativity- 10/10. I’ve never seen a Call of Duty or any other war game with people playing as a civilian and having to look for food/necessities.\n\nPrice-10/10. Worth the price and the money supports the war child fund.\n\nHype-9/10. Above what I thought it would be but the combat is a serious downer.\n\nOverall- 8.5/10. Without the combat issues or a future update this game could get the first 9/10 I’ve ever given!\n\nI think know why [some] people don’t like this game. The combat, BUT these people are choosing to fight while they could trade and loot and create items to survive. People say you need to kill to survive in this game but thats not true. It just is easier that way. You will steal a few times but will be mostly from bandits and robbers. DONT TURN AWAY BECAUSE OF THIS FLAW!!! Like I said, about a 50/50 shot unless you have patience which i’m sure these down raters don't have… Anyway feel free to ask me questions about the game in the comments. Do note that I finished the game before posting this review. Good luck and have fun!!!","November 22, 2014","true","27.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

It's taken up all of my free time for 2 days straight, and might for some time yet xD\n\nFirst, the setting. You take control of a group of civilians trying to survive in a city under siege. You have to scavenge for supplies & materials, build up your shelled out home, and try to survive at all costs. The idea alone is stellar enough, but the execution is phenominal in all aspects.\n\nTime and resource management are front and center. From the get go, you already have a limited amount of good to work with and will have to make hard choices. Build a rat cage for extra food? Or is it time to get that heater going in anticipation for winter? Your initial choices have a great sense of agency, because they set the tone for what you will need to do the next few weeks. If you went heavy on food production, you'll probably need to work towards beds & simple things and vice versa.\n\nScavenging is a massive part of the game, and is done very well. Your chosen character can only see what's in his line of sight, and many is the time you will have to peek through a keyhole to see if there's baddies waiting on the other side. You have to make hard choices again, as you can only carry so much in your backpack. Also, will you try to stay benevolent towards others, or is looting with abandon the way to go? The levels too are done really well, with mini puzzles in getting around & hiding spots scattered throughout. This game will give you an unreal feeling of intensity when you're trying to hide from looters or maybe even stab one around a corner.\n\nThe musical score is 100% fitting for each part of the game. That slow twang as you're at home really just hits home how awful it is being stuck in such brutal place. The fast paced track that always plays during scavenging is my personal favorite. It's sooo intense and perfect for those close calls which happen all too often.\n\nFinally, each character has his own traits, backstories, and personality. Fights will breakout between them! Some will steal goods for themselves, or have full on emotional breakdowns. All of it is quick and doesn't detract from the gameplay. It hits that butter zone of being "just enough" soooo well that you care about each person a bit, and are tempted to follow along with their bios when you can.\n\nThis is the best thing I've picked up all year. For me, it's my GOTY. Get this game!","November 17, 2014","true","42.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

It has enough randomness for each playthrough to maintain interest in repeated playing, but not so much randomness that the game becomes too unbalanced. Lack of detailed instructions on the underlying mechanics leads to your early games being a struggle to survive. Replayability is good, but not perfect. The game has numerous combinations of starting conditions and beginning characters. This adds greatly to the variety since each character has a couple unique skills/traits. Once you have completed the game several times and learned how to do things efficiently and safely, resources DO begin to pile up at too fast a rate. This leads to a back-half of the game without tension as you complete simple activities and move on to the next day, waiting for the war to end.\n\nLocations you visit to scavange supplies are chosen on a map of the city and are smallish (but perfectly suited to the gameplay) self-contained side-scroll maps. Most of the locations you visit have two versions that effect both the supplies you can scavange and the events/people who you can meet there. The strategic/moral choices are based off of the locations having the possibility of danger, robbing innocents, trading opportunities, or safe abandoned sites. Fairly explicit hints are given to you in the location-choice so that you can make good strategic decisions.\n\nCombat does exist in the game. It is simple and has minor stealth and cover mechanics. It is usually either a very fast paced lethal encounter (potentially for both sides) or waiting patiently in a hiding place to stab someone with a knife after possibly attracting them with sound. The mechanics of the game make the violence both tense and consequential.","December 5, 2014","true","163.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Time is of the essence as they brought down piles of junk to scavenge as much as they could. Collecting scraps of wood, left over first aid kits and dried meat; anything that helped them survive another day would be an uplifting gift in this terrible place they used to call home.\nAfter rallying together of what they could, one of the members has decided that a local abandoned home should have the necessities for them to begin their survival. Confused, distraught and still struggling of what to do in this new world of hopelessness. Pavle began his first steps up towards a heavily-shelled home across the street. He peered through every door that was ajar, only to find the single creature inhabiting this home was a rat that looked starved as he was.\nTaking what he could, Pavle gathered wood and scraps of leftover food as he headed back towards shelter. He realized that this would become his new job, and prayed that the military would someday save him.\n\nGreeted by the echoes of his footsteps, Pavle sets aside the new-found materials for Bruno to make use of. Pavle knew he wasn’t smart, nor did he have the social aspects to ever fit in with his colleagues. As his facial features often confused people that he was always angry. However he always deemed himself an optimistic character, with a lean and fit physique that allowed him to compete in sporting competitions.\n\nUnfortunately Bruno was the complete opposite. Smart, overweight, unhealthy smoker, unsympathetic, but nevertheless a chiseled chef. An intensive scholar in the culinary arts, Bruno believes this was his time to show his skills for the purpose of survival.\nKatia remained upstairs in one of the bedrooms as she fell ill during the war. Thankfully Pavle was able to come back with fever medications on the way back from the scavenge. With no medical supplies going through the borders due to war conflicts, she was left with a fever that eventually developed into many days of sleepless nights and exhaustion. Katia broke down in tears, relieved and outraged that a solution to her pain was only few houses away. But with the paranoia of being shot by militia, there was no chance she would try to wander alone.\nBruno would have left her to die, but her plea for help wasn’t a plea. It was a bargain, never has Bruno ever seen someone with nothing but a thin strand supporting their life-line; can convince him to help such a person. He was convinced to help this woman, as he found her characteristics one day could be useful against merchants.\nWeeks have passed as scavenging, falling ill, and single meals a day were a tireless struggle for survival. Often there was not enough food for two people, and a decision was made that the person off night-guard was the one who skipped a meal for a deal of 6 hours of sleep that night.\n\nNot too long ago, a young man in his 20’s requested shelter in their home named Roman. Roman was a former militia but Bruno wasn’t willing to let out personal details of his past to the others. Bruno, being the conniving chef that he was, set Roman off to raid the home that was just on the outskirts of war. He told them that the occupants of the house were corrupted soldiers and that opening fire through the front door would guarantee for bullets to catch most of them.\n\nRoman performed what he was told. Roman didn’t know what lied behind those doors except knowing there were soldiers ready to kill. Roman opened fire until the voices behind were silent. He heard nothing but ringing in his ears. Finally opening the door, he realized what he had done.\nGathering what was left of the home, he came back with two days of food, and supplies that would guarantee a new contraption that would help on the fight for survival.\n\nGreeted by the warm light what now was home, Roman felt nothing of it. He simply took his rewarded dinner and headed upstairs. Katia despite her business approach to every situation, felt there was more to Roman’s scavenge that night than just a raid. She was expecting Roman to stay behind closed doors for a while, but to her surprise. He did not. He told her everything.\nKatia couldn’t believe it. She didn’t want any of this. She hoped that the military wouldn’t find out or they would be executed on the spot.\n\nRoman is now found guilty for slaughtering an elderly couple. They died being ripped to shreds by bullets as they sat next to the fireplace.\nThis was too much for her and felt this needed to be discussed with everyone else.\nPavle wasn’t able to comprehend the situation, he turned his head and pretended it never happened.\nBruno had no words to say.\n\nThe next morning, Roman was found kicking and beating Bruno down the steps of the house. Half his life bar remained as Katia tried to restrain Roman from continuing any further. Words were still being thrown at Bruno as he Bruno tried escaping from his wrath. Roman felt hopeless.\n\nAs Katia left to be chosen for the nightly scavenge, Roman hung himself that night.\n\nEveryone was devastated except Bruno. He simply felt sad that there were no cigarettes left in the cabinet. Katia was found upstairs again having a mental breakdown. Pavle refused to get out from bed as well. Low on food, Bruno knew he had to do the scavenging tonight.\n\nAlthough as Bruno walked up the door, a stranger on the other side knocked.\n\nDay 31\n\nThis War of Mine\n","December 19, 2014","true","40.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","2"

I've never been more relieved or satisfied when it comes to my gaming experience than what I experienced today. I've blown up countless enemies, taken down more dragons than I can ever think of and done the impossible last stand fight and won, more times than I care to remember. Today however, I experienced something I've not had since I was a tiny kid. I sighed with genuine relief simply finding a small stash of canned food. Such a simple and trivial thing hit me very hard today. You see, I played my first run of This War of Mine today. I am not good at hardcore survival games, despite my insistence to play them because I'm bad with prioritizing things. Food and shelter took a backseat to beds and a radio, because I had the supplies. I made a lot of ♥♥♥♥ ups in my first five days and on night five, I was raided while my two sick team members rested. The raiders took everything of value really. My food and medicine, what little there was. For a day and a half, we had no food. Wounded and sick survivors can't exactly scavenge or build much, so they rested during the days. It wasn't until night 8 that I found small stash of canned food. This... paltry amount of food would only last us another day, maybe but it brought the biggest and most satisfied smile to my face. Because ultimately it gave me hope. Real hope that things might work out. I've never really felt that from a game before.","November 16, 2014","true","1.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

In fact, it's pretty brutal, unforgiving and unlike almost every other survival game out there - there's no undead to battle. Just your fellow man, hunger, and mother nature.\n\nThis War of Mine is a refreshing attempt at the survival genre, and a very successful attempt it was in my opinion. You start off managing 3 people in a house. It's up to you to prioritise boarding up the house to make it secure, getting a radio up and running so you can hear news of the war and other survivors, building a bed so you can get a good night's sleep or building a cooker so you can have a satisfying meal. Every choice has a consequence and drains resources that you have to scavenge every night - sometimes from an abandoned house, other times from a populated house with people just as desperate as you living inside. Make the wrong choice, and it may very well cost the life of one of your guys. An example of my first playthrough..\n\nAt the start I pretty much relied on trade and not stepping on the toes of other survivors, but then came that point when there's just the 3 of my guys, poor Pavle is wounded from an unsuccessful raid (and probably gonna die during the night) and they're all starving because I ate my last food item 2 days ago. That 2 bedroom semi-detached down the road is stocked to the brim with food and meds - and it's also guarded by 2 armed survivors who have been fairly decent people thus far. All that's left to do is to lay down and die with a modicum of humanity, hoping a trader will make it through or... pick up my knife and gun and go "Governor" on their ♥♥♥, buying myself and my household another couple of days until the next crisis! ...I'm not proud of what I did. They were probably very good people, but now Pavle is fit and well and the fridge is stocked. Another couple of days and the war will be over.. I'm sure!\n\nGreat little game and fully recommended to fans of this genre who want a change from the norm.","November 16, 2014","true","23.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I've played 6 times and  I've beaten the game twice; once with Pavle, Marko, and Bruno where I took in Boris. And once with Pavle and Marlin where I took in the Child Lover (Yvelta or something?) starting in Winter. People say the combat is clunky but I haven't had a problem with it you're killed very easily unless you have either the element of surprise, or an easily defencible position such as on top of a ladder. Finding parts to upgrade your shelter is difficult, and being raided is a huge danger, and unless you fortify your shelter and find a gun you'll almost always lose a few items. After playing about 13 hours the game has seemed to get repetetive and this is the only negative aspect i've found in it.\n\nThis game is a challenge and requires strategy to beat it. You won't always be able to help the children who come to the door asking for medicine, the starving people you meet while scavenging, or be able to help your neighbors out of a tough situation. And your characters will get sad very sad.

Now Bruno thinks that is ok if someone else dies in order for him to keep surviving.\nSure, he was always a bit cynical, but he never thought something like this before. This is something anyone should never think... but, maybe... i mean, maybe in his situation it could be understandable, couldn't it?\n[...]\nThat man has food for himself while you have nothing to eat. That food is his property, and there's not enough to share, you should go looking somewhere else. And yo do it, but you can't manage to find anything to eat. The next day you are starving, and that man still has some food. I mean, that man is old. Really old... right? Why should he eat while you die of hunger?\n\nThis War of Mine gives you some material to form your answers to these and other questions.\nThe theme, war, is not an easy one, I'm sure it is something a person can't imagine without experiencing it, and this game is, of course, just a game, but, unfortunately, war still is a reality for many people. This War of Mine gives you the opportunity to think about something like this while you are still between the lucky ones.\n\nThis game is an experience and I suggest to everyone to play it. I'll add that it is a wonderful game even in terms of mechanics. The gameplay is complete, while remaining fast to enhance the thrill of the situations you'll be in.\nYou'll see your characters react to what happen to them, you'll see them relax, sleep, crying, getting drunk, maybe even suicide. It's not fun, for them at least.\nThe people you'll meet outside your shelter, while you scavenge, will have their agenda, and will react to your doings realistically.

The city has been taken over by some kind of rebel army and the military is beseiging the city to reclaim it. The objective is to keep the survivors alive for about 6 weeks til the war ends.\n\nDuring the day it plays like The Sims. You build furniture and tools, cook, eat, sleep, and sometimes conduct trade with wandering traders or make choices as to whether to aid visitors who come for help\n\nAt night you pick a survivor to travel to one of a number of locations and loot as much as he/she can carry to aid you during the day or future raids before dawn\n\nYou will need to find materials to build furniture and defenses or to use as fuel for heating during the winter, food to not die from not eating, water to cook, medicine in case of illness or inury, weapons and ammo to defend during the night or utilise in raids, and trade goods like tobacco or alcohol to trade with wandering traders\n\nPlayers can craft items and weapons such as a shiv for combat, a crowbar for forcing locks loudly, lockpick for picking them silently once, spade for clearing rubble, saw for sawing through barricades doors etc. Often an area will have locked doors or collapsed passages and players must plan ahead for future raids to ensure they can clear the obstacles they couldnt pass earlier\n\nWhen raiding you may encounter hostile people. Some of them are thugs and bandits who are fair game. Others are innocent survivors who may fight to defend themselves or their property, and there are soldiers who are usualyl lethally dangerous and best avoided. Combat is random and depends on the skills the survivor started with and their equipment and the strenght of their foe, and whether or not you or your opponent is injured already and who got the drop on who. As combat is dangerous and injuries take many days to heal and expensive bandages, combat is best avoided. Not all survivors are hostile and some will trade or assist the player. Others must be avoided carefully or killed if the situation is desperate as the player searches for the most valuable items for their inventory space in the time available\n\nDeath is permanent so the player must weigh up the risks and benefits of each action. Do you attempt to sneak past the thugs for the food you need not to starve? Do you steal medicine from an old couple to save your sick friend? Do you try to save a woman from a battle hardened well equipped ♥♥♥♥♥♥ soldier who will almost certainly kill you? Do you pick through the looted carcass of a supermarkt for those last scraps of materials or risk your life sneaking into the rich but bandit infested warehouse district?\n\nReally I loved this game.

And you'd be right.\n\nThe game can be better described as an 'entropy simulator': There's plenty of things to pick up initially. Just through initial walks through the area you can find a bunch of resources you can use for initial improvements to make for your war hovel. But eventually, that stuff will start to run out, and you will not be able to play it safe anymore. If you're smart, you'll have someone who is good at bartering and items to supply the demands of rich survivors with, and you might be able to get through the war without blood on your hands.\n\nIf you're no longer able to play it safe, that is where the real This War of Mine begins.\n\nIt is easy to lose control of your circumstances concerning what your group needs. If you have to keep pushing your wounded and your sick, they will get worse. But there's points where you just can't, because you need to keep a tight budget on what little resources you have. Raiders will come by, you will get a small winter, and your group members will get hideously depressed from having to hide from the war in a cold, destroyed house. All of these things will add up, and not having what you need to keep them sane and healthy will eventually destroy your chances of seeing the end of the game.\n\nYou'll have to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get what you need, and the mental tax that your actions will cause will be heavy. Sure, you can poke your scavenging survivor to stab an armed thug in the back, but he will hate himself for it the next day. You can brandish your pistol at the elderly couple hiding out in their nice home to take their supplies. You can carefully sneak through homes and take things that survivors not unlike yourself have been hoarding for a rainy day, putting them in  poverty to get what your group needs. And, of course, you can sneak through shadows and stab people in the back, trying to ignore their frightened pleads as you put the blade in to keep others from noticing all for the sake of some things you could have, in better days, gotten from a supermarket for five dollars.\n\nThis game is one of those games where it can make you feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for trying to survive, and the more desperate you have to get to feed your group, the more it works. It's a horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feeling generator when the game is at it's toughest.","January 7, 2015","true","18.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","2"

It deals with a lot of taboo subjects, with some choices that may even offend some players. You bare witness to the cruelty of war and how it changes people, especially when the basics of food, water and shelter run out.\n\nBut all of that, is what makes the game great, along with the fact that it is simple to learn, it randomizes each scenario and has a lot of replayability. I did a scenario of 46 days to survive the war and that was a solid 4 hours of gaming just there, so it certainly takes up your time.\n\nLots to do in the game, many places to visit and some interesting characters you meet along the way. A very story driven game as well, as you can even listen to a radio, that tells you the latest happenings about the war, like supply shortages of vegetables, etc. One of the better games I've seen from an Indie Developer and a game that I hope DOES NOT become a reality for us all.\n\nThe DLC is great! Especially "The Little Ones", as it adds a whole new dimension to the game. You thought it was difficult with adults surviving in the war? Having kids in the game, makes it much more challenging. More mouths to feed, more responsibility and of course more interaction with them, that drains your time and energy. They cannot go out and scavenge nor can they defend the house at night. This makes the game much more real and brings about a whole new aspect of how brutal and disturbing war can be on humanity.\n\n5 out of 5 Beers from me.\n\nCheers,\n.Frost.","December 29, 2015","true","32.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

It looks like those many thousands of positive reviews are there mainly for the –message- the game sends, not the gameplay itself. Even the most helpful review listed for this game is just a few sentences poking at how depressive the game is, not an actual review.\n\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this game was it looked like a direct clone of another steam game called –Deadlight- with a smidgen of resource gathering/management from another game called\n-deadly 30-. Both of those games are also side scrollers, I’m pretty sure a Dev or two for this game pulled ideas from those two and or others to make this one.\n\nOther reviews say the graphics are good for this game, but Deadlights is much better in my opinion for a post apoc game and it came out years ago and Deadlight has more scenes/scenarios while this game is confined to destroyed buildings.\n\n\n****Spoiler warning*****\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a list of things I came across while playing this game that are head scratchers or just don’t make any sense.\n\nThe survivors know how to make a radio, but no one has the skills to make crude weapons to defend themselves from early raids while you are cleaning out your shelter. The survivors need to collect materials to make a workshop to make crude weapons. Soooo the survivors have the skills to make a workshop, but can’t make simple crude weapons until they can build a workshop. Wait..What?\n\nAll the survivors start out with nothing but their empty backpacks. Hmmm\n\nI guess the player is supposed to assume either all of your survivors were caught off guard by an attack somewhere else, but they only managed to grab their “empty” backpacks or all your survivors were caught by bandits as a group and all their belongings were taken nearby, though the bandits let them go free until they reached the shelter. But this conflicts with an early first encounter.\n\nA First early encounter at the shelter immediately followed with a groan from me. A Knock on door asking for help to carry an injured person home from being shot by a sniper. Sorry to hear that, but no I can’t help you at this time, I don’t know you and this could be a trap.\n\nOhh but wait, after you decline to help you’re told this was your “neighbor”. Oook, how did I the player know you were my neighbor? But wait, didn’t you as the survivors just find this place as a shelter? How is this person your neighbor if you just arrived with not even so much as a 2x4, knife or scrap of food on any of you? ugh\n\nObservation - During play, no survivor is strong enough to lift a table/chair or knock over a damaged wooden dresser and smash it to the ground for wood/fuel, they must craft an axe to break things down to collect wood/fuel.\n\nObservation-When scavenging, you can commonly find rare items like lock picks but more common items like hammers, knives(even a common butter knife that could be used as a weapon) are nowhere to be found. It also appears every radio and alarm clock has been destroyed during the war and one must be made, since you can’t even trade for one, though parts for one can be found.\n\nObservation-How is it that every occupied area around you has people with guns, but everyone in your group is bare handed with not so much as a shiv/knife or a 2x4 when they start.\n\nItems like crowbars break down after repeated use on wooden doors in destroyed buildings. What? I could understand a shovel breaking because of a wooden handle, but a crowbar? Saws are also a one-time use item. wow\n\nObservation- With Ai NPCs, if they have guns It’s always shoot on sight if you try to scavenge a new area with people there. There’s no “hey who are you, get out of here or I’ll shoot” “It’s hey someone’s there, you’re dead” BANG BANG\n\nNo chance for “Oh, sorry I was not aware this area was already occupied, I’m leaving”\n\nObservation-How is it possible for an NPC to know you stole something from them if you show up with a different character than the one used to steal? Silly\n\nWhy does snow that you collect at your front door need to be melted/purified at your cooking stove when you have a wood heater that is heating your shelter?\n\nThe survivors can only send out one scavenger per night no matter how many survivors you have and you can scavenge only one place per night even if you are done scavenging in a short time. If you clean out an area in an hour, you’re done for the rest of the night since you’re confined to that building/area all night. No other areas close buy/next door can be scavenged until the next night even if you have 4 hours to spare, you have to end the night or basically twiddle your thumb for X amount of hours until it’s time to go home.\n\nThe game tries to get you to open your shelter up to more survivors for you to manage/take care of beyond your initial starting group. But there is no point in doing so from a survival standpoint unless you want to read their profile/back story. When I became self-sufficient, food was still scarce/hard to come by with just 3 people. Adding more survivors only puts you in a worse position and there is nothing for the extra survivors to do but sit around, always be cold/hungry/tired or get wounded in a raid. If you could actually use the extra survivors to go scavenging, I could see the point in adding them to your shelter.\n\nThe survivors can’t go out in the daytime, there appears to be a 24 hour curfew. So for a war that’s been going on for years, there are no temporary trade markets during the day to trade at. Strangely you hear on the radio there are supplies like coffee being dropped off, so why are none of the survivors allowed to leave during the day to get some of this humanitarian aid?\n\nIn game time goes by in 10 minute increments, with each increment occurring in less than 10 seconds, somewhere around 8 seconds. So if you do have stuff to do, you need to do it quickly before 8pm. The problem with that is that it takes one of your characters 30 game minutes to walk up 1 flight of stairs or go from one floor of your shelter to another. So if you want to go up 3 stories in your shelter to build/make/break something, it will take you 1 and a half game hours to walk up those stairs. This does not include time to actuallty build/break your item. Crazy stuff.\n\nI completed the game in 42 days without killing anyone simply by concentrating on becoming self-sufficient, there’s no need to kill any NPCs unless that is what you want to do or risk. The worst thing I did was steal some supplies from the old couple.\n\nWhile the message the game is trying to send is a good one and the charity part is appreciated, the actual game play is unrealistic and is incredibly repetitive after about day 20. It would be even more so if the crime wave did not occur to mix things up after day 10. Don’t be lured in by the massive amount of recommends and wait for a sale, the $20 is too high for the limited amount of content provided.","July 27, 2015","false","17.0"," 80 of 147 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","80","147","5","9"

This is a great game (not fun tho...) I would give it 8/10.\n\nHere are some stories during my last playthrough. Hope you guys like it.\n\n\nI used to be a fireman, I have a wife and i child and live a normal life. But war seperated us.... It changed everything...\n\nI met a couple other survivars and we hide in a damaged house. Can we survive this war?\n\nDay 7 - A girl came to our door and ask if she can stay with us, the cook deside to let her stay. I am glad we did, she helped us alot especially in the darkest time. Where is my family? Are they still alive?\n\nDay 9 - I went to the supermarket, hoping to find some food and supply so that we can live for a few more days before everything runs out. I heard some sounds behind the entrance door. A soldier was trying to force a girl in exchange to give her some food. I waited a few second because he has a assault rifle in his hands. After a moment of hesitation I can't just stand there and watch this happen. So I rushed in and hit him with my crowbar, he is not down, I though he will kill me, I try to hit him again, he strick faster with his buttstock. After a few round of beating each other to death, I finally killed him. The girl ran away, and I am serverely wounded. I pick up the rifle and grab some supply and went home. Luckily we have a couple bandages. It hurts but i am happy to know that the girl is ok.... at least this time.\n\nDay 16 - I went to a military post hoping to trade some food with some moonshine we found earlier. Once i got there, the soldiers was trying to shoot me on sigh! Do they know I killed one of his man? I ran away as fas as I can.\n\nDay 25 - I went to a school full of thugs, Info said that there are planty of supply there. We were runing out of everything and if the consistant raid happened the past week continues, it will end us in no time, We don't have any more bandages and only a few ammo left. We were desperate. At the school, i can hear them talking about bad things. I found a dead body by the hallway. At the end of the hallway on the top floor, I heard someone was talking to a closed door. I waited unit the guy went away. I picked the door and found someone was lock up behind, He ran away immediately screaming. I was so afraid it will alam the thugs, they had guns and I didn't. So lucky that they didn't hear it. I slowly walk away and tried to grab as much stuff as a can on the way out. I was careless, I made noise and one of them heard it! They almost chased me down before i ran away. I didn't get a lot of stuff home.\n\nDay 26 - I have to go to the school again! We need supply!!!! This time,  I grabed a knife and my shotgun, alone wiith all the ammo left. It is the frist time i bring my gun with me on a run. But this is us or them. I knew what are their platrol route from the observation. I hide in the shadow, i wait one of them to come close. And I striked! He was down. Other thugs knew i am here, I ran away like a black cat in shadow and hide again. They were looking for me, They splited up and kept looking. One of them come to my hiding spot... there is a chance for me to strike... I took his life. The other guy heard the fight, he rush to the scene, I quickly ran to the door and used it as cover. I pulled out my shotgun, he came... I fired twice. He is down. i screach the place carefully because i don't know how many mans they got. I spotted the last guy at the back yard. I slowly approach him from behind, I shot him so that i don't give him a chance to fight back. Now they are all dead, Four lives was tooken by my hands... We cleared the building the following few days, there were plenty of food and supply, and ammo too. Will I kill them if i have to choose again? I don't know... I think i will.\n\nDay 30 - It is snowing. It is very cold outside. Our house is warm but it will not atsy that way as fuel is running lower and lower everyday. We chopped off all the closest in the house for fuel. Water is beginning to running low too. We were think about buring the guitar for fuel, but the girl who joined us really want to keep it. No question she is a good musician, She played it way better then any of us. We decided to let her keep it, lestening to her music is maybe the only enjoyable thing in this difficult time. I think the foodball guy will agree with me too.\n\nDay 37 - What! i can't believe it! The cook told me today that the war may end soon! He heard the radio new. We have some can food we have been saved up, some rat meat and vegi left too. Meds and firewood is running low, but looks like the snow stopped. We only need to hang on for some more days!\n\nDay 38 - I ask the cook if the war end yet? He said no....\n\nDay 39 - I ask him again. He told me to listen to the radio myself....\n\nDay 40 - Radio said the war may ends in any day now!!!\n\nDay 41 - We ate all the meat... i hope we can catch come more rats. Is the war going to end????\n\nDay 42 - We... We... We made it !!!!!!!!!! We..... survived...\n\n\n\nHope you guys enjoy, and I would love to hear you guys' stories.","November 20, 2014","true","36.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","6"

The game has you trying to survive - and be prepared to play it like that. There is no save. You live and die by your own foolish mistakes, which a lot of us are unused to. But at the same time that is what drives home the ambiance, the feeling of futility and makes everything come together here. This is war.\n\nI tried to save an innocent woman by attacking a soldier with a crowbar. Sure I got in the first hit - but then he promptly shot her(my character).. And.. then she was gone. I was lucky i could loot some of her items the next night, but ... gone. No save. No load. and *that is the point of the game*. If you do stupid stuff.. you have to deal with it.\n\nSo.. Enjoy it. How would you do? What risks will you take? And are you always willing to play the hero if it means loosing your own life? Find out here :) I give this game a very good/excellent rating and absolutely recomend it if you are after something different.\n\nIt might NOT be for you if you want a lot of action.

Instead of playing as a soldier on the frontlines, you're playing as a band of civilians trying to survive the war-torn city. You have to scavenge for food and supplies, craft essential things like beds and stoves, and even deal with other survivors. Keeping your survivors in check by feeding them, making sure they're well-rested and not sick, and keeping specialized ones (one survivor is a better scavenger, for example, while another is good at cooking) alive is no easy task.

I've came to face many difficult decisions, and it is not easy choosing. For example:\n\nI am playing as a man named Marko, a skilled scavenger who was once a firefighter before everything went to hell. Me and two of my fellow friends/survivors needed supplies, so I decided to head towards an old apartment, which I heard had a few people had been living there, so I tried my luck. I did bring my knife just in case things didnt go as planned. In which they didnt.\n\nAs i was sneaking through the apartment, I noticed a man walking through the house talking to himself, I forgot what he said though. He was in the kitchen but he had walked out to left door. So i took my chances and scavenged the area. As i heard his footsteps, he climbed down the ladder, saw me and gave me a chance to leave. But i couldnt. Me and my people need supplies. So i went outside, but i went back in a little bit later. But this time, i had my knife in hand. I needed these supplies desperately. So again, i went sneaking in. The man was in the kitchen again, and i was peeping through the keyhole on the other side. there was a place i could hide where i can get to unnoticable, so I wanted to make enough noise for him to get there so i could possibly take him out. The plan worked out well. I was hiding and the man was standing right beside me, confused. As i stared at him with my knife in hand, i decided to take him out. i pushed him to the ground and stabbed him 3 times in the chest. He didnt move at all or breathe again. I had thought he was the only one living in this apartment, but i was wrong. The people upstairs had heard his death and rushed to see what happened. It was an older man and his wife. They saw the corpse of their son laying on the floor. i stood there, shocked and not knowing what to do, as the father and wife mourn over their dead son. i felt like complete ♥♥♥♥, but we needed supplies. so as i filled my backpack to its max capacity, i run to the exit but i had to take one last look at the situation. The older couple were just crying over his dead body. I quickly ran back home. My character's heart was broken, and so was mine. I switched characters to Pavle, i went and gave Marko the last of the food we had and talked with him. The conversation they had literally got me teary eyed. But now i know me and my friends have those supplies we desperately needed to survive this cold war.","December 28, 2014","true","33.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You can manage group of survivors, give them task and meet other survivors in other group, they might asking for help, trading, and maybe some things that I don't know yet. I see a lot of conflicts, like son that willing to trade anything he has to get medicine for his father, and attacker/group of bandits seducing surviving young girl that asking for supplies. There are a lof of scenes that reminds me of walking dead.\n\nUpdated (1):\nAfter playing for a week (20 hours so far -- day 44) this game is kinda patterned but still you can't predict the result, first 2 weeks are harder than the rest of game. This game qualified as very good games, keeping me playing 20 hours is hard as I have over 30 games this week and this one take more intensive play than other newly games I have. I still like the moral and conflict of this game. I think I'll beat this game soon and will have 2nd play with other combination of characters.\n\nAfter 20 hours I think it's OK to sum everything.\n\nPro:\n-  great surviving simulation/strategy/management game. It's the neighbour from hell + post war survival, walking dead thingy without zed.\n-  it has great replay value. I think playing it over and over is great..\n- great graphics, music, crafting and enemy AI\n- all characters have their own set of unique skills. Having elder survivor is stilll useful here..\n\nCon:\n- why there is no 2-4x speed up button.. I hate to wait for few minutes to the end of days. If you skip the time to night some items/task that needed time doesn't progress. It's frustrating when you have to wait until the end of day and you have nothing left to do beside sleep and recovering\n- You can't have all survivors in one campaign, you can only play with 4 of them -- maybe 5  the one(s) who came later is random\n- Some places are randomly "locked", I can't go to garage in my 5th gameplay (after 4x failure)\n\ngrab it while it's 50% off :)","June 12, 2015","true","40.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

For being a sidescrolling click and point, it does have a sense of dark, somber beauty. Much like Limbo, the game has a bit of a darker visual aspect, leading to the automatic connection of absolute despair. Character models are fairly well developed and the environments are put together in a way that feels war-torn. While you won't see every brick your survivors are moving, visually, it does a fantastic job of setting the scene.\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is one of the few players might not automatically turn off. The music score to this little gem is outstanding and again, definitely helps set the tone for the world they'll find themselves exploring. The general sound effects are also nicely done, players are never long forgetting that the reality is that of mortars, snipers, and machine guns.\n\nAs stated above, it is a point and click survival game, ran in real time. Players will have a certain amount of hours (roughly 10 minutes of actual time, I believe) for survivors to build, cook, eat, catch up on extra sleep, etc. At night, players will have to send someone out for supplies, while maintaining a defense and resting up extra survivors. Sleep deprivation is an extremely dangerous reality and can affect numerous things from speed, to combat capability.\n\nThis is where the moral issues arise, when players find themselves desperate for food or materials to simply light a fire. Yes, they could attempt to break into that military base that has a fully stocked kitchen and extra niceties scattered about, but is it worth the danger? On the other hand, perhaps that group of well armed thugs needs to shuffle the mortal coil, as it were. Then again, maybe players find themselves outside the homes of couples and survivors that simply want to try to make the best of things - surely you couldn't steal from the sick, elderly, or infirm, right?\n\nThose are the choices "This War of Mine" puts players in, every time you go out to find resources, you'll be denying them to someone else. Very few areas of the world are abandoned, there will be no shortage of military or rebel forces, as well as local militias and bandits. Of course, there are those that wish to trade for your goods as well, if you've got what they need.\n\nBut that's where I found a few flaws with the game, or maybe a few flaws with myself. The game gives you no options, there's no choice, it's steal/kill or die. Even in my attempts to quickly set up an industry of sorts, to become self-sufficient in at least one aspect to lighten the load, I found myself always at odds with my resources. That's a very good thing, however (and this is the big one for me) the game inherently believes characters to be of "good" nature.\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation of fight or flight, the combat system is fairly simplistic but you'll likely find it easier to ambush your targets. But be warned!, each "innocent" you kill leads your whole group into depression - every "innocent" you steal from affects morale as well. Oh, and speaking of stealing, there's only two ways to handle NPCs. Either leave them alone (and if you're a "bandit", they'll flee) or kill them. There's no option for stickups, you /have/ to murder. But again, even if you were simply defending yourself, if they weren't a brigand or military, your characters will suffer.\n\nThat's where I have my biggest concern with the game. I understand that the game wants players to be "good" but when every choice you make is generally "the best of the worst" and your characters are constantly falling into depression (or broken) status, it puts a spin on the game that just isn't, in my opinion, totally necessary. Yes, the death(s) maybe should hang on the character that performed the deed, but it /is/ war. War is ugly, and "This War of Mine" pulls no punches in reminding us of that.\n\n\nOverall 9/10 This game really wants me to like it, and I do absolutely like it and highly recommend it to others. I just have issues with it's moral areas - But then again, maybe that's something with me, not the game.","November 22, 2014","true","56.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Being hit by some heavy debris during a shelling that wrecked what appears to have been a multiple story building for a large family, surrounded by a crew of four soft caramel chews. They apparently had got the memo that I was a hard piece of candy, and pledged loyalty to me immediately, as long as I saw them through the mess that was This War of Ours.\n\nAllow me to describe this crew of motley.\n\nThere's my workhorse, Bruno. This guy was a grump through and through, would complain all the time, and never stopped bumming smokes. Still he was the most competent individual in that he never seemed to waste any fuel when cooking much of anything. He's the only one who knew how to measure anything, giving you an idea of what I was working with. He was the only one I trusted with establishing our little cartel, because he was the only one I could count on to do the job right.\n\nThere's the looks, Katia. She's a pretty thing, who people always want to do favors for. She ran the front desk, handled the interactions with people when a smile, wink, handshake and hug were needed. She wasn't a bad scavenger either, but there's a bit of reluctance to ask such beauty to go picking through rubble and god-knows-what, especially when numerous unsavory characters are about.\n\nEspecially when there's Pavle. He's a real night owl. He was sick from the beginning to the end, but it seems I'm the only one who pegged him as a hypochondriac. Somehow when he didn't get his dose of 'medicine' regularly enough, he'd start showing symptoms. I let him sleep all day, at first because of his shakes, but later because he's the guy to send out at night to find and steal all the treasures that have been left behind locked doors and saw-busting grates. This guy moved like a man with purpose. He'd kill if it comes to that, but he won't like it; can't blame him for that, and besides too much killing is bad for business.\n\nFinally, there's, darling Cveta. She filled in a lot of the gaps that would develop. Most of her work was to take work from Bruno when his hands were full, keeping the water flowing, rolling a few not-too-fat ones to be sold, baiting traps, putting another log on the fire,  being another watch as guard, stuff that's hard to mess up. She did have a unique skill in that if someone was bumming the group out too much, she could always make them smile. It's always good to have that around.\n\nWe started out small, just wanted to barter a bit, were tired of being hungry and unable to defend ourselves. Cigarettes ran low in the city, addicts never could pace themselves, and so we started bootlegging them. There were no police.  We got a bit of excess capital around, got a taste for the lifestyle, saw our morals slip, started bootlegging high proof alcohol, sold it tax-free. After a while we got even bolder, started making home made bandages, and passed them off as the real thing, though we never got any complaints about them. Eventually we were putting anything that looked like it had an active ingredient, into fresh new pills and selling it as Grade-A pharmaceuticals. There's no guarantee, your mileage may vary.\n\nMostly we traded with a hood who would come by our door every few days. Always seemed to have a lot of scrap, still don't know where he kept finding it. We admired his resourcefulness, and never asked a question. There were a few other people here and there, looking for parts, weapons, tools, or whatever was still worth half a damn. When Pavle rubbed out our competition we were the best equipped militia in town. Assault rifles, kevlar, medical supplies, state-of-the-ghetto facilities. We went where we wanted and took what we desired. We could make most of it ourselves when we had the gumption.\n\nWe always had a mind toward the community though. Helped out our neighbors, helped out the hospital, never killed no one who didn't deserve it, and never took nothing we didn't plan on paying back.\n\nThen the war ended. The newly galvanized crew, they wanted to go back to their lives, friends, and families, have real jobs. They weren't criminals, they didn't want to go up against police, dodge investigations, deal with rivalries. They weren't interested in the power, excitement, or debauchery, had no need for colorful knives and expensive masks. I'd helped them survive the tough times, when that time passed, they wanted to forget what I tought them, forget the kind of person I was. They wanted to forget the kind of person I needed them to become for that short while.\n\nAll four people abandoned me shortly after and we haven't interacted since. There's no regret or shame on my end towards them, and I understand why. Friendship was never the objective; I kept them alive.","January 11","true","15.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

War torn apart the city of Pagoren instantly, leaving everyone lost, scared and in need of shelter.\n\nThe first few days, Pavle went out and gathered as much supplies as he could, enough to keep everyone fed by exploring abandonned buildings and trading with their savior Franko, always ready to barter when needed and always looking to help. Katia would negotiate best with him and get the most out of it.\n\nOne day, a couple kids came to their shelter, demanding bandages for their sick mother, bandages they didn't have. They had to unwillingly turn down the poor children and concentrate on their own survival, although they would have spared the supplies they needed if they had it.\n\nDays went by and the children came back soon enough, demanding urgent need of bandages once again. They had to be turned down with a heartfelt "sorry" for the second time.\n\nThey came back much later, in dire need of help. Their mother was slowly succumbing to her injuries and needed someone to carry her to the hospital as soon as possible. Of course the group agreed and the mother was saved thanks to their kind gesture.\n\nFrom that day, they would help everyone who needed it and sacrifice their own survival for the needs of others, no matter the cost, their humanity wouldn't be lost.\n\nSoon after, a man named Roman who had deserted the militia came in need of shelter, they agreed to let him in and so they had another mouth to feed but another guard for the night.\n\nThey went through a lot of close calls trying to secure their humanity, it would have been easy for them to just loot the house of other survivors and steal whatever they needed, but they simply wouldn't resort to such atrocities. Instead opting for the much more dangerous routes, cleaning up a warehouse of thugs and bandits, claiming it for their own and avenging the death of Olek the priest at the Church.\n\nThe first skirmish would prove to be surprisingly easy for Pavle only getting wounded killing the criminals with only a knife in hand. The man felt no remorse for killing such scum of the earth and everyone in the neighborhood felt safer knowing one less group of bandit was wandering around at night.\n\nSuffering from his injuries, he would be replaced at night by Katia, having enough space in her inventory to carry the same amount as him.\n\nTime would get tougher as war raged on outside, blocking access to many routes and giving them less options to gather supplies.\n\nInvestigating the Church one night and learning of the fate of priest Olek, she decided to follow Pavle's example and take care of the bandits once and for all and as luck would have it, she did it without suffering any major injuries, axe in hand. The place turned out to be a worthy risk to take and gave them enough supplies to last for a while.\n\nLuck would smile on them and with every good deed, came more surprises and hope of better days. Gathering enough supplies from the cleared warehouse and church to reinforce security, secure enough food for days and building an arsenal good enough to ensure their suvival. Books would keep them entertained and the discovery of a broken guitar brought music back into their life, the music of the radio would become redundant at times and everyone but Bruno knew how to play.\n\nThey even endured the lack of cigarettes and coffee and had plenty to go around. Lady Luck was truly upon them.\n\nThen Winter came....blocking even more territories to explore and once again making options thinner.\n\nOne night, while out scavenging for wood and supplies at the construction site, an almost fatal encounter for Pavle arised and the army almost shot him down, wounding him severely and causing him to be bed ridden...\n\nKatia took over meanwhile and did her best to gather all the supplies they needed.\n\nHeating up the shelter became a priority and everything else would be gained through trade and barter.\n\nThankfully for them, it was her specialty.\n\nShe kept them fed, safe and secure for most of winter, that is until she was injured too while on a run...\n\nFor a time, Roman took the job over, which wasn't easy since his bag wouldn't carry as much as both Pavle and Katia, who would remain bedridden for most of the remaining winter...\n\nThe times were tough but helping other survivors ensured them enough to survive winter and the harsh time, building two heaters to last during the cold season and harvesting as much fuel as possible at both the church and construction site.\n\nMost routes would be blocked due to snow and the options were few and far between...yet, they still wouldn't resort to commiting any atrocities towards other fellow survivors.\n\nThe part of town that was closed previously became once again available as snow slowly started melting and the promise of unexplored territories became accessible once again.\n\nThey would loot everything the town had to offer and when the surge of crime came around, they had enough to reinforce doors, keep themselves fed, healthy and stocked on weapons and ammunition. Which would still be a challenge for them in the end, having looted most of the town and having less and less options for survival, yet they still wouldn't resort to commiting crimes or murder.\n\nTimes became tougher, but they decided to built a small trap to ensure enough food to go around.\n\nCrimes became more violent throughout the city of Pagoren and the times became more than tough...they had almost no options left and they still wouldn't resort to the easier options, sacrificing their humanity wasn't an option.\n\nMuch worse, ammo was running out and the insurance of protection during nightime became more and more of an urgency.\n\nYet, they somehow managed to survive through it all, through bartering with settlements instead of stealing from them, risking their lives when needed and sparing the innocents, the declaration of ceasefire came around the corner. They had made it. All of them, through thick and thin.\n\nWe had survived, This War of Mine. More importantly, we had retained our humanity.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nStories like these are rare and this one will be treasured by me forever.\n\nI believe that no matter the sacrifices, helping each other out in times of need is better than being at each other's throat.\n\nWar is ugly, War never changes, yet, war is sadly a necessary evil, without it, someone is bound to start one anyway and the cycle will never end...If only it didn't exist or at least wasn't an option.\n\nThis War of Mine is one of the best Anti-War game i've played in my life, portraying the true casualties of war and the people that simply tried to survive through it, fighting for simple survival, day after day.\n\nI bought the DLC and i'm glad to know that the money will go to those who need it, no matter the sum, its a worthy cause.\n\n11/10 would survive and fight to retain my humanity once again.","April 2, 2015","true","24.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is so deeply immersive that I didn't even notice the sun go down after beginning play at around 4pm. I found myself still sat playing at 2 in the morning and thinking how the f*ck did I get here ? So beware of this effect.\n\nThe game puts the player in a scenario that is rarely touched upon by developers and that is the survival of civillians in the midst of war. When hearing my friend talk about the game and watching the trailer I immediately thought of the scenes from the first Austin Powers film where noone cares about the family of the henchmen. It was at this point I realised that many games out there are so focussed around being a hero/heroine and fighting a war mostly by themselves which brings a sense of gratification for every minor objective. This game is the polar opposite. Survivng is not only difficult but frustrating and at points tedious and dull.\n\nNow if anyone has bothererd to read this far (which I doubt anyone will read it full stop) you're probably wondering why I recommend this game if I describe parts of it as 'dull' and the simple answer is because of the effect this game has on each player. Every person I know who has played this game has each had a different output from the game and it truly makes you think about the world. As you take control of the several characters you can survive as you unravel more of their stories and their past making you connect with them. For me I became so grossly immersed in the character Arica and when she unfortunately died looting I honestly felt sad. This game, although being totally fictional in its storyline, has brought humanity to a war game so brilliantly. When you help a neighbour it truly feels like you're doing good for a community even though it doesn't exist ! I wont ramble on (great Led Zep song) because I'm only writing this out of sheer boredom however this game has inspired me to donate money to war child every month as it has truly opened my eyes to an experience that I hope to never go through myself but I am more aware of its impact thanks to this game.\n\nThe point I'm probably not getting across well is that this game can be played by most people (as it is not very demanding graphics wise) and should be because of its true potential to shed light on the horrible conditions some people live in even today if we look at Syria as an example. I rate this game 10/10 as it is truly fantastic in its setup. It's simple, clean and packs a fantastic message for any player with an open mind who's not stuffing their face with energy drinks and treating it like a challenge rather than an immersive experience. If that's the case I would suggest Counter Strike. If you have read this far I would suggest doing something better with your time as this is quite honestly just me typing random words that dont make sense now.

You start with 3 People , they have their own skills. With these skills you can help them during the war. It isn't easy to manage all these things sometimes you haven't enough food or medicin or something else. It's  hard because when you want something to eat you have to kill.\n\nGraphics:\nThe Graphics is drawn. It is really impressive! But it is not colorful. That makes the athmosphare so depressing.\n\nSound:\nThe Sound is depressing too. But! But its very well done with istruments. The Music fits very well into This War of Mine.\n\nGameplay:\nYou have to manage three people with different skills, these skills can be used for the best loot. You have to kill for survivaling during the war. You can makes different things for example water or heating. You need parts for weapons or something else.\n\n\nGraphics:  8,5/10\nSound:      8/10\nAthmosphare: 9/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nFrustationfactor (less is better): 4/10\n\n79/100 Points\nMark: 2-\n\nMy opinion at the end:\n\nI recommend "This War of Mine" because it remind that war isnt always a good thing.

Do good deeds, and you will have goods in return! Lol)\n\nHere is some thoughts for the dev, if you are going to update the game for a more dynamic game play:\nControls could be slightly annoying sometimes.\nI really wish that the weather will influence more of our play style; for instance, crops could have gone dormant during really really cold days(I know we have a heating lamp but... it is not the same as growing things under sunlight). Or, scavenging during a storm makes it harder to hear noises, in the meanwhile you will be harder to detect.\nI have never had any bandits come knocking on my door, which is very surprising to me. I think under a civil war setting like this, there might be a bit more bandits running around in bright daylight since they appeal to be really well armed. the only danger for my daytime game play was once two soldier came to my door looking for a thief(which is my neigbour, and I helped him, lol). I said I can't help and shut the door on them and they just stood for a while and left... I imagined they'd be a lot more aggrassive so I was nervous. Because some of them just kill and rob and ♥♥♥♥... But I suppose not all of those soldiers are bad. :P Or maybe I was just lucky.

When Pavle rubbed out our competition we were the best equipped militia in town. Assault rifles, kevlar, medical supplies, state-of-the-ghetto facilities. We went where we wanted and took what we desired. We could make most of it ourselves when we had the gumption.\n\nWe always had a mind toward the community though. Helped out our neighbors, helped out the hospital, never killed no one who didn't deserve it, and never took nothing we didn't plan on paying back.\n\nThen the war ended. The newly galvanized crew, they wanted to go back to their lives, friends, and families, have real jobs. They weren't criminals, they didn't want to go up against police, dodge investigations, deal with rivalries. They weren't interested in the power, excitement, or debauchery, had no need for colorful knives and expensive masks. I'd helped them survive the tough times, when that time passed, they wanted to forget what I tought them, forget the kind of person I was. They wanted to forget the kind of person I needed them to become for that short while.\n\nAll four people abandoned me shortly after and we haven't interacted since. There's no regret or shame on my end towards them, and I understand why. Friendship was never the objective; I kept them alive.","January 11","true","15.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

However, the game is compelling and incredibly captivating.\n\nNo other game manages to make you feel like a piece of ♥♥♥♥ for taking things you need. It sets perspective to the FPS of the world, where you mindlessly blow heads of and get points.\n\nThe setting is perfect. No zombies or other supernatural ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that would taint this idea. It feels very harsh and incredibly satisfying at the same time. At least if you manage to have something good happen to you (which is very very rare)\n\nIt has some flaws. If you managed to set yourself up well enough, you can just stay home for a long period of time without worrying about anything but water. Luckily, a "traveling merchant" will take care of that need, making it nigh unnecessary to go scavenge.\n\nSometimes it feels a bit clunky in regards to the movement, but it's very minor and mainly nitpicking.\n\nDefinitely recommend to anyone that loves a real survival game, where killing everything is an option, but not necessarily one you want to take It's not a lightly made decision to shoot the older sister just trying to protect her family, or rob the old couple that can't defend themselfes and just wants to live through the war","November 18, 2014","true","16.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I sent one of my survivors to a hospital to find some food and medical supplies. Armed only with a shotgun and a handful of rounds, I load up on all I can loot and was about to make my way out of the building. I was eyeing a guard and saw that he had an AK-47 looking assault weapon... I wanted it, oh boy did I want it. I made the mistake of pulling my shotgun out and pumped the guard with 2 slugs. He fell over in a bloody mess. I instantly felt remorse, but had a satisfied feeling of obtaining a much more viable survival tool. I then heard footsteps pounding overhead. I made my way towards the exit of the clinic before I was stopped by two guards with automatic assault rifles. Without question they both lit up my character, fifteen rounds each and he slumped over striving for a last breath. I lost a friend that day.\n\nI personally felt bad for my actions. One of the few games that is able to instill emotions other than high adrenaline and rage inducing mechanics. I am in love.\n\n2.) A runaway theif appeared at the doorstep of my safehouse. Begging for someplace to stay, so I allowed the woman into my home. It was getting dark and I had to make plans for the night. I decided to send the woman out on her first mission to gather supplies and armed her with a knife. She made her way to a quiet house and opened the front door. From within the house a loud cry rang out. "GET OUT OF MY HOME." cried an old man jumping out of his armchair. He approached the woman and demanded that she left. Showing no mercy, the woman pulled out the knife and with one flick of the wrist, plunged the cold steel into the man's throat spewing forth a ribbon of red silk. The old man's wife, hearing the commotion decided to enter the room and witnessed her husband's corpse hit the floor. Scared for her life, the old woman ran for the back door. However, she was too late. One swift prick and the knife entered her spine. She died before she hit the floor. The woman took everything the couple owned and fled back to the safe house.\n\nI sincerely felt bad for these people. However, I need to survive. I was surprised to see the impact it made on the character and the rest of the party. For I was not expecting such an in-depth experience.","December 6, 2014","true","4.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","3"

She couldn't hide it even if she wanted to. Her mood is broken. Despite all attemps to bring her food, talk to her, telll her to get some sleep. She just seem destroyed by the war. sometimes she keeps to herself at night and doesn't sleep at all. Poor little thing. I wonder, maybe seeing Pavle risk his life for us every night is starting to lay heavy on her heart. I see the light in her eyes every morning when he makes it back. I must admit... I dont know what we would do without him. the fella is doing a whole lotta of good for us.\n\nAnd to make things worse, Bruno is always complaining, i want this or that. I want some cirgarettes. Why is it so cold in here, while Pavle is just trying to get some rest from the hellish night he just had. i can see the look on Pavle's face when Bruno keeps on babling about his cigarettes and his restauant. Were all getting more tired everyday, and hearing Bruno's complaints just doesn't help. I really dont know why Bruno is complaining, he always insist to stay home for the night... claiming we need someone on overwatch. he's right, but i bet Pavle would gladly take a shift or two on watch sometimes.\n\nBut Pavle goes out almost every night, for him... for us... Heck even for strangers. I never heard Pavle complain about going out at night. I really dont know how he does it, the bandits, the poor peaople begging in the streets, not to mention the snipers who just use the civilians as target practice. Two nights ago, two kids came by our shelter asking for medications. They said that their mother is dying. they said, we just need a few sir, please help us. I could see the way he had a hard time telling them that we didn't have anything. But he said come back tomorow i might stop by the hospital if the weather is right. that poor little girl seemed so happy. Pavle tried to smile back, but he knew too well that the chances that he finds medication were slim...\n\nLast night Pavle came back with blood stains on his jacket, he said it was nothing to worry about, its just a scrach. He went strait to bed without even eating, not to mention his guitar, he usualy always plays guitar before going to sleep. I wonder what happened, He must see all sorts of nasty things out there. He never really tells us what happens when he's out. I guess he knows how sensitive Katia is, She doesn't need to hear all the gruesome details of what's out there.\n\nGod i wish this war is over soon.\n\nToday Pavle brought back coffee for Katia, he knows how much she loves it, but nothing does it. i think she really misses her familly. she's falling more and more into dark thoughts. She even told me that she wanted to end it herself... whats the point she said. She then went on how she was sick of it all, how she couldn't take the hunger anywmore.Those kids, they never came back, she mumbled with tears in her eyes. Those poor chiIdrens....I kept on telling her that we needed her. that we all need each other in order to survive this hell. Even made her a coffee, she didn't even look at it.\n\nAnd then Bruno came in the room, i could see it in his face, he was angry, he said, I've never seen you bring anything special for us! I swiftly replied that Pavle might not bring what you want, but he always brings what we need. Then the argument escalated on how he could have made room for something more... useful. Pavle just kept his cool, never said a word, then Bruno said, WELL!, AREN'T YOU GONNA SAY SOMETHING! Pavle just looked in Bruno's eyes, and pulled two cigarettes from his jacket. Bruno just sat there for a moment...and said... You Know, we can sell those for a pretty good amount of food... Pavle then said, i found some veggetables on my way back, would go well with the frozen rats you found. Im sure you can make it taste like the stew my mother used to make,,, after all, you're the Chef. Bruno smiled and left the room. Katia stopped crying and we went on... for another chapter...\n\ni will survive... this war of mine...\n\n","November 16, 2014","true","37.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You get relatively few characters to use, each with their own benefit, so losing even one may have dire consequences.\n- The gameplay has the right amount of challenge to it. If you play smart, you should be alright but if you do not, you will not survive. The fact that the game is unforgiving also helps to evoke the sense of desperation present in the characters' situation.\n- The environment. With the right tools, you can begin to destroy things like cabinets to scavenge them for parts.\n- The art style. The way the game handles shading, and your characters' field of vision, is great.\n- The game evolves as you play. Did you leave a pile of wood in that rubble, for later? Getting back to it may suddenly become impossible, between the fighting and the snow. And if you do get back to it, there's no guarantee it'll even be there, if the area you're going has people at it. It makes the choice between that can of food, or that bunch of planks, all the more important.\n- Your characters give you feedback about the choices that they make, and their feedback can have tangible results in gameplay. Generally, the more horrible you are to your fellow man, the sadder your little group becomes, which seems to effect how quickly they move, or perform tasks.\n\nThis game is very immersive. If you were a fan of the Fallout Series, but also enjoy a more "serious", even dark, atmosphere, this game is definitely for you.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game gets repetitious, during the day cycle.\n- "Realism". This War of Mine does a good job of drawing you into the setting, but at the same time there are a lot of little things that break one's suspension of disbelief. The way the game squishes time means that it can take your people a half an hour to climb two ladders and walk a hundred feet to answer the door. In a game focused on gathering and survival, there are a lot of things that you can't scavenge. Doors, and the planks barring the doors, I'm looking at you. Papercuts also generally don't require rolls of bandages to combat. And closing doors doesn't seem to increase the temperature in your shelter any, when it starts getting cold. Also, why I have to purify my water before I boil it, I'll never know.\n- The game's "Good choice/bad choice" moments are pretty generic "do the good and inconvenient thing/do the bad and helpful thing" survival choices. Where the decision making really begins to get murky, is with the internal choices such as "Who gets to eat?" (Sorry I let you starve Bruno, but the irony of the cook starving was too amusing).\n- The level of interaction you have with other people is limited in comparison to games with similar themes.\n- There is no tutorial. This is also in the Good category. This is also bad because the game does not explain how combat works, so the first few times a situation goes sideways you will probably lose due to figuring out what does what.\n\nThis is a slower-paced game. If you are a fan of flashier/shooter games, and not a fan of micromanagement, this game probably isn't your cup of tea.\n\nAll in all? I'd rate this game a solid 8.5/10.","December 31, 2014","true","80.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","0"

If I was stuck with Bruno or Katia in such a situation I would have left them days ago.\n\nI managed to finish the game in around about 10 hours, not very lenghly for 15 pounds imo and the replay value that I was told was there, simply isn't.\n\nNothing new comes into play the 2nd time around, that burning building you loot for the basic supplies on your first night is in the same place and isn't any different to how it was the 1st time and even if you get a different location or two from the first time you played towards the end you'll realise you've done pretty much the same thing all over again.\n\nThose 'dynamic' events i read about in reviews are about as dynamic as a college timetable, they happen in the exact same places with the exact same layouts. Sure you get people knocking on your door when your at home but again these aren't dynamic, I played in the same house in 2 different playthroughs and the events from the 1st time happened in the exact same order in the 2nd.\n\nSure the supermarket and church have a couple of different scenarios, friendly looters or a woman about to get attacked in the supermarket or a frtiendly priest willing to trade or bandits that are a cowerdly bunch to say the least and only one has a gun but he's clearly there to give you some stealth kill practice as he's so easy to sneak up on it was like attacking a dummy, same with the soldier at the supermarket.\n\nThen you get places like the Warehouse which has no kind of change in their scenario, I always have bandits there that shoot on sight and never want to trade so I'd avoid if your not very good at the whole 'stealth' thing.\n\nWhich leads me to the stealth, 8/10 it works but occasionally it will glitch and instead of silently walking to a hiding spot you'll alert the whole damn building by charging full pelt at it so stealth is slightly wonky but bearable. But when your caught and surrounded by people who can see you and have guns then your dead, no other way around it and Dead is Dead with an autosave feature that stops you from reverting to an older save. I also found it annoying that this bandit i was chasing, who had no weapon in his hand, managed to beat down my healthy character who was carrying a frigging hatchet! Also even if you have a gun and plenty of ammo, good luck actually hitting anyone before they charge you and stab you in the gut.\n\nSo yeah the combat is very poor and uneven, the only sure way to get a kill is through a stealth kill from cover, anything else takes a few hits.\n\nSure it was fun the 1st time but for £15 I feel like kinda let down at the poor replay value. Maybe I just got unlucky with my scenarios and the luck of the draw was not in my favour or maybe it really is just repetitive garbage?\n\nMy raiting 4/10: Definetely original and interesting in concept but it just didn't work for me...Personally it would have worked better as a mobile game.","January 30, 2015","false","15.6"," 94 of 176 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","94","176","3","0"

It allows us to explore and immense in the difficult choice in real life without the hassle of going through it in real life without actully going into way.\n\nMy only complaint? Why no tutorial. Sure it breaks the setup and scene but it would have been nice. However, if you the developer reading this can I make a suggestion?

Do you know why I don't approve of war? It interferes with the production of Turbinium and that makes me angry. When I am angry, people die. That is why I decided to play This War of Mine. I enjoyed seeing what it is like for non-Mars Colonial Administrators to survive in extremely tough conditions. The look and feel is excellent and the plot is surprisingly moving and even made me shed a tear, but that might have been from an unrelated spec of Martian Dust.\n\nThis game reminds me of Papers, Please in terms of impact, and Zafehouse Diaries in terms of game play (though This War of Mine is far better in every way). Highly recommended. I'm hoping I can find Kuaato in the game and nail that freaky sonofa♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNow stop reading this and get back to the Turbinium mines, before I shut off your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ air.\n\nVilos Cohaagen,\nColonial Administrator, Mars Colony","November 16, 2014","true","1.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is brutal, unfair but balanced in strange way. You spend day working around you shelter, using things you found during the night or traded for to make things to trade or upgrade your home. You want to be able to make booze, a major trade item, so water and a distillery are two biggies, with beds up there as well. Also being  able to make crowbars, lock picks, and saws are major important, so get a tool bench asap. During the night, you put people on guard, sleep, or scavenge. You have to balance the needs of everyone, and I found that my people would spend most of the day sleeping, doing a few small odd jobs first things, and the night on guard duty, with the exception of sick or hurt people who got more sleep. Its scary to be sneaking around a war zone, seeing the bombed out ruins of a city, as you try to survive. There are other survivors out there, some civilians, others military, and some will attack you on the spot, or if you go in their stuff, or they will leave you alone.\n\nThe Cons:\nYou can only send out one scavenger a night, which sucks, and I don't like. I'm sorry, but if I have three or four survivors I would send out two to get stuff and make survival easier, risk vs reward. If i get raided and they kill the one peoson left behind, then thats the price I pay. The game is also very slow during the day, not much happens, and there doesn't appear to be a way to fast forward other than skipping to the night, however if you do that then you may miss a afternoon visitor, person selling something or someone who needs help (the later never game me anything for the help which seemed a bit odd, but I was ok with that, made sense).\n\nAll in All:\nI like the game, but it's slow and not for everyone.

So we searched each building we could find. Marko was our skilled scavenger,Bruno,me,an excellent cook and Pavle a football player who was a good runner. Marko,on one night,went to this quiet house,he found an old couple which had food and medicine,which we really needed,so he made a difficult choice in stealing some supplies. Time passed...Marko was ready for another run,but little did he know that this was gonna be his last time saying "I'll see you guys in a bit." to the others. He went to this church,when he got there he didn't see anybody,but when he went down some stairs 2 guys told him to leave,Marko being a good fellow,told them that he wanted to trade,but the strangers kept insisting on him to leave so they punched him and he fought back,but since he was wounded,sadly the 2 strangers killed Marko...\nPavle was devastated even more,since he was in depression,was sick and was bleeding. Bruno tried to talk with Pavle,but Pavle wanted to be left alone,so he left. That night,Bruno went for a run to scavenge,he got to this school where there was rebel soldiers,he went to the door and was greeted by a soldier who told him to leave,but was willing to trade,so Bruno started walking away,but then  he realized Pavle need medication and bandages,so he went in by force and the soldier told him to stop,but Bruno kept searching,the soldier told him "I'm gonna let you go this time,but next time you won't be so lucky." As Bruno was about to leave he heard soldiers screaming "Hey,you,stop!' from the other side of the building. He ran till he got back to his shelter,but it wasn't over yet... He went to the bathroom and saw Pavle hanging with a note that said "I can't take it anymore!". Bruno fell to the floor crying and started thinking "Is suicide the only way out of this hell?".","December 31, 2014","true","2.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This War of Mine well take your soul down a road that well show what kind of person you really are. To explain this i would like to tell you a story about my first game play exp. It started off with three civi survivors of a brutal war, Two males and a female. I decided to take my female to the church my first night and see if I can recieve any help and get a feel for the game. I arrived at the church to find a priest, where I proceeded to speak to him where he informed me he cant help because he was robbed earlier. I decided to take a look around the church not steeling anything just looking around, when I opened a door into their kitchen i was approached by the priest and his "crew" where they then proceeded to beat my character until she was dead. I woke up on day two with only two characters left who are now depressed because of thier loss. Now knowing what I know I decided to take the approach I wanted to take in the first place, I'm going to look out for number one and number one only. I speant the next two days stealing supplys from every where i could to keep my remaining two characters alive. on day 4 I found a super market, inside I found food, water, matts, and two people talking, a male soldier and a female civi. The civi was looking for food and asked the soldier for help. He said he would help but he wants something in return, and that something is sex. she said no and he then proceeded to hit her and drag her out back to take what he wanted. not wanting to lose my supplies I left her to to the will of that soldier and his perverse ways. On day 5 I sent out to look for more supplies in some houses because my other character I left back at the shelter was becoming sick and needed meds but i was caught and they shot my character in back while trying to escape.. I woke up on day 6 with one character left who is now getting really sick. There where some houses with low threat and lots of food and meds so i decided to head there in a last ditch attepmt to stay alive. When I arived I found two very old folks a man and his very sick wife living there. He came up to me and asked what I needed and if I could leave him and his sick wife alone. They where just robbed and didnt have much left he said, but needing meds i decided to rob this old man and his wife blind stealing everything they had, he begged and begged me not to take the meds so his wife would live but i stole them any ways. When I got home back to the shelter my character became very depressed, disqusted with his actions of robbing that old couple. Day 7 would become my last day. Completely disqusted with his actions, his loses, and the way the world is, my last character hung him self and commited suicide ending the game. Because of all that I realized I have dark cold heart because after that hole ordeal if I was that last guy that hole ordeal would not have ♥♥♥♥ed me up that bad haha but to each his own.

I started over well over three times and am now in day 29 or 30 or something.\n\nAlthough the game mechanics are somewhat simple (you only have so much to do until you run out of new stuff to explore) they are quite addictive. Find food, parts, build stuff and consumables, take care of sicknes, sadness and/or depression. You need to plan in advance. Should the next night be a "food run" or do you really need more wood for the upcoming winter? It's basicly a LOT of micromanagement and so far, it is entertaining.\n\nThere's also a lot of really tough decissions to make. Will you save someone but risk your own survivors lifes? Or will you become desperate and loot and pillage your way through every encounter you make? How will your survivors react to what you do? The good thing is that there is no real good or evil. You have to survive. How you do that is up to you. So either you do whatever it takes or you start to compromise and maybe die.\n\nA few cons tho :\n- Some tasks are really tiresome (build fuel, build water filters...each and every day a new).\n- Although randomly picked by the game at every start, you soon find yourself lacking in new locations with each new game.\n- Combat is not really controllable. Sometimes while you clearly clicked on that enemy, your survivor runs past him or fails to perform any strike.\n- The game aims to be somewhat realistc but it really lacks in possibilities when it comes to scavenging. WHY DO I HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE TO GET SOME WOOD, WHILE THERES HALF A DOZEN PERFECTLY GOOD WOODEN PICTUREFRAMES LYING AROUND IN MY SHELTER?!\n- Water should really be more important than food but so far you only need it for cooking and making booze. Humans can go quite a long time without food but not without water.\n\nLastly I would really wish for more interaction between your own survivors. There's no internal "conflict" to be solved, nor any interaction whatsoever (you CAN let them talk to each other when someone is depressed but that's about it)\n\nNone the less, the game really can suck you in and it IS entertaining. I still struggle with the fact that I accidently mistaken another scavenger for a "bandit" and killed him in cold blood but those are the things that happen in war. He had a gun and he could have used it when he saw my survivor. Sometimes it's better to strike first and ask questions later...sometimes.","November 16, 2014","true","19.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You are playing groups of civilians, struggling to survive the cruel war.\n\nWill you kill the poor old man and his son for their meds, so you can save your friend ? Or will you let your friend bleed out to death ?\n\nWill you steal from the couple, leaving them starving to death, or will you starve to death yourself?\n\nAre you going to spare somebody to help other people, to get your people's moral up, or are you gonna turn down everybody that shows up?\n\nQuestion is, will you kill to save yourself or your friends?\n\nTWOM will make you connect to the characters - you will feel the consequences yourself, go on, kill the guy and then bear to his girlfriend's cries! Wether you will feel it or not - your characters will definetly feel it.\n\nIn the end, every run you'll do will end up with impact on your emotions.\n\n\nA little tip: It's easy to be a bad guy/gal and go on killing and stealing things, using whatever tricks you find to boost your people's moral so they don't get too depressed, but it's hard to survive without hurting anybody, without doing anything that you could now... call "wrong". Thing is, you are the one influencing your character's story. It's karma. You get what you give :)\n\nNow, talking about right and wrong - imagine yourself trying to survive such a war, in real life. Then, say you have a brother or sister and you're trying to survive with them. Think about your decisions - how will you do it ?\n\nJust.. buy it. You can pirate it, but seriously man. I used to pirate all single player games. But you just can't. This game is TOO good to NOT support the devs, if you have the possibility. They deserve it. And trust me, you'll have a good run with this game :)\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR THE DEVS\n\n\nI can definetly see this game being a multiplayer game with each player controling his group of survivors, through the war. Fair or not, some would have weak groups, other will have strong ones - it would be so great that one could compare it to AAA titles - that's just how great this game is.\n\nNow, I know Multiplayer would be really hard to implement. Lots of code to do and change, lots of ideas needed to be able to handle the day/night cycle, but it would be just great. It could even be a different version which you need to pay again - another game, another TWOM - a standalone multiplayer version. Hell, I'd pay again just to play it! be it 20 euro, it would be goddam worth!","April 8","true","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You start in the same exact house. Every. Single. Time. ~Would be great to update the game so that we could start in a variety of different houses. Maybe different cities entirley, more locations to loot would be nice, and how far away places are should go into how much time you have to loot each night~\n2.) Characters are also very similar each start! ~Would be good to add LOADS of variety when it comes to starting conditions and qualities. Would be nice to see more of a variety of how many characters you start with~\n3.) I should *If I want* Have my character be apart of a bigger group of NPC's wether it IS the military, a scavenger (Like you are now in the game), a homeless person, or if I choose I could be a trader who goes around the city in the day trying to make my way to other houses to make profit!\n4.) The war time it takes for the war to be over (Right now i've heard it's either 39 or 45 days) should be far more varied! It could last a few weeks, it could last a few months or even years! ~Which could translate to some adjustable difficulty setting!\n5.) When I get in trouble with a certain establishment with one character from my group, how the ♥♥♥♥ do they know that all the people in my group are bad? Who told them that the person who tried to rob them last night was with this whole group, and that no one from that group should be trusted?\n6.) More complicated crafting system and a more advanced inventory would be really nice! Instead of picks up 'parts', you would find a pile of seperate piece of rubber tube, duct tape, screw, bolts, wire etc...\n7.) Multiplayer/ Co-op! Some people don't agree with this. In fact, a lot! But there are still quite a few who would want to survive the world with a friend. Someone defends the house at night, and the other scavenges. Maybe they both scavange. Perhaps have the option that if both characters are guarding or sleeping in the house at night, they could skip the night and have the AI take over wether it is for better or worse. (There is no reason why people shouldn't want multiplayer/co-op) You DO NOT have to play multiplayer if you don't want to. And can still experience the game in singleplayer the way YOU think it should.\n8.) Either than all of the above, not a bad game. I do reccomend it for the price, although there are some things that need tweaking, and a few freatures that could be made to make this a TRULEY full fleged game. If the developers were to do the things I said above, then the game would be in my opinion FAR more worth than the $20 it is listed at now.\n\n-These are all opinions that I think would make the game much better! You can ignore these if you want, but I do hope the developers see this on an off chance and atleast the consider the things that I said unless they haven't already. You wouldn't think money would be a problem since they were bragging about how they paid the cost of development within the first two days of sale :P","December 1, 2014","true","15.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm not usually a person for the point and click games, but this was recomended by a friend. And I will say it is very entertaining. Hey, It ain't your common brainless strategy and shooter survival game. But that's what makes it fantastic! The psychological aspects of war are often overlooked. What's more, everytime someone touch on the subject, you more than often play just you're typical army trained person with a natural talent for killing and surving. Here we have the averege citizens thrown in the chaos that is a city during war times. And believe me, play the game without thinking of the consequences, and you'll end up with a group of mentally broken survivors.\n\nI'm not a man for making a pros and cons list of the game. For anyone not intriuged enough by the reviews, I'll go ahead and advise TotalBiscuits recent made video on the game that is avaible on his Youtube channel Cheers.","November 18, 2014","true","7.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Only game so far to make me feel like a complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe premise of the game is that the capital of some made-up country has fallen into a chaos after the country's military sealed it off so as to seal off any supply route for the rebels. You now have to survive in there.\n\nThe game feels like a sister of FTL. Things are completely random, you may go to the same place a different playthrough. But, one time there may be a drunk soldier trying to "coerce" a female looter. Or another time, there may be 3 armed bandits that will shoot on sight. Sometimes though, you may need to go into somewhere that isn't vacated, and you will have to steal in order to survive.\n\nSometimes, sometimes, the game throws a complete curveball from out of nowhere. I sent my scavenger to a house that seemed abandoned, and the game said that they had lots of food. Something I run out on a constant basis. Map loads, and I start trying to go in, but then there are two red spots(The game's take on the modern FPS radar). Well that's not just a rat. More often then not that's a hostile. And without fail, one of them shouts that they are armed and not afraid to fire on sight. So of course, I sneak over the roof and lockpick the door on the balcony. Sneak down the stairs and stab the one person that I saw, that was armed. Instantly one of the doors comes flying open, a woman, and hunches over the dead body, crying. The body on the ground was a man.\n\nI didn't kill her since she didn't present any harm.\n\nWandering through the house, looting of course, I saw all sorts of things. Set ups that you could do in your own base, vegetable gardens, bed, all those things. Pictures on the wall of the two previously mentioned. I just randomly came into this house, and killed an innocent that was just trying to survive. I mistakenly went from being a goody two shoes, to a bandit.\n\nGoddammit.","November 16, 2014","true","31.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You're pretty much forced to be the good guy in this war as bad decisions to steal too much from innocents or murder innocent people can and will most likely have a negative impact on all your survivors in the shelter and if any of your survivors go from a depressed state into a broken state that survivor will render useless for the whole period of being in a broken state and there is the risk that they will leave the shelter or go down the path of suicide.\n\nIt's important to time manage well especially during the daytime hours, make sure that survivors are getting enough food, rest, build anything that your survivors currently need, manufacture moonshine and alcohol if needed, put some more food inside your rat trap to catch some more rats for meat, always have at least one survivor rest during scavenge time that way you'll always have at least one survivor to do the daytime chores while the others rest.  it's advisable to get your hands on a firearm as quickly as possible as firearms help in a great deal to avoid being raided during the night, if you don't have any firearms, knives or an axe will do the job, it's important to get established early in the game, build a heater before winter comes, upgrade your metal workshop as early as possible so you can craft an axe to destroy the desks and wardrobes inside your shelter for wood, this will be important for surviving through the cold during the winter time and to build more things for your shelter early on in the game.\n\nThe player has to survive until a ceasefire which can happen randomly on any day (usually between days 40-50 but it can happen as early as day 25) also the winter usually happens during days 20-30 but it can be random as well, same with crime waves they can happen during any time and usually last at least 7-10 days which increase the chances of being raided each night, during this time especially it's very useful to have firearms. It's also useful to build a radio and check it everyday during the daytime period to get reports of weather changes, areas that are too dangerous to go to, also it will let you know on the radio when a ceasefire is getting close.\n\nI got through a 10 day crime wave, 9 days of winter and got a ceasefire on day 43 and only killed 2 innocents during the whole game, however they tried to attack me when they caught me trying to steal from them as I was desperate for supplies at the time so it didn't hurt the moral of my shelter that much, I did however lose 2 people in my shelter one on day 39 due to severe wounds and another in the hospital by a heavily armed and armored militia thug on day 40.\n\nIt can be a tough game and frustrating for some people to survive and you'll have a lot of choices to make, kill the innocent for supplies? Steal supplies from other innocent people also trying to survive the war? Help those in need at the cost of losing people or supplies that you worked hard for to scavenge? Kill thugs and miltia that deserve to die and steal all their supplies? I'll leave those choices for you to make.    :)\n\nPlease buy the "War Child Charity DLC"\n\nHelp the children that went through or have to go through such atrocities and pain during these depressing times of war.","March 20","true","34.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artyomGR/recommended/282070/","artyomGR","ArtyomGR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artyomGR/","467 products in account","Without a doubt, This War of Mine has been one of my favorite games. I purchased this knowing it was possible an interesting concept, and decided to give it a go. After playing it for some hours in the past 10 days, I have to say that it's probably the best emotional game.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you start this game up is the very minimalistic design. The game plays out in very simple 2D environments that look almost like pages from a sketchbook. If you're anything like me, this might take you aback. Call me shallow, but graphics are important to me! They're not everything, but they go a long way in immersing you in the storyline. As the game unfolds, however, you realize that the simple, drab art actually matches the "survivors in a war-torn city" theme quite well. Before long, you're completely lost in this world.\n\nLike the art, the gameplay mechanics are simple to grasp but far deeper than they appear at first glance. You start out in your shelter--a dilapidated, abandoned house--and you notice icons over the various things you can interact with. Click on a pile of rubble, and you find some wood and nails. Open a cabinet and you find a few pieces of jewelry and a lockpick. You'll need all of these things. This isn't like Skyrim where half the stuff you find is junk, and it isn't like Fallout where you can beat the game without even dealing with the crafting components. Here, everything you find has a purpose that can save your life. Those old electrical components will be used to construct a radio that will clue you in to what's going on in the city; that empty pill casing can you be used to make critical medications later in the game. Even stuff like old books are useful. Your characters can read them to stay entertained and happy (more on that later), you can burn them for fuel to stave off the chill of winter, or you can trade them for things you need. The challenge comes in choosing what to take with you. As the game progresses, you must venture out into the city to scavenge supplies, and your squad members have very limited backpack space to carry things in. Do you bring back the the gunpowder to make the bullets you'll need to clear out the bad guys in another area, or do you pick up the food that's as scare as it is critical? Finding the right balance is essential, and you'll likely have to start over a couple times before you know what works best.\n\nNo matter what style of play you choose, the game is always challenging. That's a good thing! In other games, you might just kill everyone you see and take their possessions until you build up enough wealth to coast through the game. Better them than you right? Not so here. Killing innocent characters or even stealing from them will cause your squad to suffer guilt. You'll see little thought bubbles appear of their head sharing their lament with you: "Those patients at the hospital are probably going to die because of me." Kill too many non-bad guys and one of your squad members may even commit suicide. Most other reviewers are using the term "pulls no punches" a lot, and that's definitely true.\n\nThe only drawbacks are in the minimalistic design. While it works well, you can't help but imagine how much better the game could have been with a little more depth. Since emotions play such a big role for your characters, it would be nice to have some kind of dialogue system you could use to cheer each other up, or maybe even ask for help from other non-team members. Also, there's a lot of room for the storyline to really develop and add to the emotional impact you feel. Even lacking this, however, this is still a great, challenging game.","March 21","true","29.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Everything is dark and brooding, which really sets the overall tone.  Their lighting system is a thing of beauty as well:  rays of light shine through broken walls and windows, fire barrels give a nice ominous glow in the night.\n\nAudio:  Somber acoustic guitar soundscapes reminiscent of The Last Of Us play during the day, and the night scavenging missions feature very tense, suspenseful string and synth arrangements.  Environmental sound effects like artillery shells landing and the crack of sniper fire constantly remind you that you're never really safe.\n\nControls:  Point and click adventure style.  You navigate around the environment by clicking where you want to go, objects you can interact with in the environment have their own separate icon.  While in the safehouse, you control each character independently by selecting their character photo then giving them their own commands. Navigating the menu system is simple and straightforward.\n\nGameplay:  Everything is randomly generated at the start, so no play through is the same.  The safehouse sequences are fairly routine.  Build this, repair that, eat, rest.  The game really comes alive when night falls and you have to decide what to do with your survivors.  Sickness, hunger, and injury are very serious threats to your group, and losing anyone significantly increases your risk of having the whole thing come crashing down on you.  Managing your survivors is key to getting through the siege.  There's also significant danger when it comes to the overall scavenging:  rolling over those weaker than you and taking everything they have makes you a target for vigilantes and decreases morale, and some of the more well-stocked areas tend to be heavily guarded by hostile military forces and other survivor groups who have no compunctions about killing anyone who sets foot on their turf.\n\nMy one major complaint is the lack of a tutorial or tool hints on the environmental icons.  It doesn't take too long to figure stuff out, but the initial learning curve can lead to some restarts.  There are very few bugs, which is always a plus.\n\nOverall Score:  9/10","November 15, 2014","true","8.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I am trying to take a deep breath and calm myself before I write the review...\n\nHere is the truth.  I LOVED this game, so why would I rate it down?  The artistic value of the game is to be revered.  The game-play is fun, addictive like crack, and balanced all the way through.  It is a survival game that makes you care for your characters because with a little extra thought, proper preparation, and a careful use of resources, the game can be the PERFECT challenge all the way through.  Not so much that you put it away from dying all the time, but just enough so you feel that you can learn from your mistakes when you take the wrong person looting and get him/her shot, push too far into a bandits' base for loot and  get someone killed, or become a bandit yourself and watch your characters hate themselves for it.  It all works!  So WHY in god's name am I rating this game down.... SIGH.  I will tell you at the end, because the ending is is why I am now jaded.\n\nThis game has this unique blend of survival and platformer elements.  The combat is a little wonky, but this is not an action game.  This is a survival game that pushes your moralities to the limit: do you send off one of your characters for a day to help your neighbors who in the past have shown you kindness, or do you turn your back and keep to yourself so you can keep your base safe while looting?  Killing is not taken lightly in this game.  Most of the characters are not fighters.  They have never shot at anyone before and you must weigh how stressful it will be on them to out-right murder a person for his/her loot.  sometimes it might be best to come back from a night of looting with a bag half full and a heart that is not broken.\n\nThe characters themselves are all full of life and special in their own way.  One or two are trained in combat, and do not feel the pressure of killing so long as they  are not killing innocents.  Some are good cooks, others are handy-men that  use less resources to build and craft with.  Others can keep children calm and tend to wounded while others are small but stealthy, making them ideal for nightly looting runs\n\nLooting is done so well.  Your characters feel no pain from looting bandits, but question themselves for steeling from an elderly family.  The stealth mechanics are solid and intense at many times.  I managed a play-through without ever shooting at anyone. (apart from defending my base from bandits.  Can't be controlled and it doesn't affect your characters depression)  I chose to help all  who asked of it, but stole when I needed to as long as I did not leave someone for dead by doing so, and yes there is a difference between taking what you need in this game, and taking everything, and your character will reflect on that.  Limited backpack space and time turn scavenging into a strategic race for time as you decide whether or not to bring a crowbar and lock-pick, or save the space and only take what loot is easily accessible while scouting out threats, bared and locked doors and piles of obstructing rubble that can be cleared on a succeeding night.  Rubble that can be moved without a shovel,  but will take a lot of your precious time if you chose to do so.\n\nKeeping your team rested and fed feels just right, and the amount of given resources is remarkable.  Too big of a team means that more food will be needed than can be provided.  Too small and your base will be raided while you are out looting and sleeping.  Choosing who sleeps at night, who sleeps on a bed or off a bed, and who sleeps during the day can't be taken lightly.  Wounded characters will take rest, first-aid, and time to heal.  A few nights passed that I had to keep everyone at the base and be frugal for a day so the group could recover.\n\nThe bartering system is well thought out.  There is a traveling tradesman that will show up every few days with goods that can be exchanged for home made moon-shine, home grown vegies, looted and self-made meds and anything else you want to trade.  You can also take specific items with you on  "looting"  runs to trade with the military, other survivors and even bandits.  Each group seeks different items, and you are not likely to come home with a full backpack, but you will have exactly what you set out for, and some times that is more important.\n\nThere is also a winter that you must survive.  OMG was it intense.  Keeping enough fire wood burning to keep your characters healthy while still having enough to cook food and craft pushed me to the limit more than once.  I was taking an ax to furniture just to keep the fires going.  Brilliant!  The winter is not too long and comes on at a nice pace so that you have time to trade for or scavenge what is needed in time build a heater for your base. (hint: UPGRADE IT EMEDIATELY!)\n\nAnd lastly, the DLC for this game is heart warming to say the least.  It doesn't add much content to the game, but %100 of the proceeds goes to the War Child charity, and that's just groovy.  The dlc adds some wall-art to the in-game levels.\n\nNow... After so much praise, why did I rate this game down?!\n\nSmall spoilers ahead\n\nI WILL TELL YOU WHY!\n\nI worked my tail off keeping my crew alive!  I helped EVERYONE that asked of it.  I killed no one, and only stole when I was desperate, and even then I took only what I needed and never left anyone to die.  I brought in a character in need when he asked and he survived with the rest of us to the end....  THE END!\n\nThe war lasts 45 days max, some people don't like this, I don't mind it so much.  It can end some time before that, but its random.  If you have built a radio, it will keep you informed of whats going on.  INCLUDING THE WEATHER!\n\nDay 44 roles around.  I have mastered my team and have prevailed through dozens of bandit attacks, and winter included.  I have an outright stock pile of weapons, ammo, food, supplies, crafting tables, trade goods, and FIRE WOOD.  The forecast from the radio, which you will see in the screen shot, called for "warm days ahead."  Winter was about a week in the past at this point and there is only one winter in this damn game!\n\nI leave my base on the 44th night to do some light looting because I wanted to pass the time and grab some last minute stuff in the case that there is some end game fight or something.  I leave with  "WARM DAYS"  in the forecast and a thermostat that reads 20 Celsius.  That is hot for this game, it starts around 15 C.  I get back to -5 C and a team that has frozen to death........... What in the flying F**K is that crap?!?!\n\n*edit* Turns out this is a bug that the devs have not felt inclined to fix.  With this knowledge, I will keep the thumbs down rating.  The bug is heart breaking and a game changer that happens at the very end of the game.  I am not a programer, but this cannot be the toughest bug to fix.  The day this bug is remedied is the day I give this game a thumbs up\n\nThis is why I cannot rate this game up.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/screenshot/436072840510605697\n\nNote: day 39 calls for cool weather.  "Cool" weather shows up as predicted on days 40, 41, 42.  The temp goes down a bit during the day time, and I stoke the woodstove.\n\nNote: day 42 calls for warm weather, as well as day 45: it drops below freezing on night 44 after nothing but rising temperatures during the day and kills my team.","July 27, 2015","false","22.1"," 239 of 458 people (52%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","52","239","458","63","28"

This is a game where getting shot by a gun one or two times matter. A lot. Yea you can craft items like guns without a lot of materials or a lot which you actually need to craft a really gun, but hey, games can't be that realistic or it'll be so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult. This game also requires some what of a mutli task ability. One of your member might be straving and another might be sick. This is a difficult game, so i don't reccomend this game to 10 year olds. Probably 16 is old enough but what do i know about life? This game requires choice making too. Choices vary depending on how well your surviving. For example, your whole group is healthy and have a lot of medicine and medkits. However your running low on food. Should you trade someone your medkits for food? What if my shelter gets raided during the night and one or two members gets wounded? Another example is when your whole team is low on supplies. Would you go in an area which contains armed bandits but has tons of suppiles you need or would you go in an area with less supplies but less danger? Choices. The moral is this game takes skills to play, and definitely reccomend this game.

I am not opposed to difficult games; I played a lot of FTL: Faster Than Light, for example. But this game's difficulty is utterly ridiculous and it is locked in ironman mode, which means that making a single mistake will completely and irredeemably screw you over. And you WILL make plenty of mistakes, over and over again. Every time this happens, you will lose 4-8 hours of playtime.\n\nFor example, let's say you didn't make enough ammo to defend your shelter during the night. And let's say that during the limited time you had during the day cycle, you'd done everything else right - you'd made food, water and other things you needed, you got your characters rested up and healed, took meds, traded, etc., but you forgot that one crucial task of making ammo. Well, now raiders have come in the night and stolen all of your food (as raiders always take the most valuable items). Now you have to sit back and watch your characters starve to death, or perhaps you'll have to risk stealing from a military base or rebel camp in order to get what you need - and of course, these dangerous locations are filled with swarms of heavily armed enemies who have infinite ammo and perfect aim.\n\nOr perhaps you didn't collect quite enough materials to build a heater when winter came? Well, now your characters are going to get sick and freeze to death. Or perhaps you clicked the wrong button during a scavenge and caused your character to stop sneaking? Now your character is dead because they alerted a swarm of enemies. So many little things can go wrong, and each time they do, you're forced to watch your characters die - often slowly and painfully. In most cases, there is absolutely nothing you can do.\n\nTo make matters worse, the game is extremely bad at explaining itself. There is no tutorial of any kind. You are dropped into the game with no idea of how things work whatsoever, and this is a problem, because some of the game's mechanics don't make a lot of sense.\n\nI will use the example of the first time I really attempted combat. I wanted to raid a rebel camp, so I armed one of my characters with an AK-47 (the most powerful weapon in the game), and a knife, in case he ran out of ammo. I managed to sneak up on a rebel all alone, from behind. I figured that shooting an unarmored, unsuspecting target in the back with a burst of assault rifle fire would be an instant kill, but no. He stumbles a little bit, and then rushes at me with the force of a cheetah on steroids. I blast him again and he finally goes down. Now I'm lower on ammo than I'd like to be. Then I see a swarm of other rebels responding to the noise. I panic. I see a desk nearby that my character can apparently use as cover, and hide behind it. I think to myself, "Yeah baby! I've got a chance to win this fight after all!"\n\nNope. The rebels see me and fire with perfect accuracy, inflicting full damage. My character helplessly dies. Apparently the cover mechanic does absolutely nothing. I felt a bit puzzled as to why they included a cover mechanic at all if that's the case, but regardless, I strongly felt that they should've explained this to me at some point before I invested six hours into my savegame and ended up losing one of my most important characters.\n\nOther problems occur when you misjudge how NPC's will react to you. This won't be your fault, because the NPC's in this game do not act the way people should. Once, I sent Zlata into to the hospital area. When she was there, she tried to open a locker with a crowbar. The locker was not marked as a "stealable" object, but nevertheless the game treated her action as a crime, and there was a civilian nearby to witness it. So, I got Zlata out of there as fast as I could - I didn't even finish opening the locker - I hoped that the hospital staff would forget about it. Next time I visited, I sent another character, Katia, just to be safe. But apparently the guards knew - through telepathy, I guess - that Katia and Zlata both lived together, and so they treated Katia as though she was the one who had committed the crime. They blasted her to bits without hesitation or remorse. I was left scratching my head at this.\n\nFurther problems occur when you bump up against the game's confusing and arbitrary limits on craftable items. For example, I had two animal traps, and I figured that I'd make a third, as they were proving to be an excellent source of food. So, I sent out a scavenger to collect all of the materials necessary to build another one. When he got back, he couldn't craft it. Why? Apparently the limit for animal traps is "2". No reason given. It's just an arbitrary limit. I had plenty of space and enough materials to build it, but no, the game refuses to let you succeed in the way that you want to.\n\nAnother big problem is that everything is determined randomly, so circumstances completely outside of your control can screw you over. Certain areas of the city are sometimes blocked off due to "heavy fighting", and during the winter, certain areas of the city cannot be reached due to "heavy snow". And if every location you CAN reach has already been picked clean of resources, you have no choice but to watch your characters slowly starve/get sick/get depressed/die, or risk stealing and get killed, and probably flush yet another savegame down the toilet.\n\nThe reasons I WANT to recommend this game are simple: It has beautiful graphics, fluid animation, great music, an original premise, and makes excellent use of photography. Most of the time when you are scrabbling through ruins, racing against the clock and managing your resources, the game feels good. The parts of this game that work actually work beautifully. It is evident that a lot of love has gone into this game, and for these reasons, this game is deserving of respect. It attempts to be a simulation of what it's like to be a civilian living in wartime, and at this, it often succeeds.\n\nBut as a game (that is meant to entertain) it utterly fails. The only emotion you will feel as you play this game is frustration, and that isn't fun. The rough edges also leave something to be desired.\n\nGet it on sale if you're truly interested.","April 1, 2015","false","24.1"," 47 of 88 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","47","88","2","0"

The colour scheme and art style suits the game perfectly and the game feels polished in terms of how it looks. Trying to keep a group of survivors alive is a really tough experience and one mistake can set you back big time. There's always a challenge to get what you need, which makes moments where your people are starving and the only realiable source of food is stealing from other survivors genuinely interesting and makes you feel at least something. It's not a game that glorifies war, survival or death. It throws the grim reality of war in your face and tells you to survive in it. It totally nails that feeling.\nThe game isn't perfect, however. Firstly, stealth is king a lot of the time as you have to sneak into areas to get supplies. This sounds awesome, and it is as it's very intense. You will die very quickly if attacked, and you need each and every one of your people if you want to survive. Even being injured will have a big effect on your future, particularly without medical supplies. The trouble is that the game's AI can seem unfair at points. There have been several times where they have spotted me outside of their vision which completely ruined that night's raid. When the AI works, they will move around naturally and respond to doors being left open and to what their buddies are doing. Just a shame they don't always work.\nThe game doesn't really explain anything to you either, so you'll have to figure it out for yourself which will cause you to make a lot of mistakes early on.\nOverall, this game is a dark and engaging game that is both challenging and entertaining to play. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a game that keeps you entertained and always has a new goal for you to reach. Unlike most survival games, this one actually makes you feel something. I give them credit for that.","November 16, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This time, however, you do not play the role of soldiers or any other type of warriors taking part in the conflict, but you're controlling an often overlooked part of military conflict - the day to day life of civilians.\n\nThe game will give you a random selection from the survivor menu, some random starting items and some random scavenging locations and off you go. During the day, you manage your shelter (base-building), respond to random encounters when people visit your shelter and monitor the condition of your survivors. During the night, you go out to scavenge for supplies. You will have to scrounge the available locations for items necessary for your groups survival.\n\nMy second playthrough got me Zlata, a “consoler” that keeps the morale of the team up, Pavle the runner (again) and 2 old people (Anton, Cveta) with no skills whatsoever. It was an uphill battle, since the food&meds consumption was higher from the very beginning. Pavle or Zlata would go out scavenging, Anton and Cveta stayed and guarded the shelter.\n\nHunger started creeping in. Anton got wounded in the defence of our shelter. Zlata got sick. I sent Pavle to scavenge, but many locations were closed due to fighting and snow. I was only left with 1 choice – I went to a warehouse guarded by local thugs and I took what I needed by force. The team was not too happy about that, but hey, we got rid of some thugs, that’s O.K, right? Unforunately, after a while there were no more thugs left, and Pavle started stealing from other survivors. He ended up killing some other civilians in self-defence, when he was caught rummaging through other people’s stuff. That brought the morale of the group to an all-time low. But at least we have food and meds.\n\nIt’s day 40 and the radio tells me that peacekeepers are supposed to move in within the next two weeks.

The moral and ethical decisions one has to make in the game to survive the devastation of a civil war, it can be heart-clenching (or brutally amusing depending on what kind of "person" you are).\n\nShould you steal medicine for a terminally ill survivor from a defenseless elderly couple or conduct an honest trade at the the shelled hospital?\n\nShould you risk your survivor's life to save an unknown girl searching for food for her family from the wrath of a drunk (and armed!) soldier or leave them be and scavenge the area in relative safety?\n\nI often take the time to think through the acts that I make my survivors do, could I bring myself to do if I were stuck in a similar situation like them? This game inspires a deep level of thought from the smallest of actions.\n\nBe warned, there are not many hints throughout or a tutorial, much like in real life.","January 28, 2015","true","45.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This War of Mine is not simply Papers, Please thrust into a crafting/scavenging game. Instead, This War of Mine does a phenomenal job of conveying the desperate situation civilians find themselves when in the middle of a war zone.\n\nEvery scavenging decision feels like a gamble. Address short-term needs or long-term investments? Steal from the elderly? Kill? Managing and crafting in your home shelter a continuous process of managing losses. Do you use the wood for fuel to stave off the cold, or do you board up your walls to protect against bandits? Can we really spare the last of our meds on an old man who will probably die anyway? Combat is messy, often unexpected, and traumatizing.\n\nYou will not encounter very many fail-states in this game, as that would be contrary to the theme of desperate survival. What you will face is a slow march of ever worsening conditions, with the dim, almost non-existant hope, that a cease-fire will be signed to end all of soon and bring the game to 'victory'.\n\nIn the mean time; however, two of my survivors have died, the remaining two are depressed and are coming to blows, and I only have enough food for one of them today. Who do I feed?","November 17, 2014","true","18.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is not only the lack of food and medicine that could end your life, but there's always the constant threat of bandits who will take everything you've worked for away from you. And how did I work for my supplies? By murdering innocent people. I thought the threat was over when I stole food from an elderly couple, but the aftermath of that decision caused the character who commited the murders to leave, while the other survivors were depressed about the loss of one of their own.\n\nI don't know what caused the world to go to sh*t, but I do know that there are multiple threats to be aware of. Depression. Hunger. Violence. I didn't even survive long enough to experience the threat of (possible) betrayal. This is a truly accurate war simulator. I don't know if I /want/ to call it a game because I often associate that with having fun and with This War Of Mine, you won't have fun.\n\nBut this is an experience I'd definitely recommend, if you're up for it. Those who are susceptible to various triggers such as suicide might want to stay away from it.","December 28, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XK42/recommended/282070/","XK42","K42","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XK42/","231 products in account","Day 9 and all is going well for the four survivors. They've got some barricades up, they've got some building materials, weapons and decent items for trade but they're short on food. Night falls and one of them decides to investigate an apartment that they discovered the night before. He thinks his pistol and four bullets will get him past any hostility. They don't. Day 10 and the three remaining survivors are depressed as they discuss the loss of their companion. They get through the day and send another of their number out to scavenge for food. It's another house this time. When caught breaking in he lashes out with his crowbar and before he can grasp what's happening, a father and son lay dead at his feet. He's mortified, but he takes everything they have because he knows that their deaths are for nothing if he doesn't. On the way out, a shotgun blast from another family knocks him off his feet. He's dead. Day 11, and the two survivors left have not had a good night. There's been a bandit raid on their base. One survivor is badly wounded, the other has fallen sick. Their bandages and medicine were stolen in the raid. Both are now starving to death, because there's still no food.\n\nTWoM is a mixture of emotive story-telling and rage-inducing changes in good fortune. Surviving requires a good deal of patience and discipline (or luck). The mechanics are simple enough and the game does look and play beautifully. In places it's frustrating - you'll spend ages gathering supplies and you will find that minor mistakes in judgement can get you killed very quickly. Note that there's only one (auto) saved game permitted, and it's cloud based (if you have this enabled) which means no backing up before a risky raid. On the plus side there's bunch of different survivors that, as you probably expect, have different abilities. After playing with the default three for a bit you get the option to start with different combinations of the 8 or so available. Any of these may also turn up at your door seeking refuge during a given playthrough. Each attempt also randomly generates the locations you can visit and will have different "events" as the days roll on.\n\nTWoM won't be for everyone, but I'm definitely a fan.","December 31, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The setting and harsh reality of post fallout survival really help this game live up to any expectation you might of had. I went into the game with a small amount of hype and really was interested by the trailer, and the game lived up to be better than I thought it would be and in fact is easily in my top 3 Indie games this year.\n\nPROS:\nGreat Art Style and Animations\nTrue feeling or regret or shame for killing someone for supplies\nEvery play through is different, no two will be the same\nAll decisions will affect your survival\nCharacters are easy to fall in love with\nYour feels....all the feels\nSounds and gameplay are both spot on\nMoral choices really play a part\n\nCONS:\nALT-TAB is broken, and will crash the game\nSometimes I will get a slight stutter but it goes away after a min or two\nSmall glitches will happen\n\nREVIEW SCORE:\n9/10\nSo close to being perfect yet so far no game is perfect. Anyone that is wishing to have the true feeling of the weight of humanity on your shoulders and that every choice you make will impact someone’s life somehow, then play this.

The game is pretty simple, but not in a boring way.  Each playthrough starts in a semi-abandoned apartment building with a random set of characters (2-4) and short backstory about how they got to where they are.  After that, it's up to you to decide what to do with the group's supplies, and how to get more.  Obviously, you'll want to find more food, but building materials are important as well; They keep your people supplied with tools and utilities.\n\nEach day you'll perform certain tasks to keep the homestead and your people going. Each night you'll  select a location on the map to send one of your characters to search for supplies, while the other characters sleep or guard the base.  Scavenging can become a game of stealth, while you ransack abandoned buildings or steal from your neighbors.  However, you can and will probably want to aquire firearms at some point.\n\nThe atmosphere is superb, though It can be depressing at times if you think about it too long.  In my case, certain characters reminded me of people I know.\n\nThe message conveyed to the player is not necessarily or exclusively anti-war, but one that illustrates the effects any conflict might have on the immediate populace.  To me, it illustrates how easily all options for survival can be quickly placed on the table when society ceases to function, even in times without war.","November 16, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It really lets you take a look at the effects of war of the citizens of a city. This game puts you into a disaster zone in a city with a group of people, these people become your only hope of survival. First time through I attempted to play as if I was in the game. I didn't risk to much, preferring to be alive and grateful but it was hard at the beginning. Half way through just before the harsh winter began, I realised I needed to start being ruthless, I stole from the hospital without caring for the ill and sick, I snuck into an elderly couples house and begun looting their food and medicine, as I was leaving their son caught me... I sliced him open with my knife.... It was dark.. The first kill... What made it worse was the father came storming in and attempted to kill me... I did the same to him as I did to his son... I left the mother crying in her room... I thought to myself I should have killed her and ended her misery but I couldn't... wierd as I just so easily killed her husband and son... I slipped out the back door into the dark, rainy night hoping to never come back to this house again... My atrosities didn't end there but continued throughout the gameplay, taking advantage of the weak becoming stronger but much darker.\n\nOverall this game rocks! So many different scenarios can occur and it all depends on your play style, whether you be the nice, friendly citizen or the dark, murderous bandit, it all comes down to YOU!\n\nGRAPHICS\nI like the 2D side scrolling style to the game. The added LoS system means the danger that lies in the next room is unknown until the last minute. The dark nature of the graphics really adds the effect the designers were going after.\n\nSOUND\nThe music and general sounds really add to the game. The shots of the sniper as you run through an open park, the crying of an old lady as you leave her house, the rain landing on rooms in the night, each sounds adds to the feeling of the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay is unique and really suits the game. The game is a typical click to move style but with the addition of the other components the gameplay doesn't seem like a simple clicker.\n\nRATING\n8/10\nI recommend buying the game if you have $20 spare.","February 2, 2015","true","15.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crispycrust/recommended/282070/","crispycrust","Bread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crispycrust/","132 products in account","Brief Description of Gameplay\nThis War of Mine is a game in which your goal is to manage a group of civilians in their attempt to survive while trapped inside a city near a warzone.\n\nThe game is 3D but characters move around on a 2D axis.\n\nThis War of Mine is played primarily using the mouse.  You click to select which character you want to control and simply left click the location you want your character to move to.\n\nButtons appear on objects in the environment when you can interact with them.  Typical actions include things like searching, hiding, climbing, lockpicking or prying things open and so on.\n\nWeapons can be selected using the mouse as well.  While a weapon is drawn, contextual buttons will appear in the environment allowing you to take cover behind walls and tables and other things.\n\nYou play one day at a time.\n\nThere's a day phase where your civilians are in their shelter and your task is to take care of their needs and build things.\n\nAt night you can choose to select one of your civilians to go scavenge.\n\nResource management is a big focus in this game.\nAcquire materials / food / weapons through whatever means you can.  Barter, loot, scavenge, steal, take by force.  Aid other people, take from them or even murder them.  The game does little to restrict your actions, but be prepared to face big consequences depending on what you do.....\n\nPros Uses several forms of procedural generation to give each playthrough different challenges to deal with.\nThe number of areas accessible for scavenging and the time frame in which they are accessible is always changing.\nThe layout and contents of those areas is constantly changing.\nThe game surprises you with all kinds of sudden and difficult scenarios where you have to make decisions that carry big consequences.\nCare is put into crafting some interesting and diverse backgrounds for the civilians you can play with.\nYour civilians aren't cold or emotionless.  If you do something they don't like, it'll affect their mood/morale.\nMaintains a dreary atmosphere that fits well with the setting.\nExplores war from an infrequently used perspective, which makes the game feel unique.\nNice artistic style.\nCons This game can be intensely time consuming.\nDepending on what's happening and where you choose to go at night, the pace of the game can be very slow.  This fits the idea of being focused on survival in a warzone though so it's kind of appropriate.\nCombat, danger and death can be sudden and hectic.  Once again though, this actually kind of serves the game's purpose well.\nSometimes, playing through the daytime portions can feel a bit dull and repetitive as you'll simply be eating / bandaging / sleeping and so on.  I do have to admit that this is probably a good picture of what it'd actually be like for survivors though.\nIf you're bored, have plenty of time to spare and don't mind the slightly sluggish pacing,  I definitely recommend this game.","May 6, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulsojourner/recommended/282070/","soulsojourner","Soul Sojourner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulsojourner/","108 products in account","Introduction:For anybody considering getting this game... this is a hidden gem.\n\nThis War of Mine focuses on what other war games simply do not. The lives of regular people who are affected by the war, civilians. The thing to think about is, what would -you- do if war broke out around you, and you had to struggle to survive? Would you be willing to turn your back on neighbors and friends? Would you risk your own health and safety by sharing supplies with strangers, or leaving your shelter to help others?\n\nThis War of Mine takes on a more personal tone in regards to player experience. If you've ever read any first person war documentaries, this feels like you're playing one. You read the bio entries of your sheltered civilians, and empathize with them and their struggles every step of the way. Survival is really only half of the game, personal comfort and distractions is the other half.\nThis is one of those games that I figured, even if I like it, it won't take long to beat and I won't put a lot of hours into it, but I was wrong. I am over 60 hours right now and still playing it, and the only part of the game I even considered remotely boring was doing a solo Marko run and "playing the squirrel." The Anton and Cveta scenario was just downright frustrating, but I imagine that two older people trying to survive with only eachother in the middle of a war would probably have a hard time making it.\n\nPros:+Varied morality based on each citizen's life/lifestyle.\n\n+Scavenging and combat system is well rounded and not entirely unrealistic.\n\n+Excellent crafting system that compliments the games trading system.\n\n+The survival aspect of the game forces you to manage resources and prioritize crafting.\n\n+Addictions require you to consider an added level of comfort for those who have them, as well as an additional way to cope.\n\n+Excellent personal stories and biographies give you an emotional connection to the civilians in your charge.\n\n+Random events that add flavor to the everyday struggle in your shelter.\n\n+Artistic style and game atmosphere.\n\n+Varied survivor personalities and skills.\n\n+Survivors with skills that are useful in real-life, but not-so-useful during a war, gives perspective to how war affects everyone.\n\n+Alcohol can be used to help sad people feel better, but also as a trading item.\n\n"Everyone should choose one happy memory. And it can't just be good, it has to be grand. When it gets so bad you just want to sit down and cry, when you life seems forfeit, you close your eyes and go back to your happy moment. It's not easy but you have to try." -The Survivor Marko\nCons:-A few minor bugs, most pertaining to the morality system. (Example: Citizens getting sad from "stealing" in a location where there used to be armed thugs. Everyone there is dead, it's not technically stealing anymore, and even if it was, it was from bad guys that one of your civilians already killed. (and were happy about it)\n\n-Some aspects of the game are particularly easy to exploit. (Examples: You can change the random event of that day, or someone getting sick, or a few other aspects, just by leaving the game and restarting that day. Another example is that you can prevent resources from being stolen during a raid by starting a building project, and then canceling the project the next day to get your resources back.)\n\n-Sometimes during the day you wish you could speed it up a bit while waiting for your civilians to dig through rubble or catch up on sleep, but you can only "end day" which is often more time than you wish to skip. A speed-up/slow-down feature would be nice. Also a "pause" feature that allows you to issue commands to your people at once, without having to try to flip between them as quickly as possible.\n\n-It gets fairly repetitive after a few games, luckily there is an alternative shelter you can play in that helps to combat the repitition a little.\n\n-Could definitely use more survivor options, base options, and customization of both of these things in both the regular game, as well as creating your own story.\n\n-Could do with much more crafting possibilities and game items. Even the couch that you can sit on in some scavenging areas but can't craft for your own shelter is a good example.\n\n-Depending on the length of the game, the construction space of your shelter can be very limited.\n\n-Something like a craftable safe to keep select items more secure during raids would be a helpful concept.\n\nUPDATE: -I almost forgot the most annoying con. "Alt+Tab" or basically any minimizing from full-screen mode will crash the game. The only "fix" I have found for this, is to switch to Windowed mode at the title screen, and then switch back to full-screen. For some reason, "Alt+Tab" works after that!\n\n"I've been running into either unsufferable rubes or outright criminals. But I feel that you're different. And for a scientist with an established position like me, the company of people of comparable mental capacity is paramount. Besides.. ah, bloody hell, I can't stand faking it anymore! I'm just an old fart who knows nothing. I'm so grateful for your company. I've been out there alone for too long. Way too long." -The Survivor Anton\nThe Good and Bad:+/-Save Intervals. It would be nice if it saved it at the start of every night, as well as every day, but it also forces you to re-do an entire day, if you decide to exit out of the game when something goes wrong at night.\n+/-The rainwater collector can be placed pretty much anywhere. It doesn't make sense to place it anywhere.\n\n"I used to be an optimist - one of those people who'd have sworn that war wouldn't come. Wars happened far away, in third-world countries. Or so I thought. Even when I was listening to the news getting scarier day by day, I did not believe all that was about to happen." -The Survivor Bruno\nRECOMMEDED?Without a doubt. Even if this game costed twice as much, knowing what I do from having played it, I would buy it.","October 20, 2015","true","86.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You are faced with living off food scraps and low supplies of water to survive while trying to maintain your own health and sanity. Do you screw others over so you have a better chance of surviving? Or do you help those in the community but by detrimenting your own life? Without spoiling the game for you, you're faced with some very difficult decisions.\n\nAs a side-scrolling indie thriller and with the specific tone the game sends out, this game won't be for everyone.

Ive actually made a personal study of stuff like the wars in georgia and serbia and this game does a great job with the atmosphere of dread one could expect from living through that.\n\nBut this game also takes it a step further and proves why games are an awesome medium for serious art, in any other medium if the story ended with everyone dying of either murder or starvation your reaction would probably be "Oh, I guess it was intended to be a downer story."\n\nBut here, where survival is in your hands and your control your reaction to every setback is very visceral. You're cursing the cold, you hate those thugs and want to get back at them and youre just in a daze about eight hours in wondering how much longer could this war possibly go on, its gotta be almost over right? The feeling of helplessness as a player really does a lot to help it sink into you just how terrible these conditions would be to live through.\n\n"Everyone should choose one happy memory.

It clearly deserves a perfect and non-ironic 10/10.\n\nFinal reviewIntroduction:\nI bought this game almost a year ago (2nd January 2015), and I first played it back then and, because I failed my first playthrough, forgot about the game for a while after making a first review which was this summary of my first experience with it. I decided that for this winter holiday 2015 that I'd give it a second shot, and I managed to survive ! With my brand new eyes, I decided to make a full review of this awesome game that is This War of Mine.\n\nStoryline:\nYou are a group of survivors during a fictionnal civil war that tries to survive and get through it. During the day, you are in your shelter, and you can build a lot of useful stuff like beds, furnace, radio, weapons etc. There are some random events where for example a trader will com to your place and you can trade your items for some other supplies. During the night, you visit (not so) deserted places to try and find some more supplies, such as material, woods, weapon parts, food, medicine etc. In this time, your shelter can get attacked, so you'd better keep someone away in your home, if you don't want to get robbed or killed in your own home (note that you don't control anything, it's done automatically).\n\nStrenght of the game:\nThis game has a lot of strong aspect that I'm going to discuss here.\n1. The graphics are really appealing to me. I loved the pencil-like texture applied to the whole game. It's dark, but it puts you in this civil war athmosphere.\n2. Another aspect of the game design that I liked a lot is the characters you control, because they really feel like civilians, and you can relate and connect to them. It's done through their bio and their reactions, that feel really human and plausible.\n3. While I'm at the reactions of you characters, this is what make the game really sad and heartbreaking. Your characters will regret killing and robbing people, as much as they'll regret when one of them dies or is sick. You feel the need to help and protect them, and this type of reaction is something that really breaks your heart.\n4. In addition to the character's reactions, the music is another aspect that is well done. It's melancholic, it's accoustic, it's perfect for this game.\n5. Let's talk about the gameplay. It's a point and click game, you play it entirely with your mouse. You have a lot of actions to chose from for every situation, the mechanics are well-crafted and pretty strong for this game.\n6. Other things such as the radio programms or the places you can go at night add to the immersion, as they are realistic for a civil war.\n7. My final positive point for this game is the DLCs and the game in itself: every benefits made from this game go to charity for War Child, an association that helps kids around the world where they face war on a daily basis, providing food, supplies, schools and much more to them. Just for that aspect, I even bought it in a shop where I found a physical version of the game. I may have paid twice this game and chosen to pay the DLC 20 bucks, but I regret nothing, as I know it's for a good cause. I think more charity groups should do games like this: they are great games and a great way to donate to charity, a way where everyone wins something.\n\nWeakness of the game:\nThe question here would be "has this game any weakness at all?" because it's a strong game in every aspect you could imagine. Well the only negative point I would make is the fact it's not that kind of game you can play anytime you want just for fun. It's not a funny game, but is the subject a fun one? No not really, so it's understandable that it may be a depressing game. That's why I don't play it often, because it's sad and tragic.\n\nConclusion:\nAll in all, this game deserves to be purchased a hundred times. It's a well-crafted survival point and click game with a really deep and sad athmosphere where you can relate to your characters. It's sad, it's well-done, and it's for charity, so I don't see any reasons of why you shouldn't buy this game.\n\nVerdict\nIn a whole, the game is almost perfect, it may have this flaw where you don't play it often, but otherwise it's one of the best game I've ever played. It's an intriguing and tragic experience that everyone should try at least once in their lives. For me, it's a strong and non-ironic 10 out of 10.","January 3, 2015","true","18.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

A neighbour needed our help to barricade her home: we did it. Another neighbour asked us to guard her family for two nights: we did it. Everything was so good at our house that I thought "what could go wrong? we have food, medical supplies and enough stuff for everyone" and that's where Emilia, a lawyer, comes to our house and join our group. Some stuff went rough on our guys and I decided to send her to the church so she could bring us some stuff like materials and more food, but the priest wasn't as good as I've expected, he didn't think twice before killing Emilia with his mate using a knife, she was there unarmed and wasn't robbing anything. People at my house got so sad and depressed that we couldn't do anything about it, so that's when I come with the idea: why don't we avenge Emilia and go to Church again, but this time we kill everyone in there? WRONG DECISION. Got inside there with Pavle holding a knife and assassinated the priest in cold blood, when his guard showed up I murdered him too and all the women inside there, in resume, I've killed everyone inside the church to avenge one of our crew. Coming home I thought people would be at least a bit happy to see that Emilia's death was avenged, but I was terribly wrong, Pavle got so depressed that he couldn't do anything, Katia was broken too and we needed Bruno to do everything.  For days we weren't able to go out and scavenge and people just kept raiding us, getting all our food and medical supplies. Some days after, Pavle was murdered by thugs in our own house, Bruno left us to follow his friend and got killed, Katia was left alone at home and starved to death.\n\nIn resume: it's a game where you really need to think and be a good strategist to survive, it makes you feel how the characters feels and I'm sure that everybody who plays it are going to enjoy this awesome game.\n\nps: If you buy the game, make sure you buy the DLC too, it's not expensive and the money is going to charity to help children who were victims of war. It's for a good cause.","April 4, 2015","true","12.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I relish being the 'bad guy' in a lot of games, often opting for the 'easy choice' of choosing the mentality of 'the needs of one, outweighs the needs of the many'. I wanted a new challenge and perhaps something that could change my 'evil persona' in games... and boy, do I get a challenge with this game.\n\nThis War of Mine is in a word; Brilliant. It's art style is very monochromatic, dark and pencil drawn, something which compliments the game's overall feel and direction. The musical score works really well with certain types of situations and often helps set the mood of a wore torn country that had clearly seen better days.\n\nBut for me, while all of the details are important in the art style and music, the real impact this game has had on me is it's core mechanic; it's game play.\n\nToo often in modern games, players are not confronted with tough choices. When there are choices in games, they are often very clean and cut (do this and this will happen, don't and it won't - etc). I feel that because of this, players are not given the true consequences of their actions in games therefore making it much easier for players to turn 'bad' and reap the rewards. For me this is often why I went rogue. In This War of Mine, I simply cannot do it and when I have to, I feel terrible about it.\n\nTaking charge of a group of three survivors in a worn torn city who have shacked up in a abandoned building, the player is immediately confronted with a wide selection of problems right from the offset. One of your group may be sick, hungry, sad or simply tired and it is up to you to provide the fulfillment of their most basic needs in order to keep them alive. Sure, you can scavenge for stuff in your own dwelling but the resources found there will only get you so far so you must find additional materials/food from other areas around the city. Venturing into the city gives you no promises and it thrusts you into situations that make you question your morality. An example can be that you have a sick friend back at your shelter and you have gone into a home that you know has an elderly couple inside, one of which is very ill. Do you take their medical supplies to save your friend and risk destroying the morale of your group (because you stole from people who truly needed the supplies), or do you leave them be and potentially lose your party member, which in turn could create the same amount of dismay within the group? Other examples can simply come from making a bad call, i.e. getting your scavenger into situations that they went prepared for and killed, not returning back to the safety of your 'home' in time before the sun came up, or choosing to take additional survivors into the group whom of which you couldn't really provide enough resources to cover their basic needs.\n\nBecause of the choices that you have to make and the knock-on results that they can bring, you pay the consequences or enjoy the rewards of your choices. Personally, it's refreshing to play a game that questions morality and adequately changes the gaming dynamic because of these calls.\n\nThis War of Mine gave me that new challenge in the choices that I make in games. I no longer wish to be the bad guy and when I do it in this game, it's not without reason.\n\nI really recommend this game to players of fifteen years older or more.","February 7","true","7.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bortington/recommended/282070/","bortington","Bort","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bortington/","86 products in account","If you are looking for something a bit different, that doesn't just reward you with another shiny pixel for shooting some other player in the head, or if you are bored with the regular offerings, then this may just be the game for you.\n\nIt takes place in a warzone city, based on the conflicts in Eastern Europe. The aim of the game is simple. Survive until reinforcements come and lift the siege. Actually doing it though, is far harder.\n\nYou start off with 3 or 4 people, and most of a house that seems to be out of the way of the shelling. You need to keep your people well, warm, fed, watered, and happy, or at least, content. Each night, you can send out one person to do some looting in another location. That location may be populated, or abandoned. There may be people trying to live there, or looking for trading partners. Or, there could be soldiers who will probably try to kill you.\n\nAs the game progresses, and you bring more loot home, you can start crafting - beds, heaters, cookers are pretty essential, but then you also have things like water collectors and rat traps to provide food and water, a radio so you can listen in on the news, and find out what is coming to the city, or even something that lets you grow tobacco or medicinal herbs.\n\nOf course, if you acquire too much stuff, and not enough weapons, chances are someone will try to raid you at night, stealing whatever they can, and injuring (or worse) one of your survivors.\n\nIf you are looking for a happy, friendly game, this is not it. If you are looking at a harsh look at the realities of war from a non-combatant's view, then this is the game you are looking for. Or, if you are looking for something a bit more challenging than usual, this will provide exactly that, while still being fun.","June 12, 2015","true","21.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Next to Spec Ops: The Line, P.T., Metal Gear Solid 3 and Portal, welcome to the club, This War of Mine.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKatia's Dairy\n\nDay 1:\nI began my dairy. We cleaned out the house and put together a rota. Pavle was an ex-footballer and he felt he was the most fit to go and scavenge. Bruno was a bit ill, so after he made food, he had to rest. I decided to stay up and write this dairy. Once the war is over, I'll sell it and be rich. We built a bed and rebuilt a cooker, and Bruno is sleeping. I am standing guard, listening to the sounds of the artillery in the distance.\nPavle returned later, carrying a lot of wood, food and random, useful looking crap. I wasn't particularly impressed.\n\nDay 2:\nSo I spent most of the day asleep on the bed. Bruno was better and made food, and Pavle began to patch up the holes in the building. Again, I am standing guard. Things are going well.\n\nDay 10:\nWe were raided. While Pavle was out and I was asleep, men snuck into our house, stole our food and medicine, and now Bruno is hurt. We patched him up as best we could, and let him have the bed. We built another one for Pavle.\nPavle began to discuss us getting weapons, but I argued against it. We just need to fix up this house and stay on guard at night, and sleep during the day. The house was coming together, and we began to make some cigarettes for Bruno and we found myself some coffee. The music on the radio helps to block the noise of the war... block the silence...\n\nDay 11:\nOur neighbours came to the door. I wanted to hide but Bruno just answered (but he is over 6ft tall, so I can't imagine him too scared) and asked what they wanted. They gave us food, and he left to help them fix up their house like we did for ours. Pavle cooked that day.\nPavle was forbidden to cook again. We don't have enough food to waste.\n\nDay 13:\nPavle didn't come back from Sniper's Junction. They say the military aims for civilians now.\n\nDay 14:\nI went to the military base with some moonshine Pavle had been making in the basement. I stood in that flashlights glare, and I hoped to God they wouldn't kill me. They took most of our food, and our alcohol, and some cigarettes, but I walked away with an AK47 and some bullets. We will never be victims again.\nBruno saw it and looked away, but understood the necessity. He keeps trying to give me pep-talks, but all I want is some time to myself. We sleep during the day. He will be on guard tomorrow, he'd better get to like the gun.\n\nDay 17:\nA schoolteacher came to us today, asking to stay. Honestly, in the sadness of Pavle, we accepted. We needed the extra hands, and we had the food (we'd set up some cages in the basement to catch... I don't want to know, and I don't ask Bruno what it is) to feed her... And a spare bed from Pavle. She immediately began to help with the water. I began to go out at nights. Bruno was a big guy, but nowadays, big simply means a bigger target.\n\nDay 19:\nI began to get a collection of contacts with whom I could bargain. We didn't ask names and we didn't need to. I found a talent for bargaining, and we began to more precisely fix up our house. I also began to look around these houses, and take whatever junk was around. They wouldn't need it.\n\nDay 20:\nI came back from bargaining to find that Cveta was bleeding heavily, and that we had been raided. Bruno managed to protect our food, but they simply went for the vulnerable middle-aged women. We fed her, and began to make her rest. A part of me hated her for the burden we now faced, and quietly wished she may die in the night. I once sat in her room and wept for my lost humanity. She stroked my hair. I vowed I would rob a hospital to save her.\n\nDay 22:\nCveta was beginning to circle the drain, and even her upbeat talks were becoming weak. Me and Bruno faced losing the heart of our morale and another member in less than two weeks. Another teacher, hearing of her plight, came to stay with us. I quickly greeted him (Anton, apparently), and then left the house. I knew what I had to do for her.\nThe hospital has been completely destroyed. I walked in, offering to help find medicine. And I found it in the office of the doctor. Bandages and medicine, enough to save Cveta. But if I take them, patients will die.\n\nDay 23:\nI bandaged Cveta. Today was quiet. No one wanted to ask where I found such clean materials. Everyone already knew. Bruno gave me a respectful nod and a warm meal. The teachers didn't even look at me.\n\nDay 25:\nI found more bandages. The husband asked me not to take them. I had a shovel in my hand but didn't need to use it. I didn't meet his wife's eyes as I took them out of her bedroom and walked out of the house. Cveta is healing, but will not even look at me.\n\nDay 27:\nI do not deserve to live.\n\nDay 33:\nBruno had carried me to bed at some point, and fed me. Cveta would sit in silence with me. Anton left books at my bedside table, and cups of coffee. I do not deserve them.\n\nDay 34:\nI am a burden.\n\nDay 36:\nI decided to help them again. If I can steal from the helpless, I can steal from anyone. I began to steal from a couple as they spoke with their son, while I walked in their basement taking their food.\nI would walk into their house, take their medicine and food, and then trade it back, sympathetically offering them a better deal to help with the constant thievery they suffered.\nThe group didn't know; they didn't need to know. Morale didn't suffer. After the couple, no one care. I stole a guitar from someone's basement, and Anton fixed it up. Only I can play it though. I give little performances for the group. We are... for a while, happy.\n\nDay 38:\nWinter has come. Anton built another heater. This house is now too hot, because Cveta is constantly cold. Bruno uses snow to make water, because everything has frozen. Cigarettes and alcohol have become rare, yet we continue to produce them. Bruno is fine with a few per day, the rest we trade for food and medicine, everything else we find or steal. And by we, I mean me. The teachers are too kind and Bruno is... well, he's a big lad.\n\nDay 41:\nThe militia have asked me if my neighbours have been stealing. As they have been constantly giving us food, probably. However, they have saved us a few times, and Anton had stayed with them while the husband was sick and bandits were circling. Bruno wanted the reward, but I denied it. I then informed Bruno to keep in line and make me some food.\n\nDay 45:\nThe war has ended. The teachers thanked us. Bruno went to find his friend. I am sitting here, playing this guitar and writing this book. I wonder if the owner of the house will come and find me? Find my dairy? My story?","December 22, 2014","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

What makes this game so great aren't it's features, which are decent and fun, but the stories that happen without any prescripted storyline. It is your decision to kill/rob/help people and there are severe consequences, no matter what your decision will be.\nApart from that it is a solid and fun survival experience that involves a lot of ressource management and strategy as well as sneaky stealthmissions and scavenging runs during the night. You will have to deal with hunger, sickness and the cold of winter and if you decide to fight someone, your wounds will take days and sometimes valueable bandages to heal.

All three of us were digging through piles of dirt to get to cupboards hoping to find some wood.  Seemed ok so far at best.\n\n10 minutes later, by day three, I knew what everyone was talking about.  I was worried, where will we find food?  My little band of three was hungry, tired and sore from sleeping on the floor.  In two quick game days this amazing game made me care about my little band of three to the point that I knew, tonight I'd do anything to find us some food.\n\nOr so I thought.  Night time scavenging Pavlo and I chanced upon an elderly couple in a little cottage.  The old woman sick, barely hanging on, but enough food there to last us a while.  Pavlo started grabbing whatever he could, I knew with this haul we'd make it a few more days.  Until the old man spotted us and started following us around... begging, pleading, asking us why?\n\nI can only be grateful this game has no voiceover for the people you encounter at night-time...  His pleas was so heart wrenching, I ended up trying my best not to read what he was saying, but what I had read was enough, everytime another speech bubble came up I dreaded what he was saying and couldnt help but to look.  It all made me feel like the worthless, soulless thief I was, stealing from an old man and his sick wife.\n\nMe and Pavlo got out of there...  neither of us could take it anymore.  Pavlo is depressed, I feel terrible...\n\nTwo days later Pavlo had to kill a couple a couple that attacked him after he stole their rat meat.  He is broken, won't move.  I had to end the game right there, I was feeling just like Pavlo.\n\nI took a few minutes to think how we could do better before starting another game.  How we could survive without doing these atrocious, horrible things to others...  Games have gotten under my skin before, but never quite like this.\n\nThis game gets a 10/10 from me.  It will pull you in, make you FEEL the emotions your little party are experiencing... And after you have shut it down, it will stay with you, make you wonder about every bad thing you had to do.  Was there no other way?  What did we do?  Those people would surely starve, die for lack of medicine?\n\nGames don't get to you?  Try this one on for size.\n\nWe are on day 21 now... the crime spree has died down, we've managed to survive this long without doing too much harm to others... But food is scarce, we're hungry, we all know we'll have to do... something.... soon.    And I am dreading it.","December 25, 2015","true","36.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Each day plays out in two phases. The clean split between day and night creates the steady metronome that keeps you pushing through This War of Mine. You're tasked with feeding survivors, ensuring they get a good night's rest and looking out for their physical as well as mental health.\nSystems This War of Mine's are designed to push you towards moral quandaries, where you're trapped by basic human needs, and shown how they can so easily corrupt otherwise upstanding people.\nLike a grim version of The Sims, players click around to move characters and on icons to assign tasks such as making food, building, clearing rubble, rifling through resource points or administering aid—either medicinal or moral. All of this is reliant on having the appropriate resources, which are gathered at night when a character can be sent to scavenge while the others sleep or stand guard. Locations include abandoned squallers, schools, hospitals, churches and more. Areas with more valuable resources are either inhabited or defended, while the safer places yield less.\nEverything outside line of sight is enveloped in a fog, giving the exploration real tension. Walking is silent but slow, while running comes at the risk of making noise, denoted by emanating circles of sound. Enemies emit these same tells, as do rats scurrying around. NPCs that hear the sounds or spot you in their line of sight will investigate, The defenseless cower, some propose a barter, others respond with deadly force. The slow, deliberate pacing accentuates the languishing, oppressive atmosphere.\n\nThis War of Mine is one the most thematically interesting games.","August 8, 2015","true","20.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But this darkness also allows the simple victories to shine bright, and I found myself greatful for the ability to keep my people fed, warm and safe even for one night.

It combines an old gameplay style with modern graphics, a basic yet great resource system, and compelling characters who each can benefit in their own way. Sometimes I find it difficult to pry myself away from it. Each minute is a pressuring moment- wether it be sneaking within a military outpost to steal supplies or risk a few of my canned food for a complete stranger attempting to survive just like us. However, I would find it incredibly intriguing to include a child or two which can join your band of survivors. I know this may be alot to ask for, considering all the people who would probably get all 'Mothery' about it, but I would think most of my plathroughs would have made it farther with a child. For instance, children are extremely small and can be more productive then adults and may heighten morale due to their 'bubbley' personality. Not all children are like that, but still. Perhaps the child could beg for food? It could open up so many more doors if children were included.","November 24, 2014","true","66.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

This War of Mine shows you the horrors of war through the eyes of a group of civilians. Taking quite an influence from the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War, you are put into a city under siege and forced to survive. Though the gameplay is nothing special, what truly shines about This War of Mine is the message behind it. Survival is tough in this city, and you must do whatever you can to survive. This leads to you quite often making terrible choices to survive, such as  robbing a hospital or a church just trying to help innocent people like you survive  and  stealing from an elderly couple, and if you come back to where the couple was, you find out that they have starved to death because of you.  Ultimately, This War of Mine is more of a work of art than a game. It excels at showing you the savagery of war through the ones most affected by it, but the raw gameplay is honestly not the most fun or enjoyable, at least during the daytime. At night, however, comes the real fun of the game. You must send one of your playable characters to a location in the world to scavenge for food, medicine, and anything else that your group needs to survive. If you're a roleplayer, you'll be delighted to know about the character creator where you can upload a picture and create a description for your own custom character. But if you want to stick to the base game, it can get a little boring. There isn't much replay value, and once you've seen a location you've seen it all. If you're looking for a  gritty Call of Duty style shooter, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a fascinating tale of how life under siege affects innocent civilians, this is for you. I don't believe that the current price tag is worth it for such a short experience, but if you can get the game on sale, it's definitely worth it.","June 2","true","30.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You may be thinking I don't care anout other survivors... Thats what I thought but you know, they don't all get angry and pull out machine guns and spray you down.

Then he told her to wait inside and he just went to check outside, I took my chance to finish her off and it made me feel kind off like laughing (hope I'm not a physco) but also sad because before she died she whispered 'please no.'

Murder+Moonshine or Diplomacy+hunger? ;)\n- Great replay value! I was suspect of this at first, but it is very impressive how much the world can be altered and the way the player survives by various difficulty settings.\n- Excellent sound design on all fronts, the guns hit hard and the music is more than fitting.\n- Excellent visual design--It's highly stylized. Beautiful range of color and tone, very high contrast, gritty and grim.\n- The combat system is great, I absolutely love the "cover" system and heavy bias towards stealth combat.

You play as a group of civilians held up in a run down old house in the middle of a war zone (civil war to be exact). How will you survive? Go out at night and find those must needed meds, or food. Trade with others barely holding on? or will you just take what you want.\n\nThis game will have you choosing between letting your people die or gunning down that kid and his elderly parents for a couple of cans of food and maybe, a bottle of meds. All the while praying your base doesn't get raided and those people you are now murdering a small family for, are not killed.\n\nFor those that don't like to look at the meaning behind their actions (in a video game) or the story you'd best not get this. Everyone else will see this game for what it is, a hard, soul-crushingly depressing, remorseless look at the horrors of war that'll have you playing just to see your guys though this hell hole until a cease fire is finally announced (picked at random).\n\nThose that are sensitive to emotionally taxing experiences may want to also avoid this game, at times you may be given the choice to help that woman being dragged off by an armed soldier, that main lying in the middle of the path with a sniper edging closer, and closer to you, or if killing that elderly couple is worth saving three lives.\n\nWhile this game is a side scroller it more then makes up for it in the meaning behind every action you take, and the consequences. If I had to give it a score? 9/10 and it only loses 1 because I had to kill a kid with my rifle to stop my group from starving. :(","January 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Doing a backstab will take enemies to 20% health but due to how random it is, they can still kill or wound you in which case press alt + F4 and restart the day/night.\n\nSurvivors are emotional timebombs waiting to go off the second you steal or kill someone however these is currently a glitch where returning to a dead thug's location after dealing with them(which is good karma) to loot the place may count as "stealing from innocent" even though that should not be the case. Doing more bad deeds will result in the surviors killing themself if you cannot keep them happy with various supplies(coffee, booze and cigarettes).\n\nIn alot of cases looking up a location on the wiki before going there will save your life, in a sense... though you will get punished if you dont (with no knowlage of the place).\n\nEach surivor has a specific trait which will help you..... however in some cases they can be very useless or critical to you. An example of this is Roman who is trained in combat and can instantly take down someone from a backstab and pretty much kill one shot with a shotgun which makes him one of the best survivors. A good example of a bad one is Anton who has the trait "Good Mathematician" which does nothing. However each survivor you get is random over the campain but you can quit the game and press continue to get a diffrent survivor when one does arrive.","August 11, 2015","true","36.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I honestly don't know from where to start. The game provides you a glimpse of how people in real-world, when faced with War & brutality at its worst, survive. You live and breathe with these people everyday. Making preparations, saving resources that could enable you to survive another day. However, you're forced to scavenge for supplies, and that's where the real hard part comes in. You're forced to steal from people who really need it. People like the elderly couple, the sick people in the hospital, a son looking after his old parents, a wounded man trying to find his way back home to his infant boy. All these things, pull at your heart strings in ways I've never experienced in any game before. Perhaps, it would make people understand that the situation in Syria, the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War II, is something that shouldn't have happened in the first place.

And for once everybody was absolutely right!!\nIt is totally absorbing in a way that's as entertaining as it is depressing.  Slowly you become more and more involved with the war victims in the game and although it is as desperate as it probably is in real life every little victory is immensely satisfying. I never managed to play beyond day 30 yet but somehow I keep restarting and giving it another try.\nAlthough the setting is much more harsh the game reminds me of Expedition Conquistadores at times. (making your choices of where to scavenge at night and doing all the necessary chores in daytime. Also the  involvement with your characters) This is one hell of a game and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge in a somber but realisttic setting. There's a lot of choices but no fast paced action, but it's probably more intense than all the Call of Duty's put together.","June 15, 2015","true","31.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

[deaf]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NG-Allison/","276 products in account","Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing\nOverall Rating: 6/10\nGameplay Rating: 6/10\nAccessibility Rating: 7/10\n\nNotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).  If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!\n\nLow gameplay time on steam; majority of gameplay was from DRM-free version.\n\nGame OverviewWhen you start This War of Mine (TWOM), the main menu consists of one primary button: survive.\n\nAt its heart, TWOM is a survival game.  In it, you must guide the actions of a small group of people as they struggle to survive amidst a war that is ravaging their city.\n\nI would recommend this game as a good purchase when on sale.  It is difficult to get started, interesting to play and think about, but ultimately repetitive after you understand the game mechanics.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nTWOM is primarily point-and-click.  While you can control zoom levels, the game field is larger than the what is shown at the furthest zoom level out, so you must use the mouse to scroll the screen, which can be annoying.\n\nEach new game puts you in a slightly randomized house with a different amount of resources in each iteration.\n\nThe game's economy is interesting and slightly complex, but ultimately quite limited.  The sheer number of different types of items is where the economy's complexity comes from, and the challenge lies in trying to balance what you bring back on scavenging missions due to limited space and the need to have a variety of items.  Once you understand the system, however, it is not difficult to become self-sustaining and to even develop an excess of tradable resources.\n\nUpgrade mechanics in the game are decent, but sometimes too costly for the benefit.\n\nStoryline\nTWOM takes place in a war ravaged (presumably) eastern European nation.  The charm of this game comes from its story more than anything else.  It is possible to simply play the game without getting invested in its story, but why waste the money?\n\nThe survivors each have a back story and unique traits that can complement the abilities of others to make a stronger team.  Further, each character reacts to the moral decisions you make as the war progresses and some events are triggered.  TWOM frequently nudges you to consider the terrible impacts of war on the innocent people that live in and around it.\n\nGameplay Rating\nThis War of Mine is rated 7/10 for gameplay.  You will restart multiple times, and, after some point, the game's difficulty will fade away, diminishing its overall replay value.\n\nAccessibility Overview\nGame Options\nGame options are available before starting a new game, but the menus may be difficult to see due to being low contrast with the background.  Look for the cog wheel in the lower right corner.\n\nAvailable options are music volume and sound effects in Sound options, resolution, quality, and fullscreen in Video, and localization (language and termperature).\n\nOne note is that the game uses a stylized 'Pencil Effect' that can be set to high or low.   This may provide a challenge for low-vision gamers.\n\nDeaf/HOH\nPros:\n+ Dialog shows in text for all speech\n+ Key sounds are visualized (those that affect game mechanics)\n\nCons:\n- It is possible to miss game events that may have an accompanying sound if they happen off-screen.\n\nNotes:\nTWOM is playable for deaf/HOH gamers.  Sound is not required to experience the game, since it uses visual cues to represent when your characters are making too much noise while sneaking around.\n\nMobility\nPros:\n+ Limited input required - essentially a mouse-only game.\n\nCons:\n- No options for altering combat mode, game difficulty, or accessibility accommodations for these events.\n\nNotes:\nThis game relies solely on gross mouse control and frequent clicking.  In combat situations, which are infrequent, it may be necessary to react quickly and make use of fine mouse control capabilities.\n\nAccessibility Rating\nThis War of Mine is rated 6/10 for accessibility.  Mouse controls may prove an occasional challenge for gamers with mobility issues.  The pencil effect adds an aesthetic to the game, but reduces contrast that may be essential for low-vision gamers.\n\n---\nVisit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf","July 28, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Due to various backlogs, I decided not to buy at launch and instead wait for a sale. The 60% off a few days ago did it for me.\n\nSadly, I must say, I am pretty disappointed having now played the game. There is absolutely no overreaching narrative. Whatever threadbare narrative the game has, is repetitive (character dialogues for example) or predictable (the letters/notes you occasionally find).\n\nThis game is all about the gameplay, and on a personal level, I am not fond of such mechanics. Collect/loot stuff to craft items/weapons/equipments etc. Micromanaging. I wouldn't have mind if this was a vessel to a great narrative, but it is not...it is the focal point of the game.\n\nAgain, I repeat, I am not fond of such mechanics, hence why I am disappointed in the game. It's not a game for everybody, that's for sure (but if that's the case, I'm surprised with the 96% rating).\n\nIf there's one thing the game does exceptionally well, is that it makes you feel depressed while playing it. No kidding. Everything moves at a slow pace. Sometimes you just can't do anything cause your characters are broken/depressed/tired. It's also quite unforgiving, and is a game meant to be replayed many times before you can "win", but having already played twice into the 20-days region, I cannot imagine playing again..just seems too repetitive if I do that.\n\nI'll not recommend it based on my personal experience and expectations, but the game is well-made enough that if you like such gameplay and don't care about narratives/story, then you should get it.","June 16, 2015","false","9.1"," 44 of 83 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","44","83","3","3"

I realize some of you might think I'm crazy or whatever, given the amount of glowing reviews on here (93% is a very high % for any game -- 95 % overall). But, you should realize that nearly ALL of the positive reviews come from people with less than 10 hours, and well over 50% of those have less than 5 hours. . . . for a 20 dollar game? Yeah, I don't think so.\n\nBut there's a very simple reason why I can't recommend this game: it's not procedural at all.\n\nEverything in this game is pre-determined, and how you beat it is also pre-determined. The claim of 'random events' is bogus, because in the short time I played this game, I was able to predict the time a trader would show up. Also, every building is the same each time you play. All of the items in the game seem to be the same kind/amount every time you play.\n\nThe game does give you that eery feeling, and it does put you on the edge of your seat... until you realize how repetitive the game is. In 3.3 hours of play, I wound up doing the same thing over and over and over and over again - that's sad.\n\nAlso, the game just isn't fun. The game is cool for about 2 hours, then the novelty of it wears off and then you realize you sank  20 bucks into a game that gives you about 1.5 hours of 'new stuff' to do. Seriously. After about an hour and a half, you will have done just about everything there is to do in this game. Do that for 20 more, then you'll start to understand why it just isn't that great.\n\nIf this game was $5, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat, because this feels more like an interactive novel than anything else, given its lack of content.\n\nSo that just about sums up what I don't like about this game and why I regret purchasing it. If you want a survival game that gives you an eery feeling, then get Project Zomboid or 7d2d.","June 5","false","3.3"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","14","25","0","0"

Susananya sedih, putus asa, dan pelan banget membuat lo gak sadar bahwa lo udah menghabis 5 jam ++ ketika pertama kali main game ini. This War Of Mine bener bener membuka pandangan baru terhadap perang dan pengalaman yang jarang banget ada game lain. Kalau lo liat game lagi sale, lo musti beli.\n\nScore total = 8 dari 10\nStoryline : 8 jam gue bermain dan kayanya sih gak ada storyline. Dari awal sampai akhir lo mempunyai kebebasan bagaimana caranya lo ingin survive. Walau pun begitu, disetiap karakter terdapat semacam background cerita kecil yang... kayanya nih yah... sama sekali gak mempunyai efek begitu besar didalam gameplay. Jadi, ya basically, lo bakalan memulai game dengan 3 orang karakter random dengan background ceritanya masing masing dan lo musti memanage ke 3 orang tersebut untuk survive.\n\nDisplay : Ini adalah game 3D side scrolling game. For some reason, elemen grafiknnya cukup kuat disini. So beberapa tempat yang lo bakalan datangi bakalan hancur. Jelas banget bekas peperangannya seperti lubang peluru, tembok hancur, atap rubuh, pintu di blokir, ban dibakar, gelap, grafiti dll. Efek yang paling menarik adalah efek pensil disetiap tembok. Seakan akan lo sedang 'menonton' sebuah lukisan. Animasi yang ditawarkan juga sederhana aja. Mulai dari default sampai combat keliatan mulus dan udah dipoles secara sempurna. Gue sampai sejauh ini gak menemukan bug atau glitch didalam game ini.\n\nMusic : Jujur gue jarang banget membahas aspek musik didalam game tapi gue punya pengecualian dengan game ini. Perpaduan grafik dan musik ini membuat lo galau dan putus asa. Musiknya itu melow banget... Serius, musiknya berhasil menyedot gue kedalam game. Gue tuh rasanya baru main satu jam, tapi begitu gue nengok ke jam dinding, eh udah 8 jam aja. Ini baru satu kali main lho.. baru satu kali pencet tombol play di Steam.\n\nGameplay : Survival, looting and crafting. Yup, tiga kalimat ini udah jelas banget ya. Misi utama lo adalah survival ditengah peperangan. Lo musti bertahan diri dari panggilan alam (lapar atau sakit), bandit, bahkan teman lo sendiri. Nah, untuk bisa memenuhi kebutuhan lo, mau gak mau lo musti looting. Pertama kali main, gak akan ada tutorial. Jadi lo langsung muncul dengan 3 orang karakter dan sama sekali gak tau musti apa yang dipencet atau apa yang di klik. Duh... Nah, ketika lo udah berkenalan dengan control, mulai deh. Hal yang pertama kali lo musti lakukan adalah looting markas lo sendiri. Lo bisa search di lemari, meja, dsb lah. Begitu udah cukup resource, segera buat workshoop dan toolshop. WAJIB BUAT SHOVEL DAN CROWBAR karena itu adalah 2 tools untuk looting. Setelah itu bebas deh mau buat apa.. ini review ya bukan tutorial jadi you figure it out lah.. okay balik maning, setelah lo looting dan crafting, lo musti cari resource lagi ditempat lain. Begitu end of the day, lo bakalan memanage tugas karakter lo. Satu disuruh jaga, satu disuruh tidur, satu disuruh scavenge ya itu terserah lo. Nah begitu lo menyuruh scavenge, gameplay bakalan masuk ke tempat lain dan tugas lo adalah looting. Ingat, lo cuman punya waktu 1 malam untuk looting. Lo musti pulang sebelum matahari terbit atau ada kemungkinan besar karakter lo mati. Begitu karakter lo kembali, do that crafting, cooking, sleeping and stuff.\n\nKesimpulan : This War Of Mine adalah game bagus yang bener bener niat. Game ini menekankan gameplay sebagai senjata utamanya. Harganya juga masuk akal kok dengan fitur yang ditawarkan. Fair price. Kalau lo suka survival looting dan crafting dengan spek komputer standart, ya lo bisa coba lah game ini. Gue jamin, lo ikutan galau. Jujur, butuh tingkat pemikiran dan daya filosofi yang lumayan untuk main game ini.","January 1, 2015","true","11.6"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","1"

I felt much worse about losing Carly in The Walking Dead (Telltale Games) than I did about ignoring the girl in the other room who's about to get ♥♥♥♥♥ and killed by a soldier. She made for a good distraction and helped me safely loot stuff from the Supermarket. Other moral choices like whether or not to kill this rich family trivially boiled down to "Will it help me?".\n\nThe mood mechanic infuritated me. People got sad from stealing, and depressed or broken from killing. Granted, this game isn't a game about killing but flopping down on the floor in Very Hungry state after just retrieving a bag of food from the dead people's house - that's idiotic! These direct cause-and-effect behaviors further reminded me that the characters in this game are just encapsulations of data visualized with pixels and sounds.\n\nOverall, I couldn't immerse myself into this game. The gameplay is somewhat addicting - building improvements to the house, sneaking past or killing guards, profitting on a hard-earned meal - but I couldn't emotionally invest into any of the moral decisions of the game.","August 10, 2015","false","9.5"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","0"

Its a really unique experience, emotional and brutal.\n\nGameplay is split into two sections: day and night. During the day, your survivors are at home. You need to keep an eye on any negative status effects - when they're hungry, give them some food, if they're sick, give them medicine, bandage their wounds and make sure they sleep when tired. You can build equipment such as a stove to cook food, a workshop to craft tools and weapons, rain collectors and filters to get clean water, traps to catch small animals to eat, beds to sleep in, a furnace for heat. And you can craft valuable trade items like cigarettes and booze.\n\nDuring the night, you can select one survivor to scavenge local buildings for supplies, while the others either sleep, or guard your home from bandits. There are lots of areas to visit around the city, and you'll encounter some tricky situations. There are only a couple of completely abandoned areas where you're free to take everything without consequence. Sometimes friendly people will trade with you, but if you don't have anything valuable, would you steal from them instead? Would you murder innocents and take their stuff so your own people can survive? Some areas are occupied by dangerous bandits, who will attack you on sight - but if you're desperate, you might have to risk it.\n\nThe combat system, like the rest of the gameplay, is managed through a point and click interface. Left click to walk to a location, right click to run, left click icons to interact with an object or person. I found the combat to be very hard, but I think that is probably by design. Our survivors aren't trained soldiers, and powerful guns are rare and expensive. So far I've tried to avoid combat as much as possible. There's no reloading or respawning, so death is permanent.\n\nThere are several scenarios to play through, where you'll start with between one and four survivors, and sometimes another will ask to join your group. Even that can be a tough choice - an extra pair of hands can be useful but its another mouth to feed. Each survivor has their own story and some of them have a special skill. For example Katja can get better value in trades, Bruno spends less resources when cooking and Arica can sneak quietly.\n\nIts the kind of game where you'll generate your own stories. I thought my second attempt was looking good, until we got several days of snow. I couldn't keep the house warm enough, so Bruno froze to death overnight. Realising that every meal would cost me more resources, I started to take risks in the dangerous areas. Arica stealth killed two bandits but a third one shot her dead. Katja went to the same place the next night, figuring one more bandit would be easy enough. Turns out there was more than one and they shot her dead as well. Now alone, and very desperate, I had Pavle murder an old couple and steal all their food, but the next day he was depressed, wouldn't eat anything, and overnight he committed suicide. Game over. But its failures like that which made my next, successful run feel so good.\n\nTWOM is a fantastic game and I thoroughly recommend it as a full price purchase.","February 9, 2015","true","44.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I was unsure first because when ı watch some gameplays and read about 5 or 6 reviews  the game seemed repetitive to me, you know looting the same locations over and over etc. But than the nature of this game lured me in. This is another survival game yes but it is different.\n\nFirst of all you are not facing stupid zombies or some kind of mutant animals, monsters and so on instead you are facing war itself and you are just an ordinary civilian trying to survive, not a lean, mean killing machine. On the other hand the game(war) will force you to make some hard decisions which takes your "innocence" away. For example you'll ran out of food most of the time, at first you'll scavenge empty and safe places but those places will not produce food and you will ran out of food again. So you'll try to produce your own food, you'll build traps to catch some rats if you are lucky, you'll build small gardens to grow some vagetables but those will not be enough because you will be defending your shelter from unfriendly neighbors in the meantime. Eventually you will choose the "easy" way. You'll start stealing, forcing people to give you what you want or killing them when they are not willing to give. You will change, a lot. WAR WILL CHANGE YOU!!!\nAtleast it changed me. I mean i did something ı didn't before. I made some charts to keep track of food, meds, materials etc. I labeled them by locations, ı did it carefully. It is important because ı didn't even make one for my thesis :D\n\nTo cut to the chase; I can't get enough of this game and ı strongly recommend it. Buy it.

Get enough supplies each night and you will be fine, try to stay away from bandits or fights if you don't have weapons. Sounds simple right? Well its not obvisouly buidlings will be looted some loot will be left behind for you of course but not much and some times its not enough to keep everyone alive so sometimes you will have to go out and kill bandits or become a bandit. now i love this game i reccomend it 100% if you like war simulation games but in a different way....

There are no zombies, nothing supernatural or crazy, just regular people all trying to survive. The first time I killed, I justified it to myself. These people were going to attack me if they found me. At least, that's what I assumed. They didn't get a chance to speak, I couldn't take the risk. But the next time? Were the elderly couple really going to attack me? I doubt it. But they had food, and I needed food. It's terrible, what I had to do, but I can't let anyone starve.\n\nBasically, if you buy the game, you'll eventually do something horrible and you'll feel terrible about it.

This game has excellent art direction and sense of place; you KNOW after spending a week in-game that the city is a horrible place to live in. The day-to-day resource management is appropriately challenging; choosing to build an herb workshop rather than a rat trap could mean that no one in your house will make it to the end.\n\nNeeds an optional tutorial though. I understand the developers' intention to show that you are a band of desperate people trying to figure things out, but I feel they should at least have something for people who are totally new to simulation/stealth games.\n\nHowever, I found myself being very engaged with the day-to-day struggles, and even now I am going back into the game to see if I can get another group of survivors to make it through the siege. I hope that there will be Steam Workshop support in the future, as I can see a lot of possibilities with the world of This War of Mine: Endless Mode, tweaks to traits,  maybe even new survivors. I strongly recommend this game to people who are willing to try a war game where no matter what you do, you can't stop the war yourself, and instead you're just trying to live long enough to see the end of it.","November 19, 2014","true","95.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tenryuu-Chan/recommended/282070/","Tenryuu-Chan","Sakuragi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tenryuu-Chan/","70 products in account","After playing this game for many hours, I must say, this game is good. It shows a side of war that not many games show. Sure Spec Ops: The Line showed the effects of war and decisions for soldiers but this game focuses on the citizens, the people who didn't want and deserve to be in the war. Many don''t focus on that cause people prefer action. So I will just say the pro's and con's\n\nPro's:\n\n1. Click adventure. The controls are very simple. It only needs mouse interactions and it is quite simple to understand what the icons in the game mean.\n\n2. Character stories. There are about 8 preset characters, each with their own story on life and how the war has changed them. It is very interesting to learn about each character and the hardships they went through cause of the effects of war.\n\n3. Politics through the perspective of those in the warzone. Most people don't feel as much about the government when talking about war because it is usually something people don't like to talk about but in This War of Mine, when you listen in on the radio about the politics happening, you want to get up and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of the government for what they are doing. There are many examples like how the government postpones a peacemaking group from entering the town another 2-3 weeks or when the soldiers from the government commit atrocities against the citizens. Each bit of news makes you feel more about what life is like as a citizen in a warzone.\n\n4. The harsh environment. This isn't a picnic in the middle of the meddow, this is war and it is never pretty. Bandits try to raid your home, even scared innocent citizens try to raid you just to live another day. I shows the truth and ugly side of the war that no one wants to know.\n\n5. Permenant death. Your characters will die. If you don't take good care of your folk, it will cause problems to you and your other survivors. This makes you want survivors to live.\n\n6. Choices. This game has some hard choices. There is no moral ground in war, there is only survival and this game has it in spades. Sure stealing from people is wrong but sometimes, you must put aside all morals and do what is best for your people. I had to steal from many innocents that didn't deserve it and will die cause of me but it is either me or them and I would much rather look after my own people rather than worry about others. There are also people who visit your safehouse asking for help like medicine, food, or just require one of your folk to help them. It is up to you if you are willing to give up all your medicine for a mother who is dying.\n\n7. Morale. Your characters are not soldiers, they are just people. Because of that, they are not as hardened as soldiers in the field of battle. As such, when someone dies, your survivors will become depressed, broken even. Even stealing, killing innocents, and denying request will affect your survivors. If someone is broken and beyond depressed, they will kill themself from such depression. This makes players watch and value each character even more.\n\n8. Scenarios. This game can give you a random scenario with pre-set items and characters. You can start in the winter or summer and sometimes you can get either 1-4 survivors in your party to start. Although this is a RNG dice roll, doesn't mean it gives a challenge. Personally, I like a challenge and I would accept it, for others though, this is a hit or miss with others. There is also scenarios during the time when you are surviving like when bandit run wild or when the market for trading changes prices with certain items.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Click adventure. As simple as the game is, it has its problems. For those who have played action games will not find much enjoyment from this game cause of how simple the game controls are. Simple controls leads to boring and repetitive gameplay.\n\n2. Difficulty. The first couple of games will be hard but once you understand the game concept and how it works, I never lost a single person. The game becomes too easy and becomes bland as time passes. If there were difficulty setting and options, then this game would be more fun.\n\n3. Save. This game has no manual save, it only has auto save and it only auto saves at the end of a day. A manual save function would be good. There is also no muliple save files, there is only one. Although this seems a bit questionable, this is a minor con.\n\n4. Combat. There really isn't much combat and when there is, it is just "click the dude and hope you win." Each character has traits so some characters can defeat a person better than others will but the combat is quite RNG like. If you dont have a combat expert and you are spotted, you better pray to god that the dice rolls in your favor.\n\n5. Guns. Guns in this game are largely pointless to use when scavenging. They cause loud noises and can barely kill anyone. Mostly because bandits and soldiers have armor so melee is the much better option when scavenging. The only use for guns is to defend your safehouse from raids but that is all they are valued for, other than trading.\n\nEven with these problems, it still doesn't mean it's a bad game. The game is strong and it is a nice change after seeing Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and more. It may not be as good and as entertaining to some but for those who enjoy a challenge and a change in pace for war times, this game is up your alley. My only gripe is when the game adds a difficulty setting and option and a infinite mode where the war last forever and try see how long will you survive until you meet your demise. For the difficulty setting, I want a option that turns of trading because in the later or mid-game, you can really never die or lose since a trader visits you every so often and there are areas that have trading spots, more specifically the Central Junction, where it is a trading mecha. It is cool to see a community create a trading center during war times but it becomes too easy with the amount of items they sell. You can essencially live on forever. If there is a option that turns off trading, I would gladly turn it on for the rest of my playtime.\n\nOverall: 7.5/10","December 5, 2014","true","146.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only thing that bugs me is just that.. Bugs, there's a few that drive me insane, such as some sections of ceiling that you can shoot through and be shot through when it's obvious that you shouldn't be able to do that. Sometimes when you play this game you require to move quickly because you've been spotted, or something along those lines, but you can't react as quickly as you want because interacting with objects and spots are rather finicky.. Time and time again I am killed because I click the shadows and realize that I can't duck in there, I don't care if Batman's bulky self is hiding in there, he better fit for two because I'm not gettin' shot for it.\n\nThat bit of sillyness aside, this game has its ups and downs, but another 'review' about this game mentioned how there was no way for the survivors to be the bad guy without being severely punished by this... I agree, there are times when I want to play the bad guy just for the sake of being the bad guy, but when all of my survivors kill theirselves or go into a state of depression to where they won't do a damn thing just because some crazy punk ran outside and punched me in the face, I returned the favor with a shotgun shell to cure his headache. However, I don't believe anything that's in the game should be changed, no no, everything right now I believe is fantastic! Don't change what you have, add to what you have.\n\nI love this game but I'm teetering on giving it a good or a bad review just because there is not too much to it. This game doesn't have too much replayability aside from having other survivors in different situations, which is a good tactic to convince players to try each of them. All of my thoughts came down to the newest 'DLC'.. I was disappointed, now, don't get me wrong about this and think I'm being selfish.. But bear with me here, I understand it was for charity, but surely anyone of the people reading probably got a bit hyper over seeing some DLC being added to the game, but was probably abit disappointed it was only to add collectibles to it.. Yes, people will still buy it for the sake of donating, but if you're just wanting donations for all of this then why not make a proper DLC to hook in more players?\n\nMore content being added to a great game will make it bigger, and the bigger it is makes it easier to see.. Attracting more people and bringing in more profit that the company can do whatever with. Adding more locations or different events would be great, maybe seeing some of said events around your safehouse would be fantastic, adding more weaponry and perhaps a more juryrigged look to a lot of items would be nice as well. The experienced player will see a place filled with military/militia members and eyeball it like a candy store, mainly because people like myself can walk in with a knife and then walk out with an entire backpack filled with guns and ammunition, even body armor and helmets if they have it.. This will very easilly make the player win the game so long as they continue to stay careful about their spending of such items.\n\nWhy not add some new survivors to the pool? Criminals would be a great addition, if somebody wants to have a group of unruly jerks that go around and take what they want.. Well.. That would add a good bit of excitement, they'd get greedy and be more aggressive as they kill and steal, but at the same time they would be probably taking more damage and using more of their materials, perhaps losing survivors in the process. Just as much, if you have criminals that means they'd lie as well, they wouldn't share how they got their materials unlike your other survivors that will feel guilty... This would mean no depression for the group, however, it could mean more raiders to come and punish them more often, bigger groups with better equipment knocking at your door for each place you've stolen from and people you've killed. Hell, being a criminal and thinking you can take whatever you want it would probably also mean they'd steal from their own group, like Arica.\n\nI've got plenty of things in mind that I'd love to discuss, but if you read it this far you'll know that I've been typing a good amount already.. I give 'This War of Mine' a 9/10, it's almost perfect but it could use just a bit more to it, via more DLC or just overall adding out of the kindness of their heart.. I love this game but I would love to see more people play it and more people enjoy things, have different strategies to deal with seperate situations, have a feel of being able to customize your pre-determined group. Since there's no voicing and it's all text, I would also enjoy perhaps adding a customize your own survivor feature, put yourself into the war zone with flaws and traits of your own, backstory of why you're stuck in the middle of that war and what you were doing beforehand!\n\nThis is the end of my review, I'd indeed recommend you try it, but don't get too hooked into it since there probably won't be too much, if anything, added to it.","March 12, 2015","true","55.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Raid bandits? Steal from the innocent? This game makes you think about a lot of things. Every day is a new struggle that feels so authentic it harrows you. Never have I played something so gritty. Between starving to death and dodging sniper fire, you start to appreciate the smaller things. The elation you feel when you discover a fridge full of food, or nurse a fallen comrade back from the brink of death, parallel some of the highest moments from scripted storylines such as The Walking Dead. Your characters reflect on their pasts and the things they have done recently to stay alive. They rejoice and celebrate heroic acts and sulk after more questionable undertakings. They show concern for themselves, but more importantly, eachother. Apart from the slightly limited speech bubble dialogue, they seem like real people.\n\nThe graphical style is fairly unique and gives you no illusions of safety or comfort. Everything around you screams warzone. The interface is simple, yet effective; circles show availiable actions in the environment around your characters and progress is shown by an orange meter around the circle. Every action has an appropriate, and often completely satisfying, animation to accompany it. Hatchet fights anyone!? Combat feels fresh, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Go in guns blazing? Hide and wait for an attempt to assasinate? or just plain sneak and hope to avoid a fight altogether. Your choice is important. Guns are no joke and sound attracts (usually unwanted) attention.\n\n9.5/10 - I would definitely recommend getting this game.","November 16, 2014","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I heard voices talking but didn't see what they said.  I went through a room on the bottom floor, but there was a hole in the roof, and someone with a gun spotted me through the hole.\n\n"I'll kill you!"  The person went back and came down a ladder looking for me.  I hid myself in the shadows and waited.  They walked by my position, and I lept upon them without even thinking.  Not a chance they saw me coming...My character threw them onto the floor and stabbed them over and over until the person was dead.\n\nMore people heard the violence and came down the same ladder.  I couldn't hide again; it was them or me. I charged at the one that came down first, but she just pushed me away and ran past me.  She ran to the person I'd just killed.\n\n"Boenza...No!  Boenza, I don't believe this...."  The female character keeps crying and saying the name Boenza.  She doesn't even acknowledge me.  I loot Boenza's body right in front of her; she doesn't try to stop me.\n\nAnother character, a male I believe, came into the room.  He was holding a rifle and could have dropped me right then.  He just looked at me and started shouting.\n\n"Leave! Get out of here!"  I thought he would shoot me.  God knows I deserved it.\n\nSickened, I turned around and just walked out with the woman audibly crying over Boenza's body.  The man just watched me leave with nothing besides Boenza's gun.\n\nWas Boenza their child?  Why had she yelled that she would kill me?  I guess she was trying to protect her parents; trying to be the hero we see in war far too often.  I didn't want to die, so I killed her with a knife, in what was probably her own home.  I tried to kill her mom, but she was tougher than me and just brushed me aside because trying to care for her daughter was more important.  I looted that girl's body in front of her mother because I needed the gun.\n\nThen there's her father...He saw his wife crying over their dead daughter's body, and past them he saw me with my knife which would have still had blood on it.  He could have killed me with his rifle.  Most of you would have because this is a game, right?  He just shouted for me to leave over and over again.\n\nThey were better people than me, including Boenza; I wish Boenza had won our fight.\n\nBest. Game.

The hand drawn look of the game, creates a bleak looking visual interpretation of a war torn world where colour is devoid, as is the love for life for the protagonists. The player is set to make countless life or death decisions for a handful of people who need to be guided through a month or two of what seems to be a civil war in a fictional Eastern Europe style city.\n\nI don't normally play platform type games, especially ones that look like Snakes and Ladders but after only an hour or two of playing - I found my decision to purchase the game was completely worth while.\n\nYou can play this game quite easily with just the mouse and it is easy to pick up and play. It took me about 16 hours to finish the game and did so without any guides or cheats, nor did I watch any "Lets Play's" on YouTube, and in itself made the experience even more rewarding.\n\nThe story while not so deep (ie not very story rich) is still very moving, and one can easily become attached to the people you will be controlling.\n\nThe game on occasion reminded me of SIMS, in which you control a persons needs and had a small resemblence to tower defense games or something along the lines of Civilisation where you build, upgrade and defend a base.\n\nWhile playing the game, I did not encounter any bugs or crashes and the only issue I met was in terms of game play mechanics. I found that I really did not need to upgrade many househole items and instead I decided to hoard materials to trade for food or save stacks of items I could burn, ready for when winter came along.\n\nThe game could have lasted longer and had more story - and thus would have required me upgrading certain aspects of my base - but alas I did not need to as the game did not demand it. The game could have had a DLC with different story lines, such as maybe an alien invasion or a zombie apocalypse and of course I would not rule it out happening in the future, and I will be keenly watching an eye on developer news. This is a testament to the game's success, as I rarely keep an eye on specific developer releases once I have finished a game.\n\nAt the end of the day, this was a very addictive game - and easy to pick up and play. I was left with a bittersweet feeling when the game ended for me after 46 days. I was happy that I managed to *win* the game on my first try - but I was quite sad because my daily dose of war was over; Quite ironic if you think of it.\n\nI look forward to more games from this developer and hopefully an expansion to this game. I also think if this game allowed mods via the Steam workshop - the games content could be expanded by it's own players giving this game a much longer shelf time.\n\nI give this game a solid A+ or a 9/10. If you are unsure as to whether to purchase this game or not, trust me that you will not be disappointed.","January 11, 2015","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its a really unique experience, emotional and brutal.\n\nGameplay is split into two sections: day and night. During the day, your survivors are at home. You need to keep an eye on any negative status effects - when they're hungry, give them some food, if they're sick, give them medicine, bandage their wounds and make sure they sleep when tired. You can build equipment such as a stove to cook food, a workshop to craft tools and weapons, rain collectors and filters to get clean water, traps to catch small animals to eat, beds to sleep in, a furnace for heat. And you can craft valuable trade items like cigarettes and booze.\n\nDuring the night, you can select one survivor to scavenge local buildings for supplies, while the others either sleep, or guard your home from bandits. There are lots of areas to visit around the city, and you'll encounter some tricky situations. There are only a couple of completely abandoned areas where you're free to take everything without consequence. Sometimes friendly people will trade with you, but if you don't have anything valuable, would you steal from them instead? Would you murder innocents and take their stuff so your own people can survive? Some areas are occupied by dangerous bandits, who will attack you on sight - but if you're desperate, you might have to risk it.\n\nThe combat system, like the rest of the gameplay, is managed through a point and click interface. Left click to walk to a location, right click to run, left click icons to interact with an object or person. I found the combat to be very hard, but I think that is probably by design. Our survivors aren't trained soldiers, and powerful guns are rare and expensive. So far I've tried to avoid combat as much as possible. There's no reloading or respawning, so death is permanent.\n\nThere are several scenarios to play through, where you'll start with between one and four survivors, and sometimes another will ask to join your group. Even that can be a tough choice - an extra pair of hands can be useful but its another mouth to feed. Each survivor has their own story and some of them have a special skill. For example Katja can get better value in trades, Bruno spends less resources when cooking and Arica can sneak quietly.\n\nIts the kind of game where you'll generate your own stories. I thought my second attempt was looking good, until we got several days of snow. I couldn't keep the house warm enough, so Bruno froze to death overnight. Realising that every meal would cost me more resources, I started to take risks in the dangerous areas. Arica stealth killed two bandits but a third one shot her dead. Katja went to the same place the next night, figuring one more bandit would be easy enough. Turns out there was more than one and they shot her dead as well. Now alone, and very desperate, I had Pavle murder an old couple and steal all their food, but the next day he was depressed, wouldn't eat anything, and overnight he committed suicide. Game over. But its failures like that which made my next, successful run feel so good.\n\nTWOM is a fantastic game and I thoroughly recommend it as a full price purchase.","February 9, 2015","true","44.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Roman, being ex-militia, wanted revenge for her death, so he took up his axe and went to St. Mary's church. He knocked on the basement door, and when he saw the man who had killed her he struck him dead. Two women ran over to mourn over the man's dead body as Rowan trudged through the house, looking for valuables to take, but hearing the two women frightened and crying made him want to leave despite feeling completely justified in his murder.

Snipers keep you from scavenging during the day.  Lack of food and medicine force you out into the world to hopefully find enough to make it through another day.  Other survivors populate the game, some just trying to eke it out the best they can, some have turned to banditry, some inadvertently try to push you into banditry.  The more days pass by the more you are tested in the limits of your own morals and humanity.\n\nIt's a very engrossing, well-crafted story and very easy to become engaged with the various survivors in your group.  You get the impression that someone involved in the creation of this game was in some way connected to a similar situation as it is very good at portraying the horrors.\n\nIt is a very addictive game, very easy to get sucked in and play for hours at a time, and either survive the war to the end or die off, and then take a ten-minute break and then go right back in and start a new game.

When you play it, you will never reach a certain point of stability with your resources/supplies. Every single day is a struggle to survive and you will always have to balance your group's necessities. This includes their mental health, hunger, injuries, and sleepiness. If things start to get out of check, it is possible for the group to be ♥♥♥♥ed over big-time and members can die very easily.\n\nThe combat is not perfect and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t occurs sometimes. Luckily, the gripping idea of this entire game and the excellent artwork and overall experience make up for it at the end of the day. I would go into detail about the emotional aspect that the game delivers, but many other reviews have described it perfectly already. This game will make you remember about all those inhumane things you had to do to other people to survive. You will feel like a terrible person (and your group will constantly remind you of it). I recommend that you buy "This War of Mine" now if you like games with a permanent challenge and an interesting experience like no other "war" game delivers.

If nothing, I wanted to give it a chance because I respected the message it tried to give across. I'm glad to say I didn't regret.\n\nEverybody already mentioned the unique aspect of the game, that you play as a group of civilians trying to survive instead of soldiers so I am not going to focus too much on that. I am really glad that the makers took a risk by showing an actual civil war in place (which resonates very well in these days, unfortunately) instead of the overused zombie apocalypses we have seen over and over.\n\nThe graphics are fairly simple but well done. The grey-washed color scheme and blending of hand-drawn backgrounds with digitally created characters and objects really works well together. What little there is, is done really well.\n\nGameplay is usually good. Fairly simple point and click. During the day, you are in your hideout. You have a toolbench where you gather raw materials to build beds, different types of workbenches, beds, stoves, heaters, distillers and so on. Nearly every single one of these items have a vital role to play and you want to make sure you can have a headstart so that you will be producing trade goods (alcohol, cigarettes etc...) as much as you can to keep up with your needs. The season, weather, supplies and characters you start with are randomised and that means you can have a better or worse start and while this has some impact, it is sensible and is a good challenge for you to manage yourself. Every character has some use and are better geared towards either taking care of your home (the mechanic, the cook) while others are better towards scavenging (the fighter, the runner, the expert scavenger, the heavy lifter, the thief). There are a few characters whose skills seem very specific to the point of uselessness (Cveta for instance). Maybe I was not able to find their specific uses. But having a group consisting primarily of one type of characters or the other will definitely impede your ability to survive.\n\nAt night, you go out scavenging and this is where things get more complicated. While the first few houses you find tend to be empty, as you keep going, you will find houses inhabited by soldiers, rebels, bandits, deserters and hapless survivors like you. How you deal with them will have a huge impact. I found the stealth and combat mechanics somewhat finicky but was able to get used to them fairly quickly. Anything you can interact with has a symbol on top of them which you can point and click in the usual fashion.\n\nThe one issue I have is that there are no tooltips to explain what the action exactly is. In my initial playthroughs, I found the difference between the icons for "loot-unowned-item" and "steal-owned-item" the hard way. Similarly, during combat, the icons for "take cover" and "take cover and shoot" are so small that you will find yourself doubting which is which. While most of the gameplay issues and difficulties could be explained with characters not being soldiers to perform a combat task well, things like these have little excuse.\n\nAnother issue I had was that some traders seemed to be on a bit of a hair trigger. In one of my first playthroughs, I managed to get access to the town square (where a lot of traders are present). Apparently, running towards them even if I was holding no weapons is a no-no because suddenly, everyone turned on me to attack. It seems like you need to approach them carefully. Sorta makes sense in a warzone I suppose, but it just doesn't make sense to have one rebel going "Hey, wanna trade?" while his friend goes "DIE!!!" Similarly, interactability with non-combat characters feels a bit too limited. A good example is the house with the old couple. The game seems to want you to have a morality struggle - Do you rob the old couple even as they are begging you not to or do you leave them alone? But nowhere is the option of saying "My friend is sick, I really need some medicine" or "Give me any medicine you got or I will shoot you". As it stands, you can't convey why you are trying to get into their house. How they responded and how you react to that would have a far more meaningful morality consequence, not to mention would still be sensible within the game's world.\n\nGunfight as a whole is ill-advised and even when I had access to AKs and shotguns, I stuck with hiding around and stabbing people with a knife if combat was required. Almost any enemy is likely to outclass your guys with weapons and bullets are finite. Especially in the crime phase later into the game, your house will be raided nearly every night and you're better off keeping your guns and bullets for that and use any excess guns for trading. In general, sneaking is fairly well done. Definitely better than combat.\n\nThe atmosphere is spot-on. The colors, the music cues, the little mood bubbles of the characters and the occasional challenges and "quests" (for the lack of a better word) really help set the mood. And these little things help you get attached to your characters. When you help your neighbours or save a girl from a drunken soldier, you will likely not do that out of an expectation of a reward (and often there is none) other than feeling good that you've done a good deed. It makes the characters feel content but I've noticed how often it make *me* feel good too. Similarly, robbing people or ignoring them even as they beg for help made the characters and myself feel absolutely sh*t. The decision of where you go in the night, what you need, if you think short term or long term and how you react to an unexpected situation makes the core of the game and can sometimes turn a good situation really bad really quickly. It is weird how attached you grow to your characters and have emotional responses even when it is independent from the game.\n\nIn terms of story, there isn't much in focus. You are just trying to survive, after all. But each character has their own background of which more and more is revealed as the game goes along. If you win, the epilogue will show what came of their stories. It is a nice touch but can get a bit weird with characters that join your house later. I had a guy join the group a day before ceasefire was declared and the epilogue went on about how he met the woman he had lost contact when the war broke and so on but because he had just joined the group, I didn't know any of that so it felt as if it came a bit out of nowhere. Outside the personal stories, listening to the radio, listening to people speaking during scavenger runs and notes you find give you a better idea of the scale of war, the causes behind and how others have suffered, all help enrich the game's world.\n\nI've read a lot of reviews mentioning bugs and crashes. I had no such issues during my playthrough. It seems like the game is optimised for Alienware computers, so it might be why it ran without any problems for me. On a side note, the Alienware optimisation means the game actually synchs up with your computer's LED lighting (if you have any) and changes the color of the LEDs according to what is going on in the game, which is pretty cool.\n\nOverall, definitely recommend it.","November 28, 2014","true","25.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Battling sickness, injuries, looters, and the ever looming threat of death, your main goal in each of the Day/Night phases is making it just one more day.\n\nGood: EXTREMELY atmospheric. The visuals, music, and even the UI evokes a sense of desperation and despair. The characters just FEEL real. Their daily diaries do a good job of putting you in the shoes of desperate survivors. The choices in this game, the ones that hit you in the gut, are all natural and emergent. There's never a popup asking you if you want to steal for survival, there's just an unarmed old man asking, "Why are you doing this?" while you take meat for your two friends who haven't eaten in two days. The art style is... just beautiful. With the gameplay in "This War of Mine", they could have easily settled with 2D graphics, but instead they created a moving and engrossing setting with very real feeling characters.

If not, then I guess don't play this game. But you would be missing out, because you don't see games like this very often at all.\n\nMy closest comparison to this game would be Spec Ops: The Line because both take you into very dark places and when you finish it you are more likely to feel exhausted than jubilant. Unlike Spec Ops however, This War of Mine has no set storyline to follow. None of the countless horrible events you can come across in this game are guaranteed to happen for you, and everything you do in this game is entirely your choice. So in that regard it is a step up from that lovely adventure into a sand-storm ravaged Dubai. Because in this game, when you decide to have your characters do something horrible, it was your choice. Nothing forced you to do that. And you (or rather, your band of survivors) have to live with that.\n\nThis game is about as unpleasant as it gets, and yet despite that this game was necessary since it shows the often forgotten side of war: the civilians whose hometown ends up becoming a battlefield. I can't say you will have fun (you probably won't, even if the gameplay is quite good), but I can say that it will be an experience you will think about for quite sometime.\n\nEnjoy being plunged into a world of despair and desperation.

Not that they are fighting in it, you are not a combatant, you are just trying to get through to the next day and there are plenty of things to trip you up as you go. The game has several distinct phases that will change up what challanges you face as you go. The whole time you have to feed and arm your survivors as well as fortify your base.\n\nYou will find yourselve in a variety of precarious moral situations (who gets to eat, do you help your neighbor, do you help a perfect stranger, among MANY more).\n\nThis game has a very rogue-like quality as you are balancing several very limited resources every day.\n\nEach day has two parts:\n\nDay - Is  a sort of resource managing survival game where you create the tools you need to survive.\n\nNight - Plays out as a 2D stealth game where you scavange, steal, barter or raid for whatever you can to survive.\n\nBy the end of this game you will be limping forward, my playthrough ended with all 4 of my party barely alive.\n\nThe difficulty is brutal and mistakes are punished severely, death of a party member can happen in a matter of moments and losing that one party member can cause everything to spiral out of control.\n\nI have exactly one knock on the game, when your base is attacked, it is simulated. I would have loved to have had to defend my base in the 2D combat engine the scavenging uses.\n\nThe game has a ton a replay value via random events, party members and resources.\n\nIf you like survival games, you will love this game. If you like resource management games, you will love this game. If you like games that make you think about your actions, you will love this game . If you like to feel like a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you will love this game.\n\nI cannont recommend this game highly enough. My achievement for getting my party through all the way is among my favorites.","November 30, 2014","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Raid bandits? Steal from the innocent? This game makes you think about a lot of things. Every day is a new struggle that feels so authentic it harrows you. Never have I played something so gritty. Between starving to death and dodging sniper fire, you start to appreciate the smaller things. The elation you feel when you discover a fridge full of food, or nurse a fallen comrade back from the brink of death, parallel some of the highest moments from scripted storylines such as The Walking Dead. Your characters reflect on their pasts and the things they have done recently to stay alive. They rejoice and celebrate heroic acts and sulk after more questionable undertakings. They show concern for themselves, but more importantly, eachother. Apart from the slightly limited speech bubble dialogue, they seem like real people.\n\nThe graphical style is fairly unique and gives you no illusions of safety or comfort. Everything around you screams warzone. The interface is simple, yet effective; circles show availiable actions in the environment around your characters and progress is shown by an orange meter around the circle. Every action has an appropriate, and often completely satisfying, animation to accompany it. Hatchet fights anyone!? Combat feels fresh, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Go in guns blazing? Hide and wait for an attempt to assasinate? or just plain sneak and hope to avoid a fight altogether. Your choice is important. Guns are no joke and sound attracts (usually unwanted) attention.\n\n9.5/10 - I would definitely recommend getting this game.","November 16, 2014","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I heard voices talking but didn't see what they said.  I went through a room on the bottom floor, but there was a hole in the roof, and someone with a gun spotted me through the hole.\n\n"I'll kill you!"  The person went back and came down a ladder looking for me.  I hid myself in the shadows and waited.  They walked by my position, and I lept upon them without even thinking.  Not a chance they saw me coming...My character threw them onto the floor and stabbed them over and over until the person was dead.\n\nMore people heard the violence and came down the same ladder.  I couldn't hide again; it was them or me. I charged at the one that came down first, but she just pushed me away and ran past me.  She ran to the person I'd just killed.\n\n"Boenza...No!  Boenza, I don't believe this...."  The female character keeps crying and saying the name Boenza.  She doesn't even acknowledge me.  I loot Boenza's body right in front of her; she doesn't try to stop me.\n\nAnother character, a male I believe, came into the room.  He was holding a rifle and could have dropped me right then.  He just looked at me and started shouting.\n\n"Leave! Get out of here!"  I thought he would shoot me.  God knows I deserved it.\n\nSickened, I turned around and just walked out with the woman audibly crying over Boenza's body.  The man just watched me leave with nothing besides Boenza's gun.\n\nWas Boenza their child?  Why had she yelled that she would kill me?  I guess she was trying to protect her parents; trying to be the hero we see in war far too often.  I didn't want to die, so I killed her with a knife, in what was probably her own home.  I tried to kill her mom, but she was tougher than me and just brushed me aside because trying to care for her daughter was more important.  I looted that girl's body in front of her mother because I needed the gun.\n\nThen there's her father...He saw his wife crying over their dead daughter's body, and past them he saw me with my knife which would have still had blood on it.  He could have killed me with his rifle.  Most of you would have because this is a game, right?  He just shouted for me to leave over and over again.\n\nThey were better people than me, including Boenza; I wish Boenza had won our fight.\n\nBest. Game.

Pavle, being the strong young one of the group had offered to collect supplies while Antone made supplies and boarded up the holes in the wall.  Cveta and Zlata took turns cooking and bartering.  There seemed to be a glint of hope amidst the war.  That is...until Pavle didn't return one night.  We heard from the neighbors that he had been killed on his nightly supply run.  He was the best chance we had at gathering food and other things we needed.  He always took his gun with him, why the hell didn't he take it that night!?\n\nDepression set in amongst us as we decided who would go for supplies next.  Anton of course offered as he didn't want us to risk being in danger until things settled down.  Zlata insisted she go first because she didn't have any back problems, apparently she didn't have any problems killing a priest and his clergymen for food either...\n\nHer wounds were so deep, we barely kept her alive that night. Every last bandage we had was used on her and we were surprised that she lived through the night with the amount of blood that she lost.  Then she fell into a deep depression.

Great little game. Despite using the traditional 2D platform configuration as its base (I've really haven't enjoyed these types of games since I was a kid; when that was the only thing on offer). What attacted me to this game was the genre, base building, character management and art style-ALL FANTASTIC. But what I didn't expect was depth and its addictiveness.\n\nI would suggest trying a couple of runs before turning to the internet for tips. There are some really cool surprises and mechanics that are fun to learn without doing this. BUT, even if you've looked for tips and hints, there seems to be some behind the scenes mechanics at play to keep the game balanced even if you get off to a strong start (but not in unfair ways). This game will constantly throw curve balls at you; forcing you to take risks and make tough choices. Just when I thought I figured out how to get ahead via collecting resources, managing my survivors, and prioritizing what to build in my shelter...areas on the game map all of a sudden became unavailable because of rebel conflicts...slowing my progress to a halt and causing me to shift strategies. While in transition, I was forced to take some risks...and paid for it by losing a survivor. So, here I am on run 13...hoping to make it through this thing with no casualties (note: you don't have to restart because you lost one survivor. I may have even had another one show up at my shelter, but I like the challenge of trying to get out with everyone alive).\n\nThe more you play, the more you'll see how the game adapts to your strategy...always making it just difficult enough to stay challenging but not impossible to beat. In the end, you'll get a great gaming experience. Also, for you much better at this type of game than I am...the more you play, the more characters and scenarios open up for you to choose at the start of a new game. Each character has their strengths and weaknesses and the starting group dynamics are all different...along with number of characters in your starting group (from 1 to 4) and time of season (from summer to the dead of winter).  You can certainly get this when the price comes down, but for me, this was $20.00 well spent for such a supremely designed game.\n","February 9, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The hand drawn look of the game, creates a bleak looking visual interpretation of a war torn world where colour is devoid, as is the love for life for the protagonists. The player is set to make countless life or death decisions for a handful of people who need to be guided through a month or two of what seems to be a civil war in a fictional Eastern Europe style city.\n\nI don't normally play platform type games, especially ones that look like Snakes and Ladders but after only an hour or two of playing - I found my decision to purchase the game was completely worth while.\n\nYou can play this game quite easily with just the mouse and it is easy to pick up and play. It took me about 16 hours to finish the game and did so without any guides or cheats, nor did I watch any "Lets Play's" on YouTube, and in itself made the experience even more rewarding.\n\nThe story while not so deep (ie not very story rich) is still very moving, and one can easily become attached to the people you will be controlling.\n\nThe game on occasion reminded me of SIMS, in which you control a persons needs and had a small resemblence to tower defense games or something along the lines of Civilisation where you build, upgrade and defend a base.\n\nWhile playing the game, I did not encounter any bugs or crashes and the only issue I met was in terms of game play mechanics. I found that I really did not need to upgrade many househole items and instead I decided to hoard materials to trade for food or save stacks of items I could burn, ready for when winter came along.\n\nThe game could have lasted longer and had more story - and thus would have required me upgrading certain aspects of my base - but alas I did not need to as the game did not demand it. The game could have had a DLC with different story lines, such as maybe an alien invasion or a zombie apocalypse and of course I would not rule it out happening in the future, and I will be keenly watching an eye on developer news. This is a testament to the game's success, as I rarely keep an eye on specific developer releases once I have finished a game.\n\nAt the end of the day, this was a very addictive game - and easy to pick up and play. I was left with a bittersweet feeling when the game ended for me after 46 days. I was happy that I managed to *win* the game on my first try - but I was quite sad because my daily dose of war was over; Quite ironic if you think of it.\n\nI look forward to more games from this developer and hopefully an expansion to this game. I also think if this game allowed mods via the Steam workshop - the games content could be expanded by it's own players giving this game a much longer shelf time.\n\nI give this game a solid A+ or a 9/10. If you are unsure as to whether to purchase this game or not, trust me that you will not be disappointed.","January 11, 2015","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its a really unique experience, emotional and brutal.\n\nGameplay is split into two sections: day and night. During the day, your survivors are at home. You need to keep an eye on any negative status effects - when they're hungry, give them some food, if they're sick, give them medicine, bandage their wounds and make sure they sleep when tired. You can build equipment such as a stove to cook food, a workshop to craft tools and weapons, rain collectors and filters to get clean water, traps to catch small animals to eat, beds to sleep in, a furnace for heat. And you can craft valuable trade items like cigarettes and booze.\n\nDuring the night, you can select one survivor to scavenge local buildings for supplies, while the others either sleep, or guard your home from bandits. There are lots of areas to visit around the city, and you'll encounter some tricky situations. There are only a couple of completely abandoned areas where you're free to take everything without consequence. Sometimes friendly people will trade with you, but if you don't have anything valuable, would you steal from them instead? Would you murder innocents and take their stuff so your own people can survive? Some areas are occupied by dangerous bandits, who will attack you on sight - but if you're desperate, you might have to risk it.\n\nThe combat system, like the rest of the gameplay, is managed through a point and click interface. Left click to walk to a location, right click to run, left click icons to interact with an object or person. I found the combat to be very hard, but I think that is probably by design. Our survivors aren't trained soldiers, and powerful guns are rare and expensive. So far I've tried to avoid combat as much as possible. There's no reloading or respawning, so death is permanent.\n\nThere are several scenarios to play through, where you'll start with between one and four survivors, and sometimes another will ask to join your group. Even that can be a tough choice - an extra pair of hands can be useful but its another mouth to feed. Each survivor has their own story and some of them have a special skill. For example Katja can get better value in trades, Bruno spends less resources when cooking and Arica can sneak quietly.\n\nIts the kind of game where you'll generate your own stories. I thought my second attempt was looking good, until we got several days of snow. I couldn't keep the house warm enough, so Bruno froze to death overnight. Realising that every meal would cost me more resources, I started to take risks in the dangerous areas. Arica stealth killed two bandits but a third one shot her dead. Katja went to the same place the next night, figuring one more bandit would be easy enough. Turns out there was more than one and they shot her dead as well. Now alone, and very desperate, I had Pavle murder an old couple and steal all their food, but the next day he was depressed, wouldn't eat anything, and overnight he committed suicide. Game over. But its failures like that which made my next, successful run feel so good.\n\nTWOM is a fantastic game and I thoroughly recommend it as a full price purchase.","February 9, 2015","true","44.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This game has emotion, thrill and excitement. You make your own story. Your survival depends on the decisions you make. Will you kill someone just to survive or will you help everyone you see and thrive in hunger and sickness.\n\nIn war, it's hard to fight and defeat your enemies but what more if you're just a civilian? In this game, you play as a civilian with your group trying to survive in the midst of war. Resources are very scarce. You have to scavenge for food, meds, weapons, etc. in order to survive. You also have the option to make a trade/barter with other civilians or even with bandits, thugs and soldiers but beware that not all of them are trustworthy. Here are some awesome realistic things that I like:\n\nHighlights:\n+ Real Conscience is included - When you do a bad thing (hurting, killing), the whole group suffers a "Sad", "Depressed" or "Broken" state of emotions.\n+ When all hope is lost, you can control your characters to encourage the others that it's not the end.\n+ Suicide is also present in this game. (When all hope is lost.)\n+ When all of your characters have lost hope, they will be unable to move even if you order them.\n+ Your main goal is to survive until the war ends. (The date of the war's end is at random.)\n+ Make big decisions like would you help others outside your shelter for a night in exchange of downsizing your shelter's numbers. (You might get raided.)\n+ Realism - When you attack or do something bad in a certain area with a character, they don't forget what you did. If you say, kill someone at the hospital area. If you return there, the soldiers will immeadiately shoot at you once they see you.\n+  When one of your characters is severely wounded, your character moves very slow and rests while moving from time to time.\n+ When one of your characters is ill/sick, they can recover by just staying in bed.\n\nUpdate Features:\n+ You get to choose your starting group or gamble it all with a random group.\n+ When starting a new game with a certain group, not all maps are the same. I'm not sure but I think there are 3 different maps in the game.\n+ Depending on the group you choose, your shelter will be different. It can be the original big house with a lot of fixing to do and there's also another one which does not need any fixing at all.\n+ Each group combination has now there own backstory as to how they got together.\n+ You can now make your own story with the new level editor. You can create your own characters from the templates provided, choose their backstory, select which places will be available for the story, set how long and how dreadful the winter is and finally, choose how many characters will you have in the group.\n\nNOTE: I already finished the whole game before the update features were added. The new features were meant to increase the game's replayability.\n\nThere's not much room for mercy. It's either you survive for another day or you die. Remember that in this world, there are no right choices but to survive.","November 16, 2014","true","39.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Pick this game up if you are looking for a fun game where you must scavenge at night and during the day craft and build things!\n\nSometimes I had to steal supplies from two old folks. Why would I do this you ask? Well in this game I had a full house of very hungry people and an injured and sick person! I needed them medical supplies and that food! Decisions... Decisions.....

In itself you find yourself feeling things you never thought you would feel while playing a game, and balancing those feelings with the sort of life changing actions you have/choose to make.\n\nPlaying as a survivor during a war struggling to survive from starvation, illness, wounds, other survivors, and the military, rather then a automatic weapon wielding one man army sent to slaughter hundreds of enemies in the name of your country/organization/religion/whatever. And its that sort of thinking outside the box with how most games are being done now that makes this game a true piece of art.\n\nThe combat is unforgiving, just as it should be. If you choose to engage in some kind of combat you had better be prepared to really think about how you are going to take on the obstacles in front of you. Its easy to get wounded, get chased off, or even die if you are not careful.\n\nScavenging during the night also plays its role, having to balance what is necessary with what isn't. Planning for the future winter by stocking up on canned goods and firewood. Getting the tools and materials needed to truly secure your home, and fix it up with facilities to keep your survivors both happy and alive. Mix in a little trading and you really need to look at all your looting options. Do you take the can of food? Do you really need it? Or is the pile of wood a better choice? Sometimes you will find yourself really balancing it out to because missing some key pieces when your survivors are either hungry, cold, or depressed can really change how the next few days play out.\n\nThe music is utterly amazing. Its simple, quiet, and really sets the mood properly with the artistic style the game is designed in. There are times I just left the game on pause while I do some house work, to have that nice ambiance.\n\nMy advice, play the game as if you were one of the survivors, don't think of yourself as a player/god controlling these people. When you do that you really start to care about your survivors, what their stories are, and what sort of things they are having to do, let alone what actions you take and how it will effect them.\n\nAll in all this game stands out for one main reason. It has a soul. It doesn't need those million dollar CG trailers, seizure inducing lens flares spammed across the screen, sharks with freakin laser beams, Press X to feel aspects that all the recent triple A games have. Its just a well done game with a soul, and as a gamer what more could you ask for?","March 19, 2015","true","122.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If not, then I guess don't play this game. But you would be missing out, because you don't see games like this very often at all.\n\nMy closest comparison to this game would be Spec Ops: The Line because both take you into very dark places and when you finish it you are more likely to feel exhausted than jubilant. Unlike Spec Ops however, This War of Mine has no set storyline to follow. None of the countless horrible events you can come across in this game are guaranteed to happen for you, and everything you do in this game is entirely your choice. So in that regard it is a step up from that lovely adventure into a sand-storm ravaged Dubai. Because in this game, when you decide to have your characters do something horrible, it was your choice. Nothing forced you to do that. And you (or rather, your band of survivors) have to live with that.\n\nThis game is about as unpleasant as it gets, and yet despite that this game was necessary since it shows the often forgotten side of war: the civilians whose hometown ends up becoming a battlefield. I can't say you will have fun (you probably won't, even if the gameplay is quite good), but I can say that it will be an experience you will think about for quite sometime.\n\nEnjoy being plunged into a world of despair and desperation.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tenryuu-Chan/recommended/282070/","Tenryuu-Chan","Sakuragi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tenryuu-Chan/","70 products in account","After playing this game for many hours, I must say, this game is good. It shows a side of war that not many games show. Sure Spec Ops: The Line showed the effects of war and decisions for soldiers but this game focuses on the citizens, the people who didn't want and deserve to be in the war. Many don''t focus on that cause people prefer action. So I will just say the pro's and con's\n\nPro's:\n\n1. Click adventure. The controls are very simple. It only needs mouse interactions and it is quite simple to understand what the icons in the game mean.\n\n2. Character stories. There are about 8 preset characters, each with their own story on life and how the war has changed them. It is very interesting to learn about each character and the hardships they went through cause of the effects of war.\n\n3. Politics through the perspective of those in the warzone. Most people don't feel as much about the government when talking about war because it is usually something people don't like to talk about but in This War of Mine, when you listen in on the radio about the politics happening, you want to get up and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of the government for what they are doing. There are many examples like how the government postpones a peacemaking group from entering the town another 2-3 weeks or when the soldiers from the government commit atrocities against the citizens. Each bit of news makes you feel more about what life is like as a citizen in a warzone.\n\n4. The harsh environment. This isn't a picnic in the middle of the meddow, this is war and it is never pretty. Bandits try to raid your home, even scared innocent citizens try to raid you just to live another day. I shows the truth and ugly side of the war that no one wants to know.\n\n5. Permenant death. Your characters will die. If you don't take good care of your folk, it will cause problems to you and your other survivors. This makes you want survivors to live.\n\n6. Choices. This game has some hard choices. There is no moral ground in war, there is only survival and this game has it in spades. Sure stealing from people is wrong but sometimes, you must put aside all morals and do what is best for your people. I had to steal from many innocents that didn't deserve it and will die cause of me but it is either me or them and I would much rather look after my own people rather than worry about others. There are also people who visit your safehouse asking for help like medicine, food, or just require one of your folk to help them. It is up to you if you are willing to give up all your medicine for a mother who is dying.\n\n7. Morale. Your characters are not soldiers, they are just people. Because of that, they are not as hardened as soldiers in the field of battle. As such, when someone dies, your survivors will become depressed, broken even. Even stealing, killing innocents, and denying request will affect your survivors. If someone is broken and beyond depressed, they will kill themself from such depression. This makes players watch and value each character even more.\n\n8. Scenarios. This game can give you a random scenario with pre-set items and characters. You can start in the winter or summer and sometimes you can get either 1-4 survivors in your party to start. Although this is a RNG dice roll, doesn't mean it gives a challenge. Personally, I like a challenge and I would accept it, for others though, this is a hit or miss with others. There is also scenarios during the time when you are surviving like when bandit run wild or when the market for trading changes prices with certain items.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Click adventure. As simple as the game is, it has its problems. For those who have played action games will not find much enjoyment from this game cause of how simple the game controls are. Simple controls leads to boring and repetitive gameplay.\n\n2. Difficulty. The first couple of games will be hard but once you understand the game concept and how it works, I never lost a single person. The game becomes too easy and becomes bland as time passes. If there were difficulty setting and options, then this game would be more fun.\n\n3. Save. This game has no manual save, it only has auto save and it only auto saves at the end of a day. A manual save function would be good. There is also no muliple save files, there is only one. Although this seems a bit questionable, this is a minor con.\n\n4. Combat. There really isn't much combat and when there is, it is just "click the dude and hope you win." Each character has traits so some characters can defeat a person better than others will but the combat is quite RNG like. If you dont have a combat expert and you are spotted, you better pray to god that the dice rolls in your favor.\n\n5. Guns. Guns in this game are largely pointless to use when scavenging. They cause loud noises and can barely kill anyone. Mostly because bandits and soldiers have armor so melee is the much better option when scavenging. The only use for guns is to defend your safehouse from raids but that is all they are valued for, other than trading.\n\nEven with these problems, it still doesn't mean it's a bad game. The game is strong and it is a nice change after seeing Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and more. It may not be as good and as entertaining to some but for those who enjoy a challenge and a change in pace for war times, this game is up your alley. My only gripe is when the game adds a difficulty setting and option and a infinite mode where the war last forever and try see how long will you survive until you meet your demise. For the difficulty setting, I want a option that turns of trading because in the later or mid-game, you can really never die or lose since a trader visits you every so often and there are areas that have trading spots, more specifically the Central Junction, where it is a trading mecha. It is cool to see a community create a trading center during war times but it becomes too easy with the amount of items they sell. You can essencially live on forever. If there is a option that turns off trading, I would gladly turn it on for the rest of my playtime.\n\nOverall: 7.5/10","December 5, 2014","true","146.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This War of Mine is a side-scrolling point and click game. You start out with three survivors,each with a story. You'll continue to unlock stories from each survivor's past as you progress through the game and you will also be able to recruit a fourth survivor later on in the game. So far, I've only seen two different sets of survivors. Sometimes you'll start out in a broken down house in the winter. Sometimes you'll start out in the same broken down house in the spring. The items that you find in the house are never the same. In this game, you're expected to fulfill the needs of the group of survivors that you control and scavenge for materials,food,medicine and weapons. During the night, you have the option to stay in your house(Which no one ever does unless if they're fully stocked somehow. @.@) or you can pick one survivor from your group to scavenge.You'll be playing that survivor during scavenger mode. Each building has a different lay out and some surprise events might be triggered when you enter the building. You have the option to kill whoever you meet and then rob them of their things OR you can play as the nice guy who just moves around and scavenges through rubble(Good luck with that).During the day time you have the option to upgrade your house that your group of survivors are living in,cook,craft items,barter with other survivors if they come to your house or help with special events that happen from time to time.\nFor a game made by an indie company,game's playable and I found no bugs in it(I'm looking at you Ubisoft).You're not in the shoes of an elite one man army killing machine(Well maybe except for the stealth kills in scavenger mode). You're in the shoes of survivors that aren't unstoppable. It's one of the very games that we needed and a game that I haven't seen in a long time.\n\nOverall this game is amazing I'd say 9/10.

I expect the game to have much new-found interest in it after this change and to be even more enjoyable.\n\nDamn good.","October 16, 2015","true","87.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Taken as a pure game, it's nothing fancy, and arguably resembles a mobile game in just how simple it is to play. But with its rich sound and stark visuals, it really deserves to be played on a full monitor. Like many indie games, it doesn't set out to be a fun and addicting game, but rather to create an experience and make you feel "there". It does this very well, with a sense of overarching dread and impending doom made worse by every little mistake. You never quite have enough food, or if you do, enough medicine, or supplies, whatever. No playthrough will ever be perfect and you'll be left to decide just what you can afford to sacrifice.\n\nCombat is something you're generally supposed to avoid, though that's no excuse for how awkward is actually is. Seeing as the game autosaves whenever you do much of anything, you may end up losing a survivor to the strange mechanics, which is a frustrating experience. Other than that though, this is a bleak and depressing survival sim that's nonetheless very enjoyable to play even though it left me feeling pretty devastated. Most importantly, it portrays a situation that's all too real in the world, and is very good at inspiring empathy in the player that may well translate to real life. That the only DLC is a donation directly to children affected by war just reinforces the solid intentions of the developers.","September 18, 2015","true","45.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Finally picked it up and must say was better than i initially expected. Quirky elements of stealth and resource management coupled with a decision making system that effects the games outcome as well as the individuals lives u supervise over. Save a life at the risk of doing something moraly wrong to survive or do u prioritise personal survivial over the lives of others.  Be wary though as if you take on too many mouths to feed it may start to fall apart quicker than you think.\n\nA interesting new take on a subject matter that effects many people on a day to day basis, as well as being a rewarding game to play. Challenge yourself to save as many lives as u can and hold out till the war can eventually end? Also contains an neat little crafting system so gather resources to make your hideout more comfortable and heated for the cold winters and stop despair from setting in by fending off other looters.\n\nI would recommend this title simply because its a little bit different and each playthru will be different due to randomly generated items and scenarios meaning some of the more predictable elements in other games are not necessarily found in this one.","May 12, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I do like the fact that you can easily lose your survivors if you get too risky and try to rambo through the city. I think that really gives a sense of being an average person trapped in a civil war.

These hollow words echoed throughout the empty house; Bruno was alone. After numorous days without having even raw meat to fill their empty bellies, Pavle and Marko left to scavenge. On the first night, Pavle was trying to avoid detection, but tripped. With a crash that seemed to resound for hours, while in reality was naught but a few seconds, he sat terrified, thinking about what those who occupied this homestead would do to him. Upon his discovery he couldn't fight, for he had no weapon, so he layed and cried whilst they beat the life from his broken body. Marko couldn't take not having closure, so he made way for Pavles location with a crowbar, he found them, eating Pavle, and went to work. Before being brought down himself he managed to kill two of the three  newly made cannibals. Bruno solemnly looked out, waiting for one of his comrades and friends to make the return trip, and was dissapointed. Roughly a week later, after nearly ten days of little food and absolutely no contact with life, the one remaining member of the party that killed his friends raided his bombed out home. Marko had a weapon, in the form of a crowbar, and killed the girl, though being injured in the process. He couldn't work; the blood of the young, starving girl on his hands was too much to bear, and the next morning the sun rose and shone on his hanged corpse. This is the end of their story.","November 20, 2014","true","19.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Always wanted to have clinical depression? Then this game is just for you!\n\nSeriously though, this game is surprisingly good. For one, it's a survival game that isn't about zombie outbreaks, nor do you play as super soldiers; you control a group of survivors in a war torn area that has been torn apart by war. The whole idea of juggling responsiblities between your group of survivors such as scavenging, guarding your home or sleeping is really well handled and creates a challenge while making you think about your choices. For example, you're running low on food, so send someone out seems the best idea. But, one of your guys is wounded from a recent attack, and your other guy is sick, so leaving them behind to guard the shelter may not end well, but you still need the food or else they'll be hungry for a couple of days. It's all about balance. The only problem I have with it so far is the questionable replay value.\n\nI would seriously recommend this game to anyone, just don't play it when you need cheering up, there's some heavy stuff here.","November 17, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can obtain them by scavening, stealing, bartering or even armed robbery. And often you come to harsh moral dillemas; these people have the medicine my people need. They won't trade. Will I rob them of it?\n\nThe resources are either materials you can use to craft new stuff / reinforce your shelter, or consumables (food, clean water, ammo, cgiarettes etc)\n\nYou never find enough to do everything so you often have to choose. Will I reinforce the shelter so that it's harder to rob us? Or will I use the resources to build an additional bed, so that 2 people can sleep in the same time? Or maybe I should build an additional alcohol still and make more moonshine for trade?\n\nThe depressing, grayosh graphics work very good and help create a great sad, blank, holepeless mood - just what you need to get a glimpse of how ♥♥♥♥ed up war is (in the same time the gameplay is engaging enough to sort of ballance the depressive mood). It is not as dark and touching as Papers, Please or Walking Dead, but it is still an awesome game.\n\nI kinda miss 2 things in the game:\n\n- More story mode would be great. If you could have 1 main hero who also idk looks for someone who might be somewhere among the survivors or tries to escape or whatever else I suppose it would allow for more immersion;\n- Character development would be nice ( I mean if my dude build several structures he would become proficient in post apocalyptic construction work. In the same time the dude that spend most his time sneaking and looking for resources to scavenge would become much better at that, no?)\n\nAltogether it's an awesome game.

It's so different compared to all the mainstream survival nowadays. First of all, loot and storage system, unlike other survival games where you will only find it hard to survive the first few days and then after continous looting, you will be fine for the rest of the game. This game however will cause you to really strategies how you are going to manage your resources as you will be running low on everything from the start of the game until the end. The game is hard to play at first but after you get used to the mechanics, it should get easier but it's still gonna be harder than mainstream survival games (Took me few restarts to finally get used to the game as I don't want to lose any survivors throughout the playthrough). Each survivor has unique abilities which makes the game more fun as it gives you the choice to choose which type of survivors you'd like to play with through out the playthrough.","December 5, 2015","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

It's sad, and sometimes you feel the pain of being hopeless hits you straight in the head from your computer screen. Although the gameplay may be a little repetitive, it's hard to leave this filthy in-game world. I started playing at 9 pm, the game crashed at 2:30 am and I decided to check if my progress was saved... turned off my PC three hours later. I felt proud when I upgraded my stove, then I felt guilty for killing an innocent man just to get food. And when the war was over, I felt relieved, but also hungry for more (no matter how cruel this sounds because of the main topic of this game). So it goes, as one wise man once said.\n\nAs I mentioned before, sometimes the game crashes, so some fixes are needed. Also the characters' movement is glitchy from time to time, especially when someone's running after you. I didn't really notice any other problems; TWoM looks good and its sketchy backgrounds are nicely done. I also think the music fits the gameplay perfectly.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique war experience, so different from what we, gamers, are used to - don't hesitate. In my opinion, this one-of-a-kind game is worth it. And don't forget to buy the DLC as that's the way they should be done.\n\nDobra robota, chłopaki.","June 13, 2015","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Typical morning coffee and donut on the way to the bottomless pit of work. Texting the wife to see how her day is moving along. Trying not to fall asleep to the droning voice of my mouth-breathing boss. The petty checking of emails we pretend make us important to society... It was all just a mind-numbing, typical day...\nThen the sirens started.\nIn the distance I could hear the bombs detonating across the city. I myself was amongst the masses of the paniced city, each of us struggling to get past one another in a feudal attempt to find our families. Each street blurred in my vision as I sprinted ever faster to try and reach home. I could already see the looting beginning out of the corner of my eyes. I seen mothers with children getting trampled. Fathers shot trying to pick their families back up again. I wondered of my own family. I hadn't been a faithful man, but I was praying this day. Inside I knew, there was no home left. There was no wife. There was no daughter. All I could have truly prayed for... was the bombs hit them before the looters made their way.\n\nIt's now been a week since this war began. I couldn't even tell you why it started, or even who started it. All I see are uniforms; be it the soldiers of a standing army or the gangs of looters, even a trader that stops by my three story pile of ♥♥♥♥ we call home. Well, the three of us; Our ♥♥♥♥-heap we call home.\n\nIt took a few nights of scavenging to get us situated. I can only carry so much in one backpack. You can't expect much when you have to stay to the shadows to avoid getting shot down by a sniper. There's no doc to pry a bullet from me, and I can't say I trust this 'good cook' of ours to remove it either. The real problem though began only yesterday...\n\nMany of the places we had decided to send me had been cut off due to heavy fighting. What was left had already been picked clean in previous nights to help us get this shanty up and running. We needed materials for weapons, food, workbenches, stoves, anti-biotics - you name it, we need it. With most of it done, it was now just a matter of keeping food and water on the table. Since our trader friend failed to show for the last two days, the fighting restricted where I could go, and our traps had been barren of any rats; we were left with one option...\n\nThe ruined house was nice, for what it's worth in this war-torn time. I was peering through the keyhole and looking at the couple and their son moving inside their home. They weren't leaving the main room, and there was no other way in. I barged through the door, and started sifting through as much as I could. I knew I had to push past them and make it to their food supply, likely in the kitchen (old habits die hard I learned). The son was of a different mind... I couldn't fault him, we all would have done the same. I can still here the click of my pistols trigger as two bullets released into the misty night air. The echo of gunfire stinging my ears from being fired indoors... The dark despair and pain settling on the parents eyes. I wondered if this is how my daughter laid before my wife. Reaching out for mommy to help her... Mommy knowing she couldn't, and our daughter just...\n\nI swallowed the bile rising in my throat. It was the first man I ever killed. I always saw it in the games and the movies... but this was different. He didn't scream. He didn't cry out... He just tried to reach for his parents with his shakey hand while his breathing slowly gave way. I couldn't bear to watch the scene any longer, and decided it was best to move in for the food and leave before dawn came. So I did. I took the last of their food, which was hardly more than five meals for my three friends and I. I charged out of the house as quickly as I could. I heard the father whispering under his breath... "Kill me...please" as I pushed back outside.\n\nI killed a man... I killed a family... so we could all live for one more morning. My crew was thankful... but I wasn't. They weren't there to witness what I had to do for the meals... They didn't see the eyes of the hopeless. They just saw their next meal, their life being extended for another day or two... I can't ever forget what I saw; I saw this war of mine become more of a reality. I saw how a desperate man places more value on his life, his companions lives, than anothers...  I saw the barrel of my .45\n\n10/10 Wouldn't know if I could steal from them again.","June 13, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The choices you have to make to ensure your rag-tag group of survives lives just to see another day. But that just makes me want to play it even more so. Why? Rather than your typical, "Choice A is bad, choice B is good" scenario that most games present you, This War of Mine makes every scenario a moral grey area. Will you survive the honest way, trading and bartering goods between your neighbors, but putting extra pressure on your survivors to make sure they scavenge supplies or else risk trading away their own? Or do you decide to resort to thievery and even murder to get what you need, but in the process risk not only your survivors' physical health, but their mental well-being as well.\n\nTruly a game that everyone should play at least once to experience the feeling of trying to keep a group of people together under extremely stessful circumstances, This War of Mine does an excellent job of providing a feeling of loss, hopelessness, and utter despair, yet at the same time, can provide a sense of accomplishment and camraderie that is hard to find in a lot of current games.","July 14, 2015","true","28.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psycho8gamer/recommended/282070/","psycho8gamer","Psycho8Vegemite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psycho8gamer/","72 products in account","In this review I'll be covering the story, objectives and tone of this great game.\n\nStory\nYou emerge as a citizen, trapped inside an abandoned home that you now know as safety, along with two or three other people; you've been stuck between war zones where survival and horror cross fade. You are not a soldier and therefore just a survivor. Searching ruble left behind by shelling finding few scraps of food and items. You find cloth to bandage your friends wounds in and antibiotics to help your sickness. You find little useful materials and components to build with, but is enough for a simple hotplate and a makeshift bed to rest bloodied limbs on. You know you can't survive with what you have, you know you need more supplies, but you also know you can't just walk outside with snipers lurking. You wait for night, where you'll travel for supplies in an effort for not just yourself, but the survival of your comrades as well. Risking everything you know you'll have to choose between life or death, starvation or robbery and kindness or murder. There is no choices, only decisions.\n\nObjectives\nYou play as one or more survivors at once, controlling their separate thoughts and decisions. 'This War of Mine' plays like 'The Sims' in a dark horrible way. In order to eat out of your fridge, you must either scavenge for food, steal for it or kill for it. Sometimes you have a choice, others you don't. This game is all about choosing between ultimately life or death.\nDuring the day you play as all the characters working towards fixing, improving your safety and health. You need to eat, drink (is automatic), sleep, heal and improvise along with catering to character specific needs such as smoking or drinking coffee. Sometimes you have people during the day that try to trade with you, where you can use your found items to trade with theirs for things you need. Other times you have people whom seek help, medical or physical; good or bad. Once nightfall reaches you have two choices, to stay, or scavenge; by choosing what each persons role for the night is. After this, it's your time to shine, you can scavenge, steal or kill for things such as food, materials, supplies and items.\nThe games pace is repetitive, but the shear pain and suffering to see your characters go through is what compels you to continue, to see hope or a light. Once you come home you can talk to others about your findings, reassure them that you'll survive, offer them food or medical attention. Once you have your resources, it is yours to use it wisely. Just remember, that you're not alone, your death is likely likewise having your own safety attacked and looted from. This game is all about survival, and it shows just that in all the most brutal ways possible during war...\n\nTone and Emotions\nYou as the player, will feel the pain and suffering your characters go through. Murdering people feels bad and so does robbing people of their supplies. When your characters feel bad whether its from woundings or from being depressed. You'll feel it with them. 'This War of Mine] is a harsh game in all ways, and there is no running from it. When a character leaves due to how they feel, or when a character dies because you couldn't do enough; you feel the weight on your shoulders, the sadness and emotions of the other occupants you still have to survive for. This games takes your point of view about war into a whole new perspective, and it is harsh.\n\nPros and Cons\nOverall I think that this is a genuinly great game, it has been a long time where just the gameplay makes me sad or that I feel bad stealing or killing others. Certainly deserves a close look. This concludes my review, I may visit this again if I have things to add.            Pros        Cons                    Immersive experience\nBrutally honest war\nCharacter emotions are in depth\nScavenging and robbing is great\nStealth is spot on\nInventory system is great\nBuilding and upgrading system is spectacular\nCharacter management is beautiful\nStoryline is great\nMechanics overall are pleasing\nMusic and ambiance is nicely fitting\nGraphics are really nice            Wish there were sidescroller controls such as WSAD or arrow keys\nHaving muti-people scavenging isn't implemented where honestly I would love it\nThere is no Co-op which would fit really nice with this game\nIs repetitive but nice if you understand the story well\nNot too many things to build, wish there were things like pool tables or having tables to eat at.\nJust more objects and items to build in general.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linuxastronaut/recommended/282070/","linuxastronaut","LinuxAstronaut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linuxastronaut/","119 products in account","Oh my, where to begin?\n\nThis War of Mine places your small group of survivors in a run down building for the duration of a war that's taking place as a setting in the background. You and your companions are victims of circumstance and don't actually affect the outcome of the war or take part in it, you're merely trying to survive. The game frequently asks you to make difficult decisions in order to survive. To what lengths will you go to keep yourself and your friends alive?\n\nThis War of Mine is a bleak game and very moody. If I had to boil the game down to a gameplay description, I'd say that This War of Mine is a resource and risk management game with survival and stealth elements, base building, worker placement, and heavy theme; but it's so much more than that. Every decision you make comes at a cost. Everything you build costs resources and your nightly scavenging excursions can only bring back so much. Do you build a bed for everyone, or do you hot rack and sleep in shifts? Should you trade your medicine since it's worth a LOT, or do you give it to Katia, who is developing a cold that may get worse?\n\nI knew this game had a hold on me the very first time I played it. Winter had set in by about day 30 or so and food had become even more scarce. We had resorted to trapping rats in our patched up house for a meager amount of meat every few days if we were lucky. Pavel, our best and agile scavenger, had been nearly killed while looking for supplies and it made the rest of us sad and scared. We had come to rely on him for bringing back what we needed every night.\n\nThis War of Mine starts with a random group of 3-4 survivors (randomized each time you start the game anew) each with different skills and potentially different vices as well. Some of the skills I have seen so far include 'good cook,' 'trained in combat,' and 'runs faster.' Some skills seem more useful than others and some I haven't found a use for yet (if there is one). The vices I have seen so far include 'coffee drinker' and 'smoker.' The vices affect a survivor's mood. This makes each playthrough different and challenging because you might end up with a very difficult spread of skills and vices to manage. The game also starts in a random season (hopefully not winter, good luck with that).\n\nThere is no handholding in This War of Mine, nor is there a tutorial. That said, I never felt like I needed one. The UI in TWoM is simple and effective, elegant even. You always know what you can interact with and how. There is a great deal of trial and error here, in a good way.\n\nThe game is separated into two phases, the day and the night cycle. During the day, you basically assign tasks to your survivors in real time (and the clock is running during this phase, but I wouldn't say you feel rushed by it; I've always had enough time to complete the goals I set). Maybe you want to build a still to produce liquor for trading (or consuming), or build a bed so you don't have to sleep on the floor. You'll do this in the day phase. Also during the day phase, a traveling trader might stop by to barter with you or a neighbor might come asking for help. You can choose to help or ignore these people. Sometimes people will show up asking to join your group. These are decisions you must weigh carefully, as they will be one more mouth to feed, one more person getting sick that needs medicine, etc. But they might also bring something valuable to the table, that is up to you to determine.\n\nYou can build a lot of different things in your shelter and everything you can build can also be upgraded with very few exceptions. Some of the things you can build include rainwater collectors, a radio (that works), a still, an herbal workshop for rolling cigarettes (to feed vices and also to trade), a metalworking table for making weapons and tools, and lots of other things.\n\nWhen night falls, you are tasked with deciding who gets to sleep (and where), who should stand guard (if anyone), and who will go out to scavenge for supplies (and where). Other survivors can raid your shelter, so if no one stands guard, there's a good chance they will steal some of your things and this should be avoided at all costs as they can run off with a LOT of stuff if given the chance. Even if you have guards, there's always the chance they can be wounded in these raids. When you decide where to scavenge, you're given a set of locations to choose from, each with a description of what you might encounter there so you can come prepared. A bombed out school may indicate you should probably bring a shovel to dig through rubble piles more effectively. A military outpost may have goods for trade, or they may shoot on sight. There's always a risk everywhere you go. Available locations change over time, as well, with new locations opening up, and some closing due to the war or inclement weather. As far as I can tell, these are heavily randomized for the most part as well.\n\nThere is combat in the game, including stealth kills and a cover system that I have not experimented with too much yet as I try to avoid combat as much as possible (it's super deadly). Most tools can be used as weapons (crowbars, shovels, axes) and you can also find and repair firearms or trade for them occasionally, but ammunition is rare (but can also be crafted with the right facilities and components). Again though, what are you going to give up to be able to craft your own guns? Heat in the winter? A safe place to sleep?\n\nI can't say enough good things about this game. It runs super smooth on my Linux computer and it hasn't crashed on me once. Top notch Linux port from War Child, I'm very impressed!\n\nI paid 16,14€ for this game during Steam's Winter Sales and feel that you'll get your money's worth out of it. I've been playing it for almost 30 hours so far and I haven't grown bored of it yet.","December 27, 2014","true","91.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although it is mostly skill that gets you through combative encounters, enough can go wrong with little mistake on your part to cause severe problems for you (such as a good character who is severely injured or killed).\n\nThere's enough meat to this game for you to want to read about the other characters and try to figure out which ones make for the best teams.\n\nThe save system is a bit brutal as it auto saves. So it's hard to run through the game correcting small mistakes with reloading. Instead, your small mistakes become game-long woes that you have to add to your list of problems you have to overcome.\n\nThere's also some strategy in the way you trade resources. For example, there's a vendor that sometimes shows up at your house and he is excellent to buy bulky but inexpensive construction materials from so you can save your scavenging inventory space for better things.\n\nThere is some variation in the levels you get and how they are initially set up. Some areas have guards placed in slightly different arrangements so that in one playthrough getting all the loot at some outpost is much easier than in another playthrough, but it is slight and not all zones have it (and typically they just have an either or setup and it isn't elabourate). It's a shame they didn't make more use of that mechanic.\n\nOne big con I had was, SPOILER ALERT, no bad guys ever came to your door. You would think since you're in the middle of a war that the invading army might show up at your place and like extort food or something from you or you'd have to fight in your own home to defend it or whatever. Kind of a shame since it would be cool to have the ability to plan out and build your defenses.\n\nThe game isn't very long and there's not a whole heck of a lot of replay to this game even though that seems odd considering it's a rogue like. But there's just a lot of boilerplate crap you need to get through in the beginning of a new game and things don't really heat up until quite a bit later...and then it's just one little mistake and you screw up your entire game and it autosaves and you throw your hands up and quit.\n\nThat's actually a pretty bad thing about the game. I mean, the sound and artwork is great for its theme. I'm so happy that this isn't about zombies even though it literally perfectly fits for that theme. I would love to see more skills and mechanics put into the game  and more interesting levels with more complicated puzzles or plots or character interactions bartering etc.\n\nThe somewhat variable time limit of the game is nice to keep things balanced, but it would be nice if I could just continue playing in a sandboxy mode or something. I don't know. I guess what I'm saying is I wish there was more...which usually means the game is worth a thumbs up, despite it's problems.\n","September 11, 2015","true","28.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game really tugs on the heart strings and every choice you make plays on the characters morale and mindset.  Do I help the old couple with meds or raid their things so I can survive?  Do I help the girl in the supermarket and risk being injured or dying myself?  These are a few of the challenges you will run into as you try to survive the war.

Dont be fooled into thinking every play through will be 'completely' different. There are approx 20 different locations you can scavenge and they always look the same. They have the same layout, cabinets etc are always in the same place. Only the contents vary somewhat (a cabinet may hold food and wood in one play and parts and wood in another). As to what will happen when you go there: every location has one of two possible events/scenarios at that location. Pretty barebones with the random element if you ask me...\n\nAlso survivors - There are basically 5 main survivors you can control, but they are always the same and have the same strengths/weaknesses every time.\n\nOverall content - There just isnt enough that you can craft, harvest or build. Not by a long shot. No matter what 'random' scenario you have in your game you will always end up visiting the same locations in roughly the same order (by order of threat) and always building and upgrading the minimal amount of upgrades in roughly the same order of priority.\n\nDespite the poor amount of overall content and procedural randomness I would still recommend this game (during a sale) as it shines when it comes down to gameplay and emotional attachment of characters. Some decisions you make can really weigh on your mind haha.\n\nI havent really browsed the workshop as yet but this is one of those games that is very much worth playing, but could have been truly outstanding if it just had 'more'.","December 30, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It won't make you feel any better.\nThis is a game that will make you suffer for you every decision being it 'good' or 'bad'. There are no medals, there is no honor, only civilians crying for help. You must scavenge for surviving but eventually you'll be forced to go into dangerous territory and maybe you'll have to choose to kill or die... just remember: you are not a born killer. You will get depressed and even be a completely broken person that just can't do anything else. Your mind just crack out of depression and leading you to maybe even worse...\nThis is a point an click game where you'll have to survive in any possible way for an unkown time. You never know when the war will end and it will feel like forever. The combat is really simple wich does not means by anyway that you will succeed on your engagements, on the contrary. You might have to steal, maybe even threaten innocent people or watch hopelessly while a soldier forces a mother to do him a "service".

Rather than another FPS or something similar, this takes you into the lives of the people caught in the middle of hell. People who have to fight and scavenge off others who are just as poorly off, to survive a little while longer and perhaps make it through the war.\n\nAs I started playing, I thought by the looks of it, it isn't something I can hugely immerse myself into. How wrong I was.\nOn my second scavenging night, the paranoia of being caught, the anxiety of time not being on your side and the stress of needing to find as much stuff as possible to not have wasted a night is insane. By this time, I already was so drawn in that I felt connected with the group I had managed to keep alive for nearly 10 days, their light just barely alive. A while after, a person in my group, Bruno, died from severe wounds after we were robbed by force. The other two, were too broken to even move because they could no longer take it..\n\nWith no one left around to console them, it was over, I was done for. I had failed to keep my group alive, their regret of my choice to steal from other survivors breaking them further was too much.\n\nThis game, makes you question everything, and opens your eyes to the real hardships and horrors of war. War is a terrible, terrible thing in of itself, and this captures every piece of what it's like to be a poor survivor stuck in the middle perfectly. This war of mine is a tragic masterpiece and a horrible bit of art in every meaning of the word.\n\nI cannot send enough praise to the developers way for capturing this so well.","June 26, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every action you decide to make will affect the survivors you are either given (if you play a developer-created story), or choose (if you play a custom story).  You are forced to make life-or-death deisions driven by your conscience constantly.  If you decide to kill, not only will your characters enter a time of depression, you (a general statement, those of you 'hardnuts' out there won't) will feel it too.\n\nGripping, emotional, borderline addictive.","June 19, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The choices you have to make to ensure your rag-tag group of survives lives just to see another day. But that just makes me want to play it even more so. Why? Rather than your typical, "Choice A is bad, choice B is good" scenario that most games present you, This War of Mine makes every scenario a moral grey area. Will you survive the honest way, trading and bartering goods between your neighbors, but putting extra pressure on your survivors to make sure they scavenge supplies or else risk trading away their own? Or do you decide to resort to thievery and even murder to get what you need, but in the process risk not only your survivors' physical health, but their mental well-being as well.\n\nTruly a game that everyone should play at least once to experience the feeling of trying to keep a group of people together under extremely stessful circumstances, This War of Mine does an excellent job of providing a feeling of loss, hopelessness, and utter despair, yet at the same time, can provide a sense of accomplishment and camraderie that is hard to find in a lot of current games.","July 14, 2015","true","28.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Every single time I play, I go through every single emotion imaginable. The way individual events play with your heart and how each character has their own storyline and what makes it even better is that at the end, it's not an immediate cut off; you're told what happens to them after the ceasefire. This game is one of the most dramatic, exciting and heart wrenching games on the market and is worth every penny.\n\nNot only that, there's an additional DLC that you can buy which adds artwork to the game and the money goes to charity (you can also decide how much you spend, to a certain extent).\n\nHowever, there are a few things that I would like to see improved in the future as I believe it was touched on but not competely developed. Each character has a certain personality, explained in their biography. When certain events happen, their biography is updated with how they feel about the situation that happened, for example, if you choose to kill an NPC for supplies, some don't care while others actually do. What bothers me is that even though certain characters aren't affected by these, they still become sad, depressed and broken, leaving them completely useless. I would expect a character that actually understands the concept of self defense and the fact that sometimes we must kill for supplies and even says that they understand it, to not become so depressed. Another thing is during the day, sometimes there are events in which a survivor has the choice to leave the base and help an NPC out. It would be nice to add another choice to go with them, perhaps for an extra reward where you can physically help them out, such as clearing rubble, fixing up a base, healing people etc. (You could see it as a minigame during the day).\n\nAll in all, I really recommend this game and I believe there is also room for improvement.

Taken as a pure game, it's nothing fancy, and arguably resembles a mobile game in just how simple it is to play. But with its rich sound and stark visuals, it really deserves to be played on a full monitor. Like many indie games, it doesn't set out to be a fun and addicting game, but rather to create an experience and make you feel "there". It does this very well, with a sense of overarching dread and impending doom made worse by every little mistake. You never quite have enough food, or if you do, enough medicine, or supplies, whatever. No playthrough will ever be perfect and you'll be left to decide just what you can afford to sacrifice.\n\nCombat is something you're generally supposed to avoid, though that's no excuse for how awkward is actually is. Seeing as the game autosaves whenever you do much of anything, you may end up losing a survivor to the strange mechanics, which is a frustrating experience. Other than that though, this is a bleak and depressing survival sim that's nonetheless very enjoyable to play even though it left me feeling pretty devastated. Most importantly, it portrays a situation that's all too real in the world, and is very good at inspiring empathy in the player that may well translate to real life. That the only DLC is a donation directly to children affected by war just reinforces the solid intentions of the developers.","September 18, 2015","true","45.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There was no remorse for killing them but taking their things after they were dead was apparently too cruel for them. I kept hitting my forehead each time I went back to collect some more things.

It's sad, and sometimes you feel the pain of being hopeless hits you straight in the head from your computer screen. Although the gameplay may be a little repetitive, it's hard to leave this filthy in-game world. I started playing at 9 pm, the game crashed at 2:30 am and I decided to check if my progress was saved... turned off my PC three hours later. I felt proud when I upgraded my stove, then I felt guilty for killing an innocent man just to get food. And when the war was over, I felt relieved, but also hungry for more (no matter how cruel this sounds because of the main topic of this game). So it goes, as one wise man once said.\n\nAs I mentioned before, sometimes the game crashes, so some fixes are needed. Also the characters' movement is glitchy from time to time, especially when someone's running after you. I didn't really notice any other problems; TWoM looks good and its sketchy backgrounds are nicely done. I also think the music fits the gameplay perfectly.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique war experience, so different from what we, gamers, are used to - don't hesitate. In my opinion, this one-of-a-kind game is worth it. And don't forget to buy the DLC as that's the way they should be done.\n\nDobra robota, chłopaki.","June 13, 2015","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was all just a mind-numbing, typical day...\nThen the sirens started.\nIn the distance I could hear the bombs detonating across the city. I myself was amongst the masses of the paniced city, each of us struggling to get past one another in a feudal attempt to find our families. Each street blurred in my vision as I sprinted ever faster to try and reach home. I could already see the looting beginning out of the corner of my eyes. I seen mothers with children getting trampled. Fathers shot trying to pick their families back up again. I wondered of my own family. I hadn't been a faithful man, but I was praying this day. Inside I knew, there was no home left. There was no wife. There was no daughter. All I could have truly prayed for... was the bombs hit them before the looters made their way.\n\nIt's now been a week since this war began. I couldn't even tell you why it started, or even who started it. All I see are uniforms; be it the soldiers of a standing army or the gangs of looters, even a trader that stops by my three story pile of ♥♥♥♥ we call home. Well, the three of us; Our ♥♥♥♥-heap we call home.\n\nIt took a few nights of scavenging to get us situated. I can only carry so much in one backpack. You can't expect much when you have to stay to the shadows to avoid getting shot down by a sniper. There's no doc to pry a bullet from me, and I can't say I trust this 'good cook' of ours to remove it either. The real problem though began only yesterday...\n\nMany of the places we had decided to send me had been cut off due to heavy fighting. What was left had already been picked clean in previous nights to help us get this shanty up and running. We needed materials for weapons, food, workbenches, stoves, anti-biotics - you name it, we need it. With most of it done, it was now just a matter of keeping food and water on the table. Since our trader friend failed to show for the last two days, the fighting restricted where I could go, and our traps had been barren of any rats; we were left with one option...\n\nThe ruined house was nice, for what it's worth in this war-torn time. I was peering through the keyhole and looking at the couple and their son moving inside their home. They weren't leaving the main room, and there was no other way in. I barged through the door, and started sifting through as much as I could. I knew I had to push past them and make it to their food supply, likely in the kitchen (old habits die hard I learned). The son was of a different mind... I couldn't fault him, we all would have done the same. I can still here the click of my pistols trigger as two bullets released into the misty night air. The echo of gunfire stinging my ears from being fired indoors... The dark despair and pain settling on the parents eyes. I wondered if this is how my daughter laid before my wife. Reaching out for mommy to help her... Mommy knowing she couldn't, and our daughter just...\n\nI swallowed the bile rising in my throat. It was the first man I ever killed. I always saw it in the games and the movies... but this was different. He didn't scream. He didn't cry out... He just tried to reach for his parents with his shakey hand while his breathing slowly gave way. I couldn't bear to watch the scene any longer, and decided it was best to move in for the food and leave before dawn came. So I did. I took the last of their food, which was hardly more than five meals for my three friends and I. I charged out of the house as quickly as I could. I heard the father whispering under his breath... "Kill me...please" as I pushed back outside.\n\nI killed a man... I killed a family... so we could all live for one more morning. My crew was thankful... but I wasn't. They weren't there to witness what I had to do for the meals... They didn't see the eyes of the hopeless. They just saw their next meal, their life being extended for another day or two... I can't ever forget what I saw; I saw this war of mine become more of a reality. I saw how a desperate man places more value on his life, his companions lives, than anothers...  I saw the barrel of my .45\n\n10/10 Wouldn't know if I could steal from them again.","June 13, 2015","true","8.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dont be fooled into thinking every play through will be 'completely' different. There are approx 20 different locations you can scavenge and they always look the same. They have the same layout, cabinets etc are always in the same place. Only the contents vary somewhat (a cabinet may hold food and wood in one play and parts and wood in another). As to what will happen when you go there: every location has one of two possible events/scenarios at that location. Pretty barebones with the random element if you ask me...\n\nAlso survivors - There are basically 5 main survivors you can control, but they are always the same and have the same strengths/weaknesses every time.\n\nOverall content - There just isnt enough that you can craft, harvest or build. Not by a long shot. No matter what 'random' scenario you have in your game you will always end up visiting the same locations in roughly the same order (by order of threat) and always building and upgrading the minimal amount of upgrades in roughly the same order of priority.\n\nDespite the poor amount of overall content and procedural randomness I would still recommend this game (during a sale) as it shines when it comes down to gameplay and emotional attachment of characters. Some decisions you make can really weigh on your mind haha.\n\nI havent really browsed the workshop as yet but this is one of those games that is very much worth playing, but could have been truly outstanding if it just had 'more'.","December 30, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You control the group of survivors who are struggling to survive and it is your duty to ensure that they do, no matter what it takes.\n\nPros:\n+ Beautiful graphics: illustrates war to perfection through visual themes.\n\n+ Realistic gameplay: Decisions made WILL impact the group and affect them in different ways.\n\n+ Each survivor has their own 'ability' and 'trait': For example, Bruno is a good cook and will use less supplies to cook meals. But, he is also a smoker, so he enjoys cigarettes and can rely on them to restore bad moods. Thus, meaning that you will be tempted to gather cigarettes when scavenging.\n\n+ Trading: Different civilians in the city will value supplies differently, depending on their needs. Very realistic.\n\n+ Emotive: This War of Mine does a fantastic job in making you feel guilty if you make an evil decision to gain supplies.\n\n+ Random events: Some days, people will come to your front door requesting assistance. This adds another realistic aspect and requires some decision making about whether or not to help them. These also happen during scavenging, as you can sometimes find people being attacked by military at some locations and you can decide whether or not to help them. There are consequences to every action you make.\n\n+ Risks: Mostly, everything is a risk. From scavanging at night and potentially being killed, from sending out a group member to help someone. You either reap the rewards or regret accepting the mission.\n\n+ Mood effects: Your surviviors can become depressed if you do too many evil acts, such as stealing or not helping people. An example of this would be killing someone for supplies, the group will learn of this act and have different opinions on it, such as not caring at all or feeling responsible. The killer is also impacted, as they can even commit suicide through guilt if you're not careful. Some survivors can even steal from you and leave the shelter if they become unhappy. However, making good decisions like helping civilians will boost your survivors morale and ensure they stay at the shelter.\n\n+ Night: The night is done to perfection. You can only send one survivor out to scavenge to ruins of the city while the rest can either sleep or stay on guard. There is also a chance of people raiding your shelter and stealing supplies or even killing/wounding your survivors, depending on how well you have fortified your shelter. This adds a great deal of tension to the following mornings after scavenging as you may be left without any supplies.\n\n+ Construction: There is a vast array of many different things to construct in the game, such as vegetable gardens, rainwater collectors and alarm systems. You will always be making decisions about which thing you need to construct the most and will utilise the night scavenging and traders to gather the exact supplies you need and could end up ignoring food and medicine for these parts.\n\n+ Replay value: The game does a good job in encouraging you to replay the game with different survivors and see how you fare. Want a challenge? Start in winter.\n\n+ Implementation of seasons: In winter, you use a lot more resources in keeping your survivors warm. If you do not, your survivors can freeze to death the following morning or become terminally ill from disease spreading.\n\n+ Perfect attention to detail: Simple aspects such as having ill survivors sleeping next to healthy survivors WILL increase the chance of them becoming ill, which I think is a great touch by the developers to add into This War of Mine. Furthermore, adding things like your survivors running slower or becoming depressed if they are wounded/ill is a brilliant touch and is often overlooked.\n\n+ Shelter layout: The shelter is completely under your control other than the workbench and fridge and YOU decide where everything is built. This can be utilised well or not at all, depending on the player.\n\n+ Large amounts of locations: Night scavenging opens up a variety of different locations for the player to explore, such as hospitals (with doctors working there who can heal you) ruined schools and even military outposts.\n\n+ Soundtrack: The game's soundtrack suits the game really well, as it tends to be quite eerie music most of the time: especially at night.\n\n+ Bugs: There are next to no bugs I encountered whilst playing this game and all the bugs that were found are quickly patched.\n\n+ Price: The game is also fairly cheap to buy at around £15, compared to most games nowadays costing around £30-£40.\n\nCons:\n- No statistics: This could've been added to make the game almost perfect, as a lot of people (including myself) like to have stats in games telling them, for example, how many overall days they've survived, how many people they've killed etc.\n\n- Late game: Near the end of the game, it does become tedious when you have built everything and are skipping days just to get to the ending.\n\n- Achievements: The achievements do not tell you how to aquire them and require a lot of trial and error to obtain. Some people may like this, however pefectionists may find it to be frustrating at times.\n\n- No difficulty settings: The entire game is based on one difficulty. This does limit the game as people can find it to be quite easy and would prefer it to be more difficult, like less supplies to scavenge.\n\nOverall, This War of Mine is a fantastic survival-based game which will thrill you into playing it to death (no pun intended). It utilises the concepts of war and how devastating it can be to engage the player at all times. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival-based games or emotive games that will affect the player's mood, which is uncommon in most games today.","December 28, 2014","true","47.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From the perspective of suffering civilians, This War of Mine is something you typically set out to play for the survival tactic and the interesting change of story; the portrayal of not soldiers, but the lesser-seen gameplay of civilians in war-strewn cities.\nThe connections grown with each individual character and their situation grow stronger and stronger throughout the game. Reading their growing biography with every passing day, seeing their moods alter based off of current events. If needs for supplies are not met in time, the death impacts everything and it really is powerful. I'm honestly excited to see how The Little Ones DLC plays out and curious to see how it effects the overall gameplay.\n\nThe atmosphere itself is powerful as well, with an art style that is both aesthetically pleasing but suiting the core aspect of the game; the grimy, cold struggle for survival. The music is the most fitting (and indisputably catchy) music possible. Everything about this game is beautiful and terrible, and I love it.

I got totally shrecked the first 4-5 times I played it before I started to become more familiar with the mechanics and how to survive. I made it through the winter and into the spring time when the war finally came to a close around about 60 days in or so. I was absolutely hooked on this game, I didn't want to stop playing it until I'd beaten it. And to be honest, when I finally did beat it I was a little bit sad that it was over. But at the same time, I was happy for my fictional in-game characters. They wouldn't have to do those despicable things to survive anymore. The ♥♥♥♥, murder, and pilaging was over. And then I sat in my desk chair for several minutes contemplating everything I'd done in those 60 days to survive. Thinking about how those things really happened to REAL people back in the seige of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war in the 90's. I've never played a video game that made me think about real life(...and death) such as This War of Mine.\n\n10 out of 10, would recommend. To anyone. Play this game now, before you forget about it. Also, don't be put off by the difficulty at first. After an hour or two of playing you will be a lot better at surviving guaranteed.\n\nShout outs to all who had to go through the seige of Sarajevo. I know This War of Mine is just a game, but it's a game that gave me a MUCH MUCH greater respect for ANYONE who's gone through such a terrible war and had to get their hands dirty to survive. And to those who did all that they could to help other innocent civilians while putting their own lives at risk.","December 21, 2014","true","17.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has the old ‘just one more turn’ quality common to games like Civilisation and as a consequence will consistently keep you up well into the morning hours. The game is defined by several layers of play, all of which fit seamlessly together in forming a deeply moving and often ‘emotionally taxing’ experience.\nThe first layer-of-play is orientated around exploration and scavenging in which you will be called upon to move, point-and-click style, three protagonists around your base and various other environments in search of building materials, food and weapons. The second layer-of-play is the crafting system in which you will be called upon to manage supplies, upgrade equipment and maintain existing infrastructure in the bombed-out apartment block you call home. The third layer is defined by character management in which you will have to carefully maintain the physical and psychological health of your characters through the provision of food, supplies and entertainment. The forth layer involves the strategic map which allows you to journey to other locations around the besieged city, collect supplies and interact with various realistically depicted NPCs. The fifth layer manifests as a very intense platform-based stealth system which allows you to kill, sneak and steal in various environments. The sixth layer is defined by an emergent morality system in which both NPCs and your characters react realistically to your actions, lamenting death, cursing murder and ultimately resorting to begging and sadism under different circumstances. The seventh and final layer involves interacting with NPCs for trade and barter.\nAll of these layers-of-play blend together extremely well, providing a highly immersive experience. The game makes you truly feel like you are a survivor on the brink and demands much in the way of emotional fortitude when you put your characters in harms’ way. I cannot recommend this game enough. 10/10.","November 28, 2014","true","26.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Gathering supplies from outside (Only at night since it’s safer) has you putting your home at risk from looters if not properly protected. Also building improvements like barricades, beds, booking facilities, moonshine stills, all help to keep your civilians alive. Even keeping the house warm with a stove becomes imperative, when deciding to use fuel for either cooking or heating.\n\nThe game has no tutorial or instructions on what the best approach is, rather it’s left up to you. Do you want to survive? Help others? Become bandits and rob others? Even take part in the war by attacking military posts. All rather difficult tasks, and none really goes through as planned.\n\nMy game started off with three young men, Marko, Bruno, and Pavle. Bruno was the cook who feared venturing out, caring only for survival. With the mentality, better them than us. Marko and Pavle the strongest of the two as far as scavenging and defending. As the game progressed I ran into an elderly man named Anton who excelled in creating items and gave him shelter.\n\nThe game has you investing in your characters and fabricating their personalities in your mind as you make choices that put them at risk. Towards the end of my game winter sets in and supplies become scarce, while sickness becomes more common. Pavle ends up dying trying to back home through Snipers alley, an obvious reason why it’s called that. Marko dies trying to steal supplies from bandits that own a brothel. Left with a sick Anton and the cowardly Bruno. I set Bruno to avenge Marko as a last ditch effort. I imagined Bruno having lost his fear in desperation and anger. Making him kill three armed men with a shovel as he ambushed them from different locations of their hideout. The risk brought in a big reward.\n\nHowever returning home he only found that Anton froze to death in his bed. Bruno was now alone, suffering depression, but getting what he wanted from the start, just to survive.","November 15, 2014","true","18.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

Good.\n\nHowever, what if the trader doesn't have what you need at the moment? You don't want to let your group starve, do you? Well let's go scavenge a nearby building for food and supplies. You sneak into the structure, gathering food and building materials to just try and get you buy. You aren't taking everything, heck, you can't even carry that much.\n\nAs you're searching through the cabinets for the canned goods and medicine you need, a hostile opens the door to your right and attempts to unload a magazine of ammunition at you. Through quick thinking, you descend down the stairs and wait for him in the dark corner so you can achieve the element of surprise on your well armed oppenent. He rounds the corner, and you stab him until he collapses onto the floor with a gurgling thud. You begin looting his ammunition when you hear more footsteps descending down the stairs. You ready yourself for the second onslaught, but it passes you by an collapses on your former opponents corpse into a sobbing heap. When the red haze of bloodlust clears, you realize that it was an elderly man and his wife. She moans uncontrollably and laments the fact that her love is now gone. He wasn't a hostile looter, he was an elderly man in a secluded building trying to make sure no one stole his sick wifes medication.\n\nYou then have an epiphany. You realize that he wasn't an evil doer bent on ending your life. You realize that you, in fact, are the bandit.\n\nEdit: Before the trolls come out from under their bridges, no this actual scenario doesn't happen in the game.

I've been sucked in for well over 12 hours in one sitting, something that very rarily happens for me with an indie game like this. (The play-time counter is broken for some reason...) The soundtrack is really good, it perfectly illustrates the doubt and fear in this group of survivors you're trying to lead. The gritty art style is very, very nicely done. The sketchy look and dull, grey colors do a really good job of showing this ravaged urban area. The stealth system is quite advanced, and the combat is random and really nervewracking (Think of XCOM). Losing a beloved member of the group is really a deep pain, and it echoes throughout the group. They mourn their dead and might even become depressed. The looting is very rewarding, and the limited inventory space forces heavy inventory management. Nothing like sneaking through a bandit camp and stealing all the goods that they themselves have stolen from others. The trading is very fun and well done, and it forces a lot of tough decisions. Do I want tobacco/alcohol that I may be able to sell for a good amount of food/materials, or do I want to just bring a smaller amount of materials or food and avoid the risk of not being able to sell it when I need food the most? The decisions you have to make are tough. I found myself robbing an elderly couple in pure desperation, only to stop for a moment and realize what I'd just done. The game has good replayability to a point, as it's somewhat randomized.\n\nAll in all, one of the best, if not very best, survival indie games I have ever played. 10/10, would starve to death again.","November 16, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The characters make you feel regret if you steal or murder others to survive. When I played this game, I felt as if I were struggling with them.\n\nEarly on I was scared of everybody, people who knocked on my door, people where you could scavage. However, as you continue to play, you realize that everybody is trying to survive as well. Some may want to help, some may need help, and some are just thugs trying to get by. There's a reason for every action that takes place in this game, and the developers have done an amazing job on simulating the emotion and issues that these characters face.\n\nFor example, when I was running low on everything, I decided to scavage the quiet home. There were only 2 people in that house, an elderly couple who could not fight back. They pleaded for mercy, they had many materials, but everytime I would loot something, the old man would beg for me to leave and to not raid them. I felt bad raiding their things, knowing that they would perish because of my actions. I tried to ignore it, however when I got back to the safehouse, every member had judged me. They were mentioning how cruel the character I controlled was, because I had stolen from a defenseless couple.\n\nThis game however could improve a little on its story and variety. Sometimes you feel as if it's hopeless, or that you're not getting anywhere. The cost of crafting neccessities may be a bit high sometimes, and can cause problems even after you've gathered enough supplies.\n\nThis is a definite purchase, even for its price.\n\n8.5/10","December 28, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

As a trio of civilians living in shell of a house, you start from scratch and essentially progress through the game by gradually improving your hideout, as you simultaneously stave off disease, depression, looters and hunger.  Balancing all of these competing threats is significantly easier said than done.\n\nThe game really evokes the grim reality of a modern war, in both its art style and gameplay.  Losing one of your civilians is actually quite emotionally profound; each civilian ha their own backstory and specific skill, but also hopes and dreams, as well as interesting quirk (e.g. smokes, or enjoys reading).  Keeping them alive is tough, but in my first playthrough it was not disease or depression that killed my poor family, but blundering into armed thugs and being shot for their troubles.  As inglorious and abrupt as these ends were, it didn't break the immersion whatsoever; people die in stupid ways in war.

As a trio of civilians living in shell of a house, you start from scratch and essentially progress through the game by gradually improving your hideout, as you simultaneously stave off disease, depression, looters and hunger.  Balancing all of these competing threats is significantly easier said than done.\n\nThe game really evokes the grim reality of a modern war, in both its art style and gameplay.  Losing one of your civilians is actually quite emotionally profound; each civilian ha their own backstory and specific skill, but also hopes and dreams, as well as interesting quirk (e.g. smokes, or enjoys reading).  Keeping them alive is tough, but in my first playthrough it was not disease or depression that killed my poor family, but blundering into armed thugs and being shot for their troubles.  As inglorious and abrupt as these ends were, it didn't break the immersion whatsoever; people die in stupid ways in war.  What's more, the civilian deaths deeply affect your fellow characters, severely depressing them.  Let this go unattended for too long, and they may commit suicide.

It combines equal parts of aformentioned Papers Please, State of Decay, and I Am Alive. It shows how war isn't a good thing. People die. People get hurt. Families are torn appart. War IS bad.\nIt also has some pretty solid AI. Rather, the AI is random, per say. There is no set currency, no set money system, no set value. It all depends on who you are trading with.\nHow the AI reacts to you is based on logic. An old person didnt attack me while i was looting his house because i had a knife, while a dude blew my brains out because I was near his ill mother.\nThe base building is solid,too. This is my base. There are many like it, but this is mine.\nI really dig the graphics. Some times its a bit hard to make out stuff, but i love it for this all the more.\nAnyway, this is the short version. Maybe i'll add a longer version, but if you take away nothing else from this review, take away this:This game is one of the best games to come out this year.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IceoAwesome/recommended/282070/","IceoAwesome","Iceo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IceoAwesome/","238 products in account","This War of Mine could be called the offspring of DayZ and XCOM: Enemy Unknown (whose older sister was The Sims), both excellent games that are strategic, tense and merciless. But beyond that, nearly all simularities end, unless you play This War of Mine.\n\nThis aptly named title, is a 2D survival game where you control a group of survivors, holed up in a shabby cottage-like structure, trying to ignore the horrors of the war going on outside and focus on living.\n\nYour first (in-game) day is essentially getting your cottage ready, you will need to get rid of rubble, grab all the supplies still within, and create furniture for your home. Sounds kinda like the Sims, right? Yeah, well, throw the idea of not letting your Sims eat food out the window now, because it gets merciless from here.\n\nThe night (much like most survival games) is where the true danger is at. You are going to exhaust your supplies pretty quickly unless you go out scavenging, so it is essential you go out and collect more supplies. This is where night comes in. At night, you want to select what your party is going to be doing for the remainder of the night. Do they guard, sleep, sleep in beds, or scavenge? I generally had 1 guarding, 1-2 sleeping on beds (you have to make the beds, so don't expect them to be happy if you don't have them) and 1 scavenging. The person you have got scavenging is the only person you will control for the rest of the night.\n\nYou select the site in which your scavenger will... scavenge. He/she will be controlled by you for the remainder of the night. Considering it is your first night, chances are, you have no weapons, no lockpicks, nothing. Just you, your wits and your stealth ability.\n\nYou start to enter the house, slowly creeping around to make sure no one that might be in the house hears you.\nYou scrounge around in a few cupboards, not a lot.\nThat's when you see it: The icon that shows a hand reaching for a diamond.\n\nDo you want to take from private property? Do you want to take from people? Do you want to become a bandit?\n\nYou take it, feeling guilty for your actions, and continue on.\n\nYou make it back only just in time, before dawn so you could get home without a Sniper seeing you.\n\nThen, as if last night wasn't stressful enough: You've been raided. Your guard is wounded.\n\nYou now have to take the time to nurse to him, sort your supplies, build all the things you need and countless other things.\n\nYou start doing your work when you hear a knock on the door.\n\nA kid wants your help, he has no more medicine to tend to his mother and pleads for your help.\n\nIt is up to you to decide all these moral choices, but there will always be a consequence for your actions. You may have done the right thing, but you lost some valuable supplies. You turned them down because you need them, but now your survivors are doubting their situation.\n\nI may have described the typical night, but you still need to address your teams morale, cook food, and so on.\n\nActions such as killing people and stealing from helpless affect your team's emotions, sometimes causing PTSD. It is good to see a game take killing so seriously, it isn't done too often. Their emotions can cause them to degrade others, stop being motivated in doing their tasks, and even making them leave your group. It is something you always need to think about before taking action.\n\nTime moves interestingly in this game. Time will move 10 minutes about every 15 or so seconds. Once it reaches 8 PM, it transits into your night duties. During the night, you need to get out of there by 4:30 AM, otherwise you may not make it back. You can end both day and night early if you feel that you will be wasting time waiting. But time is of essence and you must use it wisely for your survival.\n\nThe art-style consists of very little colour, with a lot of pencil detail. While it does a good job at setting the dreary mood, I did think it could have been a bit more lush and vibrant, and it can get a little straining on the eyes.\n\nAlthough it has good icons and controls so you get the hang of it pretty quickly, This War of Mine does lack a strong tutorial. While something can be said of realism and throwing you in the deep-end, I do feel that some people might struggle initially.\n\nIt is rather hard to describe this game, because it's a game that is rather new in concept, a rather surprising sight considering the recent popularity of survival games.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game, everything is thought out and all the ideas have been well executed on. It could do with some improvements, but this game does a fantastic job at showing the horrors of war in an engaging way, while also proving to still have solid game mechanics. It is a must buy for any fan of the survivalist/war-story genres.\n\n8.5 out of 10.","November 17, 2014","true","15.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You'll just want more after 20 hours or so. One pickadillo: the English is a little wonky in certain bits of dialog, and even awkward English aside, the dialog could be much better fleshed out.

The others members should still be unknown and trusted, seriously.\n\nSo in essence this is just a "manage your resources" thing since all other options are pretty much a no-go and thus gets repetitive and boring quickly.

In this game the tables are turned and you are a cevilian, trying to survive the war inflicted upon you by ruthless soldiers, who will kill you in a blink of an eye. But not only that, you will also have to take on basic challanges of survivel, like getting food and water, keeping yourself from falling into deep depression, deffending your home from invaders who want to rob you and take advantage of your posessions. The game also deals with the harsh reality of war by confronting you with hard and even brutal desicions you have to make in order to survive, like for example robing old peoples houses to get food, refusing to shelter people to save on food or maybe shelter them to gain strength against potential robers and attackers. You also have a trading & crafting system ingame, both of are which are complex and well done. You should listen to the radio not only to keep your sanity, but also to update on what kind of currency is up right now, for example maybe cigaretes are scarce right now and worth more, maybe its coffee. I can go on on about possibilities in this game since there are all over the place, this game is all about choices. every game you'll start will play trough differently, making the game highly replayable. The chracter are well thought off, everyone has its own personality, with strengths a background, and stuff they like, ehich can help you maintain their sanity by providing them with those stuff. There is a lot of stealth involved as you need to snick trough peoples houses to loot, or avoid trigger happy soldiers and snipers. You also have a combat system, in which you can use weapons you crafted to raid places and kill opponents.\n\nI love the graphics, which really portrait the feeling of your chracters, showing their exhaustion, sadness, hunger. If your chracter is a smoker or a reader youll find animations of them taking use of your inventory to keep them sain, smoking drinking coffee maybe reading a book. The other cevilians and characters are also excellent. The art direction and animations are beautiful.\n\nYou will find yourself caring for your chracters, and reading about the moral issues they are facing, which is really the point of the game, showing you what war is really about, its about making choices inflicted upon you by a harsh reality.\n\nVoice acting would of brought this game to another level.\nAlso since this is an indie platformer i dont compare it to high budget games since it would'nt be fair.\n\nAs an indie platformer game i give it a 8 out of 10. would be 9 with voice acting","November 21, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't really have much coffee this morning, the scones my boss supplies didn't look appetizing, and I'm just in a generally negative mood.\n\nYou see, last night as I was playing, This War of Mine, I was extremely desperate to save my four survivors who were wounded, sick, and on the brink of starvation.  I was so desperate that I ended up breaking into a house and began looting it.  I heard footsteps, and hid in a corner.  As the intruder came closer I pulled out my axe and jumped the intruder from behind.  I hacked down a little boy with my axe, his sobbing mother who came to his side, and eventually the father who fell next to his family.\n\nI truly feel like a piece of ♥♥♥♥ in real life right now, not sure how I'm going to recover.  The sobbing mom next to the little boy as I hacked her from the back was enough....I may take a little break and evaluate my morale compass.\n\n","November 21, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not very often have I actually felt a developer able to connect me with how a character acts, behaves and yes, dies, yet they are able to do it ably and appropriately so many times in so many ways. One of the best I have played in a long long time, this game should be in your collection. Not must, because it's tone probably won't appeal to everyone but for it's price, it's content, it's theme and the way it portrays it and the inevitable dLc that I fervently hope they include, it definitely should be something you experience at least once . .","November 21, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No, you're just in control of a group of civvies trying to survive by any means necessary, which easily includes robbery and murder if you get desperate or selfish enough.","November 21, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
