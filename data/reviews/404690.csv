Firstly, it's a text-based adventure, with minimalistic graphics and a LOT of reading.  So if that doesn't sound like you, SKIP THIS STORE PAGE NOW.  Secondly, it's kind of an old-school "dungeon" explorer, complete with some nice pixel-y maps, but completely lacking in any stats or other regular "RPG" elements apart from an inventory.  Combat consists of nothing more than choosing to fight something, then you keep clicking on text messages until you or it dies.  THAT'S IT.  No stats, no combat tactics, JUST STORY.  Again, if this doesn't sound like something you can live with, LEAVE THIS STORE PAGE NOW.\n\nPhew.  Glad that's over.  Are they gone?!  Good.\n\nNow that it's just me and you, curious one, let me say straight up that whatever else this "game" is, it's extremely well-written and has a fascinating story.  This Nathan Meunier person could probably write books for a living.  And highly Lovecraftian books they would in all probability be.  Yep, he's one of those...but a very GOOD one of those.  The depth this game goes into about rituals and demon summoning and what-not suggests a first-class crackpot who either reads too many "esoteric" texts, or has a spiffingly good imagination.  This Book Is A Dungeon is short, but intriguing, and I certainly look forward to anything Mr Meunier gets up to in the future.\n\nA few suggestions to the dev/author for next time:  The price is a tad on the silly side (one or two dollars would be far more realistic); how about some MUSIC to further invoke that Eldritchean atmosphere; and thirdly, how about some save/checkpoints next time, as redoing bits over and over and over again does get a bit tiresome (especially when the text is so moodily staggered and can't be skipped, and so many bits of the game are so ruthlessly trial-and-error)?\n\nFantastic first effort, though.  Keep up the good work, sir.\n\nVerdict: 8/10.\n\n(PS Some advice to budding players: Be sure to keep a pen and paper close at hand.  The game might keep a map for you, but you're gonna need to make plenty of notes, just the same!!!)","November 30, 2015","true","1.8"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","40","42","9","1"

The artworks are not the best, but they fit the theme and the game so perfectly, that it doesn't really matter.

Now, I simply cannot waste but a single drop of your blood."\nThis Book is a Dungeon (TBIAD) is a fantastic little text-based adventure game with a bit of unsettling dark and gloomy theme. Expect to die, A LOT, in this game and every choice you make seems like a possible bad ending. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing since the game encourages you to try again with different paths each time and hopefully brings you closer to the conclusion. I haven't managed to get that far myself but I did managed well enough to get to the second chapter before the inevitable happens.\n\nHowever, the brilliant writing and creepy atmosphere is marred by the game's lack of basic feature for a PC game, a Steam title even. I think this is what deter most of the text-based games enthusiast, or even just casual gamers, away from what could've been a great indie gem.\n\nPROS    CLEVERLY written story with immersive setting and rich with lore! I was hooked straight away even at the prologue, leading me to play for an hour straight (until I met an unexpected but-I-guess-it's-my-own-fault death).\nHigh replayability value with different pathways on almost every different choices you make.\nAccessible english that's easy enough to understand and enjoyed but not too simple that it's silly.\nCan run on a toaster.\nCharming character and world artwork throughout the game.\nSmooth text flow, perfect for immersive reading.\nFun puzzle section that requires you to think rather than just go for trial and error sequence.\nNEUTRAL    Detailed map but I think how the game shows the whole thing right off the bat is a bit spoilerish and, in my opinion, changes how I'd play given that the map is hidden at first.\nThe white background is nice and all but I do prefer an option for a darker theme. Reading the text with bright background for hours will probably thickened my cornea even more.\nCONS\nAs much as I've enjoyed the game, I have to admit that the absence of the even basic features in the game annoys me.\nNot a single audio can be find in the game. Eerie silence? Check. (I prefer the ambience, if you don't mind)\nNo Setting or Configuration menu. The game don't even have a Fullscreen toggle!\nSteam Overlay is not functioning in the game, as I've crashed twice when I attempted to open the overlay when playing.\nYou can't take a proper screenshot (probably because of the flowing text?). Every screenshot I took came out as a white screen showing only the map and the inventory.\nUninspired combat sequence. It's basically just clicking next, next, next until either one of you dies.\nThere's no option to save your progress in the game (or at least from what I've noticed). I've created a thread asking for this and once someone clarifies, I'll update the review Accordingly EDIT: The dev confirmed that there are no save function in the game due to the engine limitation. However, he did mention that he's working on a patch to add a quick skip point early on in case anyone wants to wade through the story faster.\nSome of the artwork are inproportionate with the window size. Since the game doesn't have a fullscreen support, I played the game in small windowed mode (just nice to read without burning my eyes out). I noticed that some words, that are meant to be a background artwork, doesn't show up properly. I had to rescale the window size just to see what the words meant (I had this in Chapter 2).\nTo conclude, I give This Book is a Dungeon an enjoyable but all around mediocre 3 / 5. Get it for the amazing story!\nI've scoured the Discussion section for the game and I've noticed that Nathan, the developer, is actively working (last update is at the end of January last month) to release a Redux version of the game, reworked on a brand new game engine, which promises all of the basic Steam functions, including achievements and sounds. It's not clear yet whether it will be released as a separate title or an update to this one. I'll update my review in the future after I have confirmation regarding this (as well if there's any new info I find).\n\nOriginally posted by nathanmeunier:\nTLDR version: the redesign of TBIAD is coming along...it's an agonizingly slow process, but along the way it's giving me great ideas to retune and add/change a lot of the game.\n\nI'm taking all of the reviews and player feedback into consideration. When it's done, TBIAD Redux is going to be a very different animal from the current Steam version. I think anyone who liked the core game is going to super dig it, and the changes may appeal, too, to a much broader swath of players.\n\nAnyhoo. This is a long-term redesign, but I'll share updates as I go. Everyone who buys the game in its current form on Steam will get the full updated version for free when it relaunches.\n\nAs usual, feel free to drop a comment if there's anything you'd like to add or if I've made any spelling or grammatical mistake in my review. If this is helpful or enjoyable to read, I'd appreciate a thumbs up so others can view it as well!","February 25","true","1.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rph133/recommended/404690/","rph133","Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rph133/","790 products in account","PROS:\n*Decent writing\n*Interesting environments\n\nNEUTRAL:\n*The white background, which is the vast majority of the screen, is blinding.  I got a headache while playing this game, but not everyone will have my problem, so I won't count it against the game in my review.\n\nCONS:\n*No music or sound effects\n*No saving\n*No skipping text that has already been seen\n*Short\n*Pointless combat\n*No way to know if a choice will lead to death in most cases\n*Writing is mostly descriptions of the player's current location or deaths\n*Can't return to the main menu except after death\n\nGAME LENGTH:\n30 minutes to 2 hours.  I took around 80 minutes because I was unlucky enough to choose multiple routes that led to my death, forcing me to play the game again and again.\n\nSCORE:\n2 out of 10\n\nConsidered simply as a story, This Book Is a Dungeon is not great.  Most of the text is devoted to describing the player's current location and there doesn't seem to be much of a plot or connection among the four chapters.  The protagonist simply moves along in confusion to the next set piece, dying almost randomly.  There is not only little meaning to the meager story, but also little sense in the deaths that the protagonist endures, which also force the reader to start from the beginning of the story every time.\n\nConsidered as a game, This Book Is a Dungeon is even worse.\n\nOne notices right away that there are no sound effects or music, which are powerful and important tools for creating the appropriate atmosphere in any medium that is not restricted to visuals (or even just text) alone.  Since the text itself does only a mediocre job of creating a good atmosphere in a genre where that is usually very important (horror), there is a distinct lack of immersion.\n\nThe "gameplay" consists entirely of clicking on blue text to progress, which is acceptable for the genre as long as it is used appropriately.  Unfortunately, the developer thought it worthwhile to try to include unavoidable, choiceless combat.  In predetermined locations, the player will enter into battle with some eldritch horror and be forced to click on the same blue text repeatedly as the character and monster whittle away at each other's health by 1 or 2 HP at a time, the process of which is extended by their mutual inaccuracy.  The player here is merely an observer.  Though I never died in battle against one of these creatures, I came close once, so I am forced to conclude that they are just one of many examples of unfair deaths that, again, require the player to start from the beginning of the game.\n\nI would mention other such deaths, but they would constitute the only real spoilers for the game besides the meaningless ending.  Trust me when I say that there is generally no way to know what will happen after any given choice nor any way to prepare for the consequences.\n\nBeing forced to play through the game again after each death because there is no save feature even within a chapter is bad enough.  But the absence of a skip button, the delays between text that progresses the story, and particularly one chapter where I estimate that the player must get through over 80 separate lines of text before he can make any choice make the game much more frustrating.\n\nFor me, this was not a game in which surviving a chapter created a sense of accomplishment.  It was a game in which knowing that more senseless deaths and clicking awaited me created a sense of dread--and not of a Lovecraftian nature.  The ending, sadly, did nothing to help me feel that my experience was worthwhile.\n\nAnd while I was ultimately grateful to only spend 80 minutes on the game, the roughly 30 minutes of actual content does not justify the $6 price tag of a text-based game.\n\nThe developer has expressed a desire to improve the combat and include sound and achievements, but says that the game engine makes these features difficult or impossible.  That is not an excuse; it is a reason to not use the engine in the first place.  And it certainly does not excuse the tedium that the player must endure after each death.\n\nAs I find that This Book Is a Dungeon fails both as a story and a game, but recognize that the writing is of decent quality and the environments are interesting, I give it a 2 out of 10.","January 7","false","1.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The story is brilliantly Lovecraftian and engrossing, particullary the work that went into the collections of books and tomes in the library section. My only qualms are that firstly the fact that you had to complete each painting in sequence without any form of checkpoint, is very frustrating, and I think it was to the detriment of the imersive story, as it required me to repeat sections by flashing through the choices to finish it. Secondly the one piece of combat in the game seemed absolutely arbitrary as it was seemingly unfailable, would of loved to of seen better use of a combat system or for it to be left out completely, or solely conducted through choice and consequence, as with the Avian creature in the first dungeon. Alltogether though I enjoyed this game and I would love to see a sequel as well as other creators making this kind of game.","October 31, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And while your deaths will be creative, and described in oh so much detail, every death means having all your progress reset. Since the chapters are largely linear in structure (though you can attempt them in any order), and most puzzles have only one solution, you will find yourself retreading familiar ground over and over again with increasing frustration. This also disincentivises experimentation - many times it will be clear to a genre-savvy player that a certain option will lead to an interesting, well-written and horrible death, but you won't want to try it out due to the hefty progress penalty involved (there is, of course, no saving).\n\nWith that said, a complete playthrough (which, sadly, involves going through the exact same thing multiple times if you want all the endings) will last you a few hours at most, If that's an investment you're prepared to make in the name of some well-written horror, then I would definitely recommend this game, especially given its low price.","March 1","true","2.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Fans of the RPG-Style of CYOA's will enjoy this quite a bit. Be forewarned however, some of the subject material is extremely dark and graphic. The level of despair in this game is pretty high. Some drawbacks to this game include the somewhat repetitve nature of having to replay certain areas of the game, the lack of audio and it is somewhat predictable after a while. It is also a bit pricey at over $5. However, if you can pick this up on sale and are not bothered by dark subject matter, you'll enjoy this.

Once you read the prologue, you can skip right to the Dungeon and Gallery --  the starting point and half-way point of the actual adventure.\n\nThe interface is nicely done, and the pixel artwork appropriate.  I don't feel the gamebook is quite worth the full asking price considering the length and the lack of audio ambience but it's certainly not a bad piece of work at all and anyone who loves otherwordly horror shouldn't be too disappointed at the variety of horrible ways one can end the adventure.

Or hear. You won't even have any sound playing in the background in any situation, so you should take care about that for yourself.\n\nAnd what should characterize the gameplay by itself, which is a kind of dungeon crawler game where you're looking for the exit of it, it's what ruins part of this atmosphere, even if the game itself is very short (i've actually made all the possible choices/mistakes in around 4 hours of gameplay): there are a total of two actual turn-based battles with some monsters, where your only choice is to "Attack" the enemy in order to beat it, survive and continue the dungeon, and you will never lose any of these two fights because, between you and me, who want to lose in a game where, if you should lose, you'd have to restart the game and re-read parts of the story you've already experienced, thus causing a forced ripetitive boring gameplay? Nobody.\n\nNot to mention the pretty easy ways to die while solving certain puzzles and riddles, at least for who isn't paying much attention in the reading itself or for who forgot a little but vital detail in the dungeon,  or else you're likely to start over all the challenges from the beginning again.\n\nIn the end i don't feel like to pay 6€ for such game, not because it's bad or unpolished or else, just because it feels like i'm only reading or "hearing" a great game's narrative, but without playing that game itself, and this is how empty this one makes me feel.","May 15","false","4.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This is a puzzle game that just happens to be text-based. While there are choices, in my playthrough I didn't find they had a long-lasting impact like they would in a choose-your-own adventure book. They mostly altered the short-term, gave clues to puzzles, or were cosmetic (with the exception of the ending, which seemed to come out of nowhere which was a bit disappointing).\n\nSome things that may turn some people off from this game:\n\n- It's very short. I beat it with a friend in just under two hours even though I had to redo a section about three or four times. There are about five "chapters" to the book and it ends rather abruptly.\n\n- There's no real "save" feature, just one or two major milestones you can restart at. This was a bit frustrating because death can be very punishing when you're caught unaware. The first time I died I was set back two chapters (about 30 minutes worth of game). A save feature or at least chapter checkpoints would be nice.\n\n- The game is surprisingly easy. Maybe I just got lucky, but there were only two parts I "lost" at. There were also no points in the game I got "stuck" not knowing what to do.\n\n- A few sections of the game had a very crude combat system that amounted to nothing more than luck and clicking "attack" over and over until the fight ended. There weren't many of these fights (only one or two depending on your choices) but I felt they detracted from the game. I'm all for a combat system, but the way it's currently implemented isn't fun since there's absolutely no strategy that I could discern.\n\n- While the writing is great the story is a bit weak. Things happen but there's no real reason for them. The game doesn't need to explain everything that exists in its world, but considering it sells itself as a book it would've been nice for the story to be a bit more fleshed out.\n\nUltimately, this was a fun game that harkens back to old horror/text based adventure games (and does it better than I've seen in recent years). Should you buy it? Well, if text-based horror is your thing then this is a very nice title.

It's generally short for a game but it completely makes up for that with it's sense of style and the immersion within the game. The game does have its shortcomings, such as a stupidly simplistic combat scenario that was thrown in there and the fact that there are no saves to speak of, meaning that you'll have to redo everything upon death, which WILL happen. This is partially solved by being able to skip to certain main areas within the game and bypass all the tedious clicking, however.

A rather unforgiving point-and-click adventure. That's not saying I haven't enjoyed the almost 3 hours I've played in chapters 1, 3, and 2. But I've been left somewhat wanting.\n\nApart from living or dying, the choices you make don't have an impact, making it an illusion of choice, if I'm not mistaken. They seem more like puzzles, or riddles to solve through either common sense, thinking, intuition, luck, or bruteforce (as in, dying and trying again).\n\nThe latter is sometimes quite entertaining, some of your failures (that is, deaths) have deliciously elaborate flavour. Others are simply a bland sentence, which has left me feeling left out, when walking through the entry area multiple times - exploring other dialogue choices. And having to click through from the beginnign of a level or dungeon, to the points you may have died, is quite a tedium.\n\nI would probably end up saying that the game itself is nothing special in its form or mechanics, and the only thing unique about it is the story that has been written for it. I would not describe it as a dungeon crawler in the classical meaning when it comes to computer games.\n\nAfter all, I'd say that I don't know anybody I would recommend this game to.","December 30, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise, it is a delightful read.\n\n9/10","May 24","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is just like that, but on your PC. Blood fills the page as you start your adventure, decide what to do if you want to escape from this dungeon. Be warned that this game has no checkpoint, but two different parts to start from. You will read the story and you will be totally invested in it. After all, This Review Is A Dungeon.","May 27","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
