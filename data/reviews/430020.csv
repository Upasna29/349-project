Sites that claim you can "download" a walkthrough for this game have infected players' computers with viruses. If a reputable site has a walkthrough, it won't ask you to download it, it will just display it.\n\nFull review: This hidden object game starts out very cheesy and below average, overall. There are a few silly attempts at jump scares, and very simple puzzles and HO scenes. The story is typical, and the occult elements are hilarious, to be honest (the villain's shoes have hooves for heels and pentagrams on the buckles!) The navigation is confusing at times and the instructions for a couple of the puzzles are hard to understand.\n\nAs it goes on, however, there are a few special "Golden Mask" puzzles which play on music & death themes, and those puzzles are interesting and nicely designed. For example, one has you put together portraits of classical musicians and match the portraits with their death masks. Another has you match the skulls of animals to their original bodies. I enjoyed those puzzles and wished there were more. Also, the later hidden object scenes have morphing objects, moving parts, and interactions, making them a bit more interesting than the usual HO stuff.\n\nIt is a VERY short game, though. So although it gets better, by the usual value estimate of $1=1 hour of gameplay, this is a $2-3 game at most.","January 6","true","2.8"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","0"

A boy, Luciano Folgeri, was kidnapped from St. Vicarius orphanage.  The gamer plays as a detective who is investigating this case.\n\nSimple enough storyline, find out about the boy, who stole the boy, where the boy was taken, rescue the boy and why this happened.\n\nNot quite sure why this game has an age lock on it.  Kidnapping, possibly.  The supernatural/ black magic elements maybe? (Though practically every game with magic, real or imagined, has a dark wizard/mage or some other dark entity in it.) A singular reference to God?\n\nI would get into spoiler territory if I continued about the storyline and just what is the "Dance of Death".  Though I will note the voice synching is off, possibly my computer, but if not my computer, not overly sure it is intentional or not.\n\nGameplay: Mostly hidden object but with a nearly equal share of point and click.  There are basically two locations, subdivided into areas.  There is a list of objectives for each location that need to be completed.  There is no map or fast travel, it is not needed.  The hidden object scenes are lists, and some "find x amount".  The straight lists include extra locations or some interaction.  There are interactive lists, and they are very interactive, many are puzzles all by themselves. (I like them.  Reminds me of the Mystery Case Files master puzzles starting with Ravenhearst.)  And something different:  Morphing finds, or find x amount of morphing objects. (These are not as hard as they seem.  But if stuck hit the hint button.)  Note: look carefully around every scene especially the edges for extra places and things.  Half the game is finding all the extra places.\n\nThere are no penalties in this game for game hints, hidden object hints, or puzzle hints.  There are no penalties for skipping either.  Very relaxed type of gameplay in a somewhat quasi-open world.\n\nPuzzles: mostly sliders, of various types and difficulty.  And one recipe puzzle.\n\nA few notes:\n1) This is a short game.  I took about 3 hours and I am slow.\n2) Love the music but the game does not say what the music is or who wrote it.\n3) The mask theme of the game is creepier then all the ghosts you see.\n4) Have no clue why there are so many ghosts out and about.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a short, simple, detective mystery with supernatural elements.  The overall eerie atmosphere seems to be dated about a hundred years ago which is fine and lends a subliminal creepiness to all the locations, ghosts and characters.\n\nWorth the price?  Yes, especially when on sale.","December 27, 2015","true","10.7"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","29","34","0","0"

People forget that even simple games like this take time to program and make good art for. Which, as an artist, I do say is amazing. The atmosphere and art made me feel engrossed in this tiny little world. It is beautiful. And while some players have tagged this "horror", I would say there is very little to do with horror. A few ghosts pop out or things move across the screen, but it is more just atmospheric than meant for a scare. Finally, yes, there are steam cards. They may not have been working when the reviewer below posted their review. But they work just fine, now.\n\nPros:\n-The art and atmosphere are beautiful.\n-The music is wonderful.\n-Puzzles to keep your mind working for a few hours.\n-Cute and simple story.\n\nPossible cons:\n-The game is rather short. Even I, who isn't the best at some puzzles, finished the game in 3 hours. So if you are hoping for an epic long game, this is not for you.\n-A game mechanic they relied on sometimes was simply "go back to where you were". Which I found frustrating. I never played any other puzzle game that used that. So when you have explored everywhere and can't figure out what to do, just go back to a room you've been in before and sparkles or ghosts might be there with the next step.","December 30, 2015","true","4.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

You play a detective investigating a missing boy, and this gives one of the good points of the game - your task list is very sensible, makes what you are doing logical and sensible, and things progress clearly as to what you are doing and why (as opposed to many HOGs where you just seem to randomly wander around finding items that you have no idea what you are going to do with, etc.), although with the proviso you seem completely unperturbed by the later tasks mostly are given to you by ghostly apparitions.\n\nA weak point is the layout of rooms/places, there are only really two locations in the game and the second one I found very confusing to navigate (especially outside), mostly relying on the hint button to get me to the right place rather than trying to work out how to get there myself. Another issue is it all being set in Venice, but we never really see anything of the city, just the inside of two houses and the grounds of the second which seems a bit of a waste of a great setting.\n\nOverall then a playable enough HOG with light horror elements, fairly short (probably a couple of hours if not repeatedly interrupted by cats), without any huge flaws but no great selling point either.","December 30, 2015","true","5.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

This one felt really phoned in, and it is extremely short- easy to beat in 3 hours.  But it was blissfully entertaining for how bad the plot was (if you like laughing at B rated films, this is up your alley), and had a few unique puzzles. If you can catch it at a substantial discount, go for it, but I would not recommend it, otherwise.\n\nFor a game set around a mystery narrative, it was very weak on the mystery. and the narrative.  Most of the plot felt like a first draft with blank characters and some clear plot holes. Everything is spelled out in the very beginning of the story, often in a very clunky and forced fashion, defying the overall dynamic of having a mystery to solve. The final encounter with the enemy is EXTREMELY anticlimactic and involves no sense of agency.\n\nThe aesthetic and startle moments beat you over the head with the message 'this is a horror! See? See the horror imagery!?' without even necessarily relating to the story or adding anything that hasn't been done to death before in the genre.\n\nThe weaknesses in the game are especially disappointing given that they have some very interesting puzzles, and even bring a few things into their object scenes that I have not seen before in comparable HOGs.\n\nThe in-game artwork itself is generally low grade (this speaking as someone who works in this field), though whomever was the UI artist clearly put a lot of love into making that aspect beautiful.\n\nOverall, I'd say that it did a couple things interestingly, but I'd much sooner recommend games like the Awakening, Dark Parables, Mystery Case Files, or Empress of the Deep franchises that do this genre really well.","January 28","false","5.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Took me 1h30 to finish the game, without skipping the cut scenes.\n\nYou play a detective called upon to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a young orphan.\nThe manager of the orphanage explains that since the boy disappeared, the place became hunted. Why, because of dark magic.\nYou go on a little journey in the orphanage, exploring the few rooms available, looking for clues on the boys whereabouts and who did this.\n\nI like the Goal list they incorporated in the game. Each time you accomplish a goal, they grey it out and when you've finished all the goals for the section and you need to head out, they establish new goals. You don't have to accomplish them in order, you just need to do them all to advance in the story line.\n\nThe hidden objects games are few, but with a little twist to them, the red objects in your list are hidden, you have to find them or accomplish an act to reveal them. Pretty fun.\nYou also have puzzle, which are fun and not to difficult.\n\nOver all, liked the game a lot and recommend it, if you don't mind it being a little short.","January 14","true","2.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

The HO scenes are a little different with a lot of HO within a HO requiring multiple actions to find a single object. The puzzles, however, range from very easy to incredibly hard, and it hits you with a very hard one right at the start, they do get easier for the most part.\nIf you are new the genre, there are better games out there.

It gives you this "ooh, mystery" vibe sometimes, but then the answer turns out to be pretty obvious and it's just a letdown. I also think that there are several plotholes around, like why the butler wanted eternal youth anyway, as obvious of an answer as "he just wants it" could be. Where did he even get that book on dark magic? Not to mention that I think it's pretty stupid that you never crossed paths and when you did, he just stumbled and fell and got strangled by a sea monster. :\\n\nThe goal list mechanic is useful only for the first part when you're looking for leads, but I feel that there should have been a way to incorporate that into the story progression and not just a list that says "do this". The navigation isn't intuitive, but at least the minigames are challenging. The art is also pretty nice. Weird voice acting though. They sounded like several people are saying the same lines at once.\n\nOverall, though, I don't think I can call this a good enough work to warrant a recommendation.","March 19","false","2.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The puzzles, though not particularily hard, are plenty, and most of them feel new (which is quite a treat after playing hundreds of HOPAs and being bored of the same puzzles being done over and over again).\n\nSadly, the puzzles are the only thing this game does right. First of all, it's awfully short - it took me less than two hours to finish it, including a dinner break. There are no Steam Trading Cards, though the store page says otherwise, so if you considered buying it at a bargain for the cards, don't. The cards are a lie.\n\nBut what's even worse is that this game is made so cheaply. The story falls flat. The graphics feel dated, the music is repetitive, and the voice acting is not only bad, but they didn't even get native speakers. Alawar is a Russian company, and the actors speak with such a heavy accent that "sheet music" ends up as "sh*t music" (I didn't make this up, I swear!). Also, the in-game messages are in bad English, too, e.g. mixing up "famous" with "infamous" or talking of someone as  "one of our have-beens" (still have no idea what this is meant to mean).\n\nLive is too short to play all Hidden Object Games on earth, even if they are short. Save your money on this one and make sure never to miss a game made by Polish studio Artifex Mundi, all of which are spectacular.\n\n\nEDIT\nIt looks as if the trading card bug has been repaired. I haven't played the game since, but at least "Dance of Death" has appeared in my list of possible badges. So if you purchase cheap games for the trading cards, go along.

Worth the $1.99 for 2 hours on simple games and mindless puzzles (that my pre-teen son can watch along with and "assist"), but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for the $9.99 normal price. Its a bit cheesy (to say the least), the puzzles are ultra simple, and, like I said - 2 hours of just meh story. I don't regret my purchase (yay sale), but truly wouldn't recommend it for their normal price. If you're going to spend that sort of money on a short game, I have better recommendations for sure!\n\nQuick game play. Graphics were okay, sometimes even cute. The story was a little sad, but still really cheesy and not truly believable. I wasn't coming into it expecting a 5 star experience, so there is that, at least :)  I didn't hate it, but... didn't love it either.","January 5","false","2.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Ended up becoming very boring, though. It has you do things but doesn't always let you progress. Ex: near the beginning it has you set up a bell to summon a gondola, iirc, but when clicking to activate the bell call, it states "it is too early to call (...)". You don't have a reason to sail yet but why have the option to set up the bell that early, then?","March 25","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No reason to replay but for the sale value of $1.00 it's enough of a time-killer to keep your attention if you're into standard puzzle conventions. It's nothing special, the same out-of-the-box brand you'll get from every other hidden object point-and-click you'll find on systems that come bundled with most bloat-wear computers. I would rate a 5/10. Not bad but nothing special either. The controls are pretty easy to figure out and the puzzles aren't too hard but the art leaves much to be desired. If you're a casual gamer it's something good for an hour of your time and money but if you're looking for something juicy and ground-breaking it's not this one.","February 12","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As some other reviews have said, it tries too hard to be spooky and comes off as more silly than anything. The puzzles were relatively simple, and the 'story' laughably so as well. The final (and only) confrontation you have with your main villain is anticlimactic, lacking any sense of fear past the "oh, hey there" moment when they first show up, and it ends up resolved in a manner that screams 'bad ten-year-old fanfiction.' It is also extremely short, clocking me in at only about an hour and a half, 30 minutes of which was spent away from the computer making myself a snack and tending my pets. Someone really focused could easily complete this in about 40 minutes. As it stands, I might have to load the game and just let it run to get the trading cards involved.\n\nAll in all, it's not the worst hidden object game I've ever played, being mostly functional (if a bit shabby in areas like voice acting and lip synching, along with the afformentioned areas), but unless you can get it for just a few pennies, I'd save your money for better games.","May 22","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
