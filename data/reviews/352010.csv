One thing I see thrown around is that the old version had a good plot, that's not true. The first version has a lot of the same problems I listed in my FIRST review of this visual novel. The characters are all just assembly line stereotypes or they have nothing to make them stand out from the others and they all just want to pull their knickers down for you as soon as they meet you. The sounds are at a bare minimum and they couldn't make the effort for shop doorbell sounds     (TO BE CONT.)\n\nThis review is based on the game's currrent state, as in Episode 1 and 2 only. When the game comes into episode 3, I will update the review in an organized format, this current review is merely my opinion of the game so far.\n\nAlright so, I know this game isn't complete yet, I know that so I won't say this is my permanent judgement on the game, but from what I have played so far I have many complaints.\n\n1. The characters, events and dialogue in this game are not good AT ALL whatsoever. There's this big emotional moment in this game having to do with a certain character's health condition and it's only focused on once and is not emotional AT ALL! The characters just accept this and carry on with their daily lives not giving a CRAP about someone's very serious health condition.\n\n2. No matter what you do each of the girls will come to you in a specific order and ask you to screw them. You still get a choice, but even if you avoid them the whole game they still come to you claiming they "love you" and that they want to screw you and be in bed with you... WHY! To make the donators happy? That's no excuse!\n\n3. There are NO SOUNDS FOR SHOP DOORBELLS! Come on, no sounds for shop doorbells? There's no sounds for any common noises or actions that you could easily just get.\n\n4.The dialogue is forced, rushed and a bit sloppy, it never feels like an actual conversation it just feels awkward and unreal as these conversations are so non-emotional and quick there's hardly any time for the characters to describe themselves well. Topping it off with spelling errors like "conffused" or "dokter"\n\n5. I don't feel any emotion to ANY of the events or characters described because the game forces them along like they are NOTHING!\n\n6. The characters are all one note wonders and are not complex at all.\n\n\nAs I said I will not fully judge this game yet as it's not complete but so far these are my problems with the game.\n\nAlso do not be fooled. Episode 2's update fixed no problems with the game at all. Do not get me wrong I don't want to disrespect the game's developing studio but it honestly feels like they didn't try at all while making this, it feels like they lazily slapped together a story, characters, and h-scenes all to make some money.","August 14, 2015","false","10.3"," 267 of 322 people (83%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","83","267","322","21","19"

The dialogues feel clumsy and emotionless so that you click forward hoping that the next screen will bring that 'Wow!' effect, but unfortunately, it won't happen.\n\nThe other downside is the very bad spelling/grammar throughout the text. It is riddled with spelling mistakes.\nDon't get me wrong, I am used to VNs with some spelling mistakes and I do make a fair share of spelling mistakes too, but in this game there are so many of them that it's impossible (for me) to pass over them.\nIt seems that the text hasn't been proofread at all and that the author might not be a native speaker.\n\nThe music is quite nice, but gets repetitive soon so you want to turn it off after a while.\nThe art style is nice and well drawn and it features some cute girls.\n\nI have clocked two hours into the game so I am at the limit for asking a refund but I guess I won't do it because devs can improve on the story/dialogues for part 2 and 3 and spelling mistakes can be corrected.\n\nBut at the present state I do not recommend to buy this game.","August 15, 2015","false","8.5"," 149 of 179 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","149","179","11","7"

Which means it is currently two badly written "episodes", with the third one being AWOL.\n\nDON'T buy the game in its current sad state!!\n\nEND UPDATE\n\nAt this point in time, this isn't a game, it's an expensive demo. A short demo, with the promise of more to come. Even with a rushed out patch, it's also a demo riddled with bad spelling and terrible grammar.\n\nHaving said that, the artwork is quite good, and there is some decent waifu potential in some of the characters. It'll be a bit of a wait before we see if this potential will be fulfilled though.\n\nShould you pick up the H version from elsewhere, you'll also be treated to some of the worst "intimate" scenes I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Not only are they 100% unbelievable, but the dialogue dips to an all time low, with zero quality control.\n\nCurrently, there is nothing to recommend here. I'll get back to it when it moves beyond demo state.\n\nUPDATE: "Episode 2" is out. It adds more scenes, new characters, hints at some kind of overarching plot, and lots of "intimate" scenes. It keeps the low quality writing, especially for the intimate encounters.\n\nI realize this will sell on boobs alone, which is just as well, since the artwork is the best thing about it.","August 16, 2015","false","8.8"," 144 of 173 people (83%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","83","144","173","15","0"

I cannot recommend it even if you're just in for the adult content; there's relatively little adult art and what's there has little variety.\n\nWithout spoiling the plot, short story short you end up working at the resort after you arrive. Everyone there is female of course and they want you big time. While 'working' you make chit-chat (filled with blushy "hehe", "hihi", and "tehihi") and end up going on dates after work, or just getting food and totally not going on a date. After realizing you are the epitome of the perfect man they throw themselves at you, leaving you the all-important plot choice of bang or don't bang (which happens to make up the majority of decisions in the game). You may think this is a gross exaggeration and there's lots of build-up, tension, seduction, perhaps even romance involved, but more than once you literally get a knock at your door and get propositioned on the spot. In the two currently present chapters your decisions make no difference apart from a few changed sentences. 5 out of the 7 women in the game's banner art will offer themselves to you no matter what you do, the rest doubtless to follow in later chapters. The actual plot is brought up only occasionally and you just spend your time chatting up the ladies so far.\n\nThe game's artwork on the whole is fine, but it's scarce. There's one girl you actually do a fair number of non-bed activities with, but all you get are some sentences over the area's background CG and character portrait instead of art to capture the moment. It's no secret that this is an X-rated game and a big selling point for the Steam version is that there's an official uncensor patch. Without the patch you end up getting a pink screen transition to the next scene with lipstick marks just before nudity would occur. What do you get with the patch? The image that normally transitions away has layers of clothing disappear as you get dialogue with oohs and ahhs. For fear of violating the Steam guidelines I won't give any quotes, but it actually felt like I was reading a satire of erotic literature. The image is always just the girl splayed out so don't expect much variety.\n\nBut hey, maybe things can change. They say they will "completely remaster the existing story-lines of episodes one and two". That sounds to me like it will be substantially rewritten rather than a simple spelling/grammar touch-up.","December 18, 2015","false","10.8"," 83 of 96 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","83","96","10","0"

Everything seemed fine for lets say 10 minutes. But, and thats a very big one, it has nearly no choice and nothing seems to have an effect on what i can do. It looks like just option 1 for girl A and option 2 for girl 2! And you end with the girl. And not just end it, it really ends with the first and last, lets say private moment. Thats so fast i couldnt even tell it happend.\nI accept that there are stereotypes and other mishaps, but this seems so off and without thought. No character design, just the next unfinished "game" from ajtilley.com.

Because, yeah, why should you finish a game if you just tell your customers there are episodes or a "new" game waiting for them.\n\nThis is not a game, nor an episode. It's pure scam.

(I'm not going to post the link, becuase I'm not sure if it's allowed to do so. It's a Google search away, however.)\n\nBefore I go into the pros and cons of this game let me explicitly state that I'm reviewing this from the perspective of someone looking to see scantily clad anime chicks doing naughty things. Do not buy this with intentions of being drawn into an immersive, deep world with a complex plot. This is very much a harem/slice of life game that takes inspiration from its simplistic anime relatives. The difference being one you watch with full animation while the other you click through dialogue and watch slightly animated CG cutscenes. The result is about the same.\n\n\nPROS:\n- The art style is attractive enough and you get what you pay for with a game like this.\n- The writing is subpar and there are typos, but the plot is still coherent and easy to follow and the girls talk dirty enough to get your jimmy a rustlin'.\n- If you're not playing the hentai version, the CG scenes are still relatively raunchy and the scantily clad women abound.\n- Despite what people say about the characters, each of them are pretty distinct from one another, if not fulfilling a typical stereotype for the genre.\n- The soundtrack gets a bad rap, because you're having to listen to the songs on repeat as you click through dialogue. Not sure what everyone expected. On its own, it's a pretty solid compiling of music and worth a listen to.\n\nCONS:\n- I feel like the price is a little steep. Ten USD probably would have been more fair, if not lower like five USD.\n- While playing, the soundtrack can get pretty repetitive. I'd suggest listening to the tracks as you move through the areas, but muting the music when in a single location for a while. The sound effects are on a separate volume option of the music, thankfully.\n- The writing is subpar and there are several typos. I wouldn't mind the plot so much since, as I mentioned earlier, it's just like any other simple harem story, but the typos make me feel like they could have been more thorough with their proofreading.\n\n\nOverall, I'll recommend it because there are two more "Episodes" coming which is going to be a pretty decent extra amount of action. But I HIGHLY recommend that you get the adult/hentai version from a place like MangaGamer before you buy the Steam version.\n\n11/10 would get seduced by Sakura on the first day again.","August 17, 2015","true","1.8"," 100 of 130 people (77%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","77","100","130","23","2"

There is a chance, that the future chapters will increase in its quality, i´d usually give a "perhaps" but since that doesn´t work here, I´ve chosen not to recommend it - at least for the moment. If the Devs are going to at least introduce the main cast a bit more in one of the next chapters, this might change.\n\nOn the positive side,\n- I have to admit that I like the art-style ... most of it looks quite nice and decently produced.\nAnd the game mechanics work quite well (ill let you decide, how positive that is in a VN)\n- the intro doesnt make your ears bleed, compared with a couple of other VNs\n- most of the typos have been taken care of with the second patch\n\nOn the negative side this title has quite a handful of problems in my opinion:\n- the whole female cast is somewhat shallow. Most of them are kind of unpleasant to deal with. In the whole cast (at least in the current state of the game) there are two characters I would call sympathic. The rest ? Well, let me put it this way ... there is a saying in Germany ... "I´d rather jam my thing in the doorframe and beat it with a shoe, than touching one of those !"\n- there´s barely any variety in the game´s music, it´s somewhat repetetive\n- if you bought the "Adult Version" or have the patch, the H-Scenes somehow feel completely out of place. You can literally "feel" that they where simply a Stretchgoal in the kickstarter. The text in the H-Scenes are even worse ...\n\nit reminds me somehow of a german Comedyshow, i´ve seen years ago:\n\nImagine a german wannabe-pornstar with a heavy saxony accent "oh yes, you ***** stud, come make me a woman, oh yes, oh yes" ...

I know this was meant to be a fan service game, with girls all over the MC. But honestly, the full price is just insanely expensive for such a short and rushed VN. I haven’t played the “original version” (like I read on other reviews), but I know that this current version ain’t good. Art style is decent/good, backgrounds were nicely done… But the background songs sometimes don’t match the events during the game (like an overly happy song playing during on what was supposed to be a sad scene), same with the character’s facial expressions and the text. It might be a minor thing… But it bothers me.\n\n4/10. Oh, another thing that bothered me was that the MC’s sprite was like a shadow… But you can see his face clearly on CG’s (especially the one where Mineko kisses him). So why make him like a shadow if his actual appearance has already been decided? ._.\n\nWell, if you get this game on a bundle, it’s fine.

In all honesty, solidly average.  When someone whispers (or shouts) about "Those durn smutty cartoon/anime games!", sadly, Beach Bounce is more than likely (one of many of) the game(s) the yammerer has in mind.  And I did go through the trouble to peruse both Steam and Patched versions to make sure I had a complete opinion. And I will say this: the patch is a must.  The game just FEELS edited without it, which is the biggest goof a mature subject game can make when releasing an AO version alongside an M/T-rated version(See FATE/Stay Night).\n\nSo, which buttion am I pushing?  My honest opinion is that the Patched version is a decidely marginal ci, the Steam version edits are too disruptive to the already emaciated storyline to want to push anything but the q button.  But I can't push both buttons...\n\nAnd Steam won't let me push neither.

Its abit more complicated than that but its the gisit of it. So lets get down to the game itself.\n\nThe Art is great, I do enjoy the art style here and do wish there were a few more CGs for all of the characters.

As of right now, September 1st, 2015, game is realy short.  There is not only very few content, but also it is realy easy to "digest," making the gameplay super short.  Story wise however, it is like a TV show, but with some choises and interaction.  Yes, there is some "nudity," but very minimal, which feels adequate.  Overall I recommend this game as a "one to two hours killer"  more than anything.  First DLC is comming in October, but the wait is really long for the amount of content.  Still enjoyable though.","September 3, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Or rather Hentai as you would call. I bought it with bundle expecting something totally diffrent, and if not for that I would get dissapointed with paying full or even half prize of this.\n\nYou will have a lot of lust going on from the very beginning and actually predictable straight forward plot. Character development is rather simple, and not deep. It doesn't mean though that all of them are badly executed (just like for these type of Nukige games). You will find here an scheme types.\n\nTo the point: Should you buy it? You look for some lust focused datesim you will get it. You want heart-warming VN with great personalities? No no no get away from this one. It may pass as an date game with some sweeter scenes not completely concentrated on sex. But these moments are rather rare to this game. I will propably complete this overall its not weak game, still in development for further episodes. Weakest point of the game is that there is to much short scenes, rather then emotional building up. You may not be soo open minded as me, it's even hard for me to get through some actions and logic of most girls. Hardly but afterall I decide to recomend it.

The music is good, I like the character designs (Mineko is adorable - SHE is the girl I most want to end the game getting because that's the sort of girl I like IRL), and there's plenty of different ways things can go.  The consequences of all of my choices are not immediately evident (the only one I am able to see is where I chose to go to the nightclub and got to bed Sakura down afterward).  Some however, are immediate and game altering ( if you drink beer instead of coke and you turn Sakura off and irritate Yuuki the next morning\n\nNow I will concede the haters one point: I would have liked to have had a little more game to play before the game told me "Well that's all for now - Part 2 will be released in October".  Liked what I got but, true to human nature, I want more.\n\nThe only other gripe I have is the  rampant grammatical/spelling errors.  YE GODS AJTILLEY, HAVE YOU NEVER HERAD OF SPELL CHECKER? HIRE A BLOODY PROOFREADER!  Hell, you can even PM me and I'll do it for you FOR FREE\n\nAll in all I am glad I took the chance on this game and I'm looking forward to the release of the next two parts.","August 17, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

It was actually remade by another developper while keeping the big lines. If it's the first time you look at the game it won't matter to you but in some way it feel inferior to the original path the game took.\n\nThe story is the same, you go help at your Grandmother's resort and it's obviously full of young women and you happen to be the only young men there. But most character don't feel fleshed out enough this time, it feels rushed to make more sex scenes.\n\nIf that is what you want, download the uncensored patch and go for it because there are multiples intercourses in the game.\n\nIf you want a good story it would be better to look at other Visual Novel first even though Beach Bounce is not bad, it's simply unsatisfying.\n\nArt and Music are good. The spelling and grammars issues of the first version are not returning in this new remastered version so at least it's good on the eyes and ears.\n\n---\nOld Update 2015-10-18:\n\nPart 2 was released this week.\n\nIt feels shorter but seems to bring some more story elements and even a new character. Maybe I missed some very specific parth but it feels like part 2 is pretty straighforward with choices not meaning much until probably part 3. Spelling was corrected in the first part and seems fine for part 2. It would probably be better to wait two more months for the full game at this point.\n\n---\nOriginal Review:\n\nThe game is divided in three parts and at the time of this review only part 1 is released. Part 2 and 3 are included and should be released this year.\n\nThere are a lot of visual novels coming on Steam including more and more non-japanese novels. It's hard to find quality amongst all thoses games. I personally try them all because I enjoy the experience and seeing developpers evolve and improve.\n\nAs for this one in particular, it's far from perfect, especially the spelling was pretty bad but has been patched almost the same day as release. As of the next patch the spellings and text should be fine. The script is not shakespeare's quality and the story itself is pretty basic but enjoyable. Don't buy this game thinking about getting the new Fate Stay Night or Hirugashi.\n\nThe pacing seems a bit quick but maybe they want to get the introductions over quick and the next parts will be a bit slower. You have the standard girls like clumsy, tsundere, joyful and strict so as of part 1 don't expect super special characters. They seems to have some depth to them but you only learn about it on some specific paths. Only one playthrough may leave you wondering if you skipped something.\n\nThe art is pretty clean and nice, I did not really notice the music but it is there. For now there are no voices and I think no sound effects. The engine itself is pretty good, you can pick destinations on a map while as of part one it's usually between only two choices. Don't expect a dating sims but it's a visual novels with some choices and paths.\n\nI would like Steam to have a maybe option. I picked Yes because there are usually uncalled No reviews without any substance. You should pick it at a reduced price or at least wait until the whole game is done to see what other people think at that time. As of part 1, it's too hard to judge if the whole game will really be good or not.","August 16, 2015","true","6.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Even the uncensored version is heavily censored compared to the original game.  I'm really not sure what was going through Dharker Studio's heads when they decided to make it so much tamer after we waited so long for this "remastered" version.\n\nThe story really isn't any better and is possibly even worse.  It's a real shame because they have some great art but they are afraid to use it.  What are they so afraid of?  They had absolutely nothing to lose by keeping the large amount of gratuitous nudity that the original version had.  But by toning the remastered version down, they have lost this customer.  I will never buy a game from them again, all of their games so far are generic and weak.

Very lovable I must say, especially if you read his lines in a posh british accent, it makes him feel like some sort of anime version of Hugh Grant.\n\nThe only thing that bothered me was the lack of voice acting and animation, especially in the sex scenes.

Went to load it up after an update and it crashed. The release was a major change, from original to remastered editions so it should not be an issue anymore. Appreciate the dev for upgrading everyone but a bunch of the story was changed in the switch. Characters, their tones, verbal responses, as well as the main character introductions and more were rewritten. Rewriting the story and changing it around was fine. The part I'm confused about is that after taking time to remaster the game they still had quite a few spelling and grammatical errors left it the script. No one's perfect, but a lot of these are glaring.\n\n- Placing those notes aside, the game follows a main character that is helping out his grandma while she's in the hospital. He helps out around a Beach resort that she owns. You are introduced to various workers and visitors of the resort and depending on who you help, the visual novel steers your character more towards spending more time with them.\n\n- If you enjoy visual novels and since they're doing a sequel to this game - Pick this up, won't take you forever to read it and if it's on sale it should make up for the spelling issues.

You just get some backstory on characters and you just see the girls as horny women that you don't know much about. Still, there is no feel to the characters, I don't have much attachment to any of the characters, not even the protagonist. Sometimes there is just an instant event that probably won't affect your feelings much due to the lack of relatable things with the characters. Music is still good to the ears but the game itself; well thats for you to decide. If you hunt for a visual novel where the characters are engaging and relatable and will provide you with a feel or two, then Beach Bounce is not for you. If you don't care about story and just go for the anime tiddies and bits then this may suit your needs. If you don't care about any of those and just like visual novels, then I recommend this.\n\nAugust 29, 2015 *UPDATED*\nThe small mispellings have been fixed making the sentences less awkward to read. The 18+ patch has been sent out making my Mangagamer version obsolete. Overall, you have a visual novel that includes many potential best girls to choose from while keeping things at a serious tone. This visual novel isn't all about happy fun times, you have some saddening news in-game while meeting the girls helps boost your mood. Devs have been working hard fixing the game and that is really appreciated.\nNot the best story oriented visual novel, but it does do it's best in being a fun one. Would recommend for avid VN players. Soundtrack also available on Steam which is also a plus.\n\n\nAugust 16, 2015\n(Don't mind my playtime, I have adult version)\nIf you like visual novels then sure, you can get this one.\nThere's some small mispellings and sometimes it makes the sentence awkward to read but I don't mind it too much. I feel as my protagonist is a bit too formal at the beginning; saying father, mother, and grandmother abit much feels very awkward (to me).\nCharacters are introduced pretty quickly and you might not get a good bond with all of them for a while. (However Yuuki seems to be best girl instantly). The art is fantastic and the music is pretty nice. Overall, it's not the best I've played but it definitely deserves to be in the "Good" section.","August 16, 2015","true","14.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","9","21","2","0"

I recommend it to newtime VN players and to veterans who want something shorter before they play their next 40 hr one.\nI'll say this first; this game is relatively short. After completing 100%, my steam time says I've played 120 minutes, though I did use the skip feature to miss previously read text. The game also doesn't have voice, being made in Ren'py.\nHowever, the game is very well made, and the art is really nice, although all static images.\n\nThere are plenty of branch options leading to the different endings, which help to make you feel like you're Tomo (the protaganist) aiding in your immersion. The choices generally feel like they are doing something worthwhile; only a couple feel like they're there for the sake of it.\nThere are seven girls to choose from. Each of the characters is interesting, and their personalities are fun, although Nymph could have been fleshed out a little better, though arguably she is only a side character, and a little more history for Minami wouldn't have hurt.\n\nI really recommend this game; it was enjoyable, made me chuckle a few times, and despite the girls having Japanese names, the game doesn't have a tonne of Japanisms, so is accessible to those who aren't as familiar with Japanese culture; this means I can recommend it to all VN players, old and new to the scene alike.\n\nIf you are of age, I highly recommend the uncensor patch available at the developer's website; although the game is fine without the adult scenes, its more enjoyable with them. Apart from a little bit of "messiness", they're quite tastefully done, and help to make the characters feel more rounded.\n\nPros:\n-Nice story.\n-Fun characters. (Seven girls to choose from)\n-Good art, the CGs are nice to look at.\n-Nice range of branch options.\n-Doesn't require understanding of Japanese culture, so beginner friendly.\n-Some humour, enough to cause a chuckle, but without using typical tropes.\n-(With uncensor patch) Tasteful art, nothing over the top, helps to make you care about the characters more.\n-Only 120-180 minutes to completion. (Both a pro and con - you decide)\n\nCons:\n-Static images. (no Nekopara-style character movement)\n-No voice-acting.\n-Nymph could be a better character with more to her. (but doesn't feel like a main heroine so not too big a deal)\n-Only 120-180 minutes to completion. (Both a pro and con - you decide)","April 11","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many of the meaningless choices were removed and the characters are more likeable post rewrite.  The music is still a bit sub par and the story while no longer terrible is not really good.\n\nThis finally has a finished story and decent artwork.  I am changing to a cautious recommendation if you are a fan of harem comedy VNs.   Wait for a sale to get the best value for this shortish game.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nPrior to the rewrite:\nEpisode One: Decent, a fair number of options and interesting characters, some more likable than others.  I was happy enough that I would have suggested it at that point.\nEpisode Two: Disapointing, it added a bit of content but felt compact and rushed.   Some of the character interactions seemed forced.\nEpisode Three: Overdue, with no new release date.\n\nI am afraid I can't reccomend this game at this point, episode three has to turn out awesome to redeem the hot mess that was Episode 2.  The fact that there is no update or word on Ep. 3 makes me worried that it will be rushed or it will never come.\n\nStay away, save your cash for better VNs there are a ton of them on Steam.\n\nEdit:  If you want to see the adult content you have to buy the game somewhere else.  This is another strike against it.\n\n______________________________________","January 28","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only played a little of the original so I can't really compair the two. What I do sort of remember is that in the beginning u have a more back story while waiting at a bus stop to go to Beach Bounce in the original. I have no idea why the remaster would remove this part. In honestly takes away from the story when removing a part like this. I suggest watching a playthrough on Youtube if u want to see part of the original. The original only had two parts out of three released so it's incomplete though.\n\nI really wish we found out more backstory about the characters. I would of loved to learn more about granda Umi.\n\nAt least the BG, art of the characters, and the music are very nice. My favorite track is when u are in  the games menu. I just love the track:) Also for some reason when ever u would be in Tomoyo's room the room never changes to dark. U have dialouge that u know is night time, but the room is still very sunny LOL. It's to bad a BG wasn't made for a night time transition.\n\nDo watch out because the game does have mispellings here and there. It didn't bother me though as I understood what was being said despite the errors in the spelling.\n\nIn all honestly the only two things that really bugged me was that there was no BG night time transition to indicate right away that it's night time. Plus flesh out the characters more.\n\nI would really only get this VN on a sale or better in a bundle. I got this on a bundle. The full price is not worth this VN since the VN could have been even better.

I played the first 2 episodes of the original release of Beach Bounce and waited and waited for Episode 3. Then I learned that the writer left them high and dry so they had to start over with the game and we got Beach Bounce Remastered. There were quite a few changes in the story from the original to the Remastered version. Most of them I liked but a few I'm not so sure about. I know the art was exactly the same in this version which was a great thing because I really enjoy the art style in these games from AjTilley now Dharker Studio. I liked the choice system being shown above the map with text although you didn't know who would be there but it was usually pretty easy to guess. One big thing I noticed that I'm not sure whether I liked or disliked is Mineko didn't stutter anymore like she did in the original so they completely changed her character. They didn't seem to change any of the others that I noticed. Now with the dislikes, the game seems shorter maybe it's just because it's not split up. I don't really know but it seems smaller somehow. I think it's probably because it's easier to focus on one girl now which is a good thing because it's lees confusing so maybe I should change my view on that one. Another thing I disliked was some of the music tracks I liked from the original are used but not as much in this version. For example if you played the original, the track that played during Sakura's love scenes is hardly used at all in the Remastered version and they don't use it at all in her love scenes in Remastered. I know these are minor complaints and I look forward to the sequels in the Bounce series. I hope this review helps to answer any questions you might be having about this game.","June 5","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And... it's just as long as the first one.  But longevity isn't the problem, it's the content. It's more of the same thing like the first part was. What was the point of waiting for few months? I was expecting a chunk of story and CG. They bothered to show places where you will be visiting and things that you will be able to work and pick, it didn't go anywhere in this one.  I was expecting to get to know characters more at least, but conversation are still forced and jump from one small topic to other, and you're dragged into another scene. You go to the beach, talk to a chick and scene fades to black where apparently swimming happens off-screen, scene switches back where there is only one comment that swimming was good.  As for multiple choices in the story, so far it's mostly if you wanna sleep with girl or not. If you don't, she will be mad or disappointed and if you do, they will brag to other characters you sleep with. But nobody minds... In fact some are intrigued by it.\n\nArt is fine, slight alterations in conversation based on with whom you slept  is interesting to see and that's about it. If you're getting this for the characters you better off getting some other VN. This showed a lot of promise, but it's just empty... I did enjoy it a bit, and out of charity I'll give it a thumbs up. Hopefully they do some work with the third part, but I doubt it.\n\nEDIT: They totally changed the game after this remastered thing... it's even worse then before.
