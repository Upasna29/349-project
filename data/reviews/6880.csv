He is an agent sent in to the island San Esperito. Our mission is to kill a dictator Mendoza and free the island from his reign.\n\nBack when this game came out I found it quite impressive. The Island is massive, but it doesn't matter cause there is nothing to see there. All of it is just a big jungle which all of it looks the same. There are small villages which act as outposts and you can clear them out.  The city is uninspiring and there's nothing to do there.\n\nThe gameplay is by far the weakest third person shooter I have ever seen. The shooting feels clunky and sometimes my shots don't even connect with the enemies, not to mention most guns are weak as hell, and the better weapons have low ammo counts.\n\nThe graphics (apart from the CGI cut scenes) are still great. The lush island is awesome and getting a boat and going through the rivers is really fun, but as stated before there's nothing to see, but it's still fun.\n\nThe driving controls are some of the worst driving controls I have ever seen, they even top the driving controls in Watch Dogs. Since unlike in Just Cause 2 you can't travel with the grappling hook, so most of the time you will need to use vehicles.\n\nThe game also has side quests, but most of them are boring as hell and you can grind them since they never end. So if you want something more with the game after you're done you can do the mundane side quests.\n\nThe game took me 6 hours to finish, once the game is finished you can explore the island, but as stated before there's nothing to do there.\n\nThe game also has a major spike in difficulty in the final missions, so be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nOverall even though the game didn't age well, it's still fun to play for a bit, but it's the weakest in the series. In the end I will give this a positive review, but I still suggest playing Just Cause 2 instead.\n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10 - Okay\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 16","true","6.0"," 137 of 153 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","137","153","10","5"

The second game was great, but it didn't make me laugh nearly as much as the first.","February 3, 2015","true","19.4"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","95","76","80","44","5"

And editing config files won't do crap for you.\n\nTo get your game to run in your monitor's native resolution, you're gonna need one of two versions of this program called res changer..\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/6880/discussions/0/846959520923192823/\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/6880/discussions/0/594821545181783362/\n\nVersion 1 or 2. Try 2 because it's newer. If it doesn't work, 1 might. 2 didn't work for me, so I had to use 1. Only drawback to having to use 1 is that it has no support for windowed mode like 2. And that alt-tabbing with 1 crashes your game. But, hey, it works. And I almost refunded my game. Looked awful downscaled. Game may be old, but still should have had more resolution support.\n\n- Very few graphics settings.\n\nYou're gonna need to force AA, AF, etc on from your video driver control panel. Everything in menu only affects quality of textures, shadows, and post-processing FX.\n\nOverall, the game is a good game.

Tremendous freedom, with multiple approaches to two thirds of the main missions(parachute in, burst through the front, sneak in, etc.). If you're in a vehicle moving fast, or you make a vertical jump of about a dozen meters or more, you can engage your parachute, from where you can comfortably shoot or grapple to any vehicle. Shooting is like a proper third person shooter, not like GTA3 and Vice City. Vehicles include cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters and planes, all of these types can come armed with machineguns and/or rockets, and all of them useful: sail, since you're in an island paradise, and going across water may be the shortest distance between two points; helicopter flight is easily the most flexible way to travel, because of mountains and sea; and planes are by far the fastest way to travel far. Control is great, no matter what you travel by. Fairly challenging. Limits on ammo and weapon carry capacity(two pistols, two types of C4, and another two guns - choose carefully between SMGs, assault and sniper rifles, RPGs and a grenade launcher) ensure that you are careful in shootouts. A fun arcade game.\n\nCons: Very clearly rushed, with glitches and bugs. Nothing to do once you've completed the short story and liberated all enemy zones and/or completed a certain number of the uninspired, crushingly inconsequential and repetitive side-missions. Characters are bland, and there's little to the story, meaning there's almost no "meat" to what's going on(the fun stuff is all in the game-play). Over half of the large island nation is forest and sea. Too many story missions are samey.\n\nMy recommendation: If you can live with its rather rough edges, this is among the most fun open-world games.","December 31, 2013","true","45.9"," 52 of 63 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","52","63","0","0"

But...\nThe storyline wasn't that good, it was really short (only 21 story missions) and nothing like a good storyline.\nI also came along soem bugs, not that many, but they were there.\nThe missions weren't that great either. The first ones were fine but they were -pretty much- all the same throughout the story.\nThe graphics were ok for a game from that time, it looked a little bit like GTA Liberty City.\n\nAnd now you are probably wondering why I gave this review recommend? It's because I like explosions, and this game has a lot of explosions... Exept for the last mission wich I didn't understand (but that might just be me) and I got shot at by around 2 million tanks. But then again I really enjoyed it!\n\nSo, concluding to this review, I would recommend this game to people who like explsions, action, explosions and a freaking large map.\n\nThis was my first review and I hope you enjoyed it :)\n","April 9, 2014","true","11.5"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","1"

It's basically the same game, except actually finished. This one only has inklings of ideas which were never developed, and simply has no polish whatsoever. For example, take the settlement takeover missions, which are a cool idea and which you'll probably be doing a lot. "Missions" might be too generous. There's basically only one (shoot enemies, destroy roadblock #1, shoot enemies, destroy roadblock #2, shoot enemies, destroy roadblock #3, rush to flag / kill a specific enemy - the only difference you can spot between them is that when taking over cities you don't have to destroy roablocks), which you will be doing over and over and over and over again. Do you at least get something cool for your troubles? Nope, just a new save point and a color of some pixels flipping on the map. Or take the combat, which you'll be doing a lot of. The game has only two levels of enemy threat. "Light drizzle" if they are using bullets, "instagib" if they're using explosives. For your own part, you'll have tiny, hard to see crosshairs (if you play at any real resolution)... or extremely intrusive autoaim which kicks in while you're manning vehicle weapons (which are another cool idea on their own) and which will actually very often prevent you from shooting what you want to shoot (say, the barricade rather than all the random soldiers all over the place). Or take the grappling hook, which is an amazingly fun tool in JC2, and which is an unreliable and unwieldy piece of crap in this game. The whole thing is just extremely rushed and upolished.\n\nAgain, just get JC2 instead.

Yet, everything wrong with this game somehow works in its favor.  It's fairly easy to get lost in the world and start collecting things only to be interrupted by military forces, in which the surprisingly excellent gunplay grants you access to their car and a massive chase sequence that usually involves hilariously bad AI, being absolutely swarmed by enemy vehicles, and lots of stunt jumping.  The missions are solid, the voice acting is cringeworthy, and overall the game is somewhat enjoyable as a budget title.\n\nThe biggest flaw, however, is its lack of polish and special mechanics.  My problem with this game is that I can't help but compare it to its legendary successor, Just Cause 2.  I know the hardware was limited and they really did make the most of Xbox/PS2 hardware, but it doesn't change the fact that after so many hours of JC2, the upgrades from game to sequel definitely hurt in trying to go back.\n\nIf you have a crappy computer, want some time to kill, or just want to see where this series began, there's a fair chance you might get your moneys' worth here.  On any half-decent computer, however, I'd recommend skipping straight to its sequel.  JC2 is a damn near perfect game, and there's a reason it outshines its predecessor.","December 25, 2015","true","1.2"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","21","31","8","0"

Sometimes when exploring the island you can get stuck in some areas and at some moments of the game it felt like a desert, like no NPC's until the next gas station or village. Also the grapplin mechanic is a bit hard to get used to and this game NEEDS multiplayer. But overall I've had tons of fun exploring the  island, flying planes and parachuting around, I would defenitly recommend this game to anybody looking for a large open world with good graphics that doesnt need a beats PC to run.","April 16, 2014","true","13.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

You can trace a lot of elements of modern games back to this particular title, both good and negative ones.\n\nOn the other hand, I personally just played it because I feel a compulsive need to start with the first game of any franchise, and I think Just Cause 3 looks like a lot of fun, so 1 and 2 have to get ticked off the list.\n\nWhat does the game do right?\n- Humor so bad it's good.\n- Dialogue so bad it's good.\n- Gun play that is fairly satisfying and fun.\n\nWhat does the game to wrong?\n- Visually it's very bland. By that I mean that the graphics are as you'd expect from a 2006 title, perhaps even a little sub-par, but all throughout the game you see the same assets, the same jungle, the same tiny villages over and over again.\n- The gameplay is extremely repetitive, and if you're just playing this to get it off your bucket list and be able to at least claim you've done it, then there's no reason to go clear out all the outposts. When it comes to pointless sidequests and activities to keep you playing, this game makes Far Cry 4 look reasonable.\n\nI will recommend this game purely on the basis that it's two evenings of cheesy fun that can be bought for a it of loose change on sale.","March 23","true","6.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegiofma/recommended/6880/","thegiofma","guck cuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegiofma/","111 products in account","I really want to recommend this game, but there are more negatives than positive. Almost everything has a problem with it.\n\nJust Cause is the first game in the Just Cause series, made by Eidos Studios. After a few years, Square Enix took the developing rights of JC and made Just Cause 2, a HUGE improvement to the first one.\n\nLet's start off with the graphics. They O.K for 2006, but it could've definetely been improved. Rico Rodriguez, the game's main protagionist, has the most bland outfit ever. (All black. Is he Goth or something?) The cutscenes look WAY better than the actual game, but seeing what exactly the cutscenes look, I'd stick with the normal graphics. Another thing that threw me off is that they have 1280 x 600 and 1600 x 1200, but no 1366 x 768. Why not? Surely there would've been 1336 x 768 back then. Not a big problem, but a little annoying.\n\nNext, the story. Basic. You are Rico Rodriguez, Agency agent. You must fight the evil forces of the president of San Esperito, Salvador Mendoza by blowing up stuff, helping a guerilla army fight the corrupt police and helping Yellow drug cartel fight Purple drug cartel. That's kinda it. Or that's all I know, for now. I haven't finished the game yet, nor do I have any intention of. This is more simple than your regular oh-no-guy-killed-family-must-kill-all-living-things movie. Like I said, I haven't finished the game yet, but I wished the story had more depth. More complexity.\n\nThe combat. Oh sweet Jesus. Where to start? If you hit a car, member, or other vehicle of the police or Purple drug cartel, THEY WILL BE UP YOUR ♥♥♥! They will send loads of cars and trucks and helicopters after you. It's fun, until you get out of your flaming car and either get killed by the explosion or the flurry of bullets. If you DO happen to survive, you can shoot 'em. But, you might be outnumbered. There are a lot of weapons, and utilizing them is your #1 priority. The problem is, when you die, you lose ALL your weapons, except for your (crappy) grappling hook and your dual pistols, which conviently have infinite ammo. And your safehouses, the places you spawn at, have certain weapons. For example, one safe house has a bazooka and shotgun, but another one has a machine gun and a pistol. So if you want a big arsenal, you're gonna cross the whole map building it up, only to die to that stray missile from that Apache.\n\nAnd now, the enemies. There are the police, who fight the guerillas occasionaly and mostly lose. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you might see a guerilla helicopter shoot at a police car or van and explode in a unimpressive explosion. There are also liberations, which involves storming a town with other guerilla soldiers while fighting police and SWAT and a po-po heli. There are also roadblocks, depending on the size of the town. Little ones, roadblocks. Big ones, a swarm of army soldiers. Also fighting with you is the Yellow drug cartel, who is fighting Purple drug cartel. There are also liberations here, but you're fighting Purple drug cartel instead of police. The missions are as hard as hell sometimes, like one where you have to destroy coca fields. When I completed that objective and went to a bar to complete it, I was running away on some baggage carrier modified to spray chemicals while Purple drug cartel and police are shooting me from every direction. About 400 meters from my destination, I had to leg it, chased by numerous Purple drug cartel and police bikes and vans and a helicopter. I reached the bar just in time, when I only had a little line of health.\n\nCONCLUSION: This game definetly has its good features, like adrenaline-pumped moments and blowing up stuff, but it is light, compared to the bad features. This game felt like it was an idea, not completed or polished. I definitely recommend the second JC, which is an actual game instead of an experiment like this game.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 4/10","October 28, 2014","false","30.0"," 51 of 92 people (55%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","55","51","92","10","1"

The diolog is probably just the worst, the story doesn't exist, and the graphics have not aged well compared to a lot of other games.\n\nAlso not helped by the buggy nature of some missions, including the last one where you have to ignore what the mission tells you. Go back to shore and get and attack chopper, and then finally begin to get through the finall 3 ending missions. Instead of going in on foot and being blown sky high.\n\nAnd while the graphics can be a bit of a choppy mess. It more than makes up for that fact, by having some of the best Keyboard and Mouse controlls I've seen in a Sandbox game. They felt so natural, that I never gave using a controller a single thought. Where as games like GTA3 and Vice City are far too sloppy and buggy in there controlls, as to make the game pointlessly hard to play. Even the Reical in GTA Vice City is no where near as acurate as Just Cuase.\n\nSo bugs, bad voice acting, cheesy cut sceens aside. You still have a game that is plotless, but these odd quirks only help to give it a silly late 80's or early 90's action vibe. Mindless but fun. And with that, it's still very fun to play and is even compadable with Windows 10.

And you will be pleasantly surprised if you try it. Because, even though it predates the physics-defying grandeur of JC2, the original JC is less of an action adventure title and more of an absolutely crazy open-world third person shooter. As its specs are floored, it runs on anything made after 2007, and the mouse input is not to be sniffed at, neither is the gunplay. While it doesn't have controller support or native support for non-4:3 resolutions it is nonetheless a solid shootbang title for when the grandeur of Panau is a bit too much.\n\nPlus the main character looks like my cousin when he was about my age, minus a few years.","July 30, 2014","true","1.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Not much else about the music though.\nThe gameplay? it's kind of good. being an old game the gameplay is short though, but that's okay, you can just challenge yourself to get 100%, and it's actually possible here, unlike it's sequel.\nSo, why is it that i hate enemy helicopters so much? I'll tell you in detail.\nFirst, 2 enemy copters spawn, and spam machine gun fire at you, you must think that you should get a car to outrun the fire, NOPE! while getting in the car they decide to spam missles suddenly. 8 times out of 10 killing you. Sure, you get a grappling hook, but it's not the mystical death hookshot it is in JC2, this one lets you... PARAGLIDE BEHIND CARS!

Yeah, the game has its bugs, for ex, i found myself inside a truck... on my motorbike, and also the clumsy gameplay when driving a vehicle.\nBut even though it's 5 years older than GTA III and 2 older than Far Cry, it's a sort of mix of both with a good variety of vehicles, guns and missions (mostly the main ones, the side missions are kinda repetitive).\nThe grappling hook is a great accessory, which is really hard to dominate (but if you do, it'll make the game a lot easier), like the game itself... this is one of the points that i like the most, its difficulty, i died over and over in several missions, a real challenge, and that's a "thing" that has lost in time.\nLike an argentinian guy, i saw Rico as an latin american Ethan Hunt, where he faces a whole army in different situations to get to the head: El Presidente Mendoza.

You'll laugh at differences in Tom Sheldon's voice and probably cry at the fact that you still don't have a grappling hook after the first mission. Oh, and instead of stronghold takeovers, you get to team up with 2 factions (2 WHOLE FACTIONS!) to "liberate" a village. It's pretty fun blowing up roadblocks. You're on the fun team in the liberation by the way, you get to play capture the flag! The cops have to settle for capture the frags...\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a solid game which, while released in '06, still holds up well today for a Just Cause 2 fan.\n\n","January 5, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's still a pretty cool open world game with nice gunplay and the jungle setting I enjoy. It's also easy to go from story mission to story mission without all the chaos nonsense of part 2. The stories between 1 and 2 are pretty much the same thing. You're off to an island to liberate it blah blah blah so nothing to see here. Controls were nice and easy (although the grappling hook from Just Cause 2 was sorely missed here) and the missions aren't terribly dificult, other than two that made me want to pull my hair out (a special "screw you" for the designer of mission 17 I think it was).  If you haven't played Just Cause 2, this is a cool introdcution to the series but you're better off just sticking with part 2. It just does everything better and you don't need to have played this part to get JC2. This shouldn't be a surprise but hey, I'll just save you eight hours. Still this game gets a 7/10 from me.","August 16, 2014","true","7.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

All you need do is find a lofty point from which to leap and you can drift over villages, motorways and wide channels of water.\nFire your grappling gun and Rico will hook onto passing cars or helicopters for a little paragliding - handy when you need an altitude advantage over your opponents or want to catch up on a crook.\nHowever, even with this unique mode of transport, getting around is a slow and sometimes tedious affair. Reaching each new mission marker can sometimes mean at least five minutes of travel time.\nAs with GTA, the action here involves hectic car chases, shootouts with the corrupt local officials and various seek-and-destroy missions in which you can enjoy the spectacle of big things blowing up. Typically, the player can hijack cars, bikes, boats and even helicopters, as well as kill time on various side missions that involve collecting hidden packages or performing hitman duties.\nSloppy vehicle handling, some bugs in the design of the missions and the endless travel means it doesn't hit the same high notes as GTA and others, but the mindless action is still good dumb fun.\nAn ambitious action affair that sometimes gets a little lost in the wilderness.","February 16, 2014","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

You're honestly better skipping this title and moving onto Just Cause 2, you won't miss anything. Just Cause 1 has a slew of problems, not limited to: poor controls especially when using the grapple/parachute mechanics, vehicle handling is clearly designed with controllers in mind, most notably when using the auto-aiming mounted turrets, a ridiculous cliché story including drug cartels, Nazi scientists and a whole lot of rockets, and finally it crashes alot.\n\nIn my 8 hour playtime alone, I crashed six times, three of which where on the same mission, I've Got the Power [#13]. The only real positives I can think about are the graphics are moderately good, ignoring noticable copy-paste jobs on buildings and in jungle, the soundtrack is perfect for the game, and some of the missions including, Some Enchanting Evening [#15],  Dismissed Without Honors [#17] and the last two thirds of Taking Out the Garbage [#19b-c]. If you're going to play this regardless, then I recommend running through the story and leaving a majority of the optional content. The game is only 19 missions long with the last mission split into 3 parts.\n\nIn summary, I'd still recommend skipping this and playing the second game in the series as it has improved the core idea/gameplay of JC1 into a more complete and enjoyable game.","January 6","false","8.6"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","27","50","0","0"

The map is also huge and there is plenty of places to explore. However, there are many flaws with this game. Now, before people write comments saying "Hes comparing it to Just Cause 2" I have not finished Just Cause 2. I am explicitly putting myself back in 2006. This game was not half bad. But lets really look at the game. The storyline of this game is very generic and honestly uninteresting. The gameplay is really not good, I did not enjoy driving in this game at all and the grappling gun you get eventually is cool but very difficult to control. Lets be honest here, Oblivion came out the same year this did. This game was not the top game of the year. I do enjoy the game and its gameplay but after 4 hours I got so fatigued that I gave up quite honestly. The gameplay didn't want me to keep playing and the story was not interesting enough to drag me in. Because of this generally mediocre first game, I am going to not recommend this game purely because I feel that it does have good to it but the bad outways the good. A modern gamer could not go and play this and enjoy it. Honestly a fan of Just Cause as a series probably will not enjoy this. But if you watch gameplay and find it interesting, please get it, however this game did not do it for me.","February 11","false","4.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","0"

But for all it's flaws, it's glorious because of how massive in scope and epicness it is.\n\nSomething like ~365 sq miles, the world is your playground, and not because of the sidequests, which are many yet repetitive; i.e; help the guerillas take over political territory, and help the Rioja family expand and defeat the other competing/mafia type family. The side quests are many and they do have their advantages when advancing through the game for opening safe houses and extra weapons, but are otherwise unnecessary.\n\nNo, the world is your playground because of how ridiculous it is. Police everywhere, villages are spread out, mountains, mountains, and mountains are all over with hills, rivers, cliffs, etc. The only thing that kept the diverse landscape vague was the color, which is pretty much all green. There's grass everywhere, you can't go anywhere without seeing grass unless you drive a boat out to sea.\n\nA game released in 2006, this could have easily been on all next gen systems, but you can tell Avalanche had focused with the Xbox and PC while also trying to transition to 360, as the models are pretty good, but the textures are certainly at the end of the Xbox and PS2 era.\n\nAs for travel, you get planes, helicopters, tanks, cars, trucks, etc. There's an infinite amount of vehicles at your disposal. Again, you'll have to advance the sidequests to unlock some of the cool ones, but completely unnecessary.\n\nThe plot is okay. It's nothing special, run and gun doing espionage esq type missions, sort of like James Bond espionage, but less stealthy. You are Rico and are sent by the Agency to help rid the country island of San Esperito of its corrupt El Presidente and followers. It's fun, but rather short, you can probably beat it in 4 or 5 hours, depending on the difficulty and amount of time you spend in between missions.\n\n8.3/10","January 21, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Controls aren't bad, involves the player, graphics aren't bad for it's time and it provided an even greater sequel. HOWEVER, the voice acting. I muted my volume it was that bad. In previous reviews such as Deadfall Adventures, I had a go at the game for the voice acting. It's a key feature to make a gamer feel involved in the experience, not something to laugh at every time you get a cutscene. It feels like one of those really bad movies that it's actually good such as The Room, Troll 2 or Birds: Shock and Terror. (Yeah, I watched all three)\n\nAnyways, I got this from a friend in the Just Cause 2 pack, so it's definately a good game, worth a good review.","March 30, 2014","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Don't worry, I'm going to come back and do some more optional stuff at some point.)\n\nIt's interesting to see the progression of the Just Cause series, to watch it come ever closer to what I call the "Just Cause Idea". The Just Cause Idea, for the record, is as follows: In a massive, beautiful, island nation (around 1000 square kilometers) run by a cartoonishly evil dictator, Rico Rodriguez, the world's most physics-defying Hispanic man, must use his huge amounts of mobility and destruction potential to bring down the dictator's rule by breaking everything the dictator owns. And it only gets more fun the more you play it.\n\nThe original Just Cause is a fairly generic game, obviously heavily inspired by old-school shooters as well as Grand Theft Autos 3, Vice City, and San Andreas. You run around shooting and driving cars and breaking things and holding an anomalous amount of guns, constantly maintaining a baseline level of fun; enough to keep you occupied but not exactly enthrall you.\n\nHowever, the first stirrings of the Just Cause Idea are also apparent. You have infinite parachutes; a primitive, vehicles-only version of the later games' hookshot; no regard for civilian lives; a massive island nation run by a cartoonishly evil dictator; and more time spent in freefall than a professional skydiver. And, of course, you're (young) Rico Rodriguez.\n\nIn Just Cause 2, the Just Cause Idea is advanced even further, and the game is far better for it. Your grappling hook is no longer a weapon but a permanant staple that changes the game forever, Rico's defiance of physics gets f*cking insane, the shooting becomes merely a placeholder to simply add challenge to all the movement and destruction, the world becomes more diverse, the graphics get prettier (to the point that the atmospheric effects will probably never be outdone), there's more and cooler stuff to destroy in cooler ways, the villain gets even more cartoonish, and the game is overall more engaging, fun, and just...wonderful. The Just Cause Idea proves its worth in this game.\n\nJust Cause 3 is probably the most perfect and complete realization of an idea ever, but I'm saving that for the review.\n\nIf I were to use a metaphor to describe the series' progression, it'd probably go as thus: Just Cause 1 is a flower starting to bud, the colorful petals just beginning to show from in between the sepals; Just Cause 2 is that flower in full bloom, its colors open for all to see; and Just Cause 3 is the flower if it were to detach entirely from the plant it budded from, becoming a spherical mass of petals and floating off to live in its own little world of explosions and madness.\n\nAnyway, Just Cause is still a fine game in its own right. Great? Not quite; it's the weakest of the series in my opinion, with its technological limitations and conventionality preventing it from reaching the same dizzying heights as its successors. But it's pretty good, and I guess it's worth buying, especially if you're as invested in the series as I am or if it's on sale.","January 23","true","19.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though it must be said the cheese was to my taste.\n\nThe game only supports older resolutions, which is fine for the most part but I gotta say that on the parachute it was extremely disorienting and vomit inducing.\nGameplay is similar to older GTA type titles like San Andreas with the same questionable gun accuracy and some auto-lock on aiming. The grapple gun is cool but almost never works as you would hope, sometimes taking thirty odd tries to actually board the vehicle you grappled. Fast travel is absolutely necessary to get just about anywhere as the map is truly enormous and for the most part empty.\n\nIf you were wanting to get this game for the story so you could go into the sequels, I would give this game a pass. The story consists (no spoilers) of nothing more than eliminating a dictator and a drug cartel and the side characters are mildly funny but shallow.","November 5, 2015","false","6.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Add this to the other glitches which cause the game to crash or the one that I encountered which makes it impossible to blow up the objective if you extract to get a more versatile vehicle, requiring you to either use the vehicle provided which is not suited to the task or traverse an incredible distance to get a better vehicle and all of the other times that you must traverse incredible distances just to give yourself a decent shot at completing the mission, and the result is a game on which I would not recommend wasting any amount of money.","February 13","false","94.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Even some recent  titles struggle to compare- it is visually stunning; the  screenshots on the store page don't do it justice, on higher graphical settings it feels like you're on holiday, the most danderous holiday you'll have. Although saying that, there is very little variation from mountainous forest to tropical beach,and the cities are not quite GTA V's los santos. The in game music is very nice, I could listen for hours. It captures the Caribbean setting perfectly, in my opinion.\n\nIt never won't be fun to fly a plane close enough to the ground to see  the foliage and then hastily disembarking to watch the carnage unfold, and this game, for it's time, gives a decent variety of planes, helicopters, cars, boats, guns, and explosives to play with. The downside being, of course, that many such toys are locked away untill you've completed dismayingly similar missions numerous times. Which may have been more interesting for much longer had the hostile NPCs been given any form of a competent AI, and the friendly AI seems to be all too intrigued about what's coming out the end of your gun, though I shouldnt complain about AI from that era.\n\nAlso I can't tell if any of the guns do more or less damage. A stats screen wouldnt have gone amiss, if the different gun shapes aren't purely for aesthetics. As a result the side missions are an absolute chore and still necessary to get anything large and flammable. From the little Just Cause 2 I've been able to play, the grapple hook and parachute system is much more fluid, but don't get me wrong, the system in the original works fine.\n\nThe animations in the game such as Rico's running looks pretty dodgy and can be pretty amusing at first, but is distracting from there on out. The story isn't brilliant, but who's playing games of this genre in place of a bedtime read? The greatest annoyance I have with this game are the NPC voices; the developers seemed content to hire just two voice actors for the entire civilan population, though, it's nothing a low flying plane can't fix.\n\nAll in all, Just Cause is definitely worth your time, whether you dont yet have the computing power to run Just Cause 2, just enjoy the genre because this is a great game in it's own right, or have already completed the Just Cause 2 and want to experience it's roots, and for under £5 is a bargain. If you can get it on sale, all the better. however if it's between Just Cause and it's sequal, Just Cause 2 would be a better use of your cash.","August 5, 2014","true","79.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/6880/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","While the second game is obviously superior, there are a few things that the first does better.\n\n- Everything from the shooting to the flying is faster and more responsive, if a bit unrealistic. For example, stunt jumps aren't necessarily affected by gravity, planes never stall, and helicopter propellor blades can touch almost anything without affecting control.\n- The entire game can be taken at one's own pace, with side missions free to perform at the player's choosing.\n- The world has one central theme, Caribbean jungle, as opposed to every type of biome crammed into one country. This makes the locations memorable by relying on clever geography and buidling placement, instead of the false illusion of a major change of global locale. Plus, it's just pretty to look at, most of the time.\n\nThat being said, the game isn't perfect. There are plenty of bugs to look out for, both fun and bad. I've gotten trapped inside garages simply by respawning. I've driven a motorcycle so fast that I crashed into a person's house and became stuck inside. All of those incidents required me to load a previous save. Then there are the police who never EVER shut up, and the idiotic AI that deems it fit to pilot a helicopter into the side of a mountain or skyscraper. There's a monster truck with hollow tires. There are also the occasional missing or misapplied textures.\n\nYet, on the other hand, I come back and find new bugs, or perhaps just oversights, every time I play. Rico is capable or rocket-jumping with the correct equipment, something I never thought I would see outside of FPS. He can kill himself with a heavy drop. Hell, once I took down a passing helicopter simply by requesting a vehicle at the right time. I've toyed around with the camera by grappling onto boats outside of the game's invisible ocean walls. It's even possible to do some sweet tricks by letting the cannon on a tank touch an immovable object. It's not often I see a big vehicle like that spinning and flipping that quickly.\n\nAll in all, it's a good sandbox game, but don't expect a lot of depth.","June 18, 2014","true","23.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Though I am happy that Eidos went through with the subsequent sequels, it's safe to say that this game is only worth it for the terrible plot, voice acting, and trying to master the art of getting into flying vehicles with the grappling hook. Aside from that, the side quests are tedious and not worth doing, the travel time from key mission to key mission is mind numbing, and the countless glitches. I'm currently stuck on the second to last level of the game because it's missing key cutscenes. As for other bugs, certain cars with turrets will glitch by rotating uncontrollably and messing with the turning mechanics of the car. I would switch to the rocket mode of the tank, and it hurled me into the sea with its violent rotations - like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonsensical helicopter. Also, sometimes when you try to steal someone elses car, the door comes flying off.\n\nThe resolution is a minor gripe, but the game is still beautiful for the time that it was in.\n\nJust Cause this game will be cheap as hell, doesn't mean you should buy it. Really - skip this one. You'll save yourself hours of frustration over a plot you don't care about.","October 14, 2015","false","12.7"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","48","25","52","5","2"

It is just boring. I played the game to the end only because I don't like having games in my library, that I didn't finish.\n\nThe Pros:\n+The graphics are good for its time.\n+There are really good vehicles, that you can enjoy driving.\n+It is actually enjoyable to blow up things at the beginning.\n+The story is actually interesting but the way they serve it, is boring.\n\nThe Cons:\n-If you use extraction to go to every briefing, the game is very short.\n-The map is very big but there's no point at trying to explore it because it doesn't show you anything surprising or new. Everywhere the same forests and citys.\n-The missions are pretty boring and repetitive. All you do is blow up some vehicle and kill swarms of enemies, which becomes really boring after the first few missions.\n-The side missions are just meaningless and aren't rewarding. There is no end to them and you don't gain anything special when you do them. Also they are really boring and same.\n-The characters are too cheesy. It was fun in the beginning but then it is neither funny nor logical.\n-Liberation missions are all the same and becomes very boring really quickly.\n-The game is too easy. There was only one mission, that I found hard to do and it is really hard to die.\n\nAs summary, if you want to blow ♥♥♥♥ up and kill swarms of enemies, while you magically stay alive, buy this game.

But before I get on to why this game is bad, allow me to share with you the good points of this game. First of all, there are many awesome vehichles, some better than others. Then, you have the different voices and attitudes of the Civillians. With these two good parts comes many bad things. The grapple is extremely glitchy, so 80% of the time you spontaneously die when grappled to helicopters/planes. It also will constantly detach, so the grapple is less of a fun and awesome tool and more of a chore. Speaking of planes, the planes will explode if you barely touch a tree or water. Also, you are a hippocrate. You are trying to overthrow a govt. that works with drug dealers,  uses violence on citizens, uses propaganda, and is perverted..... By working for a govt. that works with drug dealers, uses propaganda, and is perverted. (You are the one using violence on civillians). Also, your dialoge is horrible, as well as your jokes.

You play as Rico Rodriguez, a suave secret agent type on a mission to overthrow the dictator of the Caribbean island San Esperito. There's a giant open world, a set of factions warring against the currently established government, a grappling hook that can shoot you towards cars/boats/planes/etc, and a parachute you can pull anytime your high enough off the ground. Unfortunately, it is in the execution of these ideas that the game starts to fall apart.\n\nTo start, the world of San Esperito is truly massive and pretty impressive for such an old game (2006). This seems great until you realize that it consists mostly of long stretches of dense forests and tall mountains that make traversing it a huge pain. The various planes, jets, helicopters, and boats all do a well enough job at getting you from point A to point B, heck even jumping off a high mountain and gliding with your parachute is a pretty quick way to get around, but running on the other hand is completely off the table and the ground vehicles are arguably just as bad of an option with crazy amounts of oversteer making driving less of a convenience and more of a challenge.\n\nSan Esperito is also populated with a few cities, some villages, and a couple of army bases. These all start off as government/cartel controlled but can be taken over. This is accomplished by first completing the story mission in the given area which will shift the surrounding areas from "Government stable" to "Politically unstable", unlocking the liberation missions for the respective group you will be aiding in the takeover, either the Rebels or the Riojas (an anti-government drug cartel). During these mission you run in with your allies and try to raise hell by shooting as many enemies as you can and generally blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. Again, this is a pretty cool idea, except in practice it can quickly turn into a ♥♥♥♥ show. Accidentally shot one of your allies while he was running around wildly in front of the enemies you were trying to take down? It is now his sole purpose in life to kill you dead. Did an ally bump you with his slow moving car when riding in to join the fight? The wonky vehicle collision will almost ensure that even at full health, you wont be getting back up. All of this gets even more chaotic in later portions of the game when both the police/army and your allies start bringing tanks and attack choppers into the fights and a stray missile sends you straight back to your safe house. Your reward for soldering through these missions is an area full a friendly faction members and some faction points which you accumulate in order to rise through the ranks of that particular faction, unlocking bases, weapons, and vehicles along the way.\n\nAside from these issues, the combat can actually be pretty fun and creative. The shooting is pretty basic (Headshots aren't a thing? come on!) with dropped health packs in favor of regenerating health, but cool tricks like throwing a grenade and then shooting it in mid air or raining bullets from above as you parachute across the battlefield help to spice things up. You can also highjack anything with an engine by aiming your trusty grappling gun at it and then reeling yourself in close enough to jump in the drivers seat, or just hitching a ride. This can add a whole new layer of mobility and strategy to large scale battles that you don't really see in most games. Its a shame that you can only use the grappling gun directly on vehicles as this could have led to some very inventive stuff.\n\nJust Cause also makes sure to include the obligatory racing missions and collectables we see in most open world games. The races are pretty basic; you are the only participant racing to get to the next checkpoint on the map before a timer runs out. As tacked on as these are, I actually found them somewhat fun even though 8 of the 9 races involve the previously mentioned terrible driving mechanics. The collectables are out in the open for the most part and kind of a bore to collect. They don't really add anything to the game but you do get some faction points for collecting a full set. Speaking of which, before and after a liberation becomes available, the factions contact will be waiting nearby the settlements they are assigned to and will allow you to partake in side missions for some faction points. These boil down to fetch quests and "go kill/blow up X/Y", which are far from the most exciting things to do but will once in a while lead to an interesting offshoot, like "go kill X" but this time he's on a lightly guarded tanker on the ocean.\n\nThe core game is pretty short taking less than 5hrs to get through if you choose to ignore the fluff, like taking over settlements etc, in favor of rushing through the story missions. I also ran into problems with the games sound where I would be miles above the ground in a plane and hear a police officer shouting as though he was standing right next to me; not to mention not once being able to tell where a helicopter was in the sky based on the blaring propeller noises coming from seemingly nowhere. There were a few glitches as well where I would spawn inside buildings, fail to respawn completely, or have my helicopter zoom off into a wall or the ocean on its own after landing and getting out, but these were infrequent enough not to be much of a problem.\n\nOverall, Just Cause has not aged very well. It can be a fun game when everything works as intended but it's short story with repetitive side content and a general lack of polish in some key areas all wrapped up in an 8 year old game keep me from being able to recommend this. 4/10.","August 27, 2014","false","39.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I doubt I can even bring myself to finish it. One can summarise this game in a single word: Unfinished.\nThe gameplay is utter ♥♥♥♥. The A.I. is buggy at best, and at worst (believe me, the worst does happen most of the time with this game) their poor programming will end up killing you. For example, I got onto a mounted machine gun on the back of a rebel (ie. friendly) truck. The driver immediately drove into a wall. I waited for about a minute for him to reverse, but he didn't. Therefore, I got of the truck. He then immediately reversed, ran me over, and stopped the car on top of me until I died, then drove off. Most missions are nearly identical, with only a change in scenery. The open-world is empty, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as there's something to look at. Unfortunately, there isn't. Enemies are impossibly easy to kill, and vehicle handling is atrocious.\nThere basically isn't any sort of story, and there is definitely not a single ounce of characterisation. What story does exist is poorly written junk. I initially thought Just Cause's story was trying to be humorous and parodic of awful action movies, but then I realised it was just poorly written ♥♥♥♥ trying to act serious, when all it could do was move from cliché to cliché.\nI bought this game on offer, thinking that I couldn't go wrong with 80% off. I was very, very wrong.\n3/10","June 18, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cjeam/recommended/6880/","cjeam","cjeam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cjeam/","60 products in account","Probably the worst game I have ever had the misfortune to play. Do not bother with it, skip straight to Just Cause 2, forget this was ever made.\n\nThe side missions that let you gain control of regions are hugely repetitive. There seems to be no advantage to gaining control of regions, or doing tasks for the two factions you are supporting, other than getting better vehicles and access to safehouses. The driving mechanics feel floaty and leave you sliding all over the road.\n\nDuring these side missions, there is no checkpoint system, if you die, you will be transported to the nearest safehouse, leaving you often taking several minutes just to return to the area you were in, where you will promptly be randomly exploded again.\n\nDespite the somewhat random nature of death from vehicles or explosions, you can take ridiculous amounts of bullet hits before appearing injured, at which point your health will regenerate, but only to around 20%. Although your health doesn't regenerate, apart from some NPC drops there is no health-pack system, meaning the only way to return to full health is to go back to a safehouse and use a medical box there.\n\nThe almost invulnerable period and the total lack of anything even remotely approaching a cover system means often the best technique when liberating settlements is just to run in and destroy the necessary items before capturing the flag, almost completely ignoring the enemy NPCs to complete it as quickly as possible. It doesn't feel like any progress is made when you're fighting the NPCs as not only can they take a huge amount of bullets too, but they seem to endlessly spawn, and will quite happily do so behind you, leaving you running around in the open shooting randomly (at which point you'll likely be run over and die).\n\nI'm not sure if they're glitches, but the police will constantly be shouting at you even if you have no "heat", and there is permanently a helicopter hovering somewhere near you. Which sometimes decides to shoot at those nearby. This probably wouldn't be a concern if I knew why it was there, if only I didn't have to constantly listen to a helicopter, which means if I'd like to peacefully explore the game's huge and impressive environment, I have to do it chaperoned by a damn noisy hovering annoyance. It's annoying when it turns out to be a police helicopter, which will start raining down missiles when you scratch someones car.\n\nThere's a bizarre targeting system too, which sometimes auto-aims, and sometimes doesn't. Several times I blew myself up when the game decided I was aiming missiles at the guy who had just appeared three feet to my left, rather than the fuel tank which was my objective 50m away.","August 11, 2014","false","7.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Cranked up to the max, its video settings allow for some pretty stunning vistas in the huge tropical island of San Esperito.\n\nHowever, that's pretty much where the praise ends.\n\nThe story has no depth at all. You're a US agent and your mission is to overthrow a Latin American dictator. Along the way, you'll be assigned some the most forgettable seek-and-destroy missions the gaming world has ever seen, usually consisting of:\n\n1. Being briefed by terribly voice-acted, stereotypized characters;\n2. Getting to terms with the nearest vehicle's shoddy handling in order to reach your objective as quickly as possible;\n3. Storming a government base, guns blazing (forget about stealth), walking through fire from a hundred mindless, respawning enemies (good luck getting cover from helicopter miniguns, though), planting a few C4 charges and leaving.\n\nThat's it. Very simplistic gameplay coupled with terrible artifical intelligence. That's Just Cause in a nutshell.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it by 2006's standards, and I most certainly won't recommend it now.","July 19, 2015","false","4.1"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","17","37","0","7"

Note huge, but not small either.\n-Pretty nice graphics texture and color wise, the sea and the jungle were very beautiful and offered a great tone during the gameplay.\n-Great variety of weapons and neat explosion effects.\n-Though simple but satisfying enough weather effects.\n-Faction based minigames and side missions that offer some replayability (though it depends how easily bored you can get consider the whole)\n\n\ncons:-The sound quality is a buggy mess. You can keep hearing shouts "freeze citizen!" and "alto alto! this nis the police!" even if you are like alone in the freakin woods, hell you even hear them when you are driving a plane 10 miles above ground. You also get to hear vehicle sounds that are unnaturally far away from you.\n-Too many helicopters flying around. I mean seriously, TOO MANY.\n-Grappling hook only works on moving vehicles. For some reason anything esle is pure glass surface (thankfully this was fixed in Just Cause 2)\n-Cheesy characters with stupid lines, hard to feel any urge to connect with them. Even the main hero is so out of interest.\n-Physics that are not good at all.. You can't have rock hard car suspensions and airplanes that fly like pieces of woodsticks when games like GTA San Andreas have already been out there setting the example.\n-A main story that's not interesting at all.\n\n\nrecommended?\nNot really sure.\nIf you are a fan of the genre and you like trying old games, juicing out ideas and gain opinion on some things, its not a bad title to play.\nIn any other case I can't recommend this game. I doupt it's even worth buying even if its cheap as hell right now. There's so many other titles out there that can offer you a far better experience and you get nothing to lose story-wise about the franchise since Just Cause 2 stands alone on that matter.","February 20, 2015","false","11.3"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","0"

I gave it over two hours, and kept thinking "give it time, it'll improve". Well, it doesn't. The story is a mess, with structure being kept as a mere illusion, feels like the only reason there even was a story was so that they could say "has single-player story mode". The graphics are ok I guess, but the interactions are primitive at best. Enemies (which aren't easily told apart from allies, all wear uniform) have two modes - alive and dead. Shoot one in the chest/leg/balls/head and the only indication for a hit is a small complementary blood splatter. Headshots only work for innocent civilians. Besides, the entire health system is too unreal, even for a game. A grenade/car exlpodes right next to you - you don't die. You empty a pistor magazine at an enemy - he doesn't die. What gives? This isn't a game from the 90's, it's from 2006. I've expected so much more from the trailer... and I have no problem with old game, been playing Baldur's Gate and Starcraft 1 for the past two months. But this game is simply a let down. I usually make a habbit of playing all titles of a franchise by order, but in this case all I have left to do is try Just Cause 2 and hope it salvages the name. If it doesn't - it will have been a sad, disappointing and frustrating waste of money.","December 21, 2013","false","1.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The promise of a fun an entertaining game is under the hood, and that is what laid the foundation for a much better game in Just Cause 2.  Unfortunetly this one is riddled with issues that cannot be overlooked.\n\nPro's:\n\nBig Open World that encourages and rewards exploration with many things to do.\nFull City Liberation missions are fun unlike the military base ones.\n\n\nCons:\n\nHorrible A.I. for both friendlies and enemies.  Friendly A.I. will run you over in cars they took during liberation missions meanwhile enemy A.I. is just a tad bit more intelligent than the A.I. in Aliens Colonial Marines which has one of the worst enemy A.I's of all time.\n\nEnemy Helicopters can follow you around the whole map and can pinpoint you even under heavy foliage\n\nSide Missions are highly repetitive and lose their lustre,  especially when trying to liberate a military base where you can't tell who's friendly or enemy based on clashing color schemes.\n\nVehicles handle like garbage.  Seriously why does a light tap on the keyboard induce a power slide on a jeep.\n\nThis game stutters during combat after about an hour of gameplay and this issue can only be fixed with a restart.\n\n\nAll in all this game is best left unplayed.

San Andreas and many more titles from this time period have recieved at least a bit of controller support updating. (even if it was usually a community effort)\n\nObviously people are going to WANT to play this game.  I absolutely love JC2, and I want to be able to play this game.  It is beautiful and much more appealing than GTA as an open-world title I can share with my kids. (GTA has too much bad language and insinuations I prefer my kids don't hear at their age)\n\nI can't even select the top resolution 1600 x 1200, and I needed a quick file from the web to 1920 x 1080 it.\nEven with a KB mapper, my controller is not gradually easing on a curve, or slowly accelerating.  It is an ON/Off thing.\n\nYou are either FULL ON or FULL OFF on what would normally be an expected analog experience.  driving is a nightmare once up to speed, and I try to save my wrists from extra KB&M work.  This is not comfortable AT ALL.\n\nThe game loads great, and with the fix it is really beautiful to look at.  I played a very short time before I just couldn't take it.  There is nothing about this that is going to make me want to finish the title.\n\nWith so many people gearing up for JC3, don't you think a big name company could afford a little bit of effort to bring this experience up to standard?\n\nThis is yet another time where I have attempted to go back to earlier titles and have been let down due to lacking support.  Plenty of big IPs have received some sort of touching up, there is really no excuse.  Outdated visuals are fine, but lacking basic controller support is unfair.  How is there not even support for my older Gravis or other gamepads?  The game seriously came out back then WITHOUT ANY CONTROLLER SUPPORT??? Why would a company decide to release a game on a console, and then not offer PC players the comfort of a controller?  This is junk thinking.\n\nUnless the game gets an update, or you don't mind KB&M or the process of KB mapping, just get the game on a console (I rarely say that)","November 24, 2014","false","0.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","2"

To be honest, after 2 hours this game felt more like a chore then an actual game. Do this, do that (the plot of the game right here). Speaking of plot, here my impression of it: you here at this island because f*%# you that's why to liberate from an oppressive government and giving control of the island to practically terrorist because F*%# you that's why. You can have fun with this as long as you don't actually play the game. Some of your mission are also impossible. If you are doing a mission where you are screwing with the drud dealers, prepare to be absolutely rekt. Hotline Miami is less frustrating then the drug dealer missions. They will chase you with an infinite set of enemies until your missions are over. Ohter than that, there are two other frustrating things about this game, enemy helicopters and the grapling hook. The grapling hook works when it wants to (which is not very often) and enemy helicopter will somethings respwn endlessly during missions.

The game has its moments but also has some flaws. If I were to rate this game out of 10 it would be a 6/10.

This game hasnt aged well and I'm not comparing it to newer games when I say this, but older ones, playing this game in 2006 would have made me say the same things. The physics of the cars, the bahavior of the ai, the shooter mechanics, lack of ducking and cover, uninteresting guns and useless sniper rifle, rediclous mission setups, uninteresting side characters, protentious and steriotypical spanish hot shot as a lead character with horrible one liners. The game just doesnt stack up well, you cant save when you want half the time and are usually forced to complete missions to save your progress, the only practical way to beat somee missions is to abuse exploits, sometimes your weapons will disapear for no reason, glitches appear with every ai interaction, you randomly appear in off places after some missions, oh Lord the missions.. There is some unbalance to be had in the missions, either so hard that it's random or easy that you know they didn't go through to iron some missions out, but NOTHING compares to the final mission, it expects you to traverse a entire warzoned island with bombs soldiers and tanks blowing everything up at complete random with no check points, and fly a high speed jet and sky dive on a air plane, it's all luck and no skill which all ends with a horrible and cheesy boss that you didn't even know was a villain until the end.\nWhile fun and stunt worthy this game can be, the bad piles up to high.

It was originally released in 2006, but compared to a similar open-world styled game GTA San Andreas which was released earlier in 2004, Just Cause is clearly a much more inferior game in comparison.\n\nEven though the story of Just Cause wasn't supposed to be anything special other then a typical action game, but it looked like they didn't even bother to try to at least pretend to tell a story. Every single mission is about 2 people sunbathing and drinking wine and telling you to blow ♥♥♥♥ up. Yes i'm not kidding.\n\nThere are alot of things wrong with it. Firstly, it is a very poor console port, where you can't even use the mouse on the main menu. Graphics look painfully inadequate even by 2006 standards especially the enemies death animations where every single one of them does this same "jump back horizontally look" when they die.\n\nVehicle handling is atrocious, cars and airplanes are just way too sensitive in their controls. Also, try driving a motorcycle around, and look at what happens when an oncoming truck rams you....wait for it. Nothing happens. Your motorcycle just goes to a sudden stop. Just Cause really feels like one of those 1st generation substandard Open-World GTA clones and is a very good example of how NOT to do an open world game.\n\nThat said, it introduces the now series trademark stunt hijacking of vehicles which will probably feel very fresh when released in 2006, but is let down by the fact that the vehicles themselves are really no fun to drive in. The eclectic latino sounding soundtrack however is pretty good and i did enjoy listening to that.\n\nI know it may not be fair for me to review this game in 2012, which is close to 6 years after its original release. Then again, playing Just Cause 1 lets me appreciate Just Cause 2 even more lol. I must say that I am happy that Avalanche Studios saw what was wrong in JC1 and made JC2 a much better game and carve out its own unique identity.\n\nOverall Rating: 3.0 / 10\nHorrible game. Don't buy it even If you are thinking of getting it because you enjoyed Just Cause 2. You won't miss out on any story elements or anything and you're better off just playing Just Cause 2 instead.","May 25, 2013","false","7.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Or i didn't find out how to do it. You're defenseless while in car.\n- It has "turret missions" with auto-aiming. Just hold the mouse button and you'll win.\n- The diversity of stunts are limited.\n- Shooting is bland, no cover, just run and gun. Very arcade.\n- Bugged, some vehicles don't work. There are some physics bug that makes your vehicle fly all over the map (can be a bit funny tho').\n- You can't run nor can't crouch. Going anywhere on foot takes forever.\n- Unbalanced. Spawning feast of enemies all over you. You dont get any sort of upgrades such as armors.\n- Playing with mouse and keyboard is possible, but it is really bad. (i've finished the game with K+m)\n\nPros:\n- It has physics for such old game (details such as car's window and doors breaking)\n- Open world\n- Good vehicle variety, helos, tanks, planes, boats.

I bought this real cheap, but I still have to say it was a waste of money.\n\nGameplay in itself might not be bad, nor the graphics considerings it's age (the best bet to find an enemy is actually tracing back where the bullets come from, as people tend to be really hard to spot for some reason), but controls are just really really sloppy. The one thing that comes to mind when having to control your character is syrup. Figure that would give an idea.\n\nSome people I know like it though, but I can't really see why.\n\nSo my advice: even for a real bargain, leave this one in the shelf and spend your money on anything else (possibly Just Cause 2).","July 14, 2013","false","1.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

It has some of the worst driving mechanics and physics, and getting hit by a car is most of the times instakill. Do you think bullets kill you in this game? Oh no, most of my deaths were at the hand of my allies, that decided to park their car over my body during liberations. And they always park exactly at the point I was standing on. So the most important advice for this game is: NEVER STAY ON THE ROAD DURING LIBERATIONS.\n\nWhen it comes to the map, Just Cause devs thought that having a bigger map would make the game better, but it backfires right at the beginning of the game, once you realize that locations are too far from each other and going from A to B is a chore. Wouldn't be too bad if the map wasn't so lazy. All settlements and villas look almost identical with slight differences. There were some interesting points on the map that felt like a mission would take place there, but were completely unused. If the map was halved it would have been much more convenient and enjoyable.\n\nIt's really not worth playing, unless you just want to breeze through the story, which is pretty short. I ended up 100% the game, which is not worth it when you don't get rewarded. However, Just Cause 2 is much much better and worth every cent. Or just wait for Just Cause 3 and play that one if it ends up being good. No point playing all of them in this case.","May 7, 2015","false","24.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

For starters, the missions get pretty repetitive which doesn't keep me playing for very long. The American character voices seem....off. Not like lips moving before audio plays, but you can tell when you hear them.\nOverall, pretty decent.

This applies to vehicles that are being driven on the road too.

This game started off very well, it has a bright colourful cartoony style and nice music. There's a huge environment to explore with loads of side missions. It has some zany grappling gun mechanics where you can leap between vehicles. So where do the problems lie? Firstly the side missions seem rather repetitive and the rewards aren't that appealing. Certain weapons look very similar making finding good guns difficult. Getting around can be annoying, roads are few and far between with massive cliffs and dense woodlands covering most the islands. They have included airlifts and vehicle drops but these take an annoyingly long time. The vehicles' handling is very light at speed to make getting anywhere even more frustrating. The main reason I never finished this game is the last missions are just really hard with swarms of constantly spawning bad guys and after failing repeatedly I thought I have better things to do with my time.","February 21, 2013","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself disinterested in the world and the game is too "random". AKA if you look away from a car on the road and turn your back again the car will be gone or replaced. This applies to vehicles that are being driven on the road too. The game play is pretty repetitive as well but fortunately you dont have to do the repetitive missions to progress the story (unlike in Just Cause 2).

I bought it super cheap a while back, it is worth every penny. Youll have many stories to laugh at with other people who have played it. I was being chased by an attack chopper, and another car spawned in front of me, I smashed into it, the car shot up into the air spinning end over end and hit the attack chopper in the air..It was GLORIOUS.\n\nOther people mentioned how difficult the last part of the game is, I have to agree, it was mostly jarring more than actually difficult.\n\nExploring, goofing off etc is alot of fun. The cartel/guerilla missions are OK, although VERY repetative.\n\nI found saving to be kinda annoying, as you couldnt save anywhere you wanted, you have to go to specific spots that you unlock, which in general isnt that bad, since you can get dropped off there, just an extra unneeded step.\n\nIt also has a tendancy to want to go into slow mode camera view, and when you have a timer, it doesnt actually slow down time..so if youre in slow motion for 15 seconds, thats 15 seconds off the timer. So drive carefully when you have a time limit.\n\nIn the end, it was alot of fun, and I cant recomend it enough, especially if its on sale.","January 8, 2014","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first got the game, the user reviews were mostly positive. Now it's mixed, so you can probably tell from that too.\n\nFull Review:\n- Gameplay & Graphics\nWhile the scenes in the video look nice, playing it in 2014 with a 1680 x 1050 resolution and later in 2015 with a 1920 x 1080 resolution makes me feel like crying. If you force the game to full screen, it's pixelated, else it's small. I could adjust my default screen resolution to suit the game, but this simply reinforces that the game is outdated. It may be good in 2006, but certainly not now. The controls are your typical WASD and mouse interaction, while for the gameplay itself, I did not fully explore the game so I cannot offer a full storyline review. However, from my early stages in the game, it takes way too long to travel from one point to another with little to offer. While Far Cry also requires you to walk a long distance, at least you get to hunt some game. Not in Just Cause 1. It's just holding W and hoping someday, you get there.\n\n- Audio\nThe music and sound effects are pretty average in my opinion. I'm not a fan of it, but taste is subjective.\n\n- Verdict\nDon't buy it, even it's for a really cheap 90% discount. Unless you're using an older and smaller computer, you've played it before and you want to play it again. In that case, follow your desire.","June 19, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game started off very well, it has a bright colourful cartoony style and nice music. There's a huge environment to explore with loads of side missions. It has some zany grappling gun mechanics where you can leap between vehicles. So where do the problems lie? Firstly the side missions seem rather repetitive and the rewards aren't that appealing. Certain weapons look very similar making finding good guns difficult. Getting around can be annoying, roads are few and far between with massive cliffs and dense woodlands covering most the islands. They have included airlifts and vehicle drops but these take an annoyingly long time. The vehicles' handling is very light at speed to make getting anywhere even more frustrating. The main reason I never finished this game is the last missions are just really hard with swarms of constantly spawning bad guys and after failing repeatedly I thought I have better things to do with my time.","February 21, 2013","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The island was big and there were plenty of items to collect, but the world itself still felt a bit empty. Being able to paratroop a vehicle anywhere was really neat, although I didn't discover I could do that until the latter half of the game. The main missions became considerably easier with some of Rico's custom vehicles. The hook shot system was a bit rough, hooking onto moving objects rarely worked out like I had intended it to but it was fun to experiment with.\n\nSadly it was impossible to get a controller to work with the game properly, and the advanced settings were a bit lacking, especially in the resolution department. A lot of the same sounds got reused very often which got a bit annoying after a while.\n\nAlthough there were plenty of side quests scattered around the map they were only interesting really if you wanted to unlock the particular item/weapon that was at the end of the faction points system. Being able to jump across the map with the jet from the menu made buying safe houses kind of pointless. Still the game was definitely fun even if it was rather similar to a GTA game of the same caliber. While it was not very impressive after playing JC2 or a more recent GTA game I'm sure when it came out it must have been more entertaining when there weren't many games like it on the market.  It is nice if you want to see where Rico and the Just Cause series got their roots from. It hasn't aged very well though.\n","November 23, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.\n\nPlaying Che as a young medical student, you travel throughout South America and become radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease that you witness. Most of this part of the game consists of quicktime events punctuated by scenes of you jogging down corridors and along dusty streets, but the tight controls more than make up for any boredom you might feel.\nYour burgeoning desire to help overturn what you see as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompts your involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, and at this point in the game you join one of three factions which you will stay as for the rest of the game. In my playthrough I joined the 'Reapers' which was more of a fetch-quest based plot but I really like these because I'm a masochist.\nThe president's eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidifies your political ideology and you can start earning perks that upgrade Che based on three trees - Ideology, Philosophy and Taxation Schemes. Ideology allows you to increase Che's intelligence making things like lockpicking and sneaking easier. Philosophy makes people dislike Che more but you're able to find things like hidden doors and alternative roads thanks to 'thinking outside of the box'. Taxation Schemes are probably the most useful tree and are fairly self-explanatory.\nLater, in Mexico City, you meet Raúl and Fidel Castro, join their 26th of July Movement, and sail to Cuba aboard the yacht, Granma, with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. The yacht becomes a hub for you and your men and from here you can use an extensive crafting system to make new weapons. Whilst the other NPCs are in your party you can outfit them with weapons and skills just as you can for Che. The AI is a little patchy in places but for the most part works fine.\nYou soon rise to prominence among the insurgents, get promoted to second-in-command, and play a pivotal role in the victorious two-year guerrilla campaign that is set on deposing the Batista regime. At this point the game moves to a top-down perspective ala Sim City, and most of the gameplay from now on is based around maps of military strategies and other boring stuff.\n\nI guess it's alright.","October 15, 2015","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are insultingly easy, the only real challange being when the game kills you for no reason because your tank begins to spin and flies away into the skybox. The last level is damn near impossible because of the horrible AI and awful physics.\n\n[Story]\n\nThe story barely exists and (unlike it's sequel) is not at all redeemed by the gameplay, the characters are bland and boring, and the protagonist's accent and stupid one liners caused me to play most of the game with the voice sound on mute.\n\n[Game world]\n\nThe game world is impressivly large, until you realize that theres is absolutly nothing worth exploring. Theres is NOTHING to do, unless you like boring side quests that unlock more gear to do even more boring side quests. I would expect such a massive game to have a little bit more variety in the areas, but you're litterally on the same boring dirt roads with the same stupid lifeless AI people driving boring cars for the entire game, save for a few tiny cities and an airport.\n\n[Airplanes!!]\n\nI was pleased to find that (unlike grand theft auto IV) that you were able to fly the jumbo jet at the airport! This was exciting for me because the controls for the planes in this game are surprisingly good! But when I went to fly the plane into a building (obviously this is what you do) the plane bounced off like a foam plane bouncing off of a filing cabinet. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT! No explosion or anything! If you give me a jumbo jet in a sandbox game and dont let me violently crash it then why even put it in? Jesus, im not going to roleplay a bloody airline pilot, let me destroy things!!\n\nTL;DR This game might be a massive sandbox, but it only contains sand.

When I first got the game, the user reviews were mostly positive. Now it's mixed, so you can probably tell from that too.\n\nFull Review:\n- Gameplay & Graphics\nWhile the scenes in the video look nice, playing it in 2014 with a 1680 x 1050 resolution and later in 2015 with a 1920 x 1080 resolution makes me feel like crying. If you force the game to full screen, it's pixelated, else it's small. I could adjust my default screen resolution to suit the game, but this simply reinforces that the game is outdated. It may be good in 2006, but certainly not now. The controls are your typical WASD and mouse interaction, while for the gameplay itself, I did not fully explore the game so I cannot offer a full storyline review. However, from my early stages in the game, it takes way too long to travel from one point to another with little to offer. While Far Cry also requires you to walk a long distance, at least you get to hunt some game. Not in Just Cause 1. It's just holding W and hoping someday, you get there.\n\n- Audio\nThe music and sound effects are pretty average in my opinion. I'm not a fan of it, but taste is subjective.\n\n- Verdict\nDon't buy it, even it's for a really cheap 90% discount. Unless you're using an older and smaller computer, you've played it before and you want to play it again. In that case, follow your desire.","June 19, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes forever to get places, even with a chopper or really fast boat\n- Half the time I feel like Superman, the other I'm getting run over and killed by my supporting AI\n- Audio is annoying, music from certain areas sometimes sticks with you as you move about\n- Random NPC phrases get extremely repetative and annoying in areas of population\n- Unlimited pistol ammo, but very limited assult/SMG/etc ammo\n- Unlike the Far Cry series which I can in some ways compare this to, the green forrest aren't at all worth visiting are are very boring with zero variety\n- Not a lot is explained, each mission will have details but you have to open the menu, then open mission info to learn details\n- Voice acting from the very dated CGI cuts scenes is poor, but not terrible for the period\n- Buggy with lots of pop-in/drop-out artifacts, mainly cars and enemies. I called in a truck, drove it 200 feet and it died, won't move. Figured ok, got another ride, quit the game later, saving, played again after a while, called in truck, it's still dead, really?\n- Map is SO big and it takes you SO long to traverse it on foot that you need vehicles or use the fast travel/agency pick-up system, otherwise it gets BORING wandering around pretty quick.\n- Side missions include checkpoint races, fetch quests and kill quests. They never end, so you can do them over and over and that's annoying for completionists like myself. Worse you won't know which you've already done and it's hard to see the benefits until you visit a safehouse.\n- Driving physics/controls are comically poor, if you get a flat rear tire on a rear drive vehicle enjoy unbarable oversteer, overall every land/sea vehicle has felt very floaty, getting airborn often gives a lame slow-mo shot, crashing off a cliff and getting the car to roll leads to funny physics.\n- The chopper controls are decent, but if you jump out and depoly your parachute it's really hard to gauge how high up your are, so don't let go until you land.\n\nI can see the roots of some cool gameplay elements and features that I suspect have helped define this franchise. However if you make this your first game in the series be preparred to have frustrations. So far for me the frustrations haven't led to rage quits or anything and the difficulty so far has been reasonable - EDIT: essentially rage quit the last time, frustrating difficulty, uninstalling game, updating this review, moving on.\n\nRecommend?\nEDIT: I had to change this review. Simply can't recommend this game, it's ENTIRELY TOO HUGE, it takes forever to traverse even with a chopper, forget a car as you almost 100% have to stay on the roads, and F walking, it takes FOREVER - I ended up setting something on my E key to keep moving forward when boringly trying to get somewhere.\nBugs - pull a guy out of a ride and watch his door go flying, get into a APV, get bumped and watch your several ton armored vehicle roll, even fly around, don't walk near a road or get insta-killed by being run over, revive at a safe house only to land inside the structure, stuck.\nDifficulty ramped up a TON after I gained control of approximately 50% of the map. When it takes you 5 mins to get from a spawn point/safe house via chopper to your takeover area only to have your mission ramp to level 5 (top threat level) within 30 seconds and have rockets fired at you from God only knows where and die. Then take another 5 mins to get back there to get closer but still die - it's no longer fun and therefore not worth the time, I have way too many other games that I know are better waiting, including hopefully a greatly improved Just Cause 2.\n\nMy progress:\nMy first review was after 7.4 hours in, this update is after over 20 hours. I think I made it around 40-45% through the story missions and I collected around 85% of the pickups while liberating right around 50+% of the map, done several side quests too getting my militia and gang supports up pretty high. I struggled to put aside my completionish mentality and focus on the story, but avoided extra side missons, instead just aiming to liberate all of the locations. After having the difficulty ramp up so much in the last few missions/liberation attempts I just can't see wasting anymore time trying to do really anything else. I tried, but the game defeated me...","February 9","false","22.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't remember this game being so bad on Playstation. Maybe I'm just getting old and my memory is bad, but wow is this game ever broken. The driving is horrible, some of the worst I've ever seen. Such random nonsense happens, like the heli that eternally follows me wherever I go blowing up random civilians and then slamming into mountains and exploding...only to resurrect a minute later and continue its onslaught. Shooting a gun is pure luck mixed with hope if you hit anything.\n\nThe missions...oh my. The chase type missions are just pure cancer. I did the same one 10x in a row and still came up empty. It reminds me of that Driver 2 mission called Chase the Gunman. About 25 seconds into the mission you go around a corner and there's a tree there....that you hit 98% of the time on this basically railed mission. I dubbed it the "Magnet Tree", and that's the same as this game. You get to a certain point and the same bs happens every time. And I'm not sure, but I think the mission I was just on was very glitched. It's the one where you take a heli to meet whatzername for the arms deal and you get double-crossed. It just fails randomly before I can even catch up to the guy. Weird.\n\nBut, the game is fun despite all the garbage points it has. It's a big map, albeit fairly empty, lots of vehicles to choose from, and fairly simple gameplay.\n\nIf you can stand all the bugs, this game is a winner.\n\nI would rate this game...32 canoes out of 4 Blues Clues.","February 17","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also full of LOADS of old-game stereotypes. Like the blond-lady person ... Kane, I think her name is in the games ... She's useless. But on a level in this game, in comparison to the others.

The levels are insultingly easy, the only real challange being when the game kills you for no reason because your tank begins to spin and flies away into the skybox. The last level is damn near impossible because of the horrible AI and awful physics.\n\n[Story]\n\nThe story barely exists and (unlike it's sequel) is not at all redeemed by the gameplay, the characters are bland and boring, and the protagonist's accent and stupid one liners caused me to play most of the game with the voice sound on mute.\n\n[Game world]\n\nThe game world is impressivly large, until you realize that theres is absolutly nothing worth exploring. Theres is NOTHING to do, unless you like boring side quests that unlock more gear to do even more boring side quests. I would expect such a massive game to have a little bit more variety in the areas, but you're litterally on the same boring dirt roads with the same stupid lifeless AI people driving boring cars for the entire game, save for a few tiny cities and an airport.\n\n[Airplanes!!]\n\nI was pleased to find that (unlike grand theft auto IV) that you were able to fly the jumbo jet at the airport! This was exciting for me because the controls for the planes in this game are surprisingly good! But when I went to fly the plane into a building (obviously this is what you do) the plane bounced off like a foam plane bouncing off of a filing cabinet. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT! No explosion or anything! If you give me a jumbo jet in a sandbox game and dont let me violently crash it then why even put it in? Jesus, im not going to roleplay a bloody airline pilot, let me destroy things!!\n\nTL;DR This game might be a massive sandbox, but it only contains sand. Theres is nothing fun or interesing to do at all, save you time and play Just Cause 2 instead and skip this one.","January 14, 2015","false","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.\n\nPlaying Che as a young medical student, you travel throughout South America and become radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease that you witness. Most of this part of the game consists of quicktime events punctuated by scenes of you jogging down corridors and along dusty streets, but the tight controls more than make up for any boredom you might feel.\nYour burgeoning desire to help overturn what you see as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompts your involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, and at this point in the game you join one of three factions which you will stay as for the rest of the game. In my playthrough I joined the 'Reapers' which was more of a fetch-quest based plot but I really like these because I'm a masochist.\nThe president's eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidifies your political ideology and you can start earning perks that upgrade Che based on three trees - Ideology, Philosophy and Taxation Schemes. Ideology allows you to increase Che's intelligence making things like lockpicking and sneaking easier. Philosophy makes people dislike Che more but you're able to find things like hidden doors and alternative roads thanks to 'thinking outside of the box'. Taxation Schemes are probably the most useful tree and are fairly self-explanatory.\nLater, in Mexico City, you meet Raúl and Fidel Castro, join their 26th of July Movement, and sail to Cuba aboard the yacht, Granma, with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. The yacht becomes a hub for you and your men and from here you can use an extensive crafting system to make new weapons. Whilst the other NPCs are in your party you can outfit them with weapons and skills just as you can for Che. The AI is a little patchy in places but for the most part works fine.\nYou soon rise to prominence among the insurgents, get promoted to second-in-command, and play a pivotal role in the victorious two-year guerrilla campaign that is set on deposing the Batista regime. At this point the game moves to a top-down perspective ala Sim City, and most of the gameplay from now on is based around maps of military strategies and other boring stuff.\n\nI guess it's alright.","October 15, 2015","true","29.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first 2 hour's or so were fun until I realised it was just going to be the same thing over and over and the glaring issue's grinded me down to the point where I couldn't overlook or put up with them any more. Firstly,the driving is absolutely terrible,oh my! Don't even get me started on trying to ride a motorbike. You need it to get to most places as well,so it becomes tedious real quick,and I found myself dreading it. Falling off any height in a vehicle looks ridiculous,does no damage whatsoever no matter how high the drop and takes ages to readjust into a position where you can drive/ride again. The control's in general are clunky,from jumping,parachuting to grappling (which is a standalone "weapon" and needs to be equipped as a gun replacement to use and just sucks in general). No matter what keybind I assigned to reel it in or out,they wouldn't work.  The only fun part was firing weapon's,and blowing stuff up,but the gameplay is extremely limited and It gets way too repetitive. It all feels exactly the same,and it's not good enough to keep doing over and over. The only real redeeming factor was how well it ran and looked (not including the pre-rendered cutscenes) with absolutely everything cranked in Nvidia Inspector.","March 14","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/6880/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","I mainly played this, just to see how Just Cause 2 got it's roots. I can see that the roots for Just Cause 2 were well fertilized, because Just Cause OG is sh**!\n\nWell, okay, to be fair Just Cause 1 is a lot better than a lot of other games. It feels sort of like playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, with slightly less clunkier controls and slightly better graphics. However, the game has some severe problems with both narrative and gameplay that cause it to just truly suffer.\n\nMy biggest qualms with the gameplay is how easily cheated it can be. The loading screens advertize all the cool weapons and vehicles you could unlock by freeing more cities, but I got pretty much all the best gear by the end only by playing the regular story missions. And the two staples of the game- the parachute and grappling hook- both absolutely suck in this game. For one, the grappling hook is very selective. It will latch onto any vehicle or person you aim it at, but not trees, rocks, or land- which renders it basically pointless. Plus, parachuting to cars or helicopters is rubbish, since you have to reel yourself close enough to the vehicle for it to work. And Scorpio obviously has some sort of strange disease in his arms, causing them to only aim his grappling hook forward. Once a helicopter flies behind you while you reel it in, you're done. And trying to get onto cars is a massive pain, since you gradually sink to the ground (even if the car is driving at top speed).\n\nThe gameplay also takes its biggest dip during the end mission. The game builds up all this variety and open mission play-style, and the end mission completely negates that. You fly in on a helicopter but can't fly it to the island. Cars attract helicopter missiles. And missiles blasting your body cause you to bounce back and forth like a pinball, constantly taking damage. And damage can only be healed by the random health-pack spawning out of dead enemies, which is very uncommon.\n\nThe cutscenes are also really weird to watch. The animation studio chose some very strange character models (and some even worse voice actors), and the scenes that explain situations come off as weird, in the sense that characters say sentences in completely off tones, or come off as weird since the characters themselve look very inhuman. In fact, Just Cause has a very toy-ish feel. The cars look like Hot Wheels cars, the characters look and animate like action figures. Even the samey world of San Esperito has a kid's-jungle-themed-toy-box appeal. The game just doesn't have a very fun or realistic draw to it.\n\nI'm not saying everyone would hate this game. Between the wide variety of story missions, vast content, and world to explore- plenty of gamers will enjoy the original Just Cause. It just didn't impress me. I'm very picky with my sandbox games, and if you other 5% of Steam users that agree with my opinions are reading this, then you can be assured that Just Cause is not the game for you.","January 7","false","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has quite a few glitches but they are often times more humorous than in the way. I did have this annoying glitch that made an enemy helicoptor follow me throughout most of the game shooting any allies that I was near. After the initial annoyance though it became something I enjoyed because the helicoptors would start battles around me at random locations.\n\nDo not expect a modern game, but a fun predecessor and step back in to the original sandbox games of its genre.\nGlitches, really bad one liners, mediocre story, awesome game.","December 16, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't remember this game being so bad on Playstation. Maybe I'm just getting old and my memory is bad, but wow is this game ever broken. The driving is horrible, some of the worst I've ever seen. Such random nonsense happens, like the heli that eternally follows me wherever I go blowing up random civilians and then slamming into mountains and exploding...only to resurrect a minute later and continue its onslaught. Shooting a gun is pure luck mixed with hope if you hit anything.\n\nThe missions...oh my. The chase type missions are just pure cancer. I did the same one 10x in a row and still came up empty. It reminds me of that Driver 2 mission called Chase the Gunman. About 25 seconds into the mission you go around a corner and there's a tree there....that you hit 98% of the time on this basically railed mission. I dubbed it the "Magnet Tree", and that's the same as this game. You get to a certain point and the same bs happens every time. And I'm not sure, but I think the mission I was just on was very glitched. It's the one where you take a heli to meet whatzername for the arms deal and you get double-crossed. It just fails randomly before I can even catch up to the guy. Weird.\n\nBut, the game is fun despite all the garbage points it has. It's a big map, albeit fairly empty, lots of vehicles to choose from, and fairly simple gameplay.\n\nIf you can stand all the bugs, this game is a winner.\n\nI would rate this game...32 canoes out of 4 Blues Clues.","February 17","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
