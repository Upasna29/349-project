This take on the racing genre is a nice change of pace and great fun. Aerial photography from actual cities are used and then race track objects are added in to make a course. This is quite a bit of fun and well worth the full price of $15. If you catch it on a discount even better.\n\nPros:\nFun unique design using the aerial photography. Someone referred to it as Google Maps with racing, and its very close.\nLots of cars and tracks.\nMultiple game modes: Race, Time Trial, Surivial, Arcade Checkpoint.\n16 player multiplayer out of the box.\nCheap buy in with promise of additional content at no extra cost.\nGreat soundtrack\n\nCons:\nA bit too much motion blur for my liking. I can see some people finding this hard to track.\nMultiplayer can be tough to find a match. This can be remidied by increasing the player base.\n","December 7, 2013","true","2.3"," 124 of 161 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","124","161","0","7"

After putting in over 22 hours of play, I've attained all of the offline trophies and had an absolute blast doing it. The top negative review complains of "impossible challenges," but that's just not true. They're hard enough where you will need to practice, but that just means the sense of satisfaction when you DO beat them is all the better.\nThe game looks great. I love the idea of using aerial imagery, and it really makes the game look like nothing else out there. I've also seen the framerate mentioned, and I'm here to say I've experienced no slowdown (unless an anti-virus scan kicks on, or some other program). The game is impressively polished. There are tons of cars and tracks to unlock. The special livery for each car will have you wanting to beat that next challenge to see what it looks like.\nReal World Racing reinvigorated my interest in a game genre that isn't well-represented these days, and I can't recommend it enough. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the cry babies. RWR is an absolute steal when it goes on sale.

Its a game with misleading cinematic trailers that show you more of the game's menus than the actual racing itself. I was shocked to discover this is top down. I suppose looking at screen shots would have told me more than two trailers did. When the game itself shies away from its own sub genre, there's something wrong with it. The game still does it well enough, but its more focusing on turns and following the guiding line than it is fun.\n\nThe cities look good, even if its from a top down perspective. There are details like crowds at the finish lines, trains passing by and even famous monuments are marked on your map. Its good to see so much real world detail, but I suppose that's the help from real world cities and a satellite view. You'll be racing in Prague, France, London and other locales through four lane highways, tight city streets and next to waterways and harbors. For the people that want more, there are cheap DLC packs for Miami, Amsterdam and Oakland. There's standard weather effects, day and night cycles and the night feels the best because a lot of things are highlighted with neon.\n\nBecause its a strict top down view, your vision can be obscured by tunnels and bridges. Going through them you can see the cars highlighted with a faint glow, but I think the bigger problem is it looks like a dead end for a split second, so I began scanning for where there's a turn. It takes my eyes off the action. Speaking of turns, there is an optional turn warning, which would be helpful, but its a second too early even at top speeds. I'd see the signal and turn before I was supposed to.\n\nOf course turning before you're supposed to is never a problem when you have the optional green guiding line on. I highly recommend this green line and I'm thankful that its included. Looking down at a city of concrete with several streets, it can mess with your eyes and all blend together. Sure there's still a mini map, but again that just takes your eyes off the action. One problem I had was hitting a center median of one map when other maps have medians painted red and white. This green line also disappears under tunnels when it should be over them. The line also turns yellow and red depending on the suggested speed of turns.\n\nYou'll find several styles of events in the game in both open circuit make it to the finish and closed circuit lap format. There are simple races that have you in eight or sixteen car matches. Knock out races where the one in last place is eliminated. One on one races are narrow and tighter. This is where your driving skills can really shine. Time trials and checkpoint races are similar where you beat the clock. These both have you racing in an open circuit by your lonesome.\n\nIts the time trials and checkpoint challenges that I notice a glaring problem. The game itself runs smooth, there's no issue there, but these two specific event types seem to skip frames. That is they skip them until after the second or third checkpoint, then they return to the game's smooth play. Restarting or replaying the same event will be smooth as long as you stay in the event. If you exit, then return to the event, it skips again.\n\nThe career mode has you participating in six tours, championships and series. The first two are unlocked from the start, those being the junior series and the optional tutorial driver's license which is a bit on the difficult side while winning actual races is still easier and more enjoyable. Each of these series has several event. When you place third or higher the next one unlocks. Its a tried and true formula, why reinvent the wheel. One thing I do have to say is the list of events only goes down so far, before you need to select the scroll bar to proceed further or back up. Having the list keep scrolling would be a time saver.\n\nThe menus look slick, but a little cumbersome to use with a 360 controller. Using the controller snaps the mouse cursor to different menu items without doing too much to highlight the item itself. Some of the menus have items in so many different locations that I found myself needing to scan around for where the mouse cursor went and where the light white menu is highlighted. It gets into a cumbersome level on a controller, but only in the menus.\n\nIt plays like others from the genre with left and right to steer your car no matter if you're facing, north, east south or west. You have a forward and a backward like a trolley which feels better than a flat out brake and accelerator. There is no nitro, but there is both drafting and drifting. Doing those two tricks and placing the top three in events will earn you more cash to buy better cars.\n\nI'd say that the game is 90% your car and 10% of your skill at least in the early fifth of the game. There's no way to upgrade your cars, so instead you just purchase new ones. Each one has its own stats for top speed, acceleration, handling, drifting and braking. You can also paint your car a preset of colors. Let me recommend something other than blue, because during night races, everything has a sort of shadowy blue tint. Even with the optional player vehicle highlight, that's the color of your paint job.\n\nThese cars are easy enough to purchase even for big money. They are relegated to five classes, which could be for later championships. Its a struggle to stay interested in the game enough to make it through even the first series. I tried, but each of these events feels more like a chore to get through than an enjoyable experience. its just too real for me even with all the frills to make things more accessible..\n\nFor those that want it, there is a multiplayer feature with quick races and online challenges, but two years after the game's initial launch, the online is as you'd expect; dead. From the look of the challenges, you get to select from specific cars I suppose to keep challenges and races balanced.\n\nThe majority of the game's problems stem from its perspective and city street maps. The perspective takes away from the intensity. Going through tunnels can be an issue. The game does what it can to quell the issues with the optional guiding line and arrows, but its more of an apology for the game. There are games out there that have more fun where the challenge becomes the racing, rather than even seeing where you're going.","September 20, 2015","false","2.3"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","0"

There is no visible car damage, however, you do see sparks when you grind againt walls. You cn paint your car from a set of given colors, but there is no customization beyond that (aesthetics or car upgrades). The music and sounds are very good, and help contribute to that intense racing feel.\n\nThe controls are straighforward, however, I would advise you to use a controller if possible. While the keyboard controls are good, the action and gameplay feels much more responsive when you use a controller (especially if you decide to try out manual transmission). The career mode offers license tutorial levels, which are essential for getting you familiar with the control scheme. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with racing games.\n\nOverall, each vehicle operates slightly different - reflected by their stats - making each race feel like you're driving a unique car. To unlock more cars, you need to purchase them, and you earn money by performing well while driving (ex: money bonuses for executing drifts, and even more for performing perfect drifts). Bonus money rates are pretty fair, however, there will be a bit of grinding before you can afford that class S sports car. Once you become comfortable with the game, try playing with the higher class/tier vehicles, as the bonuses are multiplied as you move on to higher-end racers.\n\nThe AI is fairly challenging, if you make a big mistake (like being fishtailed into the wall), you may find it extremely difficult to catch up to the competition. With time and practice, this shouldn't be a problem, as you will learn to anticipate the twists and turns and how to compensate with proper drift techniques (influenced by which car you pick, of course). The race track will always have a green arrow trail to show you a decent driving route, and turns (and hazards) will always be indicated by non-intrusive pop ups in the middle of the screen.\n\nIf you are into racers, give this game a try. Both the career and arcade mode offer fun racing moments, and the overhead perspective changes things up if you are used to the behind-the-wheel (or third-person)perspective.\n\nRecommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","October 26, 2014","true","2.0"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","0"

Soon I was able to look ahead a little of my car but steering correctly at the same time. What I found confusing at first turned out be now a feature for me I quite like as it adds to the difficulty of the game as you constantly have to re-check your position, then look ahead again, while trying not to run into any obstacles you occasionally find in narrowing lanes.\n\nI find this game now very addictive.\n\n- it looks great\n- the steering is very nice (I use an XBOX controller)\n- all cars you can drive handle differently\n- you can power drift\n- slipstream\n- challenges in the licenses and the races along the way are great and difficult on places (nice)\n- nice balance between frustration and fun ratio (it never gets to frustrating not to be fun as you always can see where you go wrong and can improve to be better next time)\n\nThis game is not for players who want to just race ignoring the environment and just get on with it as that way you will keep crashing into things.\n\nYou will need to get used to the feel of this game and then get used to each track. I find myself having to drive tracks several times before I know which corners cause me problems and what car is best for me to use in this race which in my humble opinion is a good thing and adds to the fun.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that you cannot switch cars when restarting a race but need to cancel out of the race before being able to try a different car. However, that is just my personal preference and not a deal breaker.\n\nGreat game 8/10\n\n","May 25, 2014","true","8.3"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

They were using the same cars that I had in my garage but they were a lot faster. If you can't catch up thats it, you just cant catch up. It gets aggravating when you are at the rev limiter and still cant make up ground, No difficulty options, no driving aids of any sort its just what you see. To add to the aggravating the cars brake like they are using 4 drum brakes on 4 bald tires and the in game tips telling you drift here and there are best ignored because the drift slows you to a crawl. Going under bridges might have seemed really clever at first but in the game it can be a real headache as you lose sight of your car and when moving at speed that can be your doom easily.\n\nOverall I was aggravated, there should have been more added to the game.

Plus you have to play it many, many times over in order to learn the route. It's dreadful in every conceivable way.\n- There is no AI in the other cars, they all drive like morons, and if you happen to touch them then 99 times out of 100 you will come off worst, even if you're T-boning them.\n- The main selling point of the game is that each 'track' is a real-world location using photographic data. Unfortunately some of these photographs use a really low resolution and look terrible on any large display.\n- The game uses a scale of various vehicle traits with scores out of 10 for each one to help you work out which car is best for each event. But in nearly every case the figures are meaningless and do not reflect the performance of the car in any way.\n- The cars are all modelled on real-life vehicles though i presume for licencing reasons, they have different names. A few of the cars appear to be performance-matched to the real-life counterparts which is good, but the rest of them do not. It's almost as if the developer's started down a path and then decided it was too much work and so didn't bother for the rest.\n- At least 50% of the vehicles have the handbrake and brake functions the wrong way round.\n- You will be restarting races a LOT.\n- No really. Some of the secondary challenges require perfect runs and the AI is non-existent so you'll be crashing a lot through no fault of your own.\nEDIT: Oh yeah and the game crashes on a regular basis too, especially when after a bazillion retries you finally succeed in a task.\n\nIt's not worth the £6.99 regular price, but do pick it up in a sale if you like top-down racing.

It's actually a very fun racing game presented in a somewhat unique fashion.\n\nIt basically looks like Google Earth/Maps/what have you, with the street view, and your racing is all top down view. This looks really cool, adds a dose of realism to the game, and is effective in presenting the game in a manner quite unlike anything I have seen previously.\n\nI dont know how authentic the cities really are, but they look perfect in my estimation. I can see myself actually driving through those cities. It's all street racing, and there are points where the roads narrow, split, go under bridges or large trees, etc...that can make the races even more challenging than they already are.\n\nSo, what about the races and the cars themselves? The cars are cool. There are a lot of unlockable cars plus an in game dealership to buy more with money earned in races. There isnt a lot of in game detail due to the google Earth approach, but you can go to the garage via the in game options to see what they really look like, what their strengths and weaknesses are, etc...They actually handle a lot like real cars in my estimation. No loose controls or silly features. This game rewards tight, practical control of your vehicle, and everything seems pretty much just like the way real cars handle.You will need to practice to get good at this game. Sloppy play will result in a lot of replays. That said, I didnt find that it took too long to get accustomed to the controls, and once you do, you defintiely feel like you can take down every race. Just know this isnt a casual game as far as the mechanics go. You WILL need to learn how to drive your cars properly.\n\nThe races themselves take the form of all the standards....normal lap races, time trials, elimination, and so on. There is also a helicopter cam race type where instead of being the normal top down view, you instead are looking at your vehicle via the helicopters camera. It's a pretty cool type of race that I havent seen before either.\n\nThe only real downside to this game that I can see is the distinct lack of an online community. There doesnt ever seem to be anybody online, which kind of sucks since a lot of the features and cheevos are dependant on online play. I thinmk the way to go is to simply play with people you know, or possibly to start a Steam group specifically for this, and then list it on the Community Hub.\n\nAnyway, I give the game itself 8 out of 10. It's actually really good. However, that rating could slide quite a bit if you are hoping for online play, which is virtually non-existent sadly","March 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The most important is it's just plain fun to play. Almost as important is that it's fun to look at, especially if you've been to the locations since it's actual aerial photographs you're racing in. There are two primary modes: arcade and career. In career mode, like other games in the genre, you have to earn money to get better equipment and unlock various things. Unlike most others, everything is unlocked in arcade mode! Thank you, devs, for not locking me out of the game I paid for! There are two camera modes: rotating with the direction of the car (so you're always racing toward the top of the screen) or fixed (so your car changes direction as you drive, but the map always points north). Both keyboard and game controller work, but I find the controller a bit too sensitive, especially with the more muscular cars. The only thing I didn't quite like was that if you drive in a street that's covered with trees, your car will be UNDER the trees, which is visually cool and realistic, but you can't see your own car, what's on the road, or even if the road is turning. But I wouldn't even dock it a point on a 1-10 scale for that. I recommend this game without reservation.","May 20, 2014","true","0.7"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

Addictive, intense and fun.\n\n\nI honestly don't know what's all the complaining about. Wanted to try this game for a long time, but since I'm always on a limited budget and have to prioritize, this game had to wait until it was made available on a bundle. I must admit I've should bought it before since this game is fun and delivers everything that you can expect from it.\n\nGameplay´s good, the controls respond and the car reacts to them pretty well. Some people say the backgrounds are a little unpolished, ok, but I usually don't have time to check them out while driving like a madman avoiding rivals, drifting long curves and trying not to get stuck between some old tires. Music and sound effects are good enough to round up a really nice product in my opinion.\n\nOn top of all this you have a large selection of cars, levels, races, game modes and so on. It's so addictive and fun that I've playing it for two days ignoring literally hundreds of other games in my queue; didn't even tried multiplayer because I had my hands full trying to reach the third tier of competition. Some objectives may be hard to attain but hey... What do you want? Walks in the park?

I've played plenty of low rez games even if they're not from previous decades... as long as they're good games.  This one, unfortunately, is not.\n\nI'm not a hardcore racing gamer and I only have mediocre skills across all genres of games. So If my skill is mid-range but the game is developed well, I should then at a minimum be able to get mid-range through completing the game (and usually do on most games).  This game is entirely too difficult.  Getting a driver license alone was a 1.5 hour task (where the entire drive time of the tests combined is about 6 minutes).  Finally, I achieve victory.... just to start the game.  Now, for my first race... 5th place.  Try again... 4th place.  Try some more... now I can't get out of 6th place.  Again, entirely too difficult.\n\nI paid less for Little Racers STREET and I enjoy that game.  In my opinion, games should start out easy (especially to get used to the game), become challenging mid-way through, then finish difficult.  Not start out nigh impossible and then either plateau the difficulty curve or somehow become more difficult which would then make the game impossible.\n\nDo what I didn't do (because of eagerness to take advantage of sale price).  Try the demo first, then go find a good game to play.","June 23, 2014","false","2.3"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","25","40","0","0"

The layout, the way it looks. It's just the real thing.

This is because of the drop-in-drop-out lobby style. Too many players connect and disconnect just before you want to start; leaving you in a race with yourself and nobody else.\n\nBut, despite this strange community behaviour everything else is just good fun.

Well, good ones do. What I love most about this game is the simplicity. I think it's impossible, for me anyway, to enjoy on a keyboard/mouse combo, but with a game pad it's terrific fun. This one isn't about the graphics. It's all about the physics and competition. I was frustrated by the game at first, but after going through the achievements, I've finally picked up some subtle tricks that make all the difference. Also, you must complete things to build that bank account and get better equipment. Car upgrades are essential, but be prepared to learn to drive your new toy, as now mistakes are amplified dramatically. Easy does it. A little stick goes a long way.

The two blend together well creating an interesting style of racing game. Little details to the map like crowds of people and other traffic makes the aerial photography come alive.\nThe game presents itself very well and looks more expensive than price you pay. Just by the look of it, you will feel you have got your monies worth. The actual game however is a simple overhead racing game but it does work well against the aerial photography. It is fun to play however the licensing stage at the beginning of the game is a bit annoying. Once you have passed that then the real fun starts.\nThere is a variety of challenges not just racing that will test your driving skills. The slalom will take a little practice as it will catch you out now again and the helicopter challenge can be a bit frustrating at times because you have to time your speed carefully. However when you have mastered this challenges you will get rewarded with new cars, tracks and also a good sense of accomplishment. The controls feel right from the overhead camera prospective and each car does feel different when driven.\nThe soundtrack is great at presenting the theme of the game.

If you've played a lot of racing games and you're looking for something new and original, or if you love top-down racers and you're looking for a good one, this is the game you're looking for.\n\nThe first thing that demands attention in Real World Racing is the visuals.  The game features a top-down view with 3D graphics created from satellite imagery, which creates a truly unique aesthetic.  While photorealism may be all the rage in modern games, you've never seen this type of photorealism, where all of the eccentricities of the real world are faithfully reproduced to the pixel.  Roads meander, split, narrow, and bend in all kinds of illogical ways.  Houses and trees are all distinct from each other, and often show signs of real-world wear.  There are all kinds of subtle little details, like pools, parks, and back alleys.  The tracks in this game simply feel alive in a way that most games don't, probably because they actually are.  This in turn makes seeing each new stage exciting because the visuals are just so fresh.\n\nOf course, pretty graphics are one thing, but they don't count for much if the game isn't fun to play.  Luckily, it's also very well made from a gameplay perspective.  As with many other modern racing games, Real World Racing occupies a kind of middle ground between arcade and simulation mechanics, where you have to control your speed and use brakes to corner effectively, but cars still corner better than in real life and there's no car damage (though spinning out can happen and is very costly).  This is a great fit for this type of game, as it gives the game some depth without being off-putting for those who just enjoy the visuals or like the simplicity of top-down racing.  There's also a handy racing line indicator that helps you learn the courses and find the best lines, though deviating from it occasionally will be necessary to net those top times.  The game also features a lengthy and well fleshed-out campaign mode featuring 5 gradually increasing speed classes of 15 or so races each, each of which has a primary win condition and an optional challenge for completionists, like "take first place on lap 1 and hold it" or "don't ever hit the opponent car".  Beyond this there's also a single race mode, time trials, and online multiplayer, as you would expect.\n\nFor all of its strengths the game does have a few issues.  For one thing, while the aforementioned challenge system does help to extend the life of the game, many of the challenges simply aren't very fun.  One of the best things about the racing genre is how simple it is - just get to the finish line first by any means necessary - but the challenges frequently place additional restrictions upon you that muddy this winning formula.  Having to restart a race even though you're smoking everyone because you haven't scored enough perfect drifts for the bonus challenge can get tedious, especially on some of the psychotically-hard final challenges.  The game also has some issues with crashing, it crashed on me probably 20 times or so in the time it took me to 100% it, which is a fair bit by modern standards.  The DLC also isn't integrated into the campaign mode at all, which is regrettable, because the maps are otherwise pretty cool.\n\nOverall, it's definitely a fun and unique experience and it left me wanting more (I want to race the entire world now!) which is always a good sign.  Definitely well worth checking out.","March 2, 2015","true","21.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I've only played the single player, and haven't bought any of the DLC.\nI'd say RWR uses a semi-realistic physics system, and the cars are obviously based on real cars, just without the licences or badges. They take the opportunity to switch things up, with some typical Euro hatchbacks being much quicker then they look, and some American muscle cars handling much better then they usually would in racing games.\nMost of the tracks are set in several European cities, (DLC has tracks outside Europe) with a few tracks venturing out to the country and the suburbs.\nThe races can certainly be tough. Although I have completed the game, I haven't been able to unlock all the career bonus races as some of the gold medal requirements are too difficult for me. My advice if you're having trouble with a race is to either try different cars (try cars with better handling, braking or acceleration) or skip to other unlocked races. You'll often be rewarded with new, better cars.\nOne of the annoying problems with a top down racer that uses regular city streets is that you won't be able to see corners coming up, and even worse, large obstacles sitting in the middle of the road that you have to navigate around (though you do get warning signs and a racing line to follow). This means at certain points positioning your car on the sometimes very narrow fast racing line seems to require either more luck then skill, or slowing down to a crawl, meaning you aren't driving as fast as you would be if the camera was in the usual first and third positions, which can feel frustrating. Certain tracks are also so narrow you'll be bouncing off one side to the other trying to get past opponents.\nSome of the game modes can simply be annoying, and at times feel rather unfair. In the slalom competitions, you will at some points have to slow almost to a stop to position the car to get through very tight gaps in narrow city streets. (With certain camera angles buildings actually overhang the circuit). I definately didn't like the Helicopter Chase competitions, where you have to stay in the sight of a camera that wanders into awkward corners, and speeds up and slows down very quickly, requiring several tries before you memorize the cameras movements.\nSo in conclusion, while the game definitley has problems, on the whole its fun, and is doing some things rather different then the usual. It also boots up very quickly to the main menu, which is nice.","September 16, 2015","true","19.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

I don't know that the game gets much more depthy than the tutorial challenges put into practice on a course with opponents.\n\nFirst of all, the controls are not very arcadey.  You will really only use a few buttons - left and right steering, accelerate, brake, and hand brake, with the option to throw in an up and down shift on the manual transmission.  But the cars handle like "real" cars.  They're sensitive and twitchy.  Because of this, my first impression was a bit let down, but after playing for just a little while longer I started to appreciate the attention to detail that you'll need to play well.\n\nSecond, the overhead camera is really cool, but can be hard to follow, especially when you're moving at speed.  Your car can get lost in the environment and boom - that's it.\n\nJust like with real cars, if you make a mistake, you're going to feel it.  It takes a little while for your car to top out at max speed, so if you bump a wall or opponent, you are going to slow down and lose a lot of ground that may be impossible to recover.  I already know how I'll react to this without playing much - during races this can be highly frustrating, but equally rewarding when you execute a perfect run and win a race.\n\nIf you want something forgiving where you can zoom around and bash into things, this isn't it.  You have to pay really close attention and focus while you play, but because of this RWR is intense and captivating.  After accepting that there was a strong sim component to this game, I started to enjoy the tutorials a lot more, and I'm headed back to try a few beginner races.\n\nEdit to add: Very fun to do the actual races.  Not forgiving of mistakes, but your car doesn't take damage as far as I can tell, so you do get a bit of a free pass.  Noob pro tip: just like driving a real car, I found myself looking up ahead on the track as opposed to at my car.  Also, mastering drifting is absolutely critical.","June 14, 2014","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Each car handles differently than the others, and this difference is more nuanced than the stat bars give away - for example, the Class 5 Bugle Mago has a pitiful top speed, but it has this unique tendency to "overclock" in fifth gear, enabling it to accelerate and drift through tight corners without needing to compromise and lower gear. There is a huge amount of play and replay value even with the career mode, and the races are challenging and demand skill and attention to the track.\n\nIn essence, RWR is a huge breath of fresh air to the racing genre, and I very highly recommended it for people who want something more than just an easygoing arcade romp.","June 15, 2014","true","13.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a bit of a blend between arcade / sim, due to the fact that you will actually lose some time with drifting, or hitting the walls. The game rewards taken a good line into the corner, hitting the apex just right. Reminds me a bit of the manner in which Project Gotham Racing on the old Xbox rewarded neat driving, with kudos.

It is a neat idea of using aerial photographs rather than creating tracks from scratch. The resolution of the photographs is not ideal but they are fleshed out nicely to give them vertical depth and a bit of life with the inclusion of extra details. The range of cars is good too. They are like the Disney characters painted on ice cream van, they are immediately recognisable but just different enough to not infringe copyright. The cars are nice and varied in terms of performance too. I initially thought the game was too difficult. However for most of the game I was tantalisingly close to the target so it kept me wanting to play on and I gradually improved. It was only very near then end when it got to the point where the races got too frustrating to be fun any more.

The driving school is now optional. That means you can now start racing right away and get on with the really good part of the game without wasting time doing menial tasks.\n\nThis is a very nice change as I really hated the driving school. I wasted at least a half hour or more on this and it mostly doesnt help you drive any better. The drifting is useful but the rest of the stuff is not needed. I will admit the game is a lot harder then I would wish it to be. The timed events are very very tight and you cannot make many mistakes. If any really. The one on one event that I did was in a very tight one lane road with only about 3 places to pass the car. Its not easy. The game has Leagues and I am right now doing   the Sport Championship thats one below  the junior champ.\n\nI will admit I enjoy the racing parts with other cars the best. Its fun and exciting and takes some skill to overtake and win a game. The timed events could be better as its super tight. I like that they decided to make the change and hopefully more people will play this game.\n\nJust a little bit more. I wish they would have focused more on the racing with cars and much less on the side events. Examples would be the helicopter race, the slalom racing as its very tedious. The tracks themselves are fun but often times the designers decided to make the cars race thru alleyways that only allow one car. Strange. Also the clutter gets in the way of track and your car so it makes it very hard to see your car.\n\nWell I finally gave up on the game. I couldnt pass 2 of the events and just called it off after having tried to pass it for about 45minutes or more. I got stuck on the Sports league and now I am stuck on  that leaugue. Doubtful I will every touch the game again. The game idea is good I just wish the game was not so Ultra Hard.","March 3, 2014","true","5.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I just do, and since They're aren't any "really good" driving sims on PS4 yet, I've been kinda in a dry spell as far as that goes. I decided to pick this game up on the reviews it's been getting online, and I do like it, but I don't know if I would exactly recommend it.\n\nFirst of all keep in mind that you can love racing games, without liking racing sims. So, if you're looking for something you can pick up and play, with cars that will control like butter without any effort, look elsewhere. Real World Racing rewards...no... it THRIVES on tight controls, basic and advanced racing mechanics, and a bit of experience in games like these. However, this is not your first rodeo as far as these kinds of games go, you'll be quite surprised with how much skill, and experience is needed to get good at this game, and how rewarding it is to win races in RWR.\n\nHowever, that's not all. Let's say you are used to games like these (i.e. Raceroom, Race07, and the soon to be coming out Project Cars) you'll know that they're 3D games that give a good perspective on what's coming up next. With this game being a top down racing game, it tends to be trickier to judge corners and upcoming turns. The RWR crew have tried to make this a little easier coming in, but it still takes a bit of getting used to.\n\nThere is a multiplayer mode on this game (maybe it's the times I get on, but I never really see anybody on), and the community page on steam for this game seems lively, so if you want to talk to people about the game, or pick up pointers, or play somebody online, it shouldn't be too hard.\n\nThere's also a diverse amount of cars here (based off of real life cars too, but with different names for trademark, and copyright safety), so you'll be bound to find a car that you like in each class in this game, however there's really not much in the lines of customization. Maybe they'll fix that when the next game gets released.\n\nAll and all, this is honestly a decent racing game for the people that are extremely into racing sims. Not so much for all racing fans though, and even at that, if you're looking for a cheap good racing sim (if you don't care about playing online) Race 07 feels like a better game in all, for less. However, This game runs well on pretty much every computer I've run it on, so I can get my competitive racing fix without worriying about how the game's going to run, and even though it's a 2.5d top down racing game, they put a lot of effort into stylizing, and detailing everything from how it plays, to the look of all the tracks and cars. So if you're looking for a good, cheap, multiplayer, racing sim on Steam right now, this might be what you need.","February 26, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

On the other hand there are the impossible challenges.\n\nPros: nice graphics, fast-paced music, races are fun\nCons: AI is either stupid or unreasonable good, challenges are unbalanced\n\nI'd rather see the devs work on the flaws, instead of making new content (DLCs).

A lot of reviews are negative because of it, but i'm not sure why. Steadily increasing and maintaining speed means that careful and clean driving is rewarded, and messy/overly aggressive driving is severely punished (as the cars can take awhile to get back up to top speed). That is great to me.\n\n+ Large selection of game modes, tracks and cars.\n\nThe bad:\n\n-Unfortunately some of the game modes are awful. Helicopter mode sounds really good in theory, but in reality the helicopter is excruciatingly slow and performs nonsensical actions like circling around a corner slowly and breaking your rhythm (and most likely making you go into the 'red zone', which is bad). I also don't have much love for slalom, narrow roads with cones that cover 90% of the width of the track are very hard to slalom around and are more of an annoyance than a challenge.\n\n-The performance. The FPS is all over the place, even with the 'performance setting'. I play Grid 2 60fps completely smooth, I play this and the framerate is wild. Hilariously, it's not the drops that make the game unplayable, it's the unfathomable jumps that send the cars into hyperdrive and makes them nearly uncontrollable.\n\nThe ugly:\n\n- Description says that the game is a stunning visual experience. I would have to disagree. Night races hide some of the deficiencies, but daytime races show that the use of 'high res aerial photo images' does not work in practice. It probably sounded like a great idea in development, but it's far too grainy.\n\n\n\nI rarely encounter games I would label as a 'rough diamond', but this is certainly one of them.\n\nI don't know if I could recommend this game or not, Steam really needs a middle option. I would unfortunately have to say no, as the bad points overwhelm the good.","November 23, 2014","false","10.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Racing through the most beautiful cities in the world it's cool. Unfortunately, when it comes to gameplay, most of the excitement goes away. This is not a bad game but it plays bad somehow. First:the driving model is under your control only in the early part of the carreer, then the cars become too fast that you can't really see where you're going, plus some of handle very bad and every single little adjustment you try to make to your trajectory goes orribly bad. Second: game modes: aside of the  classical game modes, the real goal of the game it's not to win races but to accomplish some of the stupidest achievements in order to obtain the gold medal; I mean it's right to have some special achievement in each race to unlock special cars etc... But they should not be mandatory. Also one of the race mode is one of stupidest I've ever seen : you have to stay within the view from an helicopter, the problem is that the camera movement is completely unpredictable and pointless, meaning you have to try again until you have memorized the movements which takes away all the fun.\nThird: graphic:although developers made a great job highlighting the track, you can't really understand (also because of the high speed mentioned above)  when there's a turn or whether the road shrinks.\n\nIn conclusion the game do not really deserve a recommendation. I heard developers are working on the sequel and it'll be full 3d,that could be a huge improvement.

The graphics are hideous - the cars are totally unidentifiable whilst racing, and the track textures are also very poor. Far too often, there are sections of the track where you cannot see your car at all, or there are walls that you cannot see. The engine noises are barely there and are bland, whilst the same nondescript background song constantly loops throughout the game. There are no real graphics options to speak of whatsoever, and the car physics are just woefully bad. The game is also really heavily unbalanced, and if you fall behind in a race, you have no way to catch up, even if you get every turn right and have the quickest car! The idea of this game was good, but it was so badly executed that, quite frankly, almost any other game in this genre would be better.

Well lets start with Career mode. Most if not all racing games have a Career mode and this is usually to teach one how to better master the game for online play and for all around challenge and enjoyment, but at Playstos they decided to do what NO other racing games do. And that is how to make you a worse driver! Now at the beginning of Career mode you would not think this. Because it is about teaching you how to drive in a ridiculous and frustrating manner in order to get your "license". As you advance in your Career the devs have made sure to frustrate even the most seasoned player. By this they have put in goals which are not obtainable within times that have been set by the best players online. Cars that change performance values in different races. I have tested this with time trials and there is no doubt performance values change. The challenges themselves are pretentious and asinine all at the same time. I have yet to encounter this in any game before. For example. It is already a bad enough idea to have a "Helicopter Chase" but 5 of them is over the top stupid. On one of them, it requires you to come to a complete stop in your car and wait on several occasions because you need to stay out of the "Red Zone" in order to obtain the goal! Just idiocy. But wait it get's even worse. On another challenge, a time trial none the less, you are required to put your car in reverse on the last gate? I could go on about this for 65-70% of the challenges. Who thought of this crap?\n\nI have seen no pages on helping players to obtain goals either. Whats up with that? The devs act like it is some "secret" on what cars are best to use on what event challenges. I personally do not think any of the devs can complete their own game without cheating. From what I can tell the goals are set by a time that the AI makes at almost if not perfect times. Which in turn disenfranchises players and turns a game that could be a gold mine to Playstos and a big hit to PC racing fans into yet another flaming piece of crap. This game has so much potential is makes me ill to see what is being done with it. It is more about puzzle solving mixed in with some masochist hair pulling than racing. I do not think any of the dev's are passionate about racing and or do not know much about it. This game could be a huge HIT with PC racing fans. The platform is the only thing being utilized right on this. Everything else is either not thought out or seems no one really cares and they just want to have yet another unrealistic driving zombie whatever game. If you want to play a very unrealistic driving game with some Zombies and a asinine career mode that will frustrate you a hell of a lot more than entertain you, then this is your game. If Playstos plans on keeping this game as an unrealistic car driving, kinda racing arcade game, they should just sell it to devs who are passionate about racing and are not into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their customers with events they themselves cannot do. With the market for a good racing game on PC being FREAKING HUGE, I cannot believe this potential is wasted like this.\n\nHere are a few directions to go in Playstos if you have plans on ever becoming a "racing game"\n\n#1 tunable cars\n\n#2 A career mode that is actually rewarding, challenging and fun. Not pretentious,asinine and nearly impossible for 98% of your players to finish.\n\n#3 maybe some real physics and car damage rather than impossible times to obtain?\n\nThese are not by any means original ideas or some stroke of genius. They are tried, true and tested things that make for a great racing game. I love thinking outside of the box, but why do opposite of formulas that DO work? Playstos, your platform is original and great on many levels, then it just falls flat on it's face after that. It is up to you if you want to make it work or just keep this game growing into some unrealistic arcadish/puzzly crap (maybe a Vampire DLC). I hope you guy's get your Sh** together and I play this hit racing game called "Real World Racing" someday soon.","June 4, 2014","false","47.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

Just plain racing for the points with a goal to be a champion at the end of the season. And with no restart option in between racing to be even more 'real'.. It's challenging, it's realistic and yes, maybe oldschool-ish. Are younger players really that spoiled for a need of restart option at every frikin' moment at every kind of game out there? Back in the days, if you screwed up in the middle of the game, it was game over. Yes THE actual GAME OVER text, as big as the screen itself, which (as an idea) doesn't even exist in such modern games anymore.\n\nSo all you're left with are challenges, lots of different challenges which don't really pull me in as they should suppose to.\n\nDriving itself is okay, with funny and unrealistic drifs from time to time. But most of the tracks are made from loooong narrow roads with sudden turns which you hit with full speed if you don't really know the track too well. But since the game doesn't have the actual damage system of the car, that's okay, cause you'll probably be quicker in most turns hitting them with full speed, rather slowing it down to the point to actually get the turn without hitting the wall. Which is a shame.. With an option to damage your car, therefore risking it beeing slowed down or even destroyed, you would be more careful and therefore pulled more into the game. There are awards for 'perfect lap' and distance without a hit, but that doesn't do much.\n\nThere are other top down racing games made in recent times which I would recommend over RWR. Therefore not really recommended.","January 12, 2015","false","11.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The Google Earth pictures are low resolution photos and look a bit pixelated. On the other hand, the amount of detail can be distracting and make it a bit harder to follow the actual race. Additionally certain objects on the map are modelled and can obscure the view of the players car. For example, if you drive under a bridge, the car is only visible as a colored shade.\n\nThe difficulty level of the game is best described as bipolar. From the very beginning of the career the difficulty of the races switches from very easy to frustratingly hard and back. To make matters worse, it is quite often not obvious why the cars behave the way they do. Cars that should be slower in speed as well as acceleration, according to the in-game stats, are sometimes significantly faster, when driven by AI-opponents. At this point I have to admit that I don’t play many racing games and that I am generally suck in those games, so maybe it’s just me who is missing something.\n\nOn the upside, the game features a lot of different cars (not licensed) and they feel quite different. This is the reason why keep coming back to this game for a few races, despite its flaws. At the end of the day, there is no other racing game ( at least I don’t know one) in which you can drive through real city, even if it is just top-down on a satellite picture ;-).\n","May 21, 2014","false","15.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

But it really let me down! :(\n\nAnd here is why:\n1. No upgrades.\n2. No tuning.\n3. No real visual upgrades beyond a very limited selection of colors.\n4. Very hard right from the beginning.\n5. Multiplayer setup is so bad you might as well say it’s broken.\n6. As for the Z-Races, it has no new game modes, it’s basically a regular race, but zombies are walking around. Major let down!\n\nAs for what I can say that’s good about this game:\n1. The graphics look really good and I think it was very original to use Google Earth to make the maps.\n2. It has the best top down driving mechanics I have ever played.\nBut that’s all I can say good about this game.\n\n2 out of 5\n\n","May 25, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Despite the name, nothing reacts remotely the way the real world would. I know that's a cheap shot for a top down racing game, but really, it's just not fun at all. The control scheme, the fact that there are things in front of me, like obstacles, that I can't see until I've slammed into them, the bizarre handling characteristics of the various cars...

Upon first glance - top down Gran Turismo? I saw potential, until i got to Career mode and had to do ultra repetative license tests.\n\nThe game began to randomly crash on me (running Windows 8.1 on a fast laptop), for no apparant reason and it did not seem to be the fault of steam or windows. The graphics were nice, and it is a shame i could not get past the license tests to share any further interest in the game. Complete stops are to difficult and i think need to be tweaked. They were never that difficult in GT.\n\nPoint is, i have plenty of patience, but this title serves to only get on my last nerve without letting me give career racing a try. The license tests should be optional and serve as a bonus feature. It is buggy as anything and that is unfortunate because the game has nice potential. Tune the difficulty down a bit for first timers.\n\nHere is an idea of what i am running:\nProcessor: Core i7-4700MQ\nRam: 16GB DDR3L\nVideo: Nividia Geforce GT 745M 2GB Dedicated Graphics\nAudio: Dobly Home Theater\nOS: Windows 8.1.\n\nThe game didn't lag, but it certainly crashed enough for me to stop playing.","December 9, 2013","false","0.3"," 14 of 41 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","14","41","0","0"
