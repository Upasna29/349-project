This is a negative review. This game is bad. I really did try to like it. It just feels broken. The controls feel broken, the skills are unbalanced. I only played a few hours. I just did not want to try anymore. It just wasnt worth it to me. Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, just so many more out there that are really good. This feels like a lazy port. It fooled me because the video and store page made it look so good. Im giving this review to help my steam friends stay away from it.

That sums this game up well. Crappy port of a game built for a platform not ideal for gaming.\n\nThis game is poorly designed and has some horrible game breaking bugs. Im a reasonable person, and I know its an indie game so I can cut the devs some slack. I can do that much. But unfortunately what I cant do is play a game where when I click on an enemy, my spell fires way the ♥♥♥♥ in another direction. Additionally, the witches minions always lag 3-4 steps behind you, so basically you have to run into a crowd of mobs and aggro them then run back to get the minions to attack. This coupled with my characters ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aim means that when my spiders finally do attack, they take damage too fast since most my attacks miss completely and the enemies dont die fast enough. If they devs arent going to take the time to correct something so critical as a spells aim, then Im not going to take the time to play it.","June 27, 2014","false","3.9"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","48","52","0","0"

But then, for a $15 price-point, I would NOT expect a high end game (with a notable exception of Van Helsing!).  As other reviewers stated, there are lots of minor bugs and the voice acting is so flat that it is terrible.\n\nWhen it works, the game can be fun and there does appear to be a good story in the background.  The main problem was that there were times when a dialog box was supposed to appear and you are supposed to be shown some text from the story but when that dialog box didnot appear, the game was stuck.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/julespetrikov/recommended/248710/","julespetrikov","Widerstand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/julespetrikov/","65 products in account","Okay, first of all, I get it; This is a low budget, independent attempt to create an Action RPG exclusive for mobile devices and they've ported it to PC Platforms to widen their audience. Major kudos for people who put effort in this game, I really mean it. But, you see, when you develop a game or even any software on mobile devices, there's not much of an expectation because of the nature of mobile devices; Yet, when you port a particular piece of software that is designed to run on mobile devices, to PC Platforms, you raise the expectation bar pretty high. That's purely because a PC is much more stronger and a lot more customizable.\n\nNow, why did I buy this game? Because I had a couple of bucks to spare and it was available on Linux - which is pretty much the biggest selling point for me, as we don't have many Action RPG titles. And, sadly, we still don't have that many good titles as they have on Windows.\n\nI've read many comments and reviews about this game before buying it and I've realized that the game was in worse condition than this, as this is a PC Port. I can clearly see that they've made quite the UI Improvements, comparing to the Mobile Version of this game; Which is a good way to go but they should've made this happen at the time they were porting the game to PC. This is the main cause of the early negative user reviews and they are right, unfortunately, still the game's User Interface is pretty much useless and is still suffering from touch screen features.\n\nSo, there are porting problems but what about the actual game? - If you're a Hardcore ARPG Player, you will be disappointed. The game is painfully easy and has many design flaws; Not to mention bad controls. Playing this game with a mouse as a Witch, for me, was quite painful. That's why I don't use mouse, I use my keyboard to control my character and use my abilities; and again, since it's designed for mobile devices, you have the Option to turn on or off auto-targetting. - Which is ironically the best feature this game has because it's poorly designed for a Ranged Character.\n\nGraphics aren't that bad. Not a challange, compared to other titles like Path of Exile, Grim Dawn or Diablo III. But it's okay; Not many ARPG fans do actually care about the graphics, rather than optimization of the game to allow players play the game at a higher level of smoothness and frame rates. - So far, I haven't encountered such a problem. Kudos for that.\n\nI loved the Soundtrack. OST is probably the best thing about this game and it's pretty good, you may or may not agree with me. - It gets a bit too repetitive, though. Voiceacting will seem decent to a point. But, yeah, you'll get annoyed by it anyway. And, again, it's a low-budget game, I wouldn't use this as an argument. I understand.\n\nControls are.. well, not optimal. - As long as you bind your skills to the letters around your "S" key, which is the default Auto-Attack bind for the game, you're good to go. You really don't need to play this game with a mouse. Playing the game with numbers 6-9 is pointless, at least for me. - One other thing that will majorly bug people who'll choose to play this game as a Witch, when your enemy is near you; Your character will start Melee your enemy if you're using your Default Attack. Needless to say, it's weak and will most likely get you killed.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing interesting about Characterization and Building up your character. It's pretty generic and quite dull. - Story, so far, is too cliche. Storytelling is weak. Dialogs are badly written and you really won't care about the Lore, when your screen is filled with Character Dialogs, talking about nonsense. - It could be developed better. But, yeah, I don't think this is their selling point anyway, since it's a freaking Action RPG for Mobile Devices.\n\nI really don't want to be harsh. But, again, when you port your game to PC, you'll raise the expectations and when those expectations could not be feed with proper features, your game will get downvoted for many many reasons.\n\nBut, let me be honest, I've had good time with this game. and the ability to play an Action RPG on Linux is always a good thing for me. Yet, this game looks undone. That's why I will not Recommend this game. - Until the development provide the proper fixes to the gameplay, this isn't a game that worths its initial price. But from a discount, yeah, maybe. If you have time to spare or don't expect that much, you might entertain yourself for hours, just to beat the game and get some achievements.\n\nIesabel might be a wasted potential. I'll never know. But I hope they learn from their mistakes and develop better games for PC. - Again, thanks for porting your game to Linux. It means a lot.","December 23, 2014","false","22.3"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","43","47","0","0"

For some reason you come equiped with a spike club, torn pants and a shield.\n\nLesabel has all the things you expect in these type of games. There's a character sheet with all your basic stats (Str, Dex, Int Lck etc). There's a quest log to keep track of your progress. Inventory and Map to tell where you are going (or have to go)\n\nControls are typical point and click to attack and a skill bar but still feel clunky.\n\nAI .. at least the first few encounters.. are painful. They basically look at you all the while your mouseclicks at times become unresponsive and occasionally hit. You can be clicking to your hearts content and nothing will happen until you move your character forward an inch or backward. This serves as a major problem as I almost died while being surrounded by 3-4 baddies within 5 mins of gameplay.\n\nYou can scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. I prefer to play scrolled in as you can see the baddies a bit better and target more accurately.\n\nWhen your character is moving it feels like he's floating as there is little animation. Pathfinding does not flow well. You cannot click down the path for your toon to go there, you have to click (and hold) close to the toon to navigate him around the right map corners.\n\nI know this might be me being picky but not only are the colours all a dull shade but the text is very boring.\n\nMy favorite part by far is the sound when you level up. You are greeted with a voice that sounds an awful lot like Doctor Claw from Inspector Gadget. "I'm getting Skilled!"\n\nI ended my adventure with this game upon reaching the witch doctor, not without dying a bunch on the way at a measly level 4. The text was hard to read as it blended in with the background but the jist of it is, my character is a horrible guy that killed a bunch of people and has no memory. - That's when I decided to uninstall the game. However I couldn't find an exit menu so I had to Alt+F4 it.\n\nVerdict - Do Not Recommend. Instead play Diablo, Torchlight, Titan's QUest or Dungeon Siege.\n\nEDIT: I now know why I couldn't hit the baddies as much as I would of liked. This isn't point and click. Its Point and Click and HOLD.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=244750912\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=244750717\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=244751028\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=244750811","April 1, 2014","false","1.2"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","46","53","0","0"

Since this game was on sale for $1.49 at 90% off, I figured why the hell not buy it for myself and a couple of friends. It's $1.49! It has multiplayer! Surely this would scratch our itch for a dungeon crawler. Sadly, it didn't. I can't say whether the game is bad or not. I refuse to play it. What I can tell you is that if you intend on purchasing this for the multiplayer, DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE. I only paid $1.49 for this game, $4.47 if you the two gift copies I purchased. I absolutely regret it. The multiplayer in this game DOES NOT WORK. Not online, not with LAN. Seriously. It doesn't work at all, and if you read around the forums it doesn't look like it ever has. Don't make the mistake I did and assume that this game is worth a dollar. It isn't.

At that point I already wanted to give up.\n\nI forced myself to level up to 10, and tried the same with the other class. The Soundtrack was getting on my nerves as it seemed a pale attempt to imitate Tristram Theme (Diablo) mixed with some Metal influences and the intent to sound kind of oriental. This impression got reinforced once I played the Barbarian Class and heard his voice. When you overdo something, well it doesn't sound genuine at all at the end.\n\nAround level 6, noticing there was an extremely fast repop of all the mobs on the map and thinking that was kinda cool... I met "The Shaman". Well horrible story telling and shallow scenaristic choices there. Then, I found out my XP bar after going up insanely fast at start, did not go up at all. And that is one very very very bad design choice to go from "I get so much XP in no time" to "I can kill a million monsters and there will be no progress" in regards of the game economy.\n\nSo let's talk about that, game economy. Setting up my skills after leveling up, I find that I have to choose between some battle skills, some stats enhancing skills and the alchemy - the crafting "novelty" for the genre. Well, to craft a potion (beside the fact there is only a chance to achieve that depending on the level of the skill) I need to buy vials, and have a few ingredients found all over the map. So far so good, right? Well no. Buying a potion directly from the shopkeeper do cost slightly more than a vial, well actuallly nearly as much... so why even care about the alchemy then since it present so little benefits on top of taking skills points you could assign somewhere else? - Well kind of somewhere else since it is not like there is much customization options or cool skills or even synergies which require ambiguous choices from you. Falling flat once again.\n\nAdditionnaly, the respawn of all mobs, the poor and dumb loot (opposed to "smart loot concept" - as I was getting more stuff for "the other class" than for the one I played, and to mention that I found no stash or even less shared stash so basically every epic/legendary you drop that is not for your class is only trash loot - or worth a bit more money than actual trash loot), the stamina system and the XP lock (or extremely steep reduction of XP gain) makes it senseless to stay in an area to farm it (to upgrade your character) as the cost of fighting the mobs may be higher than the benefits of doing so, and even if you took self-regen health skill the action of farming remain pretty boring since the only benefit you get from it is (poor and rare) loot. Then the Stamina, you can hardly cross the village without getting exhausted... seriously? No one in the design team thought about turning that off in the village? baahhhhh...\n\nI really really kept trying to play, despite the below par graphics, the horrible pathfinding of my spider (Witch), the inability to blow a destructible object while I am standing 2 pixels away because the attack just does not want to trigger just like it also happens when NPC's accompany you and for some reason prevent you from attacking the mobs (Barb) and the voice acting and dialogs which at some point I would have like to switch off ("this area stinks like hell!") but instead had the option in the setting to set my zoom level (which works with the mouse wheel as well). I really tried to enjoy this ga... *sigh* ...thing.\n\nBut it feel like everything in it is an attempt to populate the UI and to imitate what has been done before in the category in terms of gameplay, without having actually thought about the gameplay as everything is highly unbalanced and utterly lacking depth or innovative thoughts (also I do understand that with such rigid game mecanics, it may have seemed hard to do more).\n\nWell, I did not pay so much for the game myself - though in terms of time spent on it it has costed me much more than Diablo series, Torchlight series or Van Helsing series combined. If you enjoyed any of the latter, you may not enjoy Iesabel at all as it fall short in all aspects it tries to clone and also fail to add value with the crafting system. I uninstalled and will never discover what pleasures and scenario twists awaits me in the mid and end game and well, I can't recommend this to any gamer who respect himself as such.","October 18, 2014","false","0.1"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","36","46","0","0"

There are only few color indicators for equipment, like a missing red color for gear you can't equip. The german translation is googletranslate + hasn't been translated at all - very bad job, really - if you can't get this done well stick to english but don't give us a sh*tty translation.\nWell, and the graphics itself are ok, nothing more. Flora looks nice, enemies and main character have good animations. Some NPCs look like ps1-era, nevertheless.\n\nWhat did I like?\nThe music and style overall. It's like a dark diablo with ambient music. Even though I haven't tried alchemy and other crafting skills due the lack of information overall there are many different ingredients like berries and enemy drops to collect for potions, scrolls and other things.\n\nOverall:\nI can't recommend this game after playing it for almost 2 hours. The flaws were killing my motivation within the played time to bottom zero.\n\nDisclaimer: I've played diablo 2 for more than 1.000 hours. Titan Quest almost 200 hours.

I could imagine playing this on the bus on the way to work... but as a fully-fledged PC gaming experience, it falls significantly short of the competition.\n- $15 USD may be asking too much, when there are similar experiences of higher overall quality for a lower price out there.\n- The basic combat is unresponsive, which too often results in awkward, unenjoyable experiences. Combat being the bread & butter of the game, this quickly becomes tiresome.\n- Character designs are often poor, or just bland, and the quality of their models match this.\n- The animation is APPAULINGLY amatuer. This makes the game incredibly dull, rendering the world's inhabitants devoid of any personality or energy.\n- The sound assets are a joke, and have that overall "canned" feeling: terrible voice acting and sloppy effects.\n- On the UX (experience) side of the UI, there's a lot of work that could be done. Navigating the game's interface often feels unintuitive.\n- Very few in-game graphics options, with the absence of features like AA being particularly noticeable.","March 7, 2015","false","2.6"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

But I'm having a lot of fun with Iesabel, and that's all I'm asking from a game.  This is a fun dungeon crawler in the vein of Diablo III or Titan Quest.  Indeed, it has a rough translation and some fairly awkward menus to grind through, especially when managing resolutions.  Plus only two characters for use is kinda a step back, even compared to Diablo 1.\n\nBut I'm giving this game some leeway, due to the fact it started out as an iPad/iPhone mobile game.  On those devices, this game is a freaking dynamo; it's easily one of the most deep 'hardcore' games on mobile devices.  When ported to the PC, it faces much more competition, especially as deeper and higher budget.

It's very hard to do. This game is what you call PURE EVIL. When you love action RPGs like Titan Quest or Diablo, you go and make something like Path of Exile or Grim Dawn. But when you see those games getting support and want some too while doing especially nothing, you make Iesabel. This game is not just bad. It's one of the worst I played, and from my profile you can see I play a lot. I also had PS1 back there and PS4 now, plus Wii U and 3DS. I never seen such a catastrophy of a game.\n\nThe worst thing in Iesabel is the controls - and I can't explain it, it just feels broken. Your character moves whenever he or she wants, and you cant realize, what's blocking your path, because ground texture is like... I dont want to use the s-word here, but this is perfect analogy. Graphics is unappealing to say the least. Character  progression is broken too - skills are not only stupid, but unbalanced.\n\nJust do yourself a favour and dont support this kind of lazy "indie" developers. They should be punished, not supported.\n\n***\n\nЭта игра просто отвратительна, я давно не встречал ничего подобного. Когда кто-то пытается лениво склонировать Диабло и постричь денег на популярном некогда и переживающем второе рождение благодаря играм вроде Grim Dawn и Path of Exile жанре, получается нечто плохое. Но Иезабель - это не просто нечто плохое, это НАТУРАЛЬНОЕ ЗЛО.\n\nИграть в эту игру просто нереально. Управление уничтожает любые попытки получить хоть какое-то удовольствие. Ваш персонаж движется как марионетка на веревочке, а уж какп рименять скиллы... Это даже не буду комментировать - это надо самому прочувствовать, НО НЕ СТОИТ. Более того, скиллы ужасны и несбалансированы, а количество персонажей то ли пока, то ли до определенного момента в игре равно ДВУМ, что не дает даже надежды на разнообразие. И, повторюсь, подбор навыков у этих двух классов уныл.\n\nСловом, ни в коем случае не поддерживайте этих лентяев.","February 14, 2015","false","1.8"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","31","42","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/simeonwhite/recommended/248710/","simeonwhite","Simeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/simeonwhite/","78 products in account","Long Story Short Iesabel is a good game that is lacking in several features. The art is mediocre and the music is the same. The game, surprisingly, has a very good story with lots of plot twists. The achievements are broken and up-grading system is disheartening. And yet, somehow, I still played it 32 hours. Sadly, there are only two classes to pick from and the mage is the only one that is half descent. Which really sucks for those of us who like to play as melee class. I honestly believe that Iesabel has a solid foundation of fun game play yet it lacks far too much polish for it to be a great game. 6/10\n\nLong Story Long- The Game PlayLike most games of its kind, there will be a lot of running around, dodging attacks, grinding, and lots of regretful up-grade points spent in stupid areas.  Surprisingly enough, the developer added in crafting system in order to make potions, teleporters, and enchantments. This adds in another dimension to the game as you search for plants, scraps, etc. along your way in order to create all sorts of useful items.  There are multiple quest and side quest to complete in the game all of which offer XP and gold. These quests enhance the experience and provide extra play time despite how unreasonable the NPC’s requests are.\n\nThe Loot System and Upgrades The loot system for Iesabel has received a lot of complaints. But I find that it’s one of the redeeming qualities.  Instead of the normal armor system where you just trade armor your lower value loot for clearly better equipment, Iesabel forces the player to pick careful. You will have to choice whether you want a helmet with higher armor but doesn’t have the +30% spirit that the other did, or if it’s worth it to lower your dexterity for the sake of your defense, and so on and so forth. When it comes to upgrades, the game has six options: strengths, defense, dexterity, spirit, intelligence, and luck. Unfortunately, the player has to guess as to what any of them mean. For some odd reason the creator decided to leave you clueless as to what they are by not making no explanation for what any of them mean. On top of that, the up-grades become useless towards the end of the game. Who cares if you invest all your points into strength if it’s only going to increase your attack by 1%? It’s really a shame and extremely annoying.\n\nMusic, Sound, and Voice Acting I was pleasantly surprised by the music upon playing. It fits all the themes perfectly and really added to the experience. However, the sound affects where a bit of a letdown. They were very generic, repetitive, and really get on your nerves when there are so many dang bats making your ears blead with their terrible shrieks. And then there is the voice acting. I finished the game on easy without volume on. By the time a replayed on medium I had a pretty good idea of who the character was: a witty, sarcastic, educated, self-centered dame that really, really wanted to find out her origins. Then I played with the voice acting on. I’m not over doing it when I say that she sounded exactly like a fat cave women. I can honestly say that having that voice acting on for five minutes was the single most frustrating part of my month. Thank the Lord, yes I literally thanked him, that there is an option to turn off the freaking thing. If you buy this game make sure to disable it as soon as you enter the game. Just press esc and toggle it off.\n\nArt and Achievements The artwork is neither here nor there. The sprites themselves are very well done but you often are able to see out of the room or you notice that the shading is dramatically off. As for the achievements, they were, in essence, disappointing. The majority of them are bugged and sometimes weren’t given to you after completing the requirements while at other times were randomly given to you for doing nothing. Furthermore, two of them are broken, there are quite a few multiplayer achievements that can’t be done, several of them require playing 100+ hours, and a few of them make you play the game completely over 15 times. Don’t get me wrong, the achievements do worlds more good than bad. In fact, I sacrificed 20 hours just to get a few of them. I can confidently say that I wouldn’t have played this game if it wasn’t for those bugged, broken, unfair achievements.\n\nConclusion Yes the game has many, many flaws. Yes there are hundreds of better games of its kind. Yet, Iesabel has good game play, a great story, decent music, and is very fun to play in one to two hour increments. I had a few friends actually ask me whether I would suggest this game or not. After I had thought about it for a while, I said “yes, I think I do suggest it. But” I warned “make sure to get it on a mega sale, don’t expect much, and be darn sure to turn off that flipping voice acting!” Gameplay- 7/10. Music- 8/10. Sounds- 3.5/10. Voice acting- 0/10. Art- 6/10. Achievements- 7/10. Story- 9.5/10. Final rating- 62/100","March 17","true","32.4"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","24","32","2","0"

It feels so much like Diablo 2, I can't even begin to describe the similarities, it might as well be Diablo 2.\n\nIf you need a style of game like this, for your tablet, then I suppose, buy it, but as far as PC gaming, Torchlight II, or Path of Exile, and I personally didn't even like Path of Exile, but I'm going to tell you, that game, is better then this one, in game play, resolution, story, depth of characters, every sense of the word.\n\nIesabel gives you the choice of one of two characters, Barbarian or Witch.  Really Witch should just be Necromancer and be done with it, but yeah it's a Witch.  Barbarian is Male, Witch is Female, there is no choice to switch or swap.  There is no character customization of any kind, I imagine finding loot changes your appearance, but I didn't get far enough in the game to find any loot.\n\nBasically it's an IOS Game, if you're buying games on your PC, there are many games that do it bigger or better, get one of them.  If you are hard up for a Diablo Clone in every sense of the word on your tablet, and you want a challenge, at least in the start zone, then give it a go, if you're that hard up for a new game. :D:\n\n2/5 stars","February 5, 2014","false","0.4"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

There is a lot of banter with NPC's which make you feel very sheepish while reading through their monologues and you dont really want this type of feeling in a RPG cause lets face it, you would end up skipping it once you have had enough of it.\n\nDesign and Graphics: The graphics are fairly descent, but like I mentioned above there is just something about the blurry effect that does not bode well with me. After this hour spent in the game, I could feel the strain on my eyes, which is definatly a first. The design is fairy APRG'ish and does not do anything beyond of what this genre already does. Imaginary walls were galore here as well as weird dead ends.\n\nPlaystyles: Not a lot of variety here, considering its a story of 4 people you get to only play one class... The skills get very pepedative after a while.\n\nCombat: Very very very clunky, you guys really need to rework this, espically for the magic class, I found it really hard at times to land ranged attacks. Sometimes the skills would just miss and other times my char decided that facing away from the approaching danger and firing her weapon was a better idea....\n\nGrind Level: For the one hour I put in, I reached level 7 since the mobs keep spawning in regular cycles. I did this with zero stat increases as well as basic armor drops. With regards to the story, I did not even complete one quest....\n\nLoot: The loot system like combat needs to be reworked. Since there are just 2 types of classes, is it really essential for my magic caster to get warrior type drops throught the damn game. My first Legendary was for the other ******* class. This was just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nThere were two other attractions crafting which I didnt come around to doing and multiplayer which was having some problems at the time of writing this review.(The devs were good enough to mention this before you purchased the game)\n\nTL;DR: In its current state Iesabel is not worth it. The devs have something in their hand though and with imporvements here and there, it could transform into a descent laidback ARPG.\n\n\n\n","March 10","false","0.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The tab icons (character, skills etc) show no info while hovering over, so you have to try until you find the right tab. Items can disappear, e.g when you try to equip a staff when you wield a totem and a shield. The character reacts inaccuratly to mouse clicks. If you use the auto targeting mode you have a hard time targeting the enemy you want. If you don't use it, you habe a hard time hitting at all. Projectiles are fired in the direction the character is looking after a short delay instead of the direction the mouse pointer. That means either you stand still until you have fired or the projectile will fly in a random direction. But even if you wait, it can go wrong, when the mouse pointer is above some unpassable terrain, which is hard to distinguish.\nAll these things slow gameplay down, which isn't fun.\nThe graphics are not good, but OK.\nIn my opinion the game is in a pre-beta state and needs a lot of fixes.

I am usually one that prefers to try something for myself before judging a game so I gave it a launch. And boy was I disappointed. The opening scene really didn't explain much although the artwork was very nice I give that to the developer. But the graphics looked way too 2000esque. Don't get me wrong that can be a good thing in certain games but in this one they looked horrible. The Menus and the font in it are clunky and the interface very hard to understand. You only had two classes to choose from the Witch and the Barbarian who play exactly the same way and are very generic in design. The enemies are also very generic. Plus they have promised a fix to the Multiplayer who doesn't even work back in 2014. It is 2016 and clearly no fix has come probably because the developers abandoned the game. Even if you are one of those persons who buys cheap games on sale just for cards? Well think again since this game has none of that. I can't recommend this even on free so avoid it like the plague.

There are annoying things in the game like when the story wants to push you into a direction and you walk into an area to explore the character will just turn around and say it needs to follow the quest -_-"\n\nThis was a waste of money.. not even worth the 3.50 euro I paid.","January 14, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is pretty much a game in beta state right now.  I just finished a complete playthrough on Linux and the entire experience was pretty "meh".  I am a big fan of the ARPG genre and the pickings are slim in Linux at the moment so I picked up the game last year sometime when it was on sale for a little under $4.00.  At that price point, I would recommend the game to anyone who likes the genre.\n\nProbably the most positive thing I can say about the game is that the graphics engine is actually pretty good.  I'd give it a 7.5/10 and rank it just a notch below Path of Exile when comparing it to recent ARPG titles.  The art style is sort of in between D3 and PoE, with a more gritty, realistic direction than what D3 had.  Environmental animations are done well.  Character and NPC animations not as well, but adequate.\n\nThe music/ambient sound is not bad, and is varied enough throughout the game that you probably won't end up having to mute it--UNLESS--you're playing the barbarian with the horrible voice.  Seriously, it's like Bale's Batman voice was trying out for a death metal band's lead vocalist opening.\n\nThe controls are so-so.  You can tell the game was ported from a touch title.  Sometimes you think you're clicking on something (and most likely are) but the game doesn't want to acknowledge the action.  Fortunately for combat you can assign a key to your standard attack so it didn't hamper this aspect of the game much.  It was most noticable when trying to pick up loot and you had to click around 10 times before it would finally pick up.  This didn't happen often enough for it to become a throw-the-monitor-out-the-window type of nuisance.\n\nThe stat engine, very important in any ARPG, is pretty generic and simplistic.  Unfortunately, the loot is very generic with no named items or outstanding qualities to be found throughout the game.  You get unique, epic and legendary items that just have those classifications tacked on before the item name and some pretty generic stat modifiers depending on which classification it is.\n\nThe difficulty level (on default/easy) has some weird swings early on but the game does become quite easy toward the end if you've spent your skill points wisely.  The skill system itself wasn't horrible as a barbarian, just a little simpler than say D2.\n\nProbably the biggest flaw in the game is the English translation.  It's awful.  I can only imagine they hired Kanye West to do it.\n\nFinally, there are a lot of bugs.  Nothing that kept me from finishing the game, however the final boss fight did partially freeze up on me the first time I attempted it and I had to kill the game process.  The second time through worked out ok.   In the third act there are graphics placeholders for conversations with some of the NPCs; there are quests in every act that don't work correctly; there are achievements that are unattainable with the game in it's current state.  Apparantly multiplayer doesn't work after the latest patch (Dec 13) and the developers seem to have disappeared.\n\nSo, to summaraize, I'd give the game somewhere around a 5/10 at the moment and I can't recommend it at it's current (14.99) price point, or at any price point if no working multiplayer is a deal breaker for you.  Otherwise for a single player ARPG it's probably worth checking out at $5.00 or less.","May 18, 2014","false","9.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I still gave it a yes to encourage future indie gaming as i'm fed of the 3 hours long SPs and MP focused AAA boreness nowadays. If you don't have high expectations than this game will give you some nice hours (at least more than 3-5 hours).\nBE WARNED it has numerous bugs! Some friendly like stuck mobs waiting to be killed, funny bugs like floating trees or trees without trunk or nasty bugs like invincible enemies buging you through a level (fortunately it only happens on a few levels and only if you stay too long on it). The game excels in visuals and sound/music. Some levels are just beautiful like the Glacier or Gardens. The music is nice Diablo (1) like throughout the game, but some may find it annoying. The sound effects sometimes are very good except the barbarian voice that is annoying/scary/funny, sounds like he needs some serious talk with a psychiatrist and absolutely do not fit with his apperance.\nIn overall it seems the devs took some time into the game but they had not enough resources.\nIf you give it a try choose the witch, her basic magic 'gun' don't eat mana and forget alchemy skill route as that is a total mess . BTW this girl can be nudified ingame. Maybe the devs fear someone mod their game (who? why?) with a nude patch so they included it. I have never seen such offense in other offical games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonsofblades/recommended/248710/","sonsofblades","Regent of Skull Mashing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonsofblades/","563 products in account","First impressions after a short bit with the game.\n\nThe graphics aren't too bad, they're passable, better than what I would expect out of some low budget indie efforts, but after having played some amazingly beautiful indie games (such as Dust: An Elysian Tail, FEZ, Monaco, Mark of the Ninja, Sine Mora), the graphics are average at best. Animations are extremely stiff, and lack liveliness, which is inexcusable, considering the animator tools available on the market. One other gripe is that the in-game text doesn't scale properly to well-known resolutions, such as 720p, which makes things hard to read sometimes.\n\nGraphics aside, how does the intial game play? It's again, average. The point-click-die-loot system is in place, but targeting leaves something to be desired, requiring more precision than most ARPGS I've played to kill something (minus Realms of Ancient War, which has terrible mouse controls). The menu paneling is quite difficult to manage, especially in the inventory, when some standard conventions such as the Shift-click don't even exist. Minor quibbles overall, which can be improved with some feedback to the devs. If they even respond anymore to the feedback.\n\nThere's some unique ideas here, such as the inclusion of an alchemy system and a crafting system, which I have yet to try out, but it looks fairly well fleshed out.\n\nThere's quite a few bugs that I've noticed while playing it that is irritating, and should not be in a non-beta product whatsoever. For instance, when the framerate dips even a little, the sound should not start skipping like it was being played on a record player. Seriously. Or when a help message pops up in the middle of combat, then is dismissed, then the PC continues to swing/shoot like a madman, irregardless of input. Weird little things like that, and I encountered them in a very short amount of time, so who knows what else there is.\n\nOne last thing of note: Turn your sound off. Seriously. The sound effects are terrible. And the voice acting is even worse. And not in the hammy-B-movie kind of way. It's just bad. There's no punch to the sound effects, and there's nothing but headache-inducing voicing throughout.","March 1, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was obsessed with Diablo 2 back and the day, and still play D1 every new and again.\n\nI Loved the playstyle, the feel. The types of monsters, like the annoying fallen, and the badass looking balrog thingies (can't remember the name), all in big juicy groups too. and andarials boobies! i remember when i first noticed them, i was like, Look at that, game ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, the challenge without being too annoying aspect of D2, I could always go back and grind catacombs, or durance for the loot. You knew what was out there, just had to find it! Like a treasure hunter with a very vague map.\n\nWith  that said. If your seeking nostalgia, this game is not it. i could oinly stand maybe 30 minutes of, let's just stick with it and see.\n\nPros-\n-Pretty nice graphics,\n-auto gold pickup is always a plus,\n-health orbs, Makes one of the cons less annoying\n-inventory layout was to my liking. classic, simple, and on the side of the screen where it belongs.\n\nCons-\n-annoying minimap, and an over abundance of stupid looking overcomplicated stuff.\nOnly 2 different characters to pick,\n-didn't care what their skills were. guessing, hitting stuff, hitting lots of stuff and shooting shiny stuff at stuff, possibly a summon or 2. Who knows.\n-You regain health constantly (not too rapidly), so you lose lots of health and have to wait around as a barbarian, frequently. potions didn't last me too long.\n-Found a waypoint, no town to go to, yet. Was wierd looking as well. one big circle in the middle and bunches of little circles around it.\n-Some crafting thing, also didn't care to learn.\n-Monsters were lame. mosquitos, wolves, and totally unimaginativly dull stuff.\n\nSo, if your a sucker for pretty graphics, here you go.

Iesabel looked interesting, but fell far short of the value, even as a casual diversion.\n\nThe English translation (at least) is poor, but it's readable and can be understood, so that's not so bad; and, at least the voice acting is enjoyably awful. I giggled like a child every time my witch leveled up and cheerfully proclaimed, "I am getting skilled!" However, when paired with the buggy combat and clunky controls that don't always work right, it all became a real downer. The whole experience feels unfinished and poorly-programmed, as if a lot of time and resources were spent developing graphics and the actual gameplay was thrown in as an afterthought. Unfortunately, in a Diablo-clone, that really defeats the purpose.\n\nThe aiming is terrible, even with auto-aim turned on. Every other time I tried to attack an enemy, my character would shoot in whatever direction she happened to be facing at the time, without turning. The skills are poorly detailed and mysterious; you can really only figure out what some of them do by putting points into them and attempting to use them. Maybe most frustrating of all, there's very little in the way of help or information available; tutorial pop-ups can be turned on for new characters, but all the features that gamers have come to recognize as standard and even fundamental in this type of game, nowadays, are absent: No windows appear when you hover over anything (you have to left-click to bring up a separate, static window), descriptions are vague or nonexistent, and when played at fullscreen resolutions, the text can be eye-watering to try and read.\n\nThe clincher for me, though, was the story. I admit a certain bias: The device used at the very beginning is one of my pet peeves, but that's because it's bad writing. Like, Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits bad: You're apparently one of several heroes summoned by the "Shaman" who is the head of the Council of Wizardry. He has seen a great darkness threatening to destroy blah blah blah. All humanity blah exposition blah evil blah proper noun blah tragedy blah destiny blah blah and for some reason these mighty heroes and champions are riding in a cart and literally no one is driving, the horse is just going where it wants.\n\nThen these demons or whatever attack and kill everyone but you. You go the Shaman, who's nearby. He wears a fur shawl and lives in the tiniest hut.\n\nThe tiniest.\n\nIt is a filthy, dirty, tiny yurt.\n\nAnd when you tell him what happened, he says you must prove your innocence because he can't know who actually killed the other "heroes" or you'll be put to death as a traitor in 5 days. "By the laws of our people..."\n\nWhen you say "How dare you call me a liar," this dirty, mean, weird man proclaims that he is THE HEAD OF THE COUNCIL OF WIZARDRY AND HE WILL END YOUR MISERABLE LIFE.\n\n"BUT YOU BROUGHT ME HERE. YOU SUMMONED ME. YOU KNEW I WAS A DESTINED HERO. YOU HAD A VISION. WHY WOULD I LIE, THERE WERE DEMONS. I'M STILL COVERED IN THEIR BLOOD."\n\n"Nope. Go to town and do sidequests or I, in my dirty yurt - my durt - will kill you, even though you are a foreigner who is only here because of me and even though you were attacked by the demons from my vision who I summoned you to battle against, fifty yards from where I sleep as head of the Council of Wizardry."\n\nSo I lost interest. :|","March 27, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Creating a new character didn't work for me until the third time, the other times it would just freeze at some loading screen.\n2. You can't load an existing character! When selecting it and clicking load, nothing happens.\n3. When creating a game over multiplayer, you can't create a character, hence you must start a single-player game first.\n4. The game should support cross-platform across mobile and desktop devices, but you need to enter an IP adress. Good luck hosting a game and having people join it on your phone with an IP adress you share with hundreds of others, even your PC is likely to be hard to find. There's no lobby, no friend system, nothing to help you find your friend's servers.\n\nThat being said, the one time I did get into game but couldn't load again, the game wasn't even worth my time anyway.

Here are my thoughts...\n\nShould the game have been released?  Yes.  Should it cost money?  No.  Why?  Because the game is so full of bugs that I would honestly consider this a Beta and NOT a full release.  Until they are fixed this should be free.  Some of the bugs: the game minimizes to desktop regularly; the player will get stuck in terrain; some monsters glitch causing them to not able to be hit but are still able to do damage to you; the game does crash though rarely...etc...\n\nGameplay...  I understand that the developers' primary language isn't English.  I can accept this.  But I cannot accept a translation that leads to very juvenile, confusing and idiotic dialogues.  Most of the time I felt like the NPCs and even my character were 3 years old.  It was completely annoying and made the game's plotline difficult to follow.  Near the end of the game I just didn't care anymore and clicked my way through all the conversations.  Also, the lack of proper translation leads to Axes and Mauls being labelled as "2 handed swords" and etc...  Basically, most weapons are labelled as a "sword".\n\nThe fighting...  The game missed the mark on this.  One would think that you could click on the enemy and be able to kill them.  But this isn't always the case as lootable items laying on the ground will interfere with your targeting.  Sooner or later you will just click on the Sword button in the action toolbar to attack and stop clicking on enemies to attack.  I only played as the male fighter but I noticed that if I only used my sword attack I didn't receive much damage.  As soon as I tried any of the special skills I immediately recieved a large amount of damage.  This made it so that I completely stopped using or caring about any of the special skills as the use of them would severely damage or kill me.\n\nLet me wrap this up...  The game in this current state is playable and at times very enjoyable.  But because of the many shortcomings I can not recommend paying for this game.  Until these things are fixed, I would advise you to NOT get this game.","February 6, 2014","false","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's less annoying to disable help entirely and figure out what everything does as you go.\n\nWouldn't really recommend it when there's numerous alternatives in this genre.

The bad news: It's still somewhat buggy on PC. Interface issues and leftovers from touch controls that weren't converted properly still litter the game. The good news: They're actively working on it! They didn't just do a quick port to PC and leave it as is to lure in unsuspecting consumers. I believe there's been at least two patches since I purchased it personally, both of which have a decent list of fixes. Every patch is an improvement, so pick it up, store it in the vault, and keep an eye on it!\n\nTL;DR: An investment. Built for mobile gaming, so good for quick pick-up-and-play when you don't have much time, but still rough around the edges.\n\n-----\n\nEDIT: 1/11/16\nAs of this time, the rough around the edges comment is the biggest factor here. As it turns out the potential was never really reached, and the devs appear to have given up on it. While I haven't played it on the PC recently I have more experience with the mobile version, and I've been following the community. I hate to turn a positive review into a negative one but Iesable could have been so much better, they just seem to have stopped caring.\n\nAs such I can no longer recommend it. There are simply too many bugs and bad design choices left behind, as well as previously-working features that no longer function. If only they had kept up the same level of support it had started with, perhaps it have been a worthy add to any ARPG fan's collection.","January 13, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

If we look on the bright side, this game is almost as good as Diablo III (too bad DIII was terrible), the graphics are tolerable, and it cost me little to no money.","January 14, 2014","false","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not completely atrocious, but doesn't do anything well.\n\nThe controls are the worst part, especially with the ranged character.  There's no "stand still" button, so if you miss the enemy's click box by even a pixel, you'll run toward it.  Abilities target awkwardly, and often incorrectly.  The magic arrow spell travels in the direction your character is facing rather than where your cursor is aiming, while the summon spell frequently gives error messages saying you "can't do this," forcing you to move to a spot where you can do this.\n\nGraphics are uninspired in design and crude in execution.  Dialogue is written in Engrish with numerous typos and grammatical errors.  Voice acting is flat and apathetic.  Some games can make up for mediocre gameplay with good presentation.  Iesabel is not one of them.\n\nI lost interest when the game locked up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainiepic/recommended/248710/","brainiepic","BrainiEpic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainiepic/","206 products in account","Thank god I got this game for free...\n\nAs a big ARPG fan, this game is a giantic NO. I literally stopped playing in the first location.\n\nSo lets see what did I find in 0,3 hours of my playtime.\n\n1) Graphics.\n\nThis game was released in 2013 on steam? It looks worse than Diablo 2 and Titan Quests which are damn old, but still look fantastic. I couldn't even tell the difference between terrain. Everything looks blurry, no AA,... Options menu gives you only a "post processing" option, which is not saying anything. Does it add bloom? Ambient Occlusion? No idea! But hey, at least it has "interractive grass" right?\n\n2) Performance\n\nWell, at least something good about this game. Even my older laptop did handle this game well.\n\n3) Combat\n\nOhh boy.... it is as clunky as it can get. Don't expect something deep. Don't expect using shift to cast spells and not to move. There is nothing like that in this game. I tried a Witch, whose gameplay was basicly - use your spell on CD and kite enemies while walking backwards (I will talk about animations in the next point). I hoped for more spells to use as I got skillpoints... Well, I got a spider, with AI of Dragoon from Starcraft I, and a teleport that was hiding my UI for 1s after I used it. Also drained tons of my mana - not like I was getting OOM anyway, but it is a teleport, not a pyroblast.\nAlso my Witch started bashing a mosquito with her staff instead of using LMB spell, for no reason of course.\nAbillity wise.. hopefuly there are more spells than you can see at lvl 1, because there is only 9 class abillities. 8 stat buffs (including shields) and 9 alchemy skills.\n\n4) Animations\n\nYour character is good at moon walk. Also as a Witch, you will still be walking like some brute with a mace. Zug Zug.\n\n5) AI\n\nThey just walk towards you. If you kite for a while they will form a train. Nothing complex here.\n\n6) Voice Acting\n\n"I am so good, I astound myself!" What great quote from Wizard in Diablo 3. She makes you love your character. Unlike in this game, where main character seems to be... forcefuly happy about loot. "I am rich!" "More gold!" in nearly monotome tone. You can't mute your character by the way, only volume slides are Enviroment, Music and SFX.\n\n7) UI\n\nSo, after googling I found out it's "not just a port." To quote the dev "it's not simply a port. The visuals are on a whole new level. Gui is optimised for PCs." Well then tell me why this game lacks any sort of tooltips (unless you click on spells, HELLO MOBILE), you can't drag abillities into a bar (you have to click on a slot to assign a spell to it. Why is menu on both sides of the screen? Who knows, my guess is look > functionality. Tutorial messages are tedious, nearly jumps scares, that open from the sudden, freeze your game until you close it's window. HP and Mana- I mean Vitality and Spirit globe have a strange glass effect on it, which makes it really hard to tell how much HP you have (Why is it so dark red anyway?..).\nInventory is another chore. You get 4 tabs for your items (game doesn't tell you about this) and they sort your look into categories. You have to click these super tiny buttons (bear in mind there is a giantic space above the inventory grid) to check your weapons, armor, materials, etc. Armor and Weapons you pick up are not automaticly equiped when you lack an item of the same type and they get "lost" in these tabs.\nGame doesn't tell you when you have a skill point / stat point unallocated (it is not that hard to make these buttons on sides flashy!) and tutorial doesn't tell you where to allocate them.\nFont used is so overused and look just slapped into it.\nNPC interaction is very weird and is surely designed with mobiles in mind and is hard to access it in the first place.\nGame doesn't even tell you there is a minimap, which is hidden by default. Normal map is as bad as it can be.\nYou can make HUD smaller which is kinda nice. You can also customize your keys.\n\n8) Story\n\nCan't talk about this one. I was not really interested in it.\n\nOverall: Don't buy this game unless you are a sadist (no offense, sadists). Go rather buy Titan Quest, Torchlight 2, Van Hellisings or save up money for Diablo 3 with an expansion... or play Path of Exile for free.","February 28","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I bought it because it was 90% of, but to be honest it's not worth the money. The graphics aren't really up to date, which wouldn't bug me that much if it at least looked like old graphics that aged well but they don't.\n\nThe intro is made of popup boxes with text that block the whole screen. "Your controls are A,W,S,D,Z,X,C,V,N and 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 for potions" was the first. It kinda goes on like this.\n\nThe sound is ok, but the voices are really static. As much as I like voices for game chars, I prefer text boxes over bad voice acting - always!\n\nJust skip this one, maybe there's a youtube video where you can see more if you're still unsure. I will probably play alternatives such as Grim Dawn or Path of Exile.","March 19, 2014","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will also find yourself dying a lot unless you repeat the same areas multiple times killing trash mobs to level up, if you just go ahead and try the quests as they're given to you you will die as they're higher level then your character at that point (for example, a quest to kill a bear is given to you in the first town, the bear is about level 20, you are about level 9 when you get to town) making the entire game very difficult and slow. The graphics are fantastic at least, with blades of grass blowing in the wind and pretty decent 3D light sourcing and shadows.

You can however sit like a king on a throne of riches, surrounded by NPCs.","May 23, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has bad pathing when you move, the key mapping doesn't allow the bindings which seem obvious, the mutiplayer is extremely bugged the majority of the time you can't even join the friends game even though a big selling point was multiplayer. In summery the graphics are nice but this game is rubbish. even at 90% off i wouldn't reccomend this.","May 24, 2014","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
