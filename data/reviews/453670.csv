The Lost Souls is a "sequel" to White Mirror - except it's practically the same game with a different color palette. Same setting, same "walk-up-to-statue-and-hit-keys-in-a-certain-order" puzzles, same underwater switch flipping, same monster, same, same, SAME.\n\nGame is completable within 20 minutes, assuming it doesn't crash. (It's worth noting, the game didn't crash for me like it apparently did for others) The "puzzles" are literally just typing words backwards in order to open locked doors. Unfulfilling, dull, senseless tripe. I'm sure the same will be said about the next game this developer uploads about 3 months from now, per his schedule.\n\nIn summary, terrible.","April 11","false","0.6"," 162 of 167 people (97%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","97","162","167","20","4"

Occasionally you get a "root system error" when you try to save as well which I guess is the closest thing this abomination is going to get to variety.\n\nThe Lost Souls is atrociously written, horrendously translated and is honestly about throwing seven switches over fifteen minutes. Never buy it. Never play it. This would be considered an abuse of human rights by the government in a George Orwell novel.\n\nSheer garbage awaits your eyes below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obRqRrv6y9U","April 12","false","0.5"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","48","52","15","0"

The graphics, except for the water, are sub-par and the story negates any fear of dying as you are already dead. That said it's slightly better than most low budget horrors that stumble onto steam, but this is not hard to achieve. The puzzles are hilariously simple and the game has NO options menu whatsoever. The occasional environment can look okay, but the textures elsewhere bring the game down.\n\nWould only recommend if you're already dead IRL and need a reason to be glad about it.\n\nFor my full review with screenshots:\nhttps://koolthingsforkoolkids.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/why-did-i-play-the-lost-souls/\n\n\n\n","April 11","false","0.4"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","45","51","5","1"

I'm very easily scared, but this game really didn't do it for me. I only played it for about 15 minutes so far, but its very remeniscent of the first game the developer made, which I thought was very dull. Still, its a VAST improvement over that game. I didn't experience any crashing, as other reviews point out, so I guess that's a plus. I wouldn't recommend this game, as it just lacks excitement for me.\n\nHere is a few minutes of gameplay if you want to check it out:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRqGsq_DyfI","April 11","false","0.2"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","0"

Pika!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pikasaurus/","141 products in account","I was intrigued by the theme of this game and knew it had a significant number of bad reviews. I went ahead and got it anyway assuming other players were exaggerating. I found out that they were not exaggerating. It is a very short game which is generally empty in spite of the screenshots. The few monsters this game has are programmed in a way that they do not react to you, but merely follow a predefined path. The English is extremely bad and I would have expected the developer to let this game be reviewed by someone else more proficient in it. The story is only half a story. The puzzles are too trivial to even be in the game. You have to keep using the SHIFT button to move a little bit faster as without it, you would be bypassed by snails if they were in the game. The game has a replay value of 0. You can probably finish it in 20 - 50 minutes and will then never 'play' it again. As far as I am concerned most demos are more polished than this game. It really could have become something with a LOT of effort, but the developer apparently did not feel the need to do so and apparently chooses to keep selling empty games like this one in different formats. Unfortunate. The game does have a clever marketing strategy to draw players in, but that is all it has. In all fairness the game does have scary moments and they are not badly done, but they are very scarce and at some point you just know the full extent of what the game does and does not do and the surprises then end there. I just expected a lot more and a lot better.\n\nIn this case it was not a case of whether the game was good enough to play. No, it was a matter of whether the game was good enough to be in my library. I did not consider this game worthy to remain in my library and thus permanently removed it from my library.","May 27","false","0.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
