You mindlessly shoot hilariously unbalanced enemies that will fly at you from the sides of the screen and kill you before you can dodge. There's one broken achievement, the score doesn't even display properly (19,000 displays as "19,0"), and the game doesn't even remember your high score. The game even received a steady stream of updates for a few years, which somehow made it even worse.\n\nThe one positive thing I can say about this game is that it introduced me to "Surface" by Dimrain47, a great piece of music.","April 29, 2015","false","3.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I am going to try to be respectful in this review, but this game is very bad and easily the worst I've played in a while.\n\nFirst of all, Arcardia fails at the basic requirement of being functional software. I was not able to get a working controls either by keyboard or mouse or my gamepad. There is no help menu or even a key binding screen I can tell what keys I need to press. If you want to rebind the gamepad keys you need to edit the configuration file manually. If you want to rebind the keybaord keys then you may be out of luck as I saw no configuration file for the keyboard.\n\nGameplay wise, this game really wants to be Geometry Wars. It's to the point where it follows Geometry Wars home and Geometry wars should consider getting a restraining order. If this game was commercially successful the developers of Geometry Wars should consider legal action. You might think I'm exaggerating, but I played them side-by-side and the difference is uncanny. The only difference is that Geometry Wars actually works and is a lot more polished.\n\nAcardia mimics Geometry Wars in the following ways; grid background, distortion effects, weapons and weapon progression, controls (best I can tell anyway, seeing as they didn't really work for me). Even much of the enemy AI is a mirror of Geometry Wars. It's even to the point where the same AI had the same rough shape and color as it's counterpart in Geometry Wars.\n\nJust buy Geometry Wars if you don't already own it. It's much more polished and, most importantly, it actually works.\n\nScore: 0/10\n\n\n\n","December 14, 2013","false","0.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I'm fairly sure this is a first work of an aspiring programmer, and it's not terrible by any means, but it's just not worth really playing when there are better options out there for your cash and your time.\n\nA quick look around the Steam Store will uncover more than a few games with more meat on their bones than this one.  Geometry Wars is an obvious one, as was Waves.  They have everything this game has, and more.\n\nAs a bright point, I did like the song track.

Arcadia is a casual shooter (As clearly mentioned) that is not meant to entertain you for long periods of time like other games.  This game is fun to play on and off when you don't have time for other deeper games, and it fulfills that goal excellently.  Don't buy this game if you are looking for a hardcore game to sink many hours into to beat or to become the best at it.\n\nWhether this game is being actively updated or not isn't really relevant.  The game mechanics are solid and very entertaining in a casual situation, and I'm happy having given a one time payment of 2$ and receiving the end product I got.\n\nOne point that I want to given special mention to is the music in this game.  Hearing the music in this game is like half the experience of playing this game.  The dev of this game put together an awesome soundtrack for this game, which ends up making it extremely relaxing and enjoyable to play.  The music in this game is techno and trance from Newgrnds (Steam censors the full site name for some reason), so if you like that kind of music you'll probably enjoy this game\n\nAs the description clearly states, "Arcadia is a fun, casual little shooter." And that's exactly what you get when you buy this game.  Hardcore gaming experience for hundreds of hours of evolving gameplay, no. Fun 2d bullet-hell shooter with awesome music that's worth a few bucks, yes.","December 14, 2013","true","10.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

The music is ok but its from Newgrounds.com so if you want that get it there for free.\n\nDeveloper tried working on this a few times but nothing changed. Also might not work that great on certain pc's.\n\nSave your money for an better game.","January 6, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is relaxing and provides a type of gameplay that I hunger for which cannot be fulfilled by first person shooters or block building games. There is an addictive quality about it. Some may not think the game is actually worth five dollars, but I got my time out of it. Remember when you buy it that it is just a simple arcade game.\n\nPros:\nGameplay is challenging\nGameplay is well defined\nNot many issues with bugs or crashing\n\nCons:\nOnly works on windows\nLimited game complexity\nNo trial version","December 5, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't waste your time.\n\nThere is a configuration screen outside the game, and an in-game options screen. They do not agree on what are the actual settings.\n\nIf you have a gamepad plugged, the game will use the gamepad even if you disable it in the configuration. And the XBox 360 gamepad does not work correctly (the mapping of analog axes in-game is broken). The only way to play with the mouse is by unplugging the gamepad.\n\nBroken achievements.\n\nUn-engaging gameplay, most of the time you will die before having time to react.","March 22, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Arcadia is a game that feels like a student finals project that completely apes the visuals and mechanics of the far-superior game Geometry Wars.   If Arcadia had come first the comparison would be better because by itself it's entertaining in a do-it-yourself homebrew venture, ie: there's nothing terribly *bad* about it.  Still there's no escaping the comparison: next to Geometry Wars, Arcadia's controls and movement flow aren't nearly so finessed (I couldn't get duel stick control pad to function properly), the player character and enemies are tiny and not very artistically distinctive, the music isn't very compelling, and the visual flair is a throwback to 1993 without much in the way of modern razzle-dazzle.\n\nMaybe the game gets better the longer you play it but after spending 20 minutes on it I don't think I'll be trying to play it much ever again.","January 28, 2011","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's unfortunately also no key binding feature which is important for a game like this that heavily relies on the control scheme.\nWhat is even worse is that it doesn't support controllers even though the store page says it does.\nThis is probably the worst Steam game that I own and I'm surprised 52% of the reviews for this game is positive, as I think this game is barely playable.","October 26, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a good warm-up game to get my eyes moving. To play it, try to beat your own score by leading the enemies around until your ready to fire. At the same time, watch behind you for imcomming assaults. The higher you get in score the differnet types of enemys you will encounter and adapt to. The music drew me into this game but at the 10 min mark I ask my self why I keep playing this game because it is quite broken. However, I do play it regularly. I respect games that are different, original with a good soundtrack and hard to master. This game is, so for that, I would say if you dissapoint easily, dont play it, if you keep an open mind for games; you will enjoy it.","November 7, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
