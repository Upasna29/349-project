It's considered to encompass birth, life, death and the universe in a simple story about a donkey, "Balthazar". If there was ever a game like that...oh, wait. Now there is.\n\nThere is more truth and wisdom in this "game" than most people will encounter in their lifetime.\n\nIf you consider that the above statement might be true, and is of interest to you, please continue reading. If not, it may be best for you to stop, and do something else.\n\nBecause I play games, I often begin things that I understand will be failures. This review is now among them. There is no way I can encompass this game in any way other than, perhaps, another game, or perhaps a great film. This is not so much something to be played, but rather to be experienced (however cliche'). Better yet, lived. The truth in this game is not incidental to the game, it IS the game. There's nothing in Beeswing that isn't also in life, but in life we miss it, over and over, because events in life become passe'. In Beeswing NOTHING is passe' or missed, it's all too obvious.\n\nThe premise is that a young man, Jack, has returned to his Scottish childhood home, Beeswing. He visits as an adult, but also as the child of years past. At times he is again adult, usually briefly. And nearly everyone he encounters relates glorious (or terrible) life changing stories, experiences or feelings. It was the children on the playground that first brought tears. It was the beauty of the words on grave markers, particularly the pet area, where the tears flowed from this 57 year old man. And in the story's old age home dwell the wonders and horrors of life that propel this story into being something amazing beyond simple discussion. Yes, it explores those things that we spend our lives afraid to examine, but must before we die. And it does so as unflinchingly as looking into a mirror.\n\nAt one point in Beeswing I cried out in pain. How does this game developer know my most terrible secrets?\n\nI don't know how others might be affected. Perhaps it's the specific difficulties of my life that makes the difference others may not feel at all. (Not to say ALL lives aren't difficult, but mine may be more specifically affected by the events in this game. I can't know.) Who might like this game? Perhaps some suggestions for making the decision.\n\nThis game is likely to be enjoyed by you if:\nYou've ever considered that instead of 99% of people always being wrong in matters of belief, 100% might possibly be right sometimes.\nYou wonder why it's necessary to show the same television advertisment a thousand times.\nYou think it might be possible to have an inkling of the meaning of life, because you have spent time wondering.\nYou've NEVER bought yourself a perfume because of a celebrity's name on the bottle.\nYou think that maybe EVERYONE has some specific and unique gift that elevates them among all people in some way.\nYou ache for the suffering of others every day, and consider it in every decision, yet persevere.\nAnd most definately, if you are your own best friend, or worst enemy. Or both.\n\nI almost regret deliberately telling the vast majority of humanity "DON'T buy this game", but for one; the game is about truth. For another, horribly malicious reviews don't generate sales. The game isn't cheap, but I don't suppose wisdom ever is. But IF the price keeps you on the fence, please believe that the art and music are comparable to, or even beyond, any you've encountered in any game ever before. I would listen to the music on an endless loop and be happy for a very long time. These songs won't be on the radio.\n\nTHANK YOU, Jack king-Spooner, for making this game.\n\n(As with many Steam games, offline game time is disregarded.)\n\n(4cds&w)","May 13, 2015","true","0.7"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","28","32","0","0"

It may cost more than a mass produced item, but it holds more value for those that can appreciate it.\n\nThere are a few glitches, but overall it is a great experience.\n\nDisclaimer: the game was gifted to me by another appreciative player.

It seemed a throwaway comment, but his response left me shaken. The simpleness with which I had uttered supportive comments – told people that everything will be alright and they’ll get through this – were suddenly laid bare and hollow, having been said to so many that they came almost automatically and without any real meaning behind them. How then must those actually going through these traumas feel? Being forced to listen to my fabricated condolences and pretending they mean something, when they can likely see better than anyone how forced these words are?\n\nNo doubt this is a conversation for another time, but it was during this exchange that it first hit me how attempting to review Beeswing would only find me fumbling around in the same place, trying to put words to describe my experience with it but in doing so reducing it to just another series of acclaims. “It’s beautiful/moving/a work of art/incredible.” Lines I’ve written many times in regards to many games, settling for easy, familiar descriptives to talk about games in a way that’s expected and considered perfectly adequate by the majority of those who take the time to read reviews like mine. But when we come to games like Beeswing, it doesn’t work.\n\nMy standard review practices become obsolete, because what I’m playing isn’t something that can be quickly broken down and critiqued the way we’ve grown used to thinking about games. That’s both incredibly exciting for me as someone who longs to see games as a medium grow and evolve past what we’re used to, but also disheartening because I know no matter what I say (or even because of it), there will be a vast legion of people who look at Beeswing and see nothing but pretentious indie garbage. And this is sad to me not because I feel Beeswing is above criticism, but because the conversation never makes it that far. It stops at the very idea of someone making a game that’s different from how games are typically viewed, that makes people uncomfortable or confused because this isn’t what games have ever been to them (and to some people shouldn’t attempt to be). It’s a problem other mediums have been able to move past (at least to some degree), but and yet games, or more accurately the people who often talk about them the loudest are holding fast to like a tick you can pull off.\n\nWhere then does that leave this review? Well, I’ve hardly talked about what Beeswing even is so maybe this is hardly a review at all. What I took away from Beeswing though, and what I have tried and failed to discuss in this review, is how honest it is and aware of itself in a way that a lot of games similarly branded and cast off often don’t fully achieve. It’s not trying to impress anyone or manipulate them into feeling something, it simply wishes to exist; to say and show people sides of life that aren’t easy to talk about, or that you can will people to care listen to.\n\nBeeswing isn’t sad, but it isn’t happy either. It recounts the lives of its characters (who to my knowledge are based off real people the developer knew) with a plain melancholy that is difficult to properly explain. I’m so used to media recounting horrible events, making me depressed for the sake of a narrative that’s supposed to mean something, that’s I most often find myself numb to any attempt to breach my emotional wall. But Beeswing never tried to bring me down, in fact it’s so clean in its indifference to how the player feels that it would seem cold if not for how tangible and raw the things it says and the way it shows you them are, being irrevocably connected to the actual experiences and history of the people within this tiny Scottish village.\n\nThe collages of hand drawn pictures, sculpted clay, and glitching digital art are arranged imperfectly in a way that reflects the emotions of whoever is at the center of them. It’s a constantly evolving style, but consistent in saying what lines of text could not. It’s messy, disorienting, and captivating in the pieces of myself I began to see strewn about like so many half formed thoughts and feelings I can’t describe. I wasn’t expressively trying to relate to Beeswing, but that’s also why it hit me harder than I could have expected.\n\nSaying Beeswing moved me is easy. Calling it a work of art is reductive and redundant. There isn’t a single word that can describe what Beeswing is and will mean for different people, and that’s why it’s so stunning and important. It isn’t a game that can be taken easily, or that will likely entertain, but what it is able to say about life, death, and all the messy bits in between was more profound than any number of polygons and kill streaks have ever come close to being.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 22, 2015","true","3.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hmncld/recommended/365580/","hmncld","goatt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hmncld/","914 products in account","I backed this game on Kickstarter and just got the key today and wanted to share a review.\n\nIf you have ever played a Jack King-Spooner game (Blues for Mittavinda, Sluggish Morss, Will You Ever Return...), Beeswing is more of what you'd expect.  However, this particular outing is quite a bit longer than his other games, so it has more to sink into.  Beeswing is King-Spooner's warmest and most personable game so far.  There is a lot to interact with, and it's lovely to take this game slowly, savoring everything.  If you liked any of his other games, don't hesitate to try this one.\n\nFor those who haven't played a Jack King-Spooner game, come into this expecting more of an experience than a game.  Yes, this will fit into the 'games as art' category, but it's just so damn affecting.  He does things with images and interaction that can't be done in other mediums, and gad, he creates atmosphere and weird and beautiful moments that will stick with you forever.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to see games perforate the expectations of what games can and should be.  This game is for those who look for moving experiences and interesting storytelling.  It's not for everyone,  but when it resonates, it resonates hard.","May 9, 2015","true","1.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

I have only played the game for 20 minutes and will be playing this over and over again.\nI can see the shadowing as exiting a room as being a good way to help the brain to remember from room to room.\nThe simple graphics are easy on the eyes and appear to be child friendly. Joystick support was available and makes movement easier. The only thing that wasn't working at the time of install, was the ability to take screen shots in steam.\nBut that's trivial.  But don't let my review deter you from playing this either way. After some time, I will update this as I add more game time accrues.

Definitely one of the most artistic games I've ever played, crazy to think that it isn't more popular. If you're fan of unique indie games, I strongly suggest Beeswing. If I had to describe this game as best as I could, I'd say you play as man named Jack who is revisiting his hometown nicknamed, "Beeswing". As you begin you are allowed to leave right away if you please, ending the game. It is entirely up to you to explore as much of this town and the characters in it as you please. The game will give you a list of objectives, my guess is it's telling you all the important things you can do/discover. The game itself is bizarre to say the least. At times it feels nostalgic, other times it feels spine-chilling. Probably the most admirable quality of this game is it's graphix and how it takes on all different shapes and sizes, my personal favorite being real water color pictures as the blueprint of certain areas of the game. But my favorite part of the whole game has to be the characters and there unique dialogue, leaveing you questioning your life and the world more than you might like to. Oh and the music certainly leaves it's mark, being some of the creepiest loops I've ever heard from a video game. In the end this game is just an art piece with some depressing vibes where you learn a lot of truth about how things are.\n\nP.S. This game really likes toilets.","January 21","true","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I enjoyed exploring the area and text.\n\nIt's not for everyone, there's no action (I like all kinds of games), just exploration and reading.  Definitely cerebral game, not in the puzzley sense--it just makes you think and wonder about the environment and characters that you're exploring and talkin with (or reading things about/from).  I'm still impressed that just one man created this game--story, art and music.\n\nMy roommate has never "gotten" video games, but I convinced her to give this a shot, because she likes to paint with water colors and I knew she'd enjoy the game's art, plus I thought that she'd find the story interesting. He relented to my suggesting, thinking that she'd maybe be able to give it 5 or 10 minutes tops before getting tired of it--an hour and a half later, we shut it down and she was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed it and we talked about playing again later.","January 3","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's a surprising amount of lessons to be learned and stories to be heard just by talking to people. The art style is practically the definition of gestalt: unassuming and very amateurish on its own, but taken together, it all looks gorgeous and unique. The music is hit or miss: some of it is amazing, and some of it gets a little grating. Add all of this into a playtime of 2-4 hours and you've got a great package.\n\nIf you don't like games with a slow pace or the so-called "Walking Simulator" genre, then this game isn't for you.
