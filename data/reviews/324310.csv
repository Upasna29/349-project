Hands down more accessible and stable than OSMI 2. I streamed this for about 8 hours yesterday. It only crashed once. I guess if you have a potato pc then it might seem laggy. Overall my biggest complaints are no TrackIR support and the steering was hard to get smooth with my Thrustmaster RS500. All in all it is a pretty decent cheap game. Please note that most of the negative reviews have barely ANY time playing it. Please look at playtime when checking out the reviews here on Steam.\n\nPros:\n♥ Innovative scenerios that pop up as you drive\n♥ Random conversations with the passengers\n♥ Modding ability (should bring this game to a whole new level)\n♥ Challenging conditions\n♥ No scenerio where you need to know the bus routes in Berlin in 1988 (which my wife from Germany couldnt even help me with).\n♥ Simple GPS that works better than floating signs in the sky\n\nCons:\n♡ GPS arrow should always point UP. It rotates and some of the roads get winding so it makes it hard to tell which way to turn at intersection\n♡ Lack of TrackIR meant that its hard to turn your head and see oncoming traffic. I ended up killing 4 or so people and hit about 15 cars in 8 hours.\n♡ Easy to go bankrupt if you try going too fast\n♡ Decals and stickers are not rotateable so the ads sometimes look stupid\n\nClosing thoughts\nOverall this is a fine niche game. Look kiddos, it is not every day we get a bus sim. Stop being obtuse and see the good in things why dont ya? Bah Bah Baaaahhhh.\nThat is all","March 3","true","10.9"," 170 of 196 people (87%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","87","170","196","22","10"

WAIT FOR A PATCH\n\nDue to the fact that all assets are preloaded the game is a memory hog, that is not fun if you don't have the resources to spare. What's good about is the fact that by preloading you avoid all the issues that OMSI 2 has when it comes to moving around on maps.\n\nThe Ambience sounds are well done and the fact that you can overhear the passenger talking and laughing and somewhat reacting to your driving style helps with your imersion.\n\nEngine sounds as well as sounds from the gearbox are mediocre, but they work until mods will fix it, and that bring us to the next point.\n\nThe driving physics deserve some more TLC, the bus seems too easy to handle at times and too unforgiving at others, especially when you try to drive in and out of the depot the bump of the sidewalk is significantly overdone\n\nMod support/ stem workshop support is what I believe will push the game from meh to wow.\n\nOverall I think it gets a lot right and does deserve the name Simulator as such it is of course best played with a wheel or at the very least a controller","March 2","true","18.0"," 65 of 77 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","65","77","6","4"

It allows you to drive and manage a bus on the road, plan its routes, take good care of its passengers, deal with misfortunes inside and outside of your bus, and it also allows you to macromanage your own bus company as a whole: buy buses and customize their exteriors with paints and decals, create and handle with your own routes so that you and your employees can make good use of them, make a nice profit, all a management sim could allow you to do.\n\nOf course the game has flaws! It's not too pretty visually, got some nasty bugs and a few performance issues, but considering that the developers aren't very resorceful and it's a small team working on, I couldn't expect a triple-A game. Also, they are patching up, fixing what thay can, and I expect a fair amount of remodeling so we can enjoy more of this fine piece of art.\n\nBus Simulator 16 is a bit flawed, maybe overpriced too, but I think investing in an indie team is what makes the gaming gears running.

The game released on the 2nd March 2016 for a price of £18.99.\n\nIn Bus Simulator 16, you are in charge of a bus company and must also drive around the bus collecting and dropping off people on various routes. During my hour of playing this game I had many ups and downs but the eventual ending was me stuck outside my bus and also stuck outside the depot with no way back.\n\nPositives:\n+ Good attempt at an entry level bus simulator – The game was designed to be a really good bus simulator but unfortunately falls quite short of that bar. The game feels more entry level but a good attempt at it.\n+  Steam Workshop – With steam workshop there will be mods to improve the game and adding own designs and busses.\n+ Tutorial – The tutorial is pretty good and I’m glad I did it. The amount of options and choices to the game is overbearing at times but I feel after an hour more confident  to try and drive a bus around.\n+ Multiplayer – This is a great add to the game, you can play online and manage routes together too, the only problem for me is that I lack friends with the game \n+ Cops/Police – When I was idle at the station trying to figure out buttons and such a Police car went flying past me with the lights on. I found this so cool – however it may just be normal for most people.\n\nNegatives:\n- Floaty handling – The handling is not too good on this game and most the time I end up crashing and bashing when taking corners because the handling is too light.\n- Overwhelmed – There are just so many options, buttons, choices in which you must do and then to add to the top of all that the doors get jammed and the customers expect you to give them change from money which you can’t really make out.\n- Voice acting – If you can make it through the game without laughing at the terrible voice acting I commend you. I laughed quite often due to this fact.\n- Long loading times – It may just be my PC but I experienced agonising load times and very bad FPS.\n- Price – I feel the price should be halfed for the product because although you get a lot of content the quality is subpar.\n\nUnfortunately I felt this game had a lot of potential but the execution was pretty bad. I was hoping to finally get an Omni 2 experience on Steam but unfortunately this falls well below expectations and to me feels more of an entry product. I could only recommend this game to people with low expectations or standards (huehue). I played this game only for an hour but  I was left out in Sunny Springs in the rain, trapped from my bus and depot. Although I slate the game I enjoyed it for what it was but can’t possibly recommend the game at the current price point. I’m just glad the game never crashed on me because that would’ve been the icing on the cake.\n\nScore: Wait for a sale","March 2","false","3.9"," 223 of 368 people (61%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","61","223","368","35","17"

In reality, I ended up playing the game signficantly longer than I expected to.\n\nCompared to other driving-job-simulator games, I thought the tutorial was really good at explaining all the critical components of the game. In turn, when the tutorial finishes you're equiped with everything you need to know to continue playing.\n\nOverall, the game is fun ... though, I'm not sure why... I mean, you're driving as a bus driver after all, but there is something calming about designing your routes, and driving throough german towns and cities.\n\nThe only thing I wish they would fix is:\n\n1. More music options. If you can integrate with spotify that would be amazing.\n2. Slightly better textures for some of the objects, like the interior of the bus and other vehicles on the road.\n\nI would recommend this to those that like driving-job-simulator games, or for someone who hasn't tried this genre before.","March 22","true","1.1"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","34","46","2","1"

Bus Simulator 16 is set in the town of Sunny Springs. Not only are you a bus driver, but you have to deal with a variety of events that happen around you!\n\nDriving the Bus The driving and stability of the bus is relatively easy. I'm currently using a Logitech G27 and I'm able to turn the steering wheel with no problem. However, I feel it can be quite stiff sometimes, but I'm sure this will be improved.\n\nThe Passengers The passengers are amazing. You get a variety of different talks whilst driving your bus, from calling in sick to work, talking to fellow passengers etc. Other than when I give passengers their ticket, they say 'Thank you dear'. There are also other events including asking a passenger to move so you can close the doors, helping a wheelchair user onto the bus where you may need to get out of your seat and operate it manually or press a button at the cab, turning the air con/heating up or down to the passengers' wish or even dealing with drunk passengers. Pedestrians also relatively behave probably, I do get the occasional event where a passenger walks out in front of me at a crossing and your current drive would end immediately.\nThere are also other events including fixing a jammed door, where you need to get out of your seat and manually close the door.\n\nGraphics and Textures The graphics overall are pretty good. I've been hearing reports about the textures glitching out and turning to grey, however I have not been getting this problem. A feature I do like is when it's raining and the trees blow around. Unfortunately, when it is raining, you don't get any rain effects on the windscreen which was quite a disappointment. There are wipers, but there is no point in really using these.\n\nThe AI Vehicles  The AI's behaviour in-game is very good, they will react to your indicators very well, like when you are pulling out of a bus stop, the car behind you will stop and let you out. There does seem to be a glitch where if you are sat in the cockpit, you won't be able to see the AI's lights (indicators, brake lights) but you will be able to see them from outside of the bus. This might explain to some people why they have been crashing into the back of AI cars, which I have done a couple of times.  AI will also behave probably when at traffic lights or junctions, so the developers have done a good job on coding the AI vehicles!\n\nThe FPS I get in-game The FPS I get in-game is relatively good to keep it stable. I get around 40-50FPS overall when driving around or walking about in my office/garage. I have been looking at the reviews where some people have put a thumbs down because of the poor FPS they get in-game. I seem to be one of the lucky ones where I don't get any FPS problems and can play the game with no problem. However, I'm sure for those who are getting problems that there will be a patch relatively soon.\n\nOverall Conclusion Overall, I believe Bus Simulator 16 is a great simulator and is much better than the previous bus simulator I had, which was OMSI 2, which had no end of glitches, crashes and bad in-game optimization etc. It's not every day you get a good Bus Simulator like this, probably one of the best to date. There may be a few glitches and bugs there and there, but let's be grateful that we have a good Bus Simulator!","March 4","true","7.9"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","33","46","5","3"

Games like OMSI 2 while great, are too insanely detailed for their own good, putting off someone like myself from really giving it a chance.\n\nETS2/ATS on the otherhand proved to me that you can make a accessible simulator while keeping it just deep enough to please the hardcore. I simply wanted a bus simulator that followed the ETS2 mold and Bus Simulator 2016 is a great first step at that.\n\nPROS:\n- Easy to pick up and play. It comes with a nice tutorial for first timers.\n- The city feels alive and lived in. There are a variety of passengers (including drunk and wheel chair bound patrons).\n- The added business simulation element gives you incentive to continue and improve your driving skills as it directly effects your bottom line.\n- Ability to easily create and drive routes. A simple 5 stop route to a monster 50 stop route is possible.\n- You can buy and customize your buses with decals, earn extra money by placing ads, and hire drivers to drive them.\n- Relatively stable performance. Did not crash once (unlike a certain other game).\n- Supports the Thrustmaster TX 458 Italia (by customizing the controls).\n\nCONS:\n- No TrackIR support (the mouse is used)\n- Needs more optimization\n- No real multiplayer to speak of (driving with friends).\n- The AI traffic lacks other buses. It would be nice to see your competitors as well as your own buses running the same streets as it currently feels like you are the only bus driver in town.\n- No penalty for arriving too early for your next stop. I've finished my route as early as 8 minutes without penalty. **Perhaps this is something that is unlocked later in game?","March 7","true","16.7"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","0"

You do more than just drive a bus - you also have to manage your own bus company, organise routes, deal with a variety of interesting situations (bus malfunctions, demanding passengers etc.), buy new buses, hire new drivers and so on. You get missions that help you unlock new features. You're never short of something to do.\n\nBus Simulator 16 is made by the same people who developed Bus Simulator 2012, albeit with a different partner this time. I gave Bus Simulator 2012 a negative review, but I am happy to say that Bus Simulator 16 is a vast improvement - with one exception. Bus Simulator 2012 had awful frame rates, and unfortunately, so does Bus Simulator 2016 at present. I played on medium graphic settings with a pretty powerful computer, but found the gameplay very laggy and choppy, although just bearable. But I can play games like Euro Truck Simulator 2 or Train Simulator 2016 on high settings and have no FPS issues. So this is an area that needs work. And apparently, the developers are working on it, so hopefully performance will be much better soon.\n\nSome areas where Bus Simulator 2016 has improved on BS 2012 include keyboard steering (much, MUCH better, more like Euro Truck or American Truck Simulator steering now), AI traffic (much more sensible, accidents are usually due to your bad driving rather than their stupidity) and user-friendliness of the bus interior (no more password to enter, selling tickets is now much more efficiently handled). And of course, it introduces new things that were never seen in BS 2012, like the whole company management deal, missions and so on.\n\nOther than the need for performance optimisation, I have few complaints about this game. It is definitely the best bus simulator since OMSI 2, and has real potential to give the latter a serious run for its money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crypticcat/recommended/324310/","crypticcat","Merdakah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crypticcat/","212 products in account","Bus Simulator 16 played using a Driving Force GT steeringwheel.\n\nBS16 is a surprise for me. I have little affinity with public transport if it isn't screaming along on a set of rails pulling a metric crapton of cargo-carriages. Another consideration is that I didn't think that coming to a stop at every lamppost would be fun.\n\nBut BS16 takes the concept of driving something bulky through crowded streets and makes a potentially aggrivating activity a fun and enjoyable thing to do. The driving takes place in a colorful, full featured city that's brought alive by lots of traffic and pedastrians on the sidewalks. In my hours played already, I have never been in the 'last person on earth doing a public service job' situation many simulators tend to put the player in.\n\nThe busses come in several flavors and are relatively easy to drive. There's little difference between them as they all have to same start up routine, the same transmission times, the same speeds, the same turn-radius and the same stupid ability to start driving backwards when you apply the brakes. (Errata: A setting in the options vaguely called 'drive aids' corrects that.)\n\nAs a busdriver, you transport people along a busline that's initially set, but after a short while, you can erase that baby's first busline and construct your own lines, which you can also share online for other people to drive. When other people drive your shared line, you get paid.\nYou sell tickets to people and have to give them correct change if they don't pay with ready money. Sadly, the amount of money they use to pay is not varied enough so that after a few stops you start giving people their change with your eyes closed. So, and idea that was initially fun, becomes a tedious chore due to how limited they made it.\nPassengers are interactive. A disabled person in wheelchair might need your help embarking or disembarking, an absent minded person might need to be made aware that you can't close the doors if he doesn't move further into the bus. The passengers have silly conversations that regularly make me laugh. One such an exchange really had me in stiches as a young woman rung up her mother on her cellphone to loudly exclaim that she was finally pregnant followed by 'No, I'm not at home, I'm in a bus!'.\n\nAt first, I struggled with operating my bus. I kept clipping the curb, stepped on the brakes too heavy, stepped on the brakes too lightly, steered too little or steered too much and generally was allover the place. If the game wasn't so colorful, or if the game wasn't so alive with everything that's going on, I wouldn't have stuck with it as I did. After a while, it clicked and I was doing the rounds as if I had never done anything but drive busses all of my life. As I gained skill, my enjoyment of the game grew accordingly.\n\nAs the manager of a bussing company, you can decorate your busses, get advertizement contracts, create buslines, hire and fire drivers and amass mountains of money. You advance your company's reach and reputation at a steady pace and you get a good feel of accomplishment out of it. Within the first few hours of play you're admiring your budding fleet of busses, see the map get filled by your buslines and smile as the game shows you a pop-up that someone has driven one of your shared lines which made a nice amount of cash.\n\nThe traffic AI needs a good look-over however. It's downright more stupid than a bag of hammers in a glass-factory. When they do what they're supposed to do, it's fine and it makes the city-driving all the more realistic. But they more often do the stupid and annoy you by making sure that your bottomline is wrecked by financial setbacks you can't avoid. Pedastrians aren't much better, prone to start crossing the road when you're manouvring to rounda corner. That results in a 'big accident' that immedeately ends your run. When that happens near the end of a 30minute drive, there's little reason to smile. I don't mind failing because I made a mistake. I do mind failing because the AI is as stupid as the developer tasked with developing with the AI.\n\nUsing a steeringwheel with forcefeedback and a 900degree turn is in my opinion a must. It really adds that extra like adding wheelturn resistance, which simulates that awesome 'I'm steering a huge and bulky vehicle' experience. The 900degrees wheelturn also removes the twitch-steering you get with the keyboard or a controller; making the turning more ponderous. The difference is really between night and day and heightens the immersion greatly.\n\nIf the entire package wasn't so colorful, if the streets were scarcely populated, if the management layer would've been treadbare, if the passengers were badly animated cardboard cut outs, then the things like the busses all handling the same and the AI being terminally stupid would make BS16 just another 'german simulator with nothing to live for'.\nAs it stands however, BS16 is saved by the attention to detail and many other things that really makes me feel that I'm a busdriver doing the rounds in a believable, albeit none existant, european city.\n\nThumbs up then. If the developers keep working on this title and keep bettering it, then this game could become a benchmark for city-driving simulators. It's halfway to greatness already and I wholeheartedly recommend you this title.","March 4","true","21.3"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

I played for nearly 8h and streamed it the whole time.\n\nWhile this is true the game is not optimized at all and this could make it impossible to play for some people, this game is far from the 45-50% rating it received on release. I'm glad it's back to 60% as I'm writing this review and I believe it could deserve to be a little higher like 70-75% because the game itself isn't bad. The devs just have a very hard time to optimize it and they are working on it very hard. I cross my fingers they release a fix quickly. But don't be fooled by those bad reviews. Almost none of those rate the game for what it is, they are just bad reviews of angry players not able to launch the game and not patient enough to give the devs a chance to release a fix.\n\nThis game is not OMSI 2! If you seek for an incrediblely detailed bus simulator, don't buy. This game is more arcadish. If I had to compare it to other games, I would say it's like if OMSI 2 and Cities in Motion had a baby together. You have the management part of Cities in Motion (you create bus routes, assign drivers and busses to them, make sure they are giving positive income, etc). And with that you have the driving part of OMSI 2 (you drive buses, interact with passengers, deal with traffic, etc). You can interact with buttons in cockpit view. I was surprised there was so much to interact with in fact. So while it's not OMSI 2, it's still not a lazy game where you only accelerate/decelerate/left/right and nothing else. The driving is not the most realistic one but still very fun and it works very well with G27. Just a bit hard to set it up on first time but pretty fine after some gaming time.\n\nThe multiplayer is a nice add considering lot of driving games never have one. Sadly, it's not a real multi. As you cannot see your drivers (AI) on the road, well you cannot see other players aswell in multi. It's more like if other players were replacing the AI so they are supposedly better drivers than AI but the mechanism behind is exactly the same. Very disappointed by this but I salute the effort. SCS (Euro and American Truck Simulator dev) never bothered trying to add a multi while players are hardly requesting it. StillAlive has work to do to catch on SCS but at least they tried. Let's give them a chance to improve. SCS didn't become a great truck sim developer in one day after all. ;)\n\nOnly down side of the game are the graphics. They are not stunning at all and the game is more laggy than GTA V (I run it almost at ultra while I can barely run the bus sim at  medium with a poor 20FPS). Optimization is what hurts this game right now. As I said, I cross fingers the devs fix that soon. It's really annoying to have 30-45 second loading screen on launch and I'm lucky, some players must wait 4-5 minutes!\n\nSo yes, if you are not patient to wait for a fix, don't buy or request a refund. But please, this game doesn't deserve so much bad reviews just because those devs are not experienced enough and have a little struggle optimizing their game. From a huge studio, I would have not forgiven such a mess with optimization, but for StillAlive, I'm ready to give them some time. I hope they will make good use of it.","March 5","true","40.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Like ETS 2 the world is open and explorable, and there is a managment part where you run your company. Unlike Omsi 2 the game actually looks good and runs well, though the details of each bus are nowhere near as involved.\n\nIt /is/ a simulator, you have to start the bus, use indicators, open doors, all by either clicking on items on the screen, using the keyboard or mapping them to controller buttons. While its somewhat arcadey there is a learning curve but its enjoyable discovering how the bus works and how you need to use it in the world. The developers seem to be listening and working hard to update most of the complaints they've recieved. For example the orientation of the gps map or auto turn off of indicators when you straighten out the steering wheel. The game play is smooth, I haven't quantified the framerates but it doesn't stutter or go slowly unlike Omsi 2 which is notorious for doing that even on massive high end systems.\n\nThe sound quality is high, though somewhat generic. The only complaint I have is how harsh some of the penalties are. Hit a pedestrian? Game stops and you have to start the scenario over, even if it happens as your pulling into your garage. Accidents are very costly, as are speeding fines. All well and good for sim realism I guess but annoying. Finally, the game is fairly easy to use with my G27 steering set up, though I did have to futz a little with the settings to get things nice. Again, more like ETS 2 in that and a hell of a lot better than Omsi 2.\n\nOverall I give it four and a half out of five stars.\n\nA pleasant and thoughtful game that keeps your attention and is challanging enough not to bore you easily but not so hard your wondering why the hell you wasted money on it (yes I'm looking at you Omsi).\n\nSystem specs: 4790K i7, Gigabyte 980ti G1, 16 gigs Crucial memory.","April 2","true","34.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","0"

The simulation aspect is very well done, you can turn every switch and even manually sell tickets. The excellent tutorial will introduce you easily to all aspects to the game.  While the graphics are overall not up to the standards of the aforementioned titles, the gameworld was designed with great attention to detail. A good example are the sometimes quite silly conversations of your passengers. It´s also fun to just leave the vehicle and explore the city on foot (which reminds me a lot of Vienna, for some reason). Also a big positive is the quite fleshed out management part, where you can plan new routes, customize vehicles and hire drivers. I´m looking forward to what the mod-community is going to deliver, this game really has potential.\n\nIf you´re into simulation games and don´t insist on the latest flashy high-end graphics, I would definitely recommend this.\nPerformance issues have also been solved for me with the latest patch, everything is running smooth.","March 4","true","6.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

What gets me excited about playing this game are the little things that do a lot to the immersion: Passengers running late, waiving at you in hopes you won't take off without them; traffic that doesn't constantly crash into you or each other but yield when you indicate that you are about to set off; jammed doors or passengers blocking doors from closing; handicapped passengers in need of a ramp; events like dynamic construction sites or an ambulance with wailing sirens, etc..\n\nFurther, Bus Simulator 16 gives you incentives to drive safely as you gain more reputation with your passengers when you do not drive like a maniac. You can if you want to, but it will hurt the rate of your progression (and your economy):\n\nLike Euro Truck Simulator 2, Bus Simulator 16 additionally has a management simulation mechanic which lets you buy new busses, hire drivers to generate additional revenue, customize your vehicles and even create all the routes on your own. These things (including new districts) are unlocked step by step as your reputation grows.\n\nIf you have played other public transportation simulators before then you quickly learn the controls. The tutorial is also a good addition in explaining all the important elements. Handling and getting the bus to move is easier in Bus Simulator 16 than for example OMSI 2. Therefore, hardcore OMSI fans might get a little dissatisfied as mastering your vehicle is way simpler.\n\nThe five available districs are rich in variety and the city is actually bigger than it seems when looking at the map. Unfortunately, the tool for creating routes does not give you any degree of freedom when it comes to choosing which road you want to use, resulting in odd and annoying routing in some cases.\nFurther, and despite Bus Simulator 16 being neatly polished for a simulation game, it is quite heavy on performance. So if you do not have a very 'potent' computer you might get really poor framerates.\n\nNonetheless, this game got me motivated and hooked right from the start. I hope for additional features for the route creation tool and performance improvements but apart from that I consider my 25 bucks well spent.","March 3","true","18.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

The first impressions are nice. You take over the bus company from a old man who is gonna retire. Up to you to build out the company and keep it healthy while you drive around in busses yourself as well.\n\nI really like how they put in little details with the passengers. In other bus simulators they are rather static and only react to certain things when you mess up. In Bus Simulator 16 your passengers talk with others so you can hear the conversations at times, they play around with their phone, checking for messages or playing games on it. But not for the whole ride, its not a animation that keeps playing till they leave the bus.\nPedestrians also feel more alive, when they cross a street and a car is getting close they start to run.\nEmergency vehicles now also make their way trough the traffic, passing by when someone is standing still. A huge improvement over the others where they tend to stay behind cars and waiting in line till its their turn. They also drive trough the red light so you have make sure you let them go first when you hear the sirens.\nAnother great thing are random events like maintenance to the road that makes you have to take a detour, problems with the bus you need to fix and you even get passengers in wheelchairs that you actually have to help with the ramp depending on what bus you are controlling. Don't forget this cause me and others already didn't notice them and drove off just to get the message i forgot a passenger.\n\nThere are also some minor things. If you are a die hard simmer then this game might be a bit to arcady for you. Unlike it's competition you don't need to remember a lot of buttons and manage all aspects of the bus to make sure the temperature and such is good enough.\nThis makes it easyer for beginners to get into or those who like driving a bus but find the competition to hard, but for those who are looking for the next big bus simulator this might be a disapointment.\nThere are also some optimization issues going on, when you read the negative reviews you will see a few of them. I personally haven't had the game crash on me once, nor having any bug showing up ingame. Though the game could use some optimzation, i first thought it was my pc but reading the negative reviews it is the game appearantly. Though i lower my range of view and that helped alot with the fps drops.\nThere are also long loading screens, however once it loaded the city it has loaded everything so when you unlocked the city you can drive around without any issues.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer aspect though that means you can get a friend drive routes for your company and earn money for your company. Sadly you can't see them driving around in the same world. I hope they will add this cause that would be great.\n\nThe good:\n\n+ Create your own routes\n+ Passengers feel more alive then before\n+ Nice details in behavior from emergency vehicles, pedestrians and passengers\n+ Random events\n\nThe minor:\n\n- Perhaps to arcady for the die hard simmers\n- Could use a bit more optimization (though it isn't to bad)\n- No other players in your world when playing the multiplayer\n\nA quick look at Bus Simulator 16:\n\nQuick look at Bus Simulator 16","March 2","true","8.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

It's quite a good bus driving simulator (better than most) however it doesn't live up to OMSI 2. That doesn't mean it's not a bad game. I actually prefer this to OMSI because of the simple fact that the UI is easier to use, but there's also lots of problems which ruin the game.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to naviagate UI.\n- Easy to play.\n- Customisable buses.\n- The ability to stand up and walk around.\n- The city feels alive.\n- Events such as people standing in the way of doors, doors getting stuck etc.\n\nCons:\n- Bugs. I found a bug where I stopped at a bus stop, was told I didn't need to stop there, drove away from the bus stop and was told that i had skipped a bus stop.\n- Fines are too high. It's almost impossible to make money because you'll likely keep crashing.\n- Driving feels sluggish/stiff.\n- (I'm not sure if this changes after progressing through the game) At the beginning of the game, you're unable to do certain routes because "roads are closed due to events that will/have happened". It gets annoying and means you have to drive unnecessary distances to reach bus stops in your route or it will add more stops to it which you likely won't want.\n- The graphics.\n- Optimisation.\n\nI'd rate it 6/10.

TEST TEST!!!1111!\n\nNow, where was i? Ah yes, Bus Simulator 16; never played the other 15 though.\n\nALERT: STORY SPOILER AHEAD!\n\nThe Game starts off with a nice little Tutorial; A guy named Ben (bad choice DEVs -> made me think of Spider Man -> instant cry), who sold you his Bus Company to retire and spend more Time with his old Lady (a Bus i guess), greets you and together you take a small tour through the City of...yeah, through the City.\n\nThe Immersion instantly kicks in, a nice Cockpit to call your own, Buttons to push, Engines to start, Doors to open (for a summerly Experience, let the Front Door open) and so on.\n\nMinutes later you will have your first Passengers; They seem like a nice Bunch although female Students are dressed like hookers, dunno why.  Havent encountered any Pimps yet.\n\nIts impossible to rip-off your Passengers throughout the Ticket-buyin-Process; which saddens me a lot.\n\nApproaching a Station is pretty easy, you just need to "kneel" before your Passengers, open the Doors, engage the Breaks, and the same in Reverse if you leave the Station. The "Action" Cam helps a lot here (awesome Feature btw, made me feel like Don Johnson in Miami Vice *deal with it*)\n\nAfter 5 or 6 Stops and returning to your Garage the Tutorial ends, and the real Fun begins:\n\nYou have to plan Routes, drive them and fulfill different Objectives to progress through the Game.\n\nA little later you´re able to hire Drivers (pretty random at their Personality; even had a PhD Dude who wanted to become a Bus Driver, lol)\n\nThere are quite a few Options there for Customizing your Bus: Decals, ADS, Colours;\nSadly no Options for the Interior (would love some tiger carpets or Dragon Skulls in my Bus).\n\nGraphics-wise i must say: 30 FPS never felt so fast (caution: irony!)\nThe Details are OK, like in every Simulator-Game i´ve played by now. Not bad, not very good, somethin in between; The\nBusses look very nice though;\n\nWhat i really missed is a Season Pass and the  Opportunity to kidnap all your Passengers (or at least be a Getaway Driver -> maybe some cross-over with the Payday Universe?!). Maybe i am fortunate and Still Alive Studios are going to release a DLC?!\n\n\nAll in all i enjoy riding my Bus (i look so manly in the rear-mirror doing so) throughout an unknown City, goin on a Rampage here and then, not stopping at Stations (we can't stop here this is bat country)  and after starting a new Company (the third by now) i can say:  Thankfully the Citizens do not recognize People very well!","March 7","true","2.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","8","11","5","0"

Graphics are pretty clean, city is quite large (I drove around a good portion of the city just to check it out), and it is quite enjoyable.\n\nAt first I had an error trying to run the game, but that was because it was attempting to use my Intel Graphics rather than my NVIDIA Graphics, couple of quick fixes and it was all set.

This will be quite long so if you dont want to read heres everything summed up in less detail: Great game, Some bugs, Alot of potention, 7.5/10 over all. Now for the long ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI've been playing this game for 10 hours and I've fallen in love with it so far. It hasn't crashed for me and I've had no problems but this won't run well on a potato pc. Sadly theres no track ir support and keyboard controlls are a bit dodgy from my experience but are great on my steering wheel. You start off with a single bus and a single district and you need to drive and plan routes until you recive another bus and then you can hire a driver, Eventually, you'll earn enough money to buy a driver and you won't have to do all the work yourself earing you money every time you do a route yourself. When you unlock all buses and districts then it might become a bit boring (I haven't reached that level yet so i won't talk about it alot.) but there might be some challenges or something or you can try multiplayer. Theres some random events expanding from upset passengers, stuck doors, drunk passengers and extending the ramp for wheel chair passengers. Heres are some things i like and think are good and bad for the game.\nPros:\n+A nice looking, freely accessible city with 5 realistic districts\n+Workshop support\n+Various challenges (Rush hour, Construction etc.)\n+Random conversations with the passengers\n+Simple GPS\n+Driving the bus feels realistic\nCons:\n-No TrackIR\n-Easy to go bankrupt.\n-Ads & Decals sometimes look a bit stupid on the buses.\n-Some bugs.\n","March 10","true","10.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","10","15","4","0"

I heard a fake sick  call to work... gave me an idea.\nCons: long loading from start up until you're IN the game out of tutorial. Graphics could be polished, P.O.V mouse movement could range more not a glance left n right.

I say yes get it---  ONLY if you have a very high end computer - I have a $3000 Alienware system it it stuggled it keep up with the framerate -- i had to turn down the settings to lowest to get  somewhat ok gametime but I feel its overpriced for me personally considering the really bad graphics I have to put up with to play it at a basic level ..  dont waste your time if you have a limited hardware system\nI can run GTA V on Ultra but cant run a square bus around a ten block city -- mmmmm go figure\nIf you have the specs required -- Play it -- its one of the better featured bus sims out on the market for the price\n\nFROM MrTP  :\nFrom my experience you can increase your performance very much by:\n\n1. Making sure that steam uses the correct graphic card to run BS16 (please see here: http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/72567/can-i-force-steam-to-use-my-nvidia-gpu-instead-of-the-integrated-intel-card/72576#72576)\n\n2.

High graphic settings are laggish for me now, I have to play on medium with anti-aliasing and it runs well.\n- no button for centering the camera view, it would come in handy when using a steering wheel\n- some people have reported that keyboard & mouse controls are not that great (but I am using a steering wheel anyway)\n\nSome surprising positive moments from the game:\n1. I created a new route and was driving it. I missed a turn and didn't notice that for a minute, heard passengers saying something like "- Are you sure we are on the right bus? - Yes, I checked the map, it is the shortest route". Then I looked at the map and realized I took the wrong turn and GPS was showing me that I should make a very long detour I couldn't do in time anyway. So I turned around in a nearest convenient place (they should have fined me for that though), but I made it in time to the next bus stop.\n2. Invalid passengers, when they ask for help, you have to get out of the bus and pull the ramp for them to get into the bus.\n3. An ambulance drove the street on my lane, I had to turn a little more to the right to give way. I haven't seen this kind of thing in other games.\n\nI wish accidents were more realistic, not just fining the player, but with all serious consequences like in the real world.\nI am still not sure if creating custom city maps is possible with the current modding tools. Only customizing the existing one is allowed, afaik.\nI have a feeling this game should have been delayed a little bit more. In perspective, this game can make the best bus simulator once all performance / stability problems are fixed.

Im running a gtx 970 8gb ram with an i5 4690k and even after the patch im still suffering a bit on the frame rate, but its playable. a bit choppy in places. Graphically the game looks dated. Lighting isn't dynamic, indicater lights flash inside the bus also no cars indicate, water effect for rain poor, no droplets on windscreen so wipers seem pointless. car models are quite bland. bus models are nice. Something i noticed and was impressed with was during a rainy run i noticed the tress were blowing visiously in the wind i like that.\n\nControls, I have only used my g27 and keyboard and they work lovely i love the stiffness on the wheel makes you feel like your working for it the UI in the bus is simple, so your not sitting there for 20 mins trying to work out your route codes passwords and how to switch the bugger on. Sound is quiet frankly rubbish. But the game is fun. The management side of things is much better then euro truck and it really seems this game has a good baseline to improve upon. Its moddable with steams workshop so in no time we will probably be seeing mods that will probably help improve or just expand upon a nice cheap fun game.\n\nI love the passengers, listening to the liers who are calling up work or their trainers telling them they are sick, wheel chair users and many easter eggs about people playing indie game titles and bus simulator 16 being recommended to someone for there kid. its great.\n\nCustomisation, paint jobs, nice selection of colours designs and advertisements which help you earn extra money. Thats a great little touch, hoping the modders bring in real company logos.\n\nall in all this game is fun, cheap and time just drives by.","March 4","true","6.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

First you don’t expect very much from it, because it is a simulator where you basically drive around with a bus. But after the tutorial and some exploring, it offers a lot of impressing features. The best one is how good  they implemented the driving experience of the bus, it feels like you’re driving a real one. The only issue is that it also brakes like a real one and so I bumped in one and another car. The Interaction with the passengers is also made very nice and detailed, beginning from making a ticket, to say to somebody that he should get away from the door or to help a wheelchair drive in and out of the bus.\n\nThe game is not only about driving the bus, you need also to manage your company and to start new routes. Therefore I’m very impressed from the game and the features that it offers.","March 2","true","7.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

I have driven all the simulation games on the market and this is quite good in a lot of respects but there is one really annoying aspect of this game which has had me SO frustrated.  That is THE TRAFFIC.  It's rubbish, slow, thick, annoying and generally bores tha pants off me.  You spend more time crawling along the road behind them or you are stuck at never changing traffic light where nothing is moving.  It doesn't make you late but sitting looking at a computer game that is doing NOTHING is annoying.  If they don't  change the traffic signals and traffic movement it will bore me off the game.\nWould I recomend it - YES if you like sitting around doing nothing and NO - if you want to drive.","March 4","true","100.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

That's all i need to play for now\n\nI am a bus driver in real life. I drive in service busses in and out of towns and cities for a living.\n\n\n\nThis game is. eh at best. I don't dislike it. Personally i prefer it to OMSI 2 as there's a bit more to it in way of playing it. I like running my own company and i like buying busses and setting them/drivers to routes. I found myself acting in the game as i do on service. I count out change to passangers where required. I find myself checking tailswing and nearside kerb when it comes to mounting. I found myself shouting obsinities at a van driver who stopped for no reason in frount of me then complaining to myself (with hand movements) as to why he was a ♥♥♥♥♥ driver.\n\nThis brings me onto one of my bigger problems with the game\n\nThe AI is crap. Like. Really crap\n\nPedestrians are so stupid. They stand in frount of you. Then walk out when your clearly coming. They sit on the kerb and wait for your nearside to hit them because a van decided to charge head on despite you being in his land to negotiate the corner. They glitch out when trying to get on the bus, spinning around on the spot before becoming stuck. And when they are stuck, you drive off and hit them ending your session. I (admittibly) ragequit just now on a long route because a pedestrian decided to try and cross the road whilst i was already half way around the corner. and got hit by the back of my bus. It's very frustrating because that was a long ♥♥♥ route all down the drain.\n\nThis is not to say the game is entirly bad. It's simple to pick up and all the buttons are actually labled as to what they do. Athough take note. We don't kneel at every stop. And the distances it deems "perfect" are actually pretty damn far away. Like a foot or so away from the kerb? no thanks. However i take into effect that this is a simulation on the same way ETS2 is. It's fun and easy to pick up, but not super serious dealthy death.\n\ntiming don't work like this on busses. but again it's a simple system that's easy for newer people who know less about busses pick stuff up. Also no one in any kind of mangement system for a bus company will ever disipline you for being late. Leaving early yes, being late? No.\n\nI do wish we had a larger selection of busses. 6 MAN busses are okay, but i want to see DAF's, Optares, Volvo's, Alexendra Dennis ect. Hell i want to drive a Solo. Because i am as mad as a fish. So i hope this can be extended on and more busses can be added.\n\n\nI have never seen a bus company that pays people more based on how experienced they are. at least the one i work for pays you based on how long you worked for the company.\n\n\nAll in all this isnt a bad game. It aint a brilliant game, wouldn't be worth £40. but for £18 if you fancy it, its worth a punt.","March 9","true","3.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","5","8","3","0"

It is actually really good work and makes a lot of fun and it bounded me 11 hours on the pc so far, and I will play it again in the weekend.\nWhat I really like is, that the feeling of steering the bus is really good. You must pay attention to get the junction right and not to bump into other cars or traffic lights/ signals. Also the physical effects are really good implemented. By slowing down or acceleration you can actually feel the big weight of the bus.\nThere are a lot of funny things hidden in the game, which is really amusing. For example you can hire Julian (head of company) as the bus driver witch has a very amusing CV. Or the passangers are talking about Son of Nor. Many such small things where you can see the love in the detail.\nGood work guys!

If it was released as an Early Access title I'd be more inclined to give it the benefit of doubt.\nIt runs poorly on an i7 2600K@4.3Ghz + GTX970, it uses only 1 CPU thread (and even that only at 50 to 70%) and the GPU usage sits at 40~50%. With the lowest possible settings I'm only getting around 40 to 50fps at 1080p, but with those settings the viewdistance is so small that it looks like you're driving through fog. High settings net me around 27-33 fps and maxed out is completely unplayable due the low fps and stutter.\n\nI can see this becoming a good game with a performance fix, gameplay changes and a lot of polish, but as it stands it's not worth €25 and it definitely shouldn't be a full release.\n\nUpdate: I've tried the new update, there is a performance improvement, I went from ~30 fps on High to ~35 fps now, still abysmal performance (even worse if you factor in how the game looks). There's also noticeable stutter that becomes pretty annoying.\nUpdate 2: Have tried the new performance improving patch, now the average for high settings is around 37 fps, which is still far from acceptable. Not to mention all of this should have been done before the game was released.\nWhen I'm going to get 60fps on high settings I'm going to change my review, until then it's still not recommended.\n\nAdding an image so you can see how the game looks on the lowest of settings: http://i.imgur.com/f9Eodlm.jpg\nOnly getting 50 fps with those kinds of settings (Update 2: after this update I'm getting about 60-70 fps on the lowest settings).","March 3","false","2.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","7"

I also like the visualization of the game, e.g. the ticket-selling procedure feels right - you have to print the right ticket and give back the right change to the customers. The wohle meta-game with managing your own bus company adds depth and engages you to keep playing. By now I am a quite decent bus driver, but sometimes I do too hard brakes on the bus stops ;) Btw. how can I kneel the bus?","March 10","true","7.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

Believe the reccommended specs and don't bother if you don't meet them.\nThis one is miles better than it's predessor and the goals list for the company keep the game interesting. I also love the ability to make your own routes. Lots of vehicles, reasonable budget vs. economy, although the one run = one week's income is a little wierd, but I suppose necessary or the progression would take forever.\nMy only real gripe is the steering, either with mouse/keyboard or Xbox controller. It has a real learning curve and after 5 hours it has become comfortable, although moving out to 3rd person view to negotiate some of those tight corners is almost a must. Astragon has never done a very good job at first-person driving and I would love to see a Euro-truck level of  expertise in the driving mechanics. Otherwise, this game is great, and I would reccommend it.","March 4","true","34.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

On well so much for that.\n\nLets talk about controls, using a wheel and pedals pressing brake twice engages reverse.  The steering starts turning very slow then gets much quicker about halfway through the turn.  Also why get me to define gear up and down in the settings if they dont work???\n\nIf it rains, both the rain and wipers seem like they're working in slow motion whilst everything else is moving at normal speed.\n\nYou press the key to look at either side mirror, it slowly changes to that side and slowly back.  If you look with the mouse, you have to move back withthe mouse also, not good when driving.  Especially as the AI is worse than the AI in ETS2 and ATS.\n\nThe 'route planner' is a falicy, you cant plan the route, you click on the desired stops and it gives you the roads you have to travel.  So instead  of a single outer road to follow, you'll have a series of turns and lights that take longer to get there.\n\nIt isn't all bad though, the idea of the route planner is a good start, maybe have the switching of views to be instant if desired.  Let players unbind dual controls or assign a single control eg brakes for braking only.\n\nI can't in all fairness recommend this game as thers too much enjoyment killing issues.  I will however keep this in my watch list just in case it gets better.\n\nMaybe I've been spoilt by ETS2 and ATS.

The games UI feels fresh and modern and is pretty easily navigated. I like that you can make your own bus routes and assign drivers to drive them.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the games falls flat in one of the most important mechanics, the driving part.\nThe handling feels very loose and the bus veers all over the place, and I'm playing on a controller with the sensitivity on its minimum setting. It doesn't feel like you are steering a 14-ton bus when it jerks at the smallest input on the joystick.\n\nAs mentioned by other players, the voice acting is not very good. At all. And before reaching my first hour of playtime i was already hearing the same chatter from the people in my bus as i was hearing in the beginning, it seems that they haven't recorded that many lines for people to say.\n\nThe game has a couple of pretty interesting mechanics though. The doors on the bus can jam and you will be forced to close them manually, emergency vehicles can rush up behind you with their sirens on wanting you to move over, there's dynamical construction sites and more stuff.\n\nBut ultimately, for me, the game has potential but i cannot recommend it in its current state. The steering is too off and the game has some obvious optimization issues. I'm considering refunding it and maybe coming back if it's patched.","March 2","false","1.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","3"

I had previously seen some other simulators around friends houses and not really been overly interested, but this caught my eye.\n\nOnce having downloaded it, I jumped straight in. I was pleasently suprised by it's innovative way of teaching the user how to drive the bus and how it kind of ran you into the first steps, without just dropping you in with an automated start.\n\nThe game overall plays well. The content of the NPC's vocabularly seems to lack sometimes - which makes for a tiny bit of disconnection from the game itself, but overall I really enjoyed being able to found my own company, learn how to drive the bus/coach and even more, which I found fantastically fun, make money from picking up those customers.\n\nRemember, it's not all about just making sure you don't crash the damned thing, it's more about satisfying those customers to get a decent return on your company. Attempting to put all of those together takes time and practice, and you can have a lot of fun on that journey!\n\nIf you are a SIMULATOR fan, I would suggest this one!","March 15","true","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

However StillAlive have already patched the game which has improved the performance issues. So, with this in mind, after watching Squirrel's Lets Play videos on YouTube I decided to purchase a copy.\nVery easy to get the hang of, much easier than OMSI. I have OMSI too. BS16 is more sophisticated than arcade type driving games but not as "simulatorish" as OMSI.\nCreating Bus routes and customising your company buses is also great fun.\nI find the Customer interactions very enjoyable. Walking on and off the bus and walking around the cabin of the bus is also a very enjoyable experience. The most "realistic" passengers I have encountered in this type of game too. Far better than OMSI of Train Simulator for example.\nAll in all this is a very enjoyable game, I hope StillAlive Studios release further expansions in the form of city maps and of course buses. (we already have a new bus in the form of MAN Lios City A47M!!) and at a very affordable price! £1.59!!\n\nIf you have any doubts about buying this, watch Squirrels Lets Play.

However StillAlive have already patched the game which has improved the performance issues. So, with this in mind, after watching Squirrel's Lets Play videos on YouTube I decided to purchase a copy.\nVery easy to get the hang of, much easier than OMSI. I have OMSI too. BS16 is more sophisticated than arcade type driving games but not as "simulatorish" as OMSI.\nCreating Bus routes and customising your company buses is also great fun.\nI find the Customer interactions very enjoyable. Walking on and off the bus and walking around the cabin of the bus is also a very enjoyable experience. The most "realistic" passengers I have encountered in this type of game too. Far better than OMSI of Train Simulator for example.\nAll in all this is a very enjoyable game, I hope StillAlive Studios release further expansions in the form of city maps and of course buses. (we already have a new bus in the form of MAN Lios City A47M!!) and at a very affordable price! £1.59!!\n\nIf you have any doubts about buying this, watch Squirrels Lets Play. He gives a very good overview of the game.","April 16","true","27.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The update has made it run smoother. You will find your self spending many hours on your company and with your bus designs.  The Man buses are good and the others are okay. However they could increase the amount of buses that are in the game like more Man's , Mercedes or Scania buses would be nice. Or a rival bus company in the game so that we can work to be better than them. A more involed mulitplayer would be good too.

(Without great fails though.)\n\nSome additional information:\n\n- I found I drive better with keyboard than with steering wheel.\n\n- Some people report 3-4 FPS. They have Intel HD graphics. Game should not be run with that graphics solution at all.\n\n- Some people report 30 FPS on lowest settings, while having 60-70 FPS on best settings in other games. Raise settings from lowest at least to average and you still will have 30 FPS but better experience. It is not graphics what is putting heavy load on your system it is game engine what cause that number of FPS.\n\nRecommendation:\n\n- Don't buy if you have non-top laptop.\n- Buy if you have steering wheel. (Not many games are utilizing that device good.)\n- Buy for kid. (Affordable price and good ethics in game.)\n- Buy for yourself if you have an hour or two after work and middle to top desktop. (Can be used in pair with weaker laptop with in-home streaming feature).\n\nWith my kind regards,\nfinomondo","June 2","true","18.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've been looking for another sim based driving game to go along with my steering wheel since ATS and ETS2 currently aren't matching my requirements as far as ATS not releasing their game patch for months and ETS not on the mutiplayer scene as much anymore.\n\nBus Sim 16 is probably great if you use mouse and keyboard. Took mutiple attempts to try to get it to see my G29 and register it in. Too many controls for the bus that make it impossible to run the G29 solo without a keyboard and mouse. Game wouldnt allow me to use my L3 and R3 buttons for blinkers or anything else, kept forcing the map icon to appear. Also the feedback and control over this game is terrible. My bus would go about 30 and if I barely moved my steering to the right it would hard feedback (past autocentering) to the left and then again back to the right. If I let go my steering wheel would just bounce back and forth and my bus would be out of control.\n\nGreat game concept, glad to see they fixed the dashboard looks from what the youtube video posted but game developers ( I thought ) that deal with driving sims should understand that people are going to want to play the game SOLOY with their wheels and their limited amount of buttons. "Driving" the character to the bus was fun but no interaction allowance to open the door and be able to sit down.\n\nAll in all great concept, half way decent graphics, but I have only requested 1 additional refund to this game and that was  Xcom2.\n\n2 Requests for refunds over how ever many years Steam has been alive.","March 2","false","0.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"

Well I like these small events now and then it make the game interesting.\nOne other things that make the game interesting is the ability to exit your seat and walk arround in the world and solve small problems. For example a drunk guy enters the bus so you have to get up and ask him to leave.\nAnd one in a while you also have to help handicapped people in/out of the bus by exit the bus and extending the ramp ;-)\n\nThe all new "run a bus business" feature is nice, and you can even compare how well you are doing to other players though some have kind of unrealistic billion usd scores.\nAnyway you can also invite your friends to come and drive a trip in your bus and follow one of your routes that you create and it is kind of nice i think.\nIt is also possible to paint your car and stick commercials on it to earn a little more, though It not really where that important to me.\n\nWell the bus driving experience is kind of okay. The feeling of sitting in the seat and driving I would say is realistic and the bus feel big ect. And you can also press various keys and sell tickets ect.\nThe bus is also well made and in general give a good impression.\n\nHowever the controls of the game are not that facinating.\nFirst of all the game do not yet support Trackir ( the dev. wrote on the forum that they consider implementing it ).\nSo many people are now forced to use the mouse to look arround or setup X and Y key on their wheel to look left and right. No matter what it is not the same as trackir and free look with the mouse. ALso I really miss the ability to look 90 degrees left and right in the bus since it is hard to see the trafic when at a T crossing and only can look 75-80 degrees left and right.\n\nWell all in all I think price level is good fair price for the product. The game is not bad, and have many nice features ( like you can hear small talk in the bus, such as boss i cant go to work today ).\nAlso the get in and get out of the bus by passengers work pretty good, and you often fill your bus pretty good with passengers.\nI also like that sometimes there are events such as holliday where there are tons of passengers waiting for a ride.\n\nThe game it self work in such a way you unlock features by driving from a-b.. in about 3 hour of gameplay I am level 10-11 and have unlocked the biggest bus in the game and half of the map.\nTo unlock more I need to play the game and get xp, but I can also solve some goals ( such as having 2 bus stops in each unlocked zone ect ).\n\nAll in all not a bad game but it do feel a bit like an arcade bus simulator, so I really prefer the older game named "Bus and cablecar simulator" since the busses are a little more realistisc, and the game experience is just a bit more fun and realistic.","March 3","false","2.9"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","10","24","2","1"

This however has to be set in the lowest possible setting allowed which makes the already terrible graphics pretty damned awful and there is no excuse in this day of age.\n\nThat being said, as per the pro, it's pretty addictive and I havent found any bugs but definitely not worth more than £4.99 on the next Steam sale due to that lazy game engine and terrible optimisation or blatant lack of.\n\nSome negative reviews state that the handling is very floaty...........it's a ducking bus simulator ffs! Of course the b*stard is going to be floaty, it's not need for speed......the title kinda gives it away with the key word before simulator: 'Bus!'\nIn my opinion, the handling is actually very Bus like from what I see in my town. Just use a wide swing angle for tight corners and bobs your bus driving bus bus.\n\nDefinitely a thumbs up from me, but I thumb up anything over 5/10.\n\nGraphics "optimisation": 0/10\nBusiness model: 7/10\nThe actual driving and hilarious AI conversations at times: 9/10\nPrice for it in this state: 2/10 (£18.99)\nRecommended price: £4.99 Max\n\nBusssss!\n\nAddition following a PM:\nMy rig: AMD 8 core @ 4 ghz (Equiv to low end I7). RAM: 8gb on 64 BIT W7 Pro (This game eats RAM like a starving animal for no reason). Graphics: AMD HD 7890 4gb RAM.\nRuns GTAV and ARMA3 in max settings, so this game has no excuse. Only reason I am keeping thumbs up is due to the fun business model and I will continue playing, but I think a majority of the 'sparkling' reviews on here are heavily influenced by friends of the devs if not the devs themselves!\n\nPeople!

But this all what I can say positive about it.\n\nGraphic wise the game looks more cell-shaded then realistic but I won't talk about the graphics because in the end this is a matter of taste and choise.\n\nThe negative part, which pretty much is un-avoidable is the "laggy gameplay" . I dont have a super performant PC, a little bit more then average and the only way I can play this game decently is on "lowest graphic" plus a few added cars and pedestrians.  Other way the game is un-playable.\n\nI am not a game programmer, but i worked with some Home Design 3D Software and whenever I added decorations and furniture inside a house I designed, the lag started to appear more noticible. I have looked the graphics in ETS2 and ATS and then I realized the difference.\n\nSo, my opinion for why this game is so laggy is the fact that everything is designed in 3D and nothing in 2D, not even the distant objects so the PC needs to do alot of work "loading things you will never see".\nIn ETS2, even the buildings in the cities are designed as simple cube structures plus a photo/painted added skin on the surfaces for giviing the cube a 3D feel. So they are not 3D models, but 3D cubic structures with skins wich are easier and faster to load.\n\nFrom this major design difference comes the "laggy environment" in Bus Simulator 16 compared to the other simulators people compare it with.\n\nI recomend this game only if you have enough patience to wait for the loading and you are enough calm to bear with all the laggs. If you are "i want it now" type of person, it is better to avoid this game. it will get you frustrated like nothing else.\n\nEDIT 1st may 2016\nTher game is still laggy even after the new update. It is more a lagging simulator than a bus simulator. One more update and if it is not improved even a little, I will un-recomend this game anymore. This game seems to be done by students for pasing the exam in programming and not by professionals.","April 2","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
