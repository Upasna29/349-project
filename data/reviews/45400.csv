"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/45400/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Fortix is a cracking little casual indie game thats furiously fast and ferociously fun to play.  The basic premise is something akin to 'Join the Dots' meets basic geometry.  You take control of an intrepid knight that must be manoeuvred around and across various maps in order to capture the enemy castle.  The action is displayed in birds-eye view.\n\nThe knight must be moved out from a safezone which starts on the outer border of the map.  While in the safezone the knight is immune to any deadly enemy attacks.  Rectangles must be drawn from one part of the safezone to another to cut down the enemys control of the land (map).  This must be done with all manner of obstacles ready to kill the knight, while being up against the clock.\n\nOf course the further into the map the safezone encroaches the less space the knight has to avoid deadly obstacles.  These include: two types of cannon ball firing towers and, a multitude of dragons that swoop down or shoot fireballs in an attempt to kill your knight.  These must be avoided by ensuring that your knight is in the safezone when hit and not in the midst of drawning a rectangle.  If the knight is hit while drawning a polygon then a life is lost.  If this isnt enough of a challenge note that the map must be conquered against the clock.\n\nFear not for the knight has a few actions they can perform to help you win.  They can 'capture' triggers to destroy enemy towers, or trap dragons in a part of the safezone killing them instantly.  Special tokens can also be 'captured' that provide a number of neat abilities such as: temporary invincibility, stopping cannonballs, killing dragons, receiveing an extra life or stopping time.  To capture a trigger or token a polygon must be drawn around the item on the map.\n\nThere is one campaign which covers twelve maps.  It can be replayed through four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard and Impossible.  Difficulty affects time available, starting lives, the reaction speed amongst others.\n\nWith rudimentary controls the game is easy to pick-up.  While graphics are basic they are well rendered and provide a more than fitting medieval ambience that goes perfectly with the incredibly catchy music played in the background.  No bugs were encountered during twelve plus hours of play.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed playing and beating this game. It has that 'just one more go' addictive quality, which kept me playing.  Easily worth the money.","November 11, 2014","true","12.8"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

The basic idea is very simple: capture enemy territory by moving your one character along a "baseline", where you are safe from attacks, and cutting off pieces of the territory by leaving the safe baseline. While you're out in the open, you're prone to attacks from cannonballs and dragons, so it's crucial to get a good timing, and even apply some basic strategy here and there.\n\nThere isn't much more to it, really, so the game is quite easy to master, but the intricacies of some of the later levels ask for some quick reactions while moving into the open. There is something addictive in trying to finish every level and outwit the dragons; and there are some nice steam-achievement and even trading cards on offer. So if you can pick this one up at a low price: just spend the money, but don't expect a great game in return, just a quick but tasty snack.\n\nGameplay: 20/30\nGraphics: 12/20 (basic really, but still with some atmosphere)\nSound: 5/10\nLongeliveity: 10/20\nStability/techical: 15/20 (I had a couple of sudden minimalizes, but the game just continued in the background so no big deal).\n\nOverall: 62/100","July 15, 2014","true","3.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

The game takes QIX mechanics and pits you against dragons and to win each level you have to capture the forts on the map. You can win by default by claiming enough of the map regardless.\n\nThe music isn't bad and doesn't get old too quickly, at least if you're not totally bad at it. Simple graphics are all this game needs and it does it well.\n\nIn terms of the Achievements, most of them are pretty standard things to get and won't make you work too hard. You'll get a lot of them just from playing and beating the game. Only three Achievements require any sort of skill. One of them is downright hard, but as I started playing yesterday and finally managed to get it, not too bad.\n\nIt's a good game to pick up and put down, however it may drag you in for an extended stay when you get so frustrated that the level is so easy and you made a silly mistake.\n\nThere are two control options for this game, mouse (casual) or keyboard (hard, but better for mastery.)\nOptions are pretty limited but there's not much to need.\n\nOne minor annoying thing I found, was no way to kill my profile and start over if I'd lost too many lives. You're stuck with whatever you've done unless you change difficulties.\n\nHowever, for what it is, it's a great fun time. Technically it could have a lot of replayabliity, if you really enjoy this style of game.\n\nI'd get it on sale or in a bundle. But regardless, it's good fun.\n\n8/10","April 12","true","9.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaagur/recommended/45400/","vaagur","Vaagur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vaagur/","2091 products in account","Fortix is a strategic puzzle game in which you must capture the castles by making lines and rectangles. There are turrets and dragons ready to kill you all around and you have a set amount of lives per stages.\n\nThe game is really stressful, because if you die in a set of levels, you will start over at the first one. Also in the later difficulties, with how hard it is to make pixel perfect squares, you will die to random 1x1 pixel bumps you have made while capturing terrain. This game could have been pretty good, I like the idea. There's even more bad things about the game...\n\nThis is a "puzzle" kind of game, but the enemies and bonuses doesn't spawn at the same place if you retry or start over. That makes it so you can win many levels just by re-trying until you get a "Stop-time" bonus in a convenient spot and clear the level in 20 seconds.\n\nThe game can be completed in less than 30 minutes (even on Impossible difficulty), but at least it's cheap...\n\nI do not think it is too bad, but I cannot recommend it, way too punishing, it's 1$ though... So if you want to try a new type of puzzle/strategy game, sure, try it. Personally, I found it too punishing and frustrating. I also felt like I had no real control over certain of my deaths.","April 22, 2015","false","7.5"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","17","28","0","0"

In this game, it isn't about how much you cover the screen but you need to circle enemy forts to win the round. To spice it up, you have different kinds of enemy dragons hunting you when you draw a line.\n\nWhile I have played this genre before and somewhat like it, mind you this is probably very boring kind of game for many gamers. Also I think the likes of Cubixx HD (not sure if available on steam) does a lot better job than Fortix. I reached the halfway of the game in 30-40 minutes, so it's a short game too.\n\nAt its price, 99 cents, it's not the worst purchase you could make. Still, its very short (granted it has different difficulty levels), game in niche genre and it's very stale too. So I would not recommend this game because it's not worth your money and especially your time (even it's very short), unless you are really into this genre.","November 30, 2013","false","1.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

It has also special place on SteamGifts and in my heart!\n\nThe gameplay is simple but surprisingly addictive. You are a knight, tasked to capture enemy forts on a map. You conquer land and anything placed on it simply by drawing a closed line around it, but there be dragons and enemy towers out there to get you. As long as you don't leave the borderline, you're safe though - until time runs out!\n\nYou owe it it to yourself to try hard and earn the right to play Fortix!\n\nFor what it's worth, it's fun!\n\nOnce achievements are at 100% completion however, which isn't extremely hard, you may not feel much incentive to play it further, especially if you own Fortix 2.

At least not any that has had any significant releases in the last ten years. The Fortix type of games are all very similar with very little deviation, you must conquer the land by boxing it in while being attacked by various types of moving and shooting enemies, in this case, Dragons and Towers.\n\nFortix is a cute little game and it deserves points for not pretending to be anything other than what it is, a cheap little time sink that'll take a couple of hours to complete and a few more to master, It's not normally a type of game I'd recommend to anyone, instead directing them towards the many free flash alternatives however with a measly 1$ price tag, Fortix can hardly be considered a waste of money.

It is outrageously fun! Indeed, I would say that it is worth more than a mere dollar.\n\nThere is also Fortix2 available on Steam, and although I should say that all of the level layouts in Fortix are also in Fortix2, I should also say that Fortix is a little bit more of a challenge than Fortix2.\n\nGameplayYour objective is to capture the vast majority of territory of each level. This game is apparently based on an old game called "Qix" (before my time, so I can't tell you more than that). You capture territory by walking your knight off of his baseline and tracing out boxes, which once you go back to the baseline will then be claimed. Life is made a little more hazardous by towers that shoot at you, various creatures that want to eat you, and changes in ground type which slow you down.\n\nControlsOne can use the mouse, but using the keyboard gives you much more precise control over your knight. I certainly found the keyboard more intuitive to use. You need fast fingers if you play in hard mode!\n\nStorylineThere is one, but it isn't much of one. Very basic, there is a bad guy, you must complete all the levels and defeat the bad guy. I must say though, that really not every game needs a plot so I can't count it as a con.\n\nSoundReally fun medieval jolly music. I also enjoyed listening to the little noises the dragons make.\n\nGraphicsI enjoyed the artwork a great deal. There are plenty of different looking textures to help you tell ground types apart. So, functional and nice to look at. The dragons are really cute!\n\nPros+ different difficulty settings making it simplistic or a bit of a challenge\n+ different ways to control your knight\n+ pleasant atmosphere\n+ simple objective, but hurdles between you and victory\n+ awfully cheap\nCons- movement can be a bit awkward and sometimes not as responsive as you might like\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.\n\nRothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot com\n\nFootnotes\n*Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see. The primary price I list at the top is the price that I bought the game at.\n**I will not be keeping an eye on whether the links are up to date, so if they are broken I apologise.

The controls are also surprisingly responsive, giving players support for both keyboard and mouse which is an achievement in this age of console gaming.\n\nFortix far exceeeded my high expectations, it costs as much as a Humble Bundle, but its value reaches far beyond any ordinary game, it is an experience that is both art and entertainment with moral lessons to be learned that would benefit all of humankind.\n\nThis game is not only an example of a game done right, but also an inspiration to other game developers such as myself, for we now have a goal for which we strive towards, a goal of someday, possibly, being able to create as exsquisite a game as this magnificent work of art.\n\nI award this must-play game: 10/10","August 21, 2013","true","3.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

In the end, just capture the castle and forget the rest of the map, as this is the easiest path to victory. This game just ends up being a bit of a time waster, and is good for a nostalgic trip into childhood, replaying a remake of an older game from days past.\n\nDon't buy this game unless it is under $1 or in a really good package deal.","April 15, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A great, simple game, with fun, engaging, simple and tried-and-true gameplay mechanics. For less than a dollar you can get a game that is better than some $5+ games I own.\n\nSimple story, you are a knight who has returned to his homeland to reclaim his family's throne from an evil wizard. However, this isn't some strategy game where you build up resources or units, nor is this an in-depth RPG or hack-n-slash. No, this game is a thing of pure beauty.\n\nIt is simple. You control a knight (Sir Fortix), and you move around the map, cutting out swathes of land. The more land you get, the higher your score. However, there are enemy turrets that can hit you or your drawn line, and dragons that fly around the map and can kill you. There are also enemies that travel around the lines, trying to hunt you down. How do you defeat them? Simple, outline them. Simply run around them so that they are trapped in the piece of land you cut out. Capture catapult triggers to shoot catapults at the enemy turrets and destroy them. You have a set number of lives and a time limit, although each is more than enough I think. This isn't as easy as it sounds, as enemies can fill your screen and multiple turrets can send cannon balls flying everywhere, while you dodge through, vanquishing enemies, capturing triggers and power up, and slowly but surely conquer the map.\n\nMany levels, often with other levels within them, a great, simple, and cheap game that focuses on gameplay and fun. For $0.99? It is a steal and I highly reccomend it. Plus, it comes with trading cards, so you can get emoticons, backgrounds, and badges from this game, and for getting access to this, the price seems even better!\n\nIt is a little older, so the resolution is a little off, although setting it to full screen makes it more than playable imo. I've heard of issues with this game on Windows 8.1, but I run Windows 8 64 bit and it runs perfectly.\n\nI do recommend this game, 8/10","March 19, 2014","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

While the art is interesting enough and carries what it needs to carry, you aren't going to be entranced, and the gameplay, while a bit repetitive, offers enough challenge to keep you on board for long enough to at least finish the game's achievements and receive the three offered card drops.\nThe game offers two control schemes, keyboard or mouse, each with it's own advantages, which is an interesting and not-often-seen twist. The game offers standard option controls including windowed mode (always a plus) and the ability to mute the in-game music, which you will most likely be doing after it loops the third time.\nThe gameplay is difficult enough to match each mode of play from easiest to hardest, with the hardest being worthy of the title. The game offers bonuses to be roped-off and captured in order to gain short-lasting special abilities such as a temporary speed boost, temporary halting of cannon fire, or the killing off of one of the infuriating dragons. The level designs vary and offer up a challenge as you gain access to higher levels. Be careful not to lose all of your lives, though! In levels with multiple castles to capture you have to restart from the first castle in that level if you run out of chances.\nFor the price, I recommend picking up the game, for the trading cards and easier-than-usual achievements. While you won't be returning again and again as if the game is a nasty habit, it is highly worth being a quick guilty casual-gaming guilty pleasure.","August 22, 2014","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Walking over 'enemy soil' creates a thin line where you walked, and when crossed with your own land, you gain the smallest patch (e.g. if you take over a small plot of land, naturally it wouldn't grant you the whole map from that small piece.)

Though it might seem trivial to complain when it only costs a dollar, the fact of the matter remains that with the release of Fortix 2 (which includes all of 1's levels) the original has been made completely obsolete and redundant.\n\nNot that it was particularly worthwhile to begin with. With only a dozen or so strongholds to defeat, most of which comprise but a single level, Fortix is over before it feels like it's even started. The different difficulty settings do nothing to create replay value, only increasing the speed of enemies and lowering the generous amount of extra lives you receive, as the game is very easy even set on impossible.\n\nIn short, even having gotten it for free, I feel cheated to have wasted my time playing Fortix. The level designs are terribly dull and the presentation so basic and repetitive that the it amounts to being little more than a glorified flash game or demo. Save your dollar, or better yet find it a friend and get Fortix 2 instead. It provides the better experience through and through, and although I think the core gameplay of Fortix is rather enjoyable itself, this is simply an extremely poor representation of it that serves no purpose but to take up space in your Steam library.","September 15, 2013","false","2.9"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","3"

No bugs that I could see, graphics is crap, but fine for the type of gameplay.\n\nI enjoyed the game on easy, and finished it in about 1 and a half hours.\n\nI decided to see how difficult Nightmare level was and complete it with a perfect score.  As some of the areas you have conquer have two or three levels, I was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that you had to go back to the first level if you decided to retry.  So even if you had completed level 2 or 3 of a certain area, you end up returning to level 1 once you choose to "retry" level 2 or 3. So, to get a perfect score, you must not die once during a level. Obviously, you do die a lot on Nightmare, and that just made me rage quit as I got really annoyed with having keep redoing certain previous levels I had already completed.\nBesides that, good game.","January 1, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a price-point of $5 on Steam, Fortix definitely offer a nice change of pace to the multi-million budget games, emulating the experience of short Qix gameplay.\n\nFortix is far from a good game though. The controls are limited to only keyboard control with the arrows button. The game is short (22 maps at the moment), and could be easily completed within an hour. Music though nice, is limited to only one track. Enemy type are limited to only 4. No tutorial and graphics that are rather backdated (but forgivable, since it was supposed to be released originally for PSP Mini).\n\nWhile nothing is promised at the moment, Nemesys studio seems keen in community contact, and might expand this game further in the near future. .\n","November 19, 2010","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You draw lines to divide up territory, making sure that neither yourself nor your line is hurt by the obstacles along the way, and when you've captured specific territory or a certain amount, you succeed. The principle is simple and it's fun enough.\n\nThey certainly know how to set difficulty levels. The default of easy is just that as it allows time for correction. The impossible difficulty will give you a run for your money as, try though I did, I could not get perfect on the last level on the impossible difficulty. This makes it an adequate choice whether you are looking for a brief distraction or a challenge.\n\nThe game is very sensitive and seems to expect extremely precise timing. I say this because often enough I tried to reconnect to a previous section only to be a sliver off, usually leading to my demise. This is compounded by the fact that anything and everything, including your own character and score callouts, seems to be in the way of being able to see where you are and whether you've started a new line, exposing yourselft to danger. Often, I would accidentally end up on a border that was a sliver off of the one I had come from only to find myself dead because I had unknowingly just exposed myself to a nearby danger. There are also many random elements like which tower will fire when, where pick-ups appear and which way dragons will go making it much harder to plan things out. When all of these things are so meaningful alone that they could determine success or failure, it becomes increasingly frustrating on the impossible difficulty because you fail due to many factors seemingly beyond your control.","December 1, 2013","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is basically etch-a-sketch warrior.  You have a map that you walk around with the arrow keys so just up, down, left, & right.  You unlock or reclaim it by making or completing a square back to the baseline or the edge of the map.  This "base line" will change as you chew your way into the map.  The interesting bit is while you are trying to do this turrets will fire cannonballs at you and dragons and various baddies will come after you.  You die when they hit your incomplete line.  That reminded me of the old snake games you used to play on cellphones before they had color screens.  Your line is completed when you make a box.  You can trap dragons by boxing them in and the same with turrets.  Whatever is within that box is reclaimed or defeated.  There are various powerups and trigger points that will activate your attack forces to start firing at the turrets to make life a little easier for you.    It is a simple game mechanic that is quite fun.  Well worth the asking price on steam.","June 2, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, there are bonuses that spawn, and the only one I've found useful is a extra life powerup. Now, this game is not worth the $1 price tag, so why do you ask am I recommending this game? The trading cards. When I wrote this, the price of the cards were about $0.20 each, you get 3 and that means, if you can sell them away, that the game comes to about $0.40...or... you could spend just $0.40 and get a badge, which is pretty cheap.
