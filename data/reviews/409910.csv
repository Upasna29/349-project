Keep playing games, extend your library and hoping for that one game that brings all your gaming wishes together? I have that often. Sometimes I see myself browsing the Steam library for hours just to find that one game that fits all my demands.\n\nLast year I discovered just a few of those hidden gems. I mention Thea: The Awakening because of the small team who managed to freshening a stale genre of countless 4x games around the same fantasy setting and around the same game mechanism. And more recently I discovered, while less complete yet and still in EA, Last Days of Old Earth. Like Thea it has some fresh new ideas and combinations of different genres (card game, tactical battles, turn based strategy) that fits well together.\n\nWhile browsing a Steam friend's library and wishlist searching for more of these hidden gems I discovered the store front picture of The Storm Guard: Darkness is Coming. I clicked the picture expecting some casual indie title on the same pixelated hex grid like the other thousands of rogue-like, dungeon crawlers etc that reach the Steam store because of fanatic Greenlight clickers.\n\nHow wrongly I was when I decide to buy the game despite the ugly, embossed, unalligned font on the store front picture.\n\nSteam must be punished for hiding this game so long from my recommondations and hide it from my store page.\nWhy they hide a title like this in a cellar beneath thousands of casual tablet games?\n\nSo what exactly is this game doing right?\n\nFirst of all, and that is exactly why I compare it to Thea, the game is made to entertain you.\nThat is clear from the very first run.\nAn intro movie a la Blizzard style (when Blizzard was making games instead of pleasing stockholders).\nFully animated artwork with dragons and a story told by a professional narrative.\nNext screen. A paper with a short story to make some ambience.\nNext screen. A little town with some heroes in front of a questboard. Tooltips all over to tell the player what all those buttons do. In a few minutes you understand how the game works and the town looks like a small town you wish you should visit it yourself in your dreams. Ambience is there. Music is fit totally in the setting and the artwork in Unity engine is high resolution and detailed.\n\nOn the right side of the screen you have your hero/unit raster from where you can select a group of heroes you want to start questing. On the left side you can start your first quest within a minute.\n\nThe quest generated is different everytime you play. You start on a kind of grid map with a random or procedural generated dungeon where every block you can walk into triggers an encounter. That can bring you some treasure, a monster encounter or just a short little story where you have to make a choice in the end.\n\nThis alone already spoil some of the details you can find in this game. While in a few hundred of RPG, TBS games the last twenty years you can find a magic or a healing potion with only one effect, you find a potion with some effects AND some side effects. Why I did not see that in any other game? In turn one and two the potion is doing Y and in turn three and four the potion is doing X. Right.\n\nAnd so you continue to find so much detail in this game when you start your first turn based battle with your heroes against the monster army.\nWhile in every RPG or TBS game from the last twenty years you see skeletons, 2D skeletons, 3D skeletons, animated, pixels, sprites etc etc in this game you have skeletons as well. But what is different? The skeleton is really a skeleton. It raise from the ground before it even moves. It's animated not only after an attack but it's animated when battle start, when attacking, when defending. It's real! It's not just a statue.\n\nSo in the last 300+ TBS games you played you can move from A to B no? In this game you can move from A to B as well. But you can move the way you want because it use waypoints while in a tactical turn based battle. So you can move your unit around an enemy unit and positioning your archer without the AI decide for you that your archer first have to walk in the melee area of the enemy while moving from A to B. Smart.\n\nAnd so the game use morale and adrenaline. Not just to raise some static stats. No it's used to trigger some real unique traits and abilities. Not only in the battle fought or in the current turn. It's a system used for a whole battle at once. So for the first time you really fight a battle instead of watching it.\n\nTired of those games you shoot and miss while the AI have a constant critical hit? Here your hit change is always 100%. So again the game is not designed to punish the player but to entertain and to let you play a game. So it's easy then? No it's not. Because there are threats that lowers your hit change, lowers your damage done to enemies and traits that buff you even more or makes you invunarable for attacks. It's just more detailed and entertaining then the last 100 TBS games I played.\n\nSo I highly recommend this game. Not only because what I told you above but because all those ideas, original approaches of the genre are settled in a smart, clean and nicelooking playerfriendly UI. Helpfull tips around your run. You can't move or you can't shoot and you don't know why? A small tooltip warns you and even those are fully voice overed.\nBesides of that the replay value must be great because of random encounters, everything have voice overs, mouse overs, tips, and detailed info on right click menu's. WSAD keys work normal for moving the map and Q and E for turning and if you don't like it that oldskool way you just use the mouse. Press middle for pan, press left for move the map and right to rotate. This game just does it allright.\n\nFinal verdict: The game is some combination between the tactical battles like in XCOM games and campaign progress, character building and dungeon crawling like in Darkest Dungeon.","March 25","true","4.1"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","43","48","0","14"

After a while the battles seem to get a little repetitive as you find yourself making the same patterns of movements and attackss every battle.  I think i'd like to see a little more variation in terrain and rocks and things to help change up the battles a little, but maybe I just haven't played enough yet to see more variation.\n\nAs you complete missions, your town opens up new buildings where you can buy potions of all sorts to take in your adventures, a shop where you can buy a few armor items per for each character with different attribues for different prices and a training hall where you can advance and upgrade each characters skills as they level up.  Pretty standard RPG stuff that any RPG fan will feel at home with here.\n\nMissions are the main way you level up and advance through the game, and each mission is a procedurally generated block grid that you can move your group through, each block having an random even happen, which could be an opportunity to help someone for gold (easy gold obtained just by clicking the right choice, etc) or it could be a battle.  Once you move through all blocks in a mission you can return to town to rest, upgrade skills, and hire new heroes if one died in your mission.\n\nThe main goal of completing each mission is to lower the "panic" level of your towns citizens and keep them safe and happy it seems, and I found that you can rest your group for a day at a time to collect taxes and easy money to spend but at the cost of your towns citizens panic level increasing due to the outside dangers that exist.\n\nMy biggest complaint with this game after my first three hours of play is that in the turn based battles, sometimes there are lag spikes that make the game feel far too sluggish, but then again that might have just been an isolated issue with my 5 year old gaming pc suffering my trying to play on the 3rd best graphics settings available.\n\nOverall, a fun game.. but because I haven't played enough of these turn based RPGs.. it's hard for me to compare this game to others of a similar price and style.\n\nIf I had to give this game an early grade based on my first few hours, I'd probably give it around a 75-80 as I think it will offer a lot of RPG gameplay hours for the price tag.  I feel that there is plenty of content here to give RPG fans a good bang for their buck even if there might be better options available.\n\nThis game gets my thumbs up as despite my few gripes, I think it offers far more positives then negatives.. and that's a great sign for the first day of its early access launch!","January 28","true","3.0"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","33","37","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lynchden/recommended/409910/","Lynchden","Lynchden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lynchden/","91 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVery promising game.  Lots of content.  Hardly any bugs.  Developers must be working 20 hrs a day with all the feedback they give and changes they are working on.  It is permadeath, but you can reload an old save.  Turn based combat on a square tile set. You initially control a group of three heroes. This number will eventually increase to four and then five.  You can either move once and attack once or attack twice, though some special attacks will actually hit 2 or even 3 times.  You can also see exactly how far you can move (blue circle around you), the current range of any ranged attacks (red circle around you) how far the enemy can move on their next turn (blue circle around them) and how far their ranged attacks can reach (red circle around them).  You can also click once on a tile before moving there and the enemies you can reach with a projectile should you move to that spot are highlighted in red.  When in melee, you can attack from all 4 sides and all 4 corners.  Good variety of classes and powers. I feel like random numbers play a very small role in this game.  There are definetely dice rolls, but I never feel like I got screwed by the RNG gods.   They also do a great job giving you info via tooltips when you mouse over an object or right click.  For every attack, you can see your percent chance to hit, the points range of damage you will do, the crit chance & the exact hit points the enemy has remaining and the exact number of hitpoints the enemy will automatically lose at the start of the next round if they have a debuff (like bleeding) or how many hit points they will gain if they have a buff.  This can really help with strategy as you can know whether to spend an attack on an enemy or if the bleed will finish them off automatically.  I like the whole game of thrones/nights watch setting.  I like the narrarator's voice, he does a good job.  I will expand upon this later when I have more time.  For now, buy this game if you are on the fence.  It is well worth the money and is in a very advanced stage and very well put together.","February 2","true","15.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The dev has taken some time to quickly produce a patch to add a lower difficulty option for us. He did this over the weekend. To me that screams dedication. The dev has also been around all weekend answering questions and looking at our feedback. Really seems to care about the game and the enjoyment the community gets out of it. I'm recommending this one, my 20$ well spent.","January 31","true","9.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

Tons of content and a lot of attention to detail.  The dialog could be better written as it tends to be redundant and you hear the same lines over and over, but the gameplay, and the fact you can turn the narator volume down, makes it irrelevant.\n\nOnly encountered one bug, though I saw it a few times.  Had to reload the game as it would get stuck, but the autosave feature always returned me right back to where I was.  Seeing only one bug in an early access game and only having it be a minor inconvenience is great.\n\nThe game is great fun and well worth the $20 they are asking.

It really does take me back to the days of RPG on older systems.\n\nIt is well done though, no mistake.  Seems balanced and it moves along at a decent pace with somewhat appropriate consequences for poor judgement.\n\nIt also crashes every so often and there isn't anything you can do about it.  Something else that used to happen in old RPGs.\n\nIt's good enough to get a fair review even in EA.

Even just in early access, there is a nice assortment of random "events" that can occur on every mission and each result depends on the choices you make for your group of characters.  Think pen and paper RP where the game is your DM and the decision to investigate those "...strangely out of place rocks" lands your poor group face to face with a lava golem.  I'm certain the gravedigger and that golem are in cahoots!\n\nThere's talk on other boards of the game being to difficult in the beginning and unbalanced.   I agree with some of it to a point but most is exaggerated.  Each combat where you meet a creature for the first time has a nicely detailed explanation of what their strengths and weaknesses are.  Be distracted at your poor group's peril.  This is a game where  tactics matter.  Terrain, distance to targets, movement range, positioning, available attacks; they all come into play when you're hanging on by a thread and the reward for getting your group through th efight is much more than the gold and XP.  There isn't an RPG out there where the creatures don't love a rambunctious, "CHARGE!," player eager to give that dang gravedigger his quota.  See mention of golem above...\n\nI've never been a fan of permadeath but when it fits the difficulty and "death" can largely be blamed on my own "mistakes," I don't mind it at all.  It builds character.  Or in this case, it ends character(s)?  If I must fault this game as it stands right now, I will say that combat does seem to run a bit slow.  It can become monotonous.  However, realizing that you don't have to wait for one character to finish an attack before assigning another task to a different character seems to compensate for the monotony.  Still, I fear it may be a sadly distracting side-effect of the game to a few who would otherwise be fans.\n\nI thoroughly recommend Storm Guard: Darkness is Coming to anyone even slightly curious about it.  It is enjoyable, entertaining, and if you don't play it on that wimpy "easy" setting, its a nice challenge for an RP experience.  I'd curse that golem again happily as it toasts another of my groups.\n\nEnjoy!","March 13","true","14.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But, I honestly really like this game quite a bit.\n\nAs a strategic RPG, I think it works quite well at what it wants to accomplish in quite a few ways. One of the ways it accomplishes its goal at being a pretty solid strategy/RPG hybrid is its way of throwing difficulty at the player immediately from the start, with the first area you bring your small little team of dudes to. I like a game with a good amount of difficulty, and it makes you consider how you should set up your guys, what weapons and magic you should use, and it does this in a way that feels quite fun to play around with your options a little.\n\nThe inspiration from Game of Thrones is veeery obvious, right from the first letter you get from the game, telling us how The Storm Guard is this military order that protects the whole land from all manner of hellish beasts, including our favorite fire-breathing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s known as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons. And that's basically what The Wall was in Game of Thrones. Except, instead of being in this snowy-♥♥♥ environment, it's a normal grassy plain. And these guys fight dragons, instead of y'know, wildlings n all that. The mood and even the tone is very close to the realms of Game of Thrones. And to some, that may be a very big plus, or a very big negative, depending on whether you're into Game of Thrones or not.\n\nThe story, is very basic, and if you have read or watched any fantasy works, it's quite uninspired. And in the context of this game, the story is only the outline for the actual gameplay, and is there to give more purpose to what is going on. There is several pieces of flavour text sprinkled throughout the game, particularly in its very text adventurey parts, where it gives you a few options for the player to choose whether he wants to help this villager from this pack of zombies, or just ditch the villager and don't get any of the rewards from doing so. And in those parts, it really feels like FTL. These parts feel like if FTL, Super Mario Bros. 3, and a random board game had a baby, and this came out. And I like this, a lot.\n\nThe dialogue can be pretty all right, and the writing for the dialogue can range from "AW YEAH" to "eh, it's all right". I feel like I'm not really one to praise nor critisize my voice work in this 'cause it's really up to you whether or not my voice acting was "OH YEAH THIS GUD" territory.\n\nBut yeah, if you love fantasy RPGs, dragons, tough-♥♥♥ enemies that will kick your ♥♥♥, strategy works, or even games like FTL, you'll really REALLY like this game! And that is why I recommend this game!","June 6","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
