The soundtrack is neat and fitting with how the game looks, and just overall the game has a slick smooth gameplay experience with a lot of creative puzzles that look really cool and is actually fun to play around in. I couldn't find the Vodka though.\n\nThere isn't a story or anything in the game, unless it's hidden and I couldn't find it, it's just a straight out fun puzzle game with a handful of them to finish, and I had fun solving all the puzzles, confusing at times of course, but with how the levels were designed, making me think with dimensional portals, I had a fun time solving them. For the asking price and for the creative fun content you'll play around with, it's definitely worth the purchase and playthrough.\n\nAlso, I'm hoping that the developers would think of adding a level editor and Steam workshop for community created levels, if the game sells well, and if that's the case, then buy two copies, because if it has a level editor and new levels coming in, the value of the game doubles in my eyes, so let's hope it sells well to merit a level editor.\n\nShameless link[ksalue.com] to original post","March 10, 2015","true","6.0"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","39","44","3","0"

Visually it should reminds me of Antichamber but with a lot more polish. The puzzle mechanics are minimalistic but they all blend really nicely.\n\nI'm a little disappointed that you can't see your best level performance anywhere. The replay value is raised quite a lot by challenging yourself to beat each level as fast as possible.\n\nUpdate as of 2015-03-26:\nThe developers has done so many amazing things to improve this game for our little niche of speedrunners. While it still doesn't keep track of best performance the game now has a much more detailed in-game timer and in speedrun mode there's a timer for your full run as well.

Nowadays every new puzzle game has to have a unique gimmick to it to make it interesting and challenging for the player. In Parallax's case, it's parallel dimensions coupled with some gravity defying platforms in the later levels. The challenge is fair and balanced and the difficulty increases steadily as you progress through the game. While some levels can look quite intimidating at first, with a bit of thought, careful planning and memorization you can beat everything fairly fast and achieve perfect level completion within very few actions.\n\nEven if Parallax doesn't break any new grounds in the audiovisual department, its simple yet futuristic looking monochromatic art style along with electronic beats lend themselves well to the game creating a pleasant overall experience.\n\nThe game's price is perfect for its length of 4 chapters with 8 levels each and it still has a lot of replayability to offer after completion. As of March 14th 2015, the developers have already added a game mode specifically designed for speedrunners, which will exponentially increase Parallax's lifespan.\n\nIf you're a fan of first person puzzle games that are not only well designed, but offer substantial replay value, then you mostly likely already own Parallax. On the slim chance you don't, buy it. You certainly won't regret the purchase.\n\nThe Good:\n- Balanced difficulty\n- Very good level design\n- Simple, but fitting audiovisuals\n- Good replay value\n\nThe Bad:\n- Might be too short for some players","March 15, 2015","true","24.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/le_master/recommended/325060/","le_master","Le Master","http://steamcommunity.com/id/le_master/","54 products in account","I'll start by saying Parallax and The Talos Principle are the first-person puzzlers of the past 12 months.  At their core, they are each archetypal puzzle games: begin at a starting point and arrive at a predetermined goal with the means provided using logic and reasoning. Like any well-constructed puzzle game, the levels start simple and gradually become more complex while introducing more concepts which build upon themselves.\n\nHowever, they are also much different from one another. TTP is immersed in a story which drives and motivates the player (much like Myst or Portal) with its mystery and philosophical ideas. It has large, beautiful environments that provide enough to explore and add to the experience.  Parallax is a straightforward puzzler. There is no story, no environments or landscapes to explore, nothing -- just level after level of puzzles. But this isn't exactly a negative. The game really works in its simplicity. It somehow creates a lot of incentive in the player to move forward and to complete the game (I would say at least to the extent of the recent Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube and non-director's cut Q.U.B.E.).\n\nThe unique concept to this game are the portals to a parallel "world." The portals shouldn't be dismissed as a sort of copy of those from the Portal series. They are only alike in name and that you walk through them. The portals here lead to and from another environment that has elements connected to both environments and also has elements local to only each respective environment. The player moves to and from each environment to activate switches and traverse to other portals in order to reach the goal. The swtiches can rotate portals the opposite direction so that the player can enter once inaccessible switches or portions of the level, and the switches can even rotate portions of the level itself.\n\nThe level design is mostly very intelligent. Most have that "aha!" moment. And I really think it is because of those moments that the player is rewarded and driven. There are a small number of poorly designed levels, ones which make use of laser beams that have no purpose to the overall puzzle and only hinder the player's ability to traverse, and ones that obscure the player's ability to see where switches lead and what they activate.\n\nIt is a wonderful exercise of the mind, and it is a rewarding experience. Any fan of the genre would be sorry to miss this addition. I only hope a level editor becomes available before interest subsides.","March 31, 2015","true","11.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Here the 'Portals' are fixed, and like mirrors have a front and a back face - Only side transports you to an 'inverse' dimension and the other side acts as a blocker. Switches and wires link to mechanisms that can spin these faces around to help you reach the exit.\n\nThe individual elements of the game are pretty simple and it breaks you in gently with the first few puzzles, but things get quite a bit more complex in the end. Getting your head around what's happening in each dimension at the same time as working out how to use the mechanisms is very rewarding.\n\nThe graphics are simple and you can change the two colours involved, but you are still limited to only two colours. This is a good thing in a way, as the game runs very smoothly and does not clutter up your screen with unnecessary details. There's no story or enemies in the game, although it does have a weird inter-dimensional atmosphere and some mood music. Really this is all you need - The puzzles are very good and are allowed to stand as the main feature of the game.\n\nI'd definitely recommend it.","March 13, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/325060/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","Parallax is a first-person puzzler with minor platforming aspects. And it's pretty great.\n\nFirst off, the presentation is very appealing. The game is monochrome (though this can be changed) and rather minimalist; platforms and portals have a very crisp feel to them that looks great. Everything's very visually distinct too, rather important in a monochrome game. And the music adds to the atmosphere, playing downtempo electronic music in the "light" zone and ambient noise in the "dark" zone. It looks and sounds great.\n\nBut that would mean nothing if the gameplay itself wasn't good. But it is. The game is primarily focused around two-state objects, and puzzle solutions involve pressing the right buttons to turn the right objects the right way. Such objects include lasers, platforms, portals that take you between the game's two dimensions, and ramps that fling you into the air. There's also gravity shenanigans that happen in the later levels to make for a further level of confusion.\n\nBut surprisingly, despite how much the game works to confuse you, the puzzles are still surprisingly logical, and that's due to them being grounded in this two-state system. Figuring out the correct order of events isn't too tough with a bit of observation and a bit of experimentation, but doing so in the minimal amount of moves is the real challenge. The game's puzzles are also quite variedl; each structure is unique and most every level has a small little nuance to it not seen in previous levels to keep you thinking. I never felt bored solving the game's puzzles.\n\nThe biggest gripe I'd have is that there are a few occasions where, even solving a puzzle as optimally as possible, you're going to end up waiting around for spending some time doing nothing. It's mostly a result of the way the puzzles are designed, but there are a few instances of long transition session or having to wait on a particularly long switch. The game is also rather brief, though I'll take a brief, varied experience over a long, unnecessarily bloated one any day. Personally it took me around 5 hours to clear all the puzzles perfectly, but other people have taken twice as long or more, so it may just depend on how used you are to these kinds of puzzle games.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable experience and definitely one I'd recommend to fans of puzzle games.","March 25, 2015","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You use buttons to rotate certain elements of the world in order to gain access to an exit platform. It is very easy to mash buttons and win here, but the reall challenge is doing it in exactly the required number of moves [or trying to break the game and do it in less]. If you can think logically and think of moves ahead of time, this will be your type of game.\n\nThe first two chapters are moderately easy, but things get very tricky in the second half of the game. With various aspects like lasers and gravity reversal introduced, it can be a real mind bender. The music for this game isn't too energetic, which helps you get in a thinking mood.\n\nIt is worth noting that while the game looks black and white, you can change the colour scheme in the game options or the main menu to other presets, so you needn't be put off by the stark contrast you may see in screenshots.

The rifts will be in the same place in both rooms, but nothing else necessarily will be. The puzzles are primarily based on orienting the rifts properly to over obstacles and reach switches to eventually make it to the exit. It starts off very simple and the difficulty builds in a very natural way. At the end I definitely felt challeneged, but never so much so that I wanted to stop playing. Eventually you are required to use platforms that manipulate gravity, which where the game really shines and will put your spatial reasoning to the test.\n\nThe aesthetic may not be for everyone (I personally loved it) and there's no plot to speak of, so if you're for anything besides puzzles you might want to keep looking. Otherwise this game provides a fascinating and unique take on the genre of first person puzzlers. The "perfect" number of moves also provides an extra challenge that I found engaging in most instances.","March 10","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The puzzles are really great and the whole game has a very polished feel to it.\n\nThere are 32 levels in total with 8 levels in each of the 4 chapters. Every chapter introduces a new and interesting game mechanic. Playing through the puzzles for the second time is really where this games meat is at, where you try to solve each level in as little moves as possible. Fans of Portal and Antichamber should really enjoy this game.\n\nThe developer is also a really great guy. He's quick to respond to any issue you may have and updates occur frequently. (There have already been 6 patches in the week or so this game has been out)\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games.

I thought I could cope with that but after a while you do kinda wonder why you're bothering?\n\n\n2 - you could solve most puzzles if you could jump a slightly larger gap or run (you can't) or just climb around the side of the portals - e.g the difficulty is in the limitations of movement and not the cleverness of the puzzles - no locked rooms or impossible leaps here, just roadblocks.\n\n3 - puzzles can solved by elimination or deduction.  These puzzles quickly add a LOT of combinations which means lots of elimination but are involved enough to make deduction pretty hard (and all the puzzles I saw were single-solution)\n\n4 - I got motion sickness/a headache after about 5mins of play - after 2 attempts I gave-up.  It's not something I've had much before (The Ball did it - that's about it) but this does it really well!\n\nSo, it's a fine game where everything works but it lacks some stuff.  It needs some sort of a carrot to keep you playing, some reason for accepting the limitations of movement and it could feel a bit more of a puzzle to be deduced and a bit less of rat maze to be beaten by sheer effort.\n\nYMMV","December 13, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

It's worth picking up if you really need another puzzler.\n\nVideo Review:\n\n(Spoiler alert in the video)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVbJg2h2-M\n\nWhat is it?\n\nParallax is a black and white (or a variety of other pairs of colors that can be chosen in the settings) puzzle game. The idea is that you have portals that transport you between a blak on white world and a white on black world. These two worlds are different and what is done in one world can effect the other. You're goal is to use what you have at hand to get to the exit each time. There are booster, objects that change gravity, flippable portals and moving platforms to complicate your efforts.\n\nPros:\n\n-Cool mechanics. The idea of travelling between two worlds to effect each puzzle (although not entirely novel) is a cool idea.\n\n-Great visuals. These visuals are created by cascading portals and flipping of perspectives that can be trippy at times (in a good way).\n\n-SImple gameplay. It's fairly obvious what you can interact with and what you can't. That helps to make the puzzles more streamline.\n\nCons:\n\n-I'm a third of the way through the game and have not been challenged. The puzzles barely rquired throught to complete them. Admittedly, things like boosters and lasers havn't been introduced yet, but one would expect to see some diffuculty in the first third of a puzzle game.\n\n-There is no penalty for death. Death came to me in the form of an endless fall, and death was a merciful companion. When you die, things do not reset. In a puzzle game that has so far been so easy, I see this as strange. There is no risk involved is you hurtle yourself to your doom.\n\nIn the end, how do I feel about Parallax? Well, (as I've said already) I got a thrid of the way though the game in twenty minutes, with no challenge. I hope that the challenge will come. As I play the game more I'll update this review. I feel that Parallax is a good idea that could have been executed a bit better. That being said, these twenty minutes have been fun. If you're looking for a puzzler, this is a decent game to check out.","March 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Not too dissimilar from "Portal" in the sense that you need to use circular portals in order to solve puzzles. However in "Parallax" they're fixed in place and the only way you can interact with them is rotating them by enabling switches that are placed throughout the level. Also the portals themselves aren't connected in the same dimension, there's a parallel dark world with different platforms and switches, so you have to find a path through the level using both worlds. It can be really disorienting at first when you walk through portals and expect that the level design stays the same and later on it can get really difficult to keep track of all the portals, platforms and switches. Especially when it introduces the mechanic by which you can shift gravity and walk on the walls and ceilings.\n\nIf there's one thing I'm not too fond of is that there aren't that many levels in it. 32 levels in total and it took this numbnut of a player 2.5 hours to get through all of them. The problem is that the first couple of levels of each chapter only take a few seconds or maybe up to a minute to beat, since they introduce new elements, while later ones can take between 10 and 15 minutes per level, so a few harder ones wouldn't have hurt the game. Though I guess it's not too few, "Portal" also wasn't much longer than this, so it's only a minor criticism. It's definitely worth recommending to people with good spacial awareness and a knack for puzzles that require you to think ahead two or three steps.","March 26, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
