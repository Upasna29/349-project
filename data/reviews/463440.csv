It's a game? it has idea's? I'm sure the developers have had the best of intentions with this title, but from top to bottom this title is a mix of bad mechanic to worse execution.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LAQRVa19hU\n\nText:\nAs always, watch the video for the best possible impression of a title.\n\nRetool markets itself as a hacking puzzle game, where you would assume that would be it's two main focuspoints. Hacking mechanics and puzzles.\n\nSadly, starting from the top, the hacking is ... weak. you use a console and suddenly to can reconfigure some lines on the map, sometimes you need TWO consoles, but the base is really that. The UI is annoying with different buttons for actions that have no reason to be separate actions, with MANY of the "hacks" serving no purpose, boiling it down to "lets move to the lines so the doors open, and remove all the other lines so I don't get shot by a turret".\n\nThe AI doesn't react to any of that, fellow AI will gleefully ignore a corpse and keep moving on their linear path. Also, the AI doesn't use sound, movement, hacks, triggers or audio warnings of any kind to be alerted.. merely it's VERY tight (and exploitable) view cone (that you can always see and cant turn off).\n\nOh, and all the puzzles are exploitable. Yay.\n\nOn the graphics department... you play in SPACE... on floating platforms. I wish i was making it up, If this was a prototype it would be bad, but this is a full release. Also, both character animations and the VERY repetitive graphics just makes the entire thing feel.. ugh.\n\nLastly, the sounds are poor as ♥♥♥♥. Everything from movement to guns doesn't sound close to good.... so honestly, from top to bottom this game has taken very good idea's and ♥♥♥♥ed them up top to bottom.\n\nNo.\n","May 19","false","1.6"," 38 of 54 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","38","54","3","0"
