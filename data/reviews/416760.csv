It strips away the fluff from games and reveals the hollow skeleton beneath. As P2W reveals these tactics in a clinical way, you can't help but notice parallels with some of your favorite games, whether they're "Pay 2 Win" or not. Hopefully, this will make you contemplate how you spend your money and, more importantly, your time.\n\nThere are a lot of great, laugh-out-loud moments where the game finds new ways to extract your cash and make you feel like you're getting a good deal out of it. The combat is mindless. The rewards are meaningless. The grind is endless.\n\nAn empty world, forgettable enemies, and an addictive but ultimately imagined sense of progression are all that await you in the hours you will spend completing it. As a nihilistic statement about gaming, this game is art, a dadaistic masterpiece. I wholeheartedly recommend you experience it.\n\nHowever, I do not recommend you experience it via purchasing and playing through the game, because doing so is nearly impossible. Exactly why this is would be a spoiler and too nit-picky to get into, but suffice to say this game is better experienced via a well-edited Let's Play video* rather than actually enduring it yourself. Like an Andy Kaufman performance, it's more enjoyable to hear about afterwards than to actually attend.\n\n\n* I recommend this video, which shows all the game's content within the span of about an hour.

Back then there would be new MMORPGs that came out fairly regularly, nearly a new one every month.  Each of them claimed to be the "WoW Killer", that they were going to force players off of WoW servers by enticing them to play something else.  None of those games ever succeeded.\n\n*This* game does.  This $4.99 near joke of a game, designed purely to make a point about anti-fun... *this* is the WoW Killer.  After playing this for less than two hours, I doubt I'll ever log onto WoW again.  There are too many things in the world that generate true fun, so I'm not going to dump my time, energy, and MONEY into something that doesn't deserve any of those things.  This is a lesson I had already learned, but this game served to remind me.\n\nAlso, for a game that was designed to make people hate it, this was surprisingly well put together.  It managed to avoid all the terrible glitches that plague many of the low budget crap games on Steam.  I get the feeling that if this dev wanted to make a *fun* game, then it would be pretty great.\n\nFinal verdict:  I got this in a bundle, so it was totally worth the 58 cents, if for no other reason than to remind me not to play MMORPGs.  If you have a friend or family member who is addicted to an MMORPG, then this might be able to break them of it... maybe.","March 20","true","1.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I know my self i have many times found a fun looking game that i would like to continue in but ive always stopped myself when all those P2W comes up. Sadly but true almost  every game has some P2W content. Not that extreme that you HAVE to spend but it would surely make it more easy and enyojable. Mainly i play League of Legends. You can earn yourself all the characters in the game OR you could buy them with in game currency that cost real money ofcourse. But ive never stopped playing LoL because of that. I mean the developers need to earn money in some way and i can understand that. But now when it comes to the part that i cant continue playing if i dont pay. Thats just terrible. I will talk about this game now and how i felt like playing it.\n\n+ Pros\n+Teaches us in a really good way how big companies uses different bussiness models to "force" us into buying virtual currency.\n+ The game is fun in some parts.\n+ Got some okay soundtrack but gets tiresome.

The feeling when your doing the same thing over and over again was really not that great.\n- The developer could have made it that way so it was more fun and enjoyable to play AND we could learn at the same time. I would have loved the game so more.\n- Really NOT replayable. Just no. The game itself its pretty boring and i see no meaning of replaying it.\n\nI would recommend most people to try this out.

In fact, I think it's the opposite: the devs always make have the player the false impression that she/he is who controls the situation.\nUntil I left the game, I had some objections:\n\n-Please, include an in-game Settings menu. The music was driving me crazy.\n-There is just one button to add funds and gives only $0.10 per click. I suppose the dev was trying to remark that each time you click, you are giving the 'game' money, but 10 cents is not an amout enough to be concerned of. Even 10 clicks for 1 buck is still not enough to be lectured. The average cheapest item in a MMORPG costs about $3, maybe a $3 or $3 button would be more appropiate. In the end, it turns an Add Funds Simulator Clicker Edition.\n-In real MMORPG's, there isn't almost any item you can't get as a drop or a regular/daily quest or events. The chance drop percentage is pretty low, but you can still get it without paying for it. Purchasing it from the store is simply quickier. In this game, there is no way of getting those items outside the Premium Shop, and even after purchasing them, the items can fail.\n-Nowadays, in a lot of MMORPG's the armor or weapons you can purchase are cosmetic, just skins.","April 3","false","2.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

This is quite accurate to what it says it's trying to be, and well done in several ways. It's not really a game, so much as an interactive lecture, but given that it's a lecture about how games are designed, using a game as the medium feels appropriate.\n\nI had some problems with a few times where I felt it was being exaggerated far beyond its source material, though, like the time you need to spend 9 hours or like $60 of fake money to craft three potions; as I mentioned in a feedback thread on that: "The cost of accelerating farming/crafting times is WAY too high, even for the sake of example. It's not going to be terribly convincing when you ask a player to pay like $60 of fake money in order to not wait for 9 hours - most of those wait times accelerate for cheap, and even then buying them is generally considered a sucker's bet in many things, as the name of the game is managing your time so that you can log off and come back later when all of those things are done. Neither of those is the case here."\n\nUnfortunately, there's a massive problem later on, when you have to upgrade several items to +10. What I had to say about that in the feedback thread was the following: "The mechanics for upgrading items reminds me of actually doing that in a real MMO, where I had enough upgrade gems to almost certainly get my items to +10, but didn't want to sit there clicking the button for literally two hours per item until it succeeded enough times in a row. In that sense, verisimilitude! ...but I also got all of those upgrade gems for free over a long period of play.\n\nIn this, however, it cost me like "$200", 10 minutes, and several trips to and from the vendor with the upgrade items to get one item up to +10. This is another time the prices are a little high - the new Neverwinter had ridiculous item enchantment costs at launch, up around $128 for a single maximum-power item, but you were guaranteed to succeed, and quickly, if you spent that much on it.\n\nAnyway, the point is I'm not willing to do that five more times even for fake money, because that's still like 50 minutes of my life. qq pls buff reinforcement"\n\nThe developer posted an announcement here: http://steamcommunity.com/games/416760/announcements/detail/72420041513981709 where he stated that the intent of that was to frustrate the player and drive them to find macros or autoclickers. I gave up on this instead, because needing to spend over an hour on one mind-numbingly boring step of what amounts to an interactive lecture...\n\n...well, IMO, I got the point after the first ten minutes of it, and even that I felt was somewhat exaggerated compared to my free-to-play MMO experience.\n\nAnyway, yeah. I'll be seeking a refund since apparently that's working as intended, and as such I can't recommend this game ("game?") to anyone. That's a shame, because it's pretty okay at making its point otherwise, and mentions things that I didn't actually know, like the purpose of those daily logon campaigns. Sorry, Bang / Best Gaem Studio.\n\n(As implied above, I did not finish this game/lecture/whatever, having stopped after about 40 minutes due to the reinforcement grind.

But was hoping it would teach me something I didn't already know.\nI guess It's just my fault for playing F2PMMORPGs since I was 15. (RuneScape, MapleStory, Mabinogi, Dead Frontier, Tera Online, Elsword). The only thing I really "enjoyed" was reading the lectures which I did find mildly educational. However, it's still not going to be much of anything new if you've already experianced alot of F2PMMORPGs.\n\nAs someone has mentioned before in the disscusions boards, the prices on some of the items are extremly over exaggerated. I don't think I've seen any game anywhere charge $30 to complete a basic begginers quest. However, I understand it was for an extreme example's sake. Also the +10 equips quest was mind numbinly tasking to do simply because you couldn't just right click the items to put them in their proper slots, no you have to actually drag them to the slots. Be prepared to use macro's if you do buy this game.\n\n\n(spoiler? will anyone care?)\nfaintly attempts amusment with a "get strong and crush the F2P'ers" quest at the end, followed by the game shutting down as soon as you become the best in the server.\n\n\nSomewhat off-topic (Topic of P2W games) : Tera Online is the LEAST P2W game I've ever encountered (I guess minus League of Legends?). You can definatly play that game and get very deep into it without feeling pressured to spend cash on it.\n\nMeanwhile Elsword is THE MOST P2W game I've ever encountered (But maybe that's because MapleStory doesn't have PvP). Weapon/armor enhancments work 100% in PvP. And Costumes give you stats + set effects + additional stat sockets (you can frget about maxing any stats without a costume).\n\nI've spent about $2,000 from 2008-2012 on MapleStory.\n\nAnd now in Elsword I've probably spent over $3,000 since 2014 began.\n\nMaybe have spent $100 tops in Tera, for cosmetics.","December 20, 2015","false","2.8"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","5","25","0","1"

It's a bit annoying actually. You can't jump. I wana be able to jump lol.. You can't die. there is no real point to playing it. Unless you really wana know the secret.
