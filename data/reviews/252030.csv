The 2 currently available characters have very different playstyles, one of them is a monk which starts by using only fists while the other starts with a sword, both have their strengths and weaknesses which makes it really fun to play through the game a second time.\nI started out playing the swords man in the hardest difficulty and finished the game and it was quite rewarding as i had to put some effort in to it, later i decided i was going to try out the monk and oh my did i get a surprise, it was like playing a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME! i died a couple of times to bosses here and there which i had considered mastered, but because of the different playstyle and spells it really shook me up and made me have another blast through the game!\n\nThe game also features a leveling system and a talent tree system which is pretty rare for a sidescroller, it brings out allot of possibilities while leveling on what path you wish to take and what  stats you require for your skill tree... Want to be a MONK MAGE?! no problem... Want to be a barehanded swordsman!? again no problem... the game is very well built to give you the different options of choosing what ever path suites you best!\n\nThe item system in the game is very pleasing, it's not to complex and not to simple, you will grind enemies along your travels and they will drop a variation of items for you, later in the game you will be able to use the items obtained to upgrade your weapons or armor as you see fit or even expand your mana or health pool.\nThis really brought out the good old RPG feeling in me and made me want to try to obtain all the items in the game in my first playthrough, i then realised that there are some items in the game that are only obtainable from chests and you will have to think wisely before you upgrade your weapons or armors as you may not be able to upgrade any other weapon or armor in your current playthrough!\n\nWhile gliding through the game you will fight vicious bosses that will show you no mercy at all, you will struggle and enjoy the sensation of progressing them til you finally deliver the final blow! you will be required to try out various combinations of armors or spells in order to find out what the best possible way to kill the bosses are.\nEvery boss in the game has some sort of weakness and it's yours to figure out!\n\nThe game it self is well designed, the story is great, has beautiful graphics which are all hand drawn as well as amazing music that really puts you in the zone when fighting bosses or while you are exploring the world of Valdis Story!\n\n\nPros:\n\n- Playable multiple times\n- Very fun combat system\n- Challenging boss fights\n- Multiple characters to choose from\n- Great leveling system with a unique leveling tree\n- Difficulties made to please the average player to hardcore player\n- Upgrading system\n\nCons:\n\n- Map can be frustrating for beginners who have not played the game yet\n- You will become hooked to the game and not want to leave your computer!\n\n\nMy Ratings:\n\nGraphics: 94/100\nCombat System: 91/100\nStoryline: 89:100\nMusic: 95/100\n\nOverall: 92/100\n\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone and if you have any questions, feel free to hit me up on twitch.tv/icyd3mon even if im not streaming, i'm usually in the chat channel!","November 27, 2013","true","434.4"," 345 of 390 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","345","390","0","26"

This game is tough and I'm playing it on normal.  It hearkens more to the mega man days where movement is very stop and go, and taking damage will completely destroy your momentum.   The non-combat timed puzzles are brutal and require nothing less than perfection.  I spent a lot of time repeating them over and over to get them right.\n\nCombat is pretty complex, combining light and heavy attacks, along with a block, dodge (cancel), and parry system.  It takes a bit to get used to, learning when to heavy attack to break a block, or block yourself.  There's a lot of trial and error in discovering exactly which attacks can even be blocked or which ones you should use the "Cancel" dodge.  But like the non-combat puzzles, every boss or enemy has a pattern, and this is one of those games that gives you warm fuzzies when you finally get the pattern and beat the boss after the tenth time.  Until you figure it out, expect frustration and what will feel like cheap hits.  Also, it keeps things fresh when you backtrack through previous areas because the enemies level with you and gain new abilities to attack you with as your progress through the game.\n\nAlong with that is a fairly deep magic system and your customization through both stat increases and a talent tree, that definitely changes the way you play your character in many places.\n\nThe graphics have a nice retro sprite feel, without reverting to the overdone 8-Bit style so prevalent, lately, falling somewhere between the quality of the PS1 and PS2.  The soundtrack is superb, combining a lot of retro synth, metal guitars, and symphonic instruments and spans something like four hours.\n\nThis is one of those games that will challenge you, but reward you when you succeed and I'm really digging it.  It really does feel more like the toughness of the original Super Metroid or Symphony of the Night to me than most games in the genre have presented lately.  And I'm just playing it on the easiest of four modes... O_O","November 2, 2013","true","18.8"," 99 of 114 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","99","114","0","0"

This has been my best purchase to date on steam and i dont say that lightly. i feel there is a real art to the fighting system in which sometimes through my frantic button bashing at times i hear in my head a little voice telling me "what you just did there, was AWESOME". My only problem with the game is it leaves me wanting to know so much more about the lore, the history of this game as the story itself is great, but leaves me asking more questions then i got answers. Not really something major with issues but its the characters you meet along the game that look interesting and quirky that make me feel that way. im begging for a sequel or even a prequel.\nEndless fluff if you do this for me i will get a tattoo of Wyatt in honour of this!","May 5, 2015","true","77.3"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","60","65","2","1"

There is no end for the war and only a small group of outcasts, renegades and cursed ones takes the adventure to stop this madness once and for all, not knowing what awaits them in heaven, hell and in between.'\n\nThe story is more than just solid and comes up with different twists, fantastic ideas and a cast of crazy-but-interesting characters and leads the (Anti-)Hero(es) through a lot of different environments and areas. Exploring is truly satisfying as the player can explore a huge map with lots of dead ends, hidden items, forgotten treasures and several optional bosses and areas to stumble upon.\n\nThe positive aspects go on with an exquisite design with a love for details, a great soundtrack and a surprisingly deep fighting system that allows the player to create some really badass battles. The level of difficulty is definitely quite high and even in 'Easy Mode' you will die a lot at first. Though as you progress you can see how you get stronger and better, creating long and devastating combos to annihilate hundreds of enemies in no time.\n\nThere are four different characters with slight changes in the story and unique weapons, skills and attacks available, an additional 'Arena Mode', the insane 'Goibniu Mode' for the mad players and a deep character system with skill trees and lots of equipment options, weapons and spells. Your first run will need approximately 8 up to 10 hours but all the different characters, hidden secrets, the difficulty levels, a ranking system, the leaderboards as well as some quite hard achievements can keep the fun up for a long time. Especially as there are several viable builds per character, e.g. a „Minion & Dark Magic“ Vladyn or a „Shot’em up“ version with focus on his Shotgun and Agility, or how about a „100 Demon Arm (Melee)“ build? Fight the enemies the way you prefer it.\n__________________________________________\n\nCons\nCertainly there is also some shadow among all this light, but from my point of view all the negative points can be listed quite shortly: the variety of enemies could have been bigger, the difficulty changes sometimes to a quite frustrating level and some platforming passages are annoyingly difficult and require perfect timing – but all this is complaining on a level that most games I’ve played have never achieved.\n__________________________________________\n\nConclusion\nFrom my point of view this game is a hidden gem that really shines brightly among so many average titles as it showed me how wrong several of the prejudices for Indie games (e.g. lack of polishing, mediocre gameplay elements, missing updates and abandonment from the devs…) can be: Some superb Metroidvania-mechanics with lots of areas and content get combined with an 'Easy to learn but hard to Master‘-fighting system, deep RPG elements and an interesting story with likeable characters. This is a fantastic overall package that entertained me for more than 60 hours, but there is still enough stuff left to do for several more runs in the future.\n\nDefinitely at least an 8.5 out of 10 - and in regard to the fact that all of this was created by only two persons and it brings honor to a genre long forgotten by the huge publishers I’ll happily add another bonus point (…Yes, I absolutely love this game!) and recommend it for everyone who likes some good 2D-Action-RPG full of fighting and exploring – just like in the good old times with lots of Metroidvanias.","October 18, 2015","true","72.9"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","64","71","2","6"

This is an incredible Metroidvania (one of the bests I've ever played) with a very deep and complex combat system that should not disappoint any old-school gamer nor new challenge-seekers.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nAnd now that I've played this game so much to the point that I literally know the whole map, enemies, items and secrets by heart, I can review it properly.\n\nThis is one of those games that reminds you and the gaming industry that games used to be mercyless as hell, right at the beginning. You want a tutorial? Test what you've learnt with a godlike boss!\n\nValdis Story: Abyssal City is a pure Metroidvania game, with the most remarkable features of the genre: 2D exploration platformer; RPG elements based on stats, skill tree, weapons, armors, accs, etc.; tons of bosses; materials to upgrading and crafting; the classic square-like zone map; tons of bosses. This game was built with one goal in purpose: create an RPG platformer with a complex battle and combat system. But did it succeed?\n\nBefore focusing on pros and cons, let me just summarise the main story: The game is placed in a world where both Gods of Darkness and Light (which happen to be sisters) are in war, sending never-ending troups of angels/demons. As usual, the ones suffering the colateral damage are humans, and some people are just against this whole mess and purpose to kill both Goddesses. You take hand of one of those tripulations who suddenly gets attacked by some giant monsters. Your ship sinks and you end up in the lost city of Sitheil, a civilization underwater protected by a mysterious mana barrier.\n\nAnd that's all until you start playing it. Now the important stuff:\n\nCOMBAT SYSTEM - 9.5/10\nSince this is the most important fact about the game, I'm starting with it. The combat system is basically INCREDIBLE. There's so much to learn with every character and you can effectively play with lots of different playstyles and strategies. A very interesting thing is that some bosses are way easier to deal with if you use an specific strategy, even if it's one you're not used to.\n\nThere are 4 characters in this game. Two of them are more melee/close range based, while the other 2 are ranged. Nevertheless all characters have different weapons that allow you to play on any style so the amount of possibilities are huge.\n\nThe damage and combo system are surprisingly complex, to the point that you might even need to read guides in order to fully understand how it works. Once you do, and if you plan yourself properly, you'll end up by dealing with breaking strategies. When that happens, trust me, the feeling is AWESOME, like "hell yeah, I nailed it".\n\nThe main stats are the typical Strength, Agility, Intelligence and Luck, but those take care of other deeper stats that might make you consider how you're gonna play.\n\nThe Skill Trees look limited at a first glance (3 skill trees), but don't get fooled. How you place your points can be crucial and some of the later skills, if used properly, are totally breakers. Expect to find all the important stuff like dodging, parrying, guardbreaking, spellbreaking, and so on.\n\nThe combat mechanics... I can see a lot of work progamming it. All those features I pointed out in the previous paragraphs could only conclude in an almost perfect feeling of a true fight even against the weakest foe.\n\nSOUNDTRACK - 8.5/10\nThe sountrack is amazing as well. You'll get in love with it very quickly. A music combining epic/symphonic with some metal guitar sound will keep you estimulated for the big amount of hours you will be playing this game. Expect a lot of internal hype with boss themes.\n\nLENGTH - 8.5/10\nFor a Metroidvania, the game is surprisingly long. It might take you about 15h to beat the game for the first time (if you spend some time exploring of course). The map is pretty big (specially now after the free update) and there's many stuff to uncover and secrets to find, even in places where you firstly thought you fully explored. You will be facing over 20 bosses that will keep you stressed and held until you master their patterns. Also, you need to beat the game several times in order to unlock everything so if you are a completionist you will be putting over 50h into this game for sure.\n\nART - 8/10\nI totally love the concept art of the game and it also looks pretty decent in the game itself. The menus and the text look kind weird though.\n\nDIFFICULTY - 9/10\nI'll spend some time explaining this:\n\nThis game is pretty brutal and mercyless. Even on Normal difficulty if you're not very used to these games you might struggle with enemies and specially bosses. Not to mention that the game has Normal Difficulty, Hard, Veteran, God Slayer, Goibniu Mode (God Slayer with 1 life + no saves + time limit).\n\nBut... is the difficulty artificial?\n\nHELL NO.\n\nThis game was crafted to be played on God Slayer difficulty. Every other difficulty is just a weakened version of this, not the opposite. If you wanna fully experience Valdis Story, you better play this game on the hardest settings, and you might not regret it. PLEASE keep that in mind: this game was meant to be hard and it succeeds on what it's aiming. So don't start yelling "huehuehue this is so hard huehuehue" because yes, you're right! You've just entered Valdis Story! Will you keep it and try to beat the challenge or will you give up like a scrub?\n\nBy this time I've already stated that the combat system is amazing. Well, remember that enemies can also fight so be ready to face some very skillful enemies, able to do amazing and long combos to your butt. Unless you flawlessly learn how to deal with them, you're gonna die. A lot.\n\nAnd of course, the major feature: BOSSES. Bosses in this game are extremely lethal and varied. You will fight them over and over and over and over until you basically reach a point you can predict every single move they make. Doesn't that remember you the kind of stuff we usually do on fighting games?\n\nACHIEVEMENTS - 9/10\nMost of the achievements are made for the hardcore and uber-hardcore audience and that's something I always appreciate since achievements should be ACHIEVEMENTS in my opinion. And yes, there's an achievement for beating the game in Goibniu Mode. Good luck!\n\nHowever, I cannot put a 10/10 in this section since completing this game involves A LOT of playthroughs. Be ready, completionist, as you will have to beat this game like 8-9 times without counting failed runs, with different styles and purposes. I think that was unnecessary.\n\nOVERALL - 9.25/10\nI've always been bad in Metroidvanias and it's a genre that despite enjoying, I get easily frustrated and therefore I usually avoid. But Valdis Story completely changed that and gave me some hope to both myself and the industry. This game is simply amazing and resulted into an incredible experience to me as a gamer. It was so addictive once I started it I couldn't let it go until I did everything. I will remember this title for a long time and it's definately gonna be one of my first references when recommending a Metroidvania game.","November 5, 2015","true","74.8"," 72 of 84 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","72","84","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmsnake/recommended/252030/","mmsnake","pH. mmSNAKE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mmsnake/","296 products in account","To me Castlevania: Symphony of the Night rates as #2 greatest game of all time, bested only by Unreal Tournament 2004. It started the entire metroidvania subgenre and made a rather large impact on many people, including me. This game is made by someone who no doubt shares great love of SotN and metroidvania in general. If you are one of those fans you don't need to read any further, this is as good as it gets, the finest metroidvania I played since SotN.\n\nFor those not familiar, this game is set in a large two dimensional world where to progress to new areas you need to acquire keys and abilities (metroid style), but at the same time you procure new equipment, level up and specialize. The biggest strength of this game lies in it's combat system. This is a perfect mix of min max stat gameplay with skill based reactive 2d brawler. What this means is that you will have to take great care of how you invest your stat points, skill points what you upgrade, what you use and most importantly how well you understand and play the game. The combat system is simple at overlook: light attack, heavy attack, block, cancel dash and magic, but undrneeth there is a whole deep level that will make fans of stylish action games rejoice. There are lifters, slams, blocks, parries, force blocks, secret techniques, stealth, backstabs, criticals, magic oriented attacks, stuns,assists, crazy combos etc etc. In all honesty this game is rather overwhelming how much there is to the actual combat. To someone who invested time it's second nature but the sheer amount taken into consideration when creating a build for your character far exceeds what I ever thought a game like this would offer.\n\nCurrently there are two characters (there will be two more with a forthcoming free update). Each character has their own three skill trees to spend points on. Each character has different weapons to use and completely different playstyles. There are four main stats (strength, agility, inteligence and luck), you get to put a point in this as well as picking a skill when leveling up. It opens up a tremendous amount of specialization and replaybility for each character. Upgrading gear needs to be done wisely because the materials needed are finite, and for certain item types you will only be able to upgrade one item to maximum (weapon for example). Choose wisely which weapon, armor or spell you upgrade.  Speaking of gear, everything is a sidegrade. There are no upgrades in this game, each piece of armor, accessory or even weapon is suited for a specific build or playstyle. Each armor has special properties and unique benefit. This alone expands the amount of possible play styles and builds significantly.\n\nThe game's combat challange is done correctly. The more I play the better I am. I started and i would get thrashed by every boss I'd encounter, barely able to finish it. Now I'll get an S rank on every boss encounter(tip, better rank on bosses gives permenant stat increases). It feels like Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, where the game teaches you the hard way to play well. On the other hand the platforming portion of the game is not so ideal. If I had any setbacks for this game it's that platforming does not work as well as combat does. Sure after some time it becomes trivial because you get used to it, but at first the platforming will be a chore, mostly because the way movement works. It's difficult to pinpoint your character, don't expect perfect pixel platformer controls like in Mega Man. Though after time it goes away and you learn it like it happened with the combat. A very minor setback to overall fantastic experience otherwise.\n\nSo yes, I absolutely endorse this title. For the amount of replaybility and content this game offers, along with free future updates to come this game is an absolute steal even for it's full price. For you metroidvania fans, I swear you will get that feeling that SotN had you as you explored, grinded and fought in Dracula's castle. Just an absolute blast of a game.","December 29, 2013","true","157.2"," 90 of 113 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","90","113","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thePoark/recommended/252030/","thePoark","thePoark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thePoark/","831 products in account","The game says I'm at around the ~60% completion mark at about 6 hours in; I feel I've had enough exposure to at least make a Yes/No recommendation.  While there are certainly some frustrating elements of the design (which I'll list out below), I couldn't help but feel compelled to keep playing, albeit it after a little break.  All-in-all, to draw a topical analogy, I keep thinking of the game as "Dark Souls-vania"; feels like a Metroidvania style game, with difficult (but often fair) enemies, and often unexplained elements.\n\nPersonal Cons List (with objective commentary):\n-- Not much indication of where to go.  This often lead to retreading the same areas over again hoping to find the little thing I missed the first couple of times (to advance the story/progression), etc.\n-- -- The map seems arbitrarily color-coded (though I imagine there's some logic to it, that's not explained in any way that I noticed in the game).\n-- -- The very brief "objective" listed on the on-screen minimap has no context, and there is often no way to have NPCs, who just explained some cryptic event you need to particpate in to advance, repeat themselves of that key information.\n\n-- Stumbled into some seemingly impossible boss fights that I'd later discover were optional (and had to load my game out of to "recover").\n\n-- Encountered a brutally difficult "escape" sequence in the game that was on a timer -- it was so easy to fall/be blocked into a pit that could be rendered inescapable, that I'd either have to let myself get killed, or wait for the 80-second timer to countdown before I could retry again -- this took me several (probably 6?) attempts before I made it through.  Was extremely frustrating.\n-- -- I see what the designer was going for, but being pushed into a pit with no way out, forced to suicide/wait felt like poor design.  At the same time, I could've very well gotten lucky on my first attempt, and never thought anything of it... but I just got stuck in one of those ruts where I kept failing over and over again, and it took a lot out of me.\n\n-- There's a little climbing animation whenever you grab the ledge of a platform/wall, which feels a little lengthy.  The locked animation frames remove your control for a period of time that can sometimes be frustrating when you're trying to navigate the environments over and over again, especially when there are enemies in "strategic" places that seem positioned ONLY to knock you off of them -- frequently.\n\n-- I'm personally having a hard time following the story.  It's all dialogue-driven, so keeping track of all of the various odd-sounding names and places can feel a little overwhelming sometimes.  There are times when events or dialogue feels so abstract that I can't tell if I just encountered a random secondary scene, or if the main story is progressing.\n\n-- The menus / interface feel a little clunky, but are servicable.\n-- -- The focus meter has nice little light particle effects that shower into the screen -- this is sometimes distracting, as I think something is happening in the world, then realize it's just the interface.  Distracts me more often than I would expect...\n\nPersonal Pros List (with objective commentary):\n-- I find the combat to be fun, deep, and reasonably responsive (in terms of controls).  There are definitely some engaging combat systems in the game -- which, after several hours, I finally feel like I have some control over.\n-- -- There are some cases of personal frustration when I get locked into a juggle or a damage loop where I lose control, but invoking my "skill cancel" ability often seems to get me out of it -- not always, but it helps.  There were a number of times where I got stuck in a damage / locked animation loop only to die because I couldn't regain control.\n\n-- Seems to be good potential for replayability with the multiple characters and, from what I've seen, nuanced differences in the story for each.  I started a second game, and played the monk character for about 60 minutes, which did immediately feel different in combat, and seemed to have a good number of unique spells available as well.\n\n-- There are some interesting exploration / backtracking mechanics (in the vain of a Metroidvania game).  Even though I do end up having to sometimes arbitrarily explore while trying to happen upon the next objective/event, there do seem to be enough games that I found myself discovering something previously blocked often enough that my interest doesn't wane too quickly.\n\n-- The spell system is interesting, though a bit cumbersome when it comes to changing stuff.  You can hold RT+B to get access to a paused "quick menu" for adjusting spells, which is useful, but you do end up having to scroll through up to 6 spells in each of four categories to change things around -- can feel a little jarring, especially when some of those spells really don't get used often (if they have a specific utility, etc.).  However, the variety and functionality in spells is cool and interesting -- I do find myself mixing it up fairly often to make good use of all those tools, so having to switch this way, while annoying at times, is usually worthwhile.  However, getting stuck repeating a boss fight until you learn the patterns means having to adjust to the desired combination of spells each time you start anew.\n\nAnyway, I think that's about it.  I do plan on continuing and hopefully finishing this game.  I wouldn't call myself talented at games, though I've been playing for a long time, so I would say I'm skilled.  In most games, I tend to pick one difficulty higher than "Normal", which is about where I usually feel comfortable -- right amount of challenge, etc.  This game I'm playing on Normal, and I find it brutally difficult in places.  There are bosses I've had to try a half-dozen times before getting the patterns and puzzle figured out to win, but it did feel fairly satisfying (and relieving) to do so.  Those are the moments when the game felt so akin to Dark Souls.  :)","April 28, 2014","true","8.3"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","6"

There are so many different styles of play: rush in like a barbarian, use melee attacks, take time to plan things out, use magic, attack from a distance, run away in fear, or any combination of those.  The gameplay is so well made and the design so spot-on that there was never a dull moment.  There's quite a lot of optional paths and bosses too.  I really like how whether or not you defeat certain optional bosses determines what happens later in the game.  Some of them change the story, some change the ending, and some even change how future bosses act.  Plus the bosses were all unique and unbelieveably intense.\nIt's a really pretty game, too.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the music.\nOoooh god, the music.  It's so good.  I legitimately feel that this game has my favorite soundtrack of any game I've ever played.  Zack Parish is now my God.  I've never bought a video game soundtrack before, but I HAVE to buy this one.\n\nI did notice that if there was more than one or two lasers on-screen at once, and during the final boss, I would experience framerate issues, but I also had a recording software running, and I'm sure everything would've been smooth if I hadn't been recording.  In the end, I turned down the graphical settings for the final boss (which is a super intense experience and takes a little while to beat) and everything was fine.  I have a really hard time saying that this is any fault of the game, but I wouldn't know.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I did play through this game on YouTube (youtube.com/Frozelar), if you'd like to see some more gameplay before buying it.  I really hate to self-advertise but maybe it'll give people a better idea of just how great the game is before they buy it.\nEasily my favorite Let's Play of all time.  Looking forward to playing through it again.  And possibly again and again and again.","November 1, 2014","true","107.6"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","1"

Monsters, bosses, weapons, party members, stores, collectibles and TIGHT combat controls. Obviously, since games are hard to make (let along by yourself) that never happened. But I would happen across Valdis Story, which I think is the closest I've ever seen a game be to my "dream game." Side scrolling action platforming at its finest since Symphony of the Night! If you liked SoTN or any of the other Metroidvania games (including Metroid itself) you will highly enjoy this game just like I did. Fun bosses, high skill cap and rewards the skilled with bonouses from bosses encouraging you to learn the bosses' patterns and improve yourself.  After you beat the game your first time, why not play again? On a harder difficulty? And its not just the numbers that get harder with the difficulties either, some bosses mechanically change in terms of how they are fought (albiet minorly, but still) and the best part is, THIS GAME ISNT EVEN DONE YET. There is more to come! It's good enough as it is, but knowing that there are other characters and items and possibly bosses planned in future updates just makes me rock hard. GG EndlessFluff. You did good.\n\nVLADYN AND GILDA PATCH UPDATE:\n\nThe final two characters have been added and a total of 4 new bosses with some new and remixed areas make the game still pretty fresh for those of use that have played it a bunch until this point. The game supports 16 different saves now to compensate for the new characters allowing you to essentially have 4 saves for each characters if you want.\n\nVladyn is SUPER FUN to play, he is now my favourite character taking the place of Reina. He is the only primary ranged character is the game and it makes everything so different and fresh. Gilda is really complex but can be VERY rewarding if you play her correctly. Many bosses are weak to a certain element and all of Gilda's attacks utilize each of the elements in a substantial way meaning you can really exploit bosses weaknesses if you play it right. For example, Magus takes MAD damage from poison, up to and probably beyond 250 PER TICK, which is a LOT of damage believe me. She also starts out with a double jump when everyone else needs to wait a while until they get access to it allowing her to grab some items and equipment early.\n\nThe new bosses are all very challenging and interesting and the new areas have interesting mechanics as well that I felt added to the challenge in a good way rather than being cheap.\n\nAll in all, this update added a LOT of great stuff and I am still VERY happy with my purchase.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/252030/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","I backed Valdis Story on Kickstarter because it looked like the kind of game I'd want to play: a side-scrolling action RPG. The truth is that it's really closer to a Metroidvania platformer with some RPG elements. Despite its short length I had it installed for a year and a half before I got around to beating it. I just wasn't that motivated to ever play it, for reasons I'll go into.\n\nIt is fundamentally a good game though. The soundtrack is amazing, the animations are smooth (though there was considerable slow down when there was a lot of stuff on the screen), and the special effects are much better than you'd expect from an indie crew with hardly any experience. The story leaves something to be desired, but it picks up later on and it's not bad, just lacking in emotion. It does make up for that in epicness and scale though.\n\nThe single biggest problem is the controls. Playing on a keyboard my hands would start cramping after just a few minutes of play. If the game were slower-paced I'd say that switching the right hand to mouse controls might be better, but it's too much of a twitch experience for that. And that's the crux of the issue: there's some very tight jumps and timings that have to be made and given that the controls can be glitchy and are just generally a pain to use, the puzzles and fights that depend on those split-second key presses should really have been a lot more forgiving.\n\nThe combat itself isn't too hard, especially if you bother to level up at all. When I could forget the pain of the controls it was genuinely fun if I wasn't in the middle of a frustrating boss fight. The game also follows the usual steps of getting easier as it progresses because you have access to more skills and spells and equipment. So the most rage-inducing moments are generally early on.\n\nThere's a crafting aspect I didn't get into, but you don't really need to. It seems sort of superfluous and confusing.\n\nThe other major issue is just finding the next objective. There is a fast travel system, but it doesn't go to nearly enough places. And when your destination is just a name that doesn't appear on a map anywhere it can take a long time to find where you're supposed to go. Some sort of objective pointer or even a global map would've helped me a ton (there is only a very small local map without any names on it). As it is, the bulk of my play time was probably spent wandering around trying to figure out where to go next.\n\nSo if you want an action platformer with RPG elements that depends on twitch skills, I'd highly recommend Valdis Story. It's the best you're going to see in that genre from an indie team. But for the sake of your hands and sanity, bring a controller instead of relying on the keyboard.","March 17, 2015","true","13.2"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","36","45","4","2"

They each have their own different skills and attacks that they use.\n\nThe game uses a simple spell casting system where you just hold a button and press a certain direction and it casts the spell you have binded onto it. Aside from the spells, the game enables you to use dashes, varying comboes between weak and strong attacks, wall jumps and more!\n\nEach character has their own unique skill tree that you can use to enhance the characters performance. eg, Increase attack damage by 5%. It follows the basic RPG skill tree (Attack, Defense, Magic).\n\nThe boss fights in this game are my favourite out of all the platformers and RPGs. Each boss you encounter have different attacks and each have their own special moves. Not only are they challenging, they are also EXTREMELY fun to fight! You won't simply beat a boss with just luck! They also look really cool :3\n\nThe game's graphics and music are just straight up AMAZING! The anime-like art style really does pull a lot of audience in, and I am not suprised. The devs really know what people like!\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 9.5/10 for all of the reasons I have mentioned above. The only thing I find that this game is lacking the Quest log or Objective menu. When you speak to an NPC and you take a quest, at some points I found it frustrating because I could not find the desired place I needed to go, simply because I had no clue where it was. That being said, I am sure the devs will add this in the future since they seem to be updating the game very often.","April 18, 2015","true","5.8"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

And this impression only got confirmed later on.\n\nThe Art in this game is beautifull, the drawings have their own style, the backgrounds are detailed, and the music is one of the best I've ever heard in a video game, and all this gives to Valdis Story a very solid identity, that of an epic tale of a war between gods and mortals, of a fantasy world with a grim and not-so-simple story.\n\nWhat about the controls? Yes, they're tight, precision in your inputs is needed, be it for the fights or the platforming sections of the game. The game has a special feel to it, and you'll need to get used to it and understand why it behaves that way if you want to succeed. Mashing buttons will get you killed, as ennemies can block, dash, and combo you, and they only improve in the higher difficulties.\n\nThat being said, with RPG-elements, you character can gain up to 20 levels, unlock weapons, armors and accessories with huge effects on the gameplay (one more dash, or more magic power, etc, etc), a wide array of tools that can be combined in powerfull builds, capable of maching even the most difficult optional bosses the game throws at you.\n\nAnd those Bosses are hard at first, you'll have to be patient, learn their patterns, in order to beat them, or even better, get the maximum rank as you fight them. Because yes, your performance will be evaluated, with noticable rewards coming with the highest ranks.\n\nWith the latest big update being released the 4th of may 2015, the content is huge. 5 difficulty modes, 4 characters with their own playstyle, each one of them having even more sub-playstyles depending on your equipement, and drastic choices to make in your progression, as you cannot upgrade every item to max level in one playthrough. There are also a few secret events and ennemies that will keep you on your toes if you want to find them by yourself.\n\nHaving played and followed that game since launch, I'm also impressed by the work of the devs, and the tweaks they've made, listening to both positive and negative feedback to always improve their game again and again. Not only bug fixes, but also tweaking some encounters, some rooms, some controls, adding the possibility to rebind your keys for exemple, and many many else that you won't even notice, all that while still staying true to their core design choices.\n\nNo game is perfect. But for me, Valdis Story : Abyssal City is darn close. I recommend it, purely and simply.","May 10, 2015","true","435.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The player is frequently required to traverse gauntlets of environmental hazards, narrow moving platforms, crumbling footholds, relentless attacking enemies, and strictly-timed doors in order to progress and/or obtain certain items, all without committing a SINGLE mistake or mistimed action, otherwise it's back to square one all over again.\n\nThe design of these segments often requires several repetitions to pass (on the order of dozens, in some cases), and more often than not saps all forward momentum from the experience.  I'm all for a good platforming challenge, but one that takes 15-30 solid minutes to complete through arduous trial-and-error seems woefully misplaced in what is otherwise a stellar, fast-paced adventure game.\n\nNot to mention the rewards for completing these platforming challenges don't seem to adequately compensate the effort involved in obtaining them (either it's a rare material that can be found elsewhere as an enemy drop, or it's an armor item that I most likely won't wear, because the one I already have fits my playstyle just fine).\n\nI really want to be able to recommend this game; the love and attention to detail invested in it are plainly evident.  But the frustration bred by all the awful timed platforming bits totally disrupts this game's rhythm, and if you're anything like me, you'll soon find yourself avoiding the game to save yourself the headache.","January 9, 2014","false","26.0"," 69 of 115 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","69","115","3","0"

I did like it enough to finish, but there's almost equal parts really fun verses stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I would probably recommend it to metroidvania fans who've played most other stuff in the genre, or people who like fighting games, but maybe not most casual fans just yet.\n\nIt does a few things well: Most combat is executed well and is more challenging than most games in the genre. The stage design and art is nice, and the music is pretty great. Combat feels much more satisfying than stuff like Dust: An Elysian Tale  or Castlevania: SoTN most of the time, because it's pretty precise in how it makes you block, dodge and parry, and it feels more like a 2d character action game in that regard.\n\nBut where it missed the mark for me it was almost enough to quit it before the end.  The first thing you need to know to enjoy this game is that the "cancel" skill is absolutely critical. Everything in this game hits you with irritating status effects like freezing you, poisoning , and most annoyingly, enemies often juggle you into the air constantly, and even the most slight of grazes inflict a really annoying knockback. To some people that will be part of the charm, but I got sick of that ♥♥♥♥ back when 8-bit was still all the rage. I had cases where I was juggled like a ping pong ball across the screen, and inflicted with every status under the sun in the process. This was usually combined with precision platforming of some sort. I hate losing control of my character like that, and it is one of my personal nerdrage triggers. There's no invincibility frame after you get hit, so you just keep getting juggled until you use the all-important cancel skill. Learn it early and use it often. Also, remap it because for 3/4 of the game I had it on the default "down" and this made it pretty hard to play.\n\nThe other thing I hate is that I don't feel like the diablo2 style skill trees were done well. They locked really basic abilities like parrying behind skill points, so if you decided to go up the offense tree or magic verses defensive, you missed out on that ability. I just kind of feel like that's something I should have from the start rather than having to spend multiple level-ups in a specific tree to get.\n\nControls is the final gripe I have. I feel like I usually master controls in games pretty fast, but I was fighting with them the entire game. Switching magic was super cumbersome, and you had to stop and change basic moves like double jump or ice pillar in a menu to access new areas, then switch back to your preferred spells when you're done and then probably 20 seconds later you run into a situation where you need to use a mobility spell again. equipping and unequipping items on the fly was also pretty terrible. During the last boss fight I had an item that drained life but did high damage on the boss, but it was filled with lots of mooks I had to kill, so I had to constantly go into the menu and equip/unequip things, and they somehow even made that a chore, since I had to navigate across the equip menu every time to remove an item. Ledge controls are a whole 'nother can of worms that people need to really practice, because they're counter-intuitive, but pretty precise.\n\nSo: The good is that it's a cool, challenging metroidvania with passable aesthetics. The bad is that there is some seriously annoying ♥♥♥♥ that may or may not bother you depending on your tolerances for platforming and the controls and menus. I think it's worth a shot if you like metroidvanias. If you don't, I would maybe play something more accessible, first.","January 14, 2014","true","13.2"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

This feels like a game I'd make if I knew how to do so. Even after completing the game I just wanna play more. Those who enjoy a challenge and different ways to play will enjoy it.\n\nThis game has one of my favorite things in games today, that being a timed dodge and parry mechanic. It always feels so satisfying to know you timed your block just right and counterattack. Games like Batman Arkham series, Guacamelee, and somewhat Dark Souls come to mind in terms of timed presses.\n\nFew problems with the game though. Feel the biggest is the boss reward Rank system. Part of me likes that but another part is like, way to stress me out to try and do a near flawless fight. The rewards tend to be stats and if you get the best rank, you get the best stat reward. So for those who are like me and get kinda OCD when it comes to wanting best possible stats, items, outcome and so forth... that may hinder some enjoyment. What makes it worse is that there is this hat you get later in game to DOUBLE those rewards. Seems cool, right? Well there is a chance it will break upon being hit so... not only do you have to worry about reaching the boss without it breaking but now you have to hope it doesn't break during the boss either. Could be having a good S rank boss fight but then see it break... constant restarting more than usual. It would be better if the Hats were timed.\n\nI guess that is the issue I have most with the game. To a minor extent, needed better puzzles and work on the platforming a bit. Can't obtain every piece of gear and for those who like to collect everything on a single file might find that a bother. Though that is just another OCD factor, but don't bother me as much as the stats. And the map needed better indication and be able to see the whole world... but not too big a problem, though I did get lost a good while my first play.\n\nOverall this game is fun and satisfying. I suppose that rank mechanic forces you to get better at fights even if it can get crazy at times with too much things flying about on screen to keep up with. Those who enjoy the explore, upgrades to explore more, rpg elements and fun combo combat... then this is for you.\n\nI feel this genre of games are pretty rare since forever ago, to why referred to as Metroid-likes because they were the only ones back then until Castlevania did the same. So you are missing out by not playing.\n\nEdit: This game actually taught me to get better. I still think the Boss Reward Rank system is bogus but it also pushed me to improve. I play on God Slayer difficulty just fine now, something I thought impossible. Then I went ahead and got all achievements, something I thought I would never do after my 1st playthrough and saw some crazy ones.","March 13","true","196.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Valdis Story has outstanding balance between tight platforming and fast-paced combat, but also contains RPG and adventure game elements. As you explore the game's underwater city you can slowly shape your character according to your play style with attributes, skills, spells, items and various other upgrades. All the while you're fighting all sorts of creatures and of course many different challenging bosses with their own unique mechanics.\n\nThe most notable thing about Valdis Story is its immense replayability factor. Each character has unique skills and items they can use, as well as a different slant on the overarching storyline. On top of that they can be build in many different ways, there are many hidden items and bosses, and there are four difficulty settings. The lowest difficulty setting, Normal, can already be a severe challenge to anyone unused to metroidvania-style platformers. So there's a lot to see and do in this game, even after the initial playthrough.\n\nSee my video review above for more details and of course footage of the game in action.\n\n\nRecommendation\nIf you're looking for a good metroidvania-style platformer then Valdis Story: Abyssal City is your game. It's made for fans of the genre with some (recent) experience and approaches difficulty similar to Dark Souls by letting you figure things out yourself. If you have less experience with games in this genre: prepare for a challenge, but a healthy one that'll ultimately be worth it. Valdis Story is also among the most free-form and replayable games I've seen in years, so it can keep you entertained for a long time to come.\n\nTechnical Droning\n60FPS - Yes\n120Hz - No\nFullscreen - Yes\nBorderless Window - No\nGraphics Options - Minimal\nTexture Quality - Okay\nKey Rebinding - Yes, but no gamepad sensitivity settings\n\n\n---\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","July 20, 2015","true","26.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

A GOOD one, with a d-pad that isn't circular.\n\nThis game is, in a nutshell, a post Igarashi-era Castlevania. It's a very beautiful game, both graphically and musically, with soothing piano scores. In many regards, it's a well done game. But there's just so much I have to nitpick.\n\nValdis Story tells the story of a young man fighting the likes of angels and demons. His ship is destroyed and he sets out to rescue his homies. I actually liked the setting and story elements, I just wish there was more of it. There wasn't really enough dialogue to develop any characters.\n\nThe boss battles are intense and in many cases, gimmicky. These were great. Though if you completely lacked certain things, like spell upgrades, some bosses were perhaps way too hard.\n\nHere are some features I would have liked to see or change.\n-The inability to duck is baffling, and my number one complaint. Hitting down is defaulted to slide/cancel. While you can unbind this, on more than one occasion I find myself unintentionally moving forward while "crouching forward" because I expect the ability to duck to halt horizontal movement.\n-There are a few leaps of faith in the game, where you cannot guess where you will land with no way to get back up the same way. Some means to see a little further ahead would help.\n-Having attacks lunge my character forward tends to make me move all over the place, which is problematic on certain bosses that I try to fight near ledges.\n-The prevalence of near-perfect timed jumps is overkill. A few jump puzzles are great, but not every area needs one, let alone two.\n-The lack of a unified world map makes navigation surprisingly difficult, despite the fantastic mini-map. Even after beating it twice, I still don't really have a feel for the layout.\n-Related to the above, backtracking is somewhat high because it's difficult to tell where to go.\n-Bouncing back when hit is fine, but the extremely short invulnerability period makes this problem outstanding. The repeated loss of control is aggravating.\n-Status afflictions such as stun last a long time, considering this is a solo real-time adventure.\n-Normal difficulty is still too punishing. Yeah it's doable, but it's not nice at all to new players to the genre. An easier difficulty would be a welcome addition.\n-A high-speed movement ability would be nice for end-game exploration, given the large amount of backtracking.\n-Inability to block heavy attacks by default seems counter-intuitive. It's not like players automatically know what a heavy attack looks like.\n-A curious amount of grinding is required for a completionist type player who wants every item upgraded. By the end of the game I had very few things upgraded.\n-The library, which seems like it'd be the perfect hub to hang out and reach other areas, is oddly out-of-the-way of just about everything.\n-Certain crew members are almost too important to miss out on, such as every upgrader. These characters should instead be unable to be missed.\n-Boss battles are completely unannounced. If you walked into that next room with next to no health and a far away save point, good luck beating it.\n-Also there's no quick option to restart bosses. You must resort to suicide or returning to the menu.\n\nValdis Story is a very commendable game to be accomplished with such a small team. It looks great, it sounds great, it plays okayish. In the end, all i'm really asking for is a more forgiving easy diffulty. There's a pretty good amount of replay value, with several unlockable characters who play quite differently, but I couldn't bring myself to sit through the game one more time. I feel this game deserves a 7.5. Thanks chicago!\n\nEDIT: Fixed the cards/cloud info.","August 24, 2015","true","22.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

Timed platforming puzzles require extreme precision and perfect execution with mechanics such as dash cancel, jump, walljump and platform hanging which are very unreliable, to not say random. You have to fight enemies on tiny platforms but you make a huge step forward every time you swing your sword. Every time an enemy coughs in your general direction, you're stunned for an absurd amount of time, so if there are several enemies (or worse, a flamethrower) any hit will lead to a stunlock, then death.\n\nYou can block a boss' special attack from front four times in a row, but the fifth time it might count as if you were hit from behind (which means extra damage and stun, thus death) because the hitboxes are glitchy. Speaking of hitboxes, sometimes you jump over a projectile and still get hit because hitboxes are much bigger than the visuals. I could go on, there are dozens of nitpicks that make the game feel really unpolished. You can't expect perfection from players if your game doesn't respond perfectly itself.\n\nAmong other problems, the map doesn't show any useful information (doors, treasures, shops, save points...) so navigating is really tedious, a major flaw for a Metroidvania game. The skills seem unbalanced, I had a lot of trouble with bosses until I unlocked perfect guard, then they became really easy (but still very long ; a boss took me over 20 minutes because of his ridiculous HP bar and teleport spam).\n\nOn a positive note, the art (sprites and music) are really nice. Way too many recolors though, there are only about 10-15 different enemies that you will see in every dungeon in a different color.","January 2, 2014","false","5.4"," 49 of 86 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","49","86","0","2"

It doesn't have quite the uniquely immersive experience that Bastion does, but the gameplay is a bit more varied and enjoyable. Though it's RPG-ish, it also has platforming and arcade-like combos and boss rankings. There are two playable characters, Wyatt and Reina, and I've found both to be lots of fun. Another two character will be patched in later. With the decent campaign length and many build options for each character, there seems to be a lot of replayability.\n\nThe story has a pretty broad cast of characters for what it is, though admittedly, outside of the main characters, they don't have much depth. Many of the characters are evidently named and designed by backers, which is a thing that concerns me about Kickstarter projects generally (backer perks bogging down the creative process), but it seems to "work" in this case. The main plotline is decent, and not quite as generic as you might think from the synopsis about a struggle between gods of light and dark. The way you fight both angels and demons also reminds me of Darksiders, while we're on the topic of specific game comparisons.\n\nThe music is awesome. I was actually surprised at how much of it there was and how creative and well-developed some of the melodies were. The art style is your typical cartoony indie game art. Both have a slight JRPG flair to them, which to me is a good thing, but YMMV.\n\nThe dialog could use a proofreader. That's another thing that reminds me of Darksiders, heh. It's the little things, like a comma where there should be a period, or no comma where there should be one, etc. And please, for the love of God, stop putting exclamatory dialog in all caps. It looks amateurish. Still, some of the dialog manages to be pretty clever, IMO. "You know, instead of giving you these books I could just punch you in the face." Maybe I'm easily amused.\n\nOverall, it's quite a fun game, so anyone thinking about picking it up should think about picking it up a little harder than they did before, because I think they should pick it up too.

While the art is wonderful and the characters are interesting, the gameplay has some very serious flaws which drag the whole experience down with increasing magnitude as the game progresses.\n\nFirstly, spell slots are used for mobility abilities - meaning you have to switch slots up to move around. These mobility powers still use MP, so during the many boss fights later, where you will never have MP (because so many bosses drain mana with many attacks) you effectively lose all of your special abilities, including critical things like double jump.\n\nSecondly, many aspects of the game,  from puzzles to boss fights, seem designed soley to be frustrating and bothersome. Timed puzzles where the slightest wrong move forces you to retry the long, boring chain of switches and jumps again and again, and enemies that have stun attacks-o-plenty.\n\nThe boss fights are at first quite easy, save that the boss fight rank system actually affects what stats your character gets - meaning that if you don't beat most bosses using nearly perfect technique (which requires lots of memorization and blind luck in later cases), your character suffers for it.\n\nThe later boss fights become absurd. One boss bombards you with a dizzying array of attacks from all angles, nearly all of which freeze or stun your character. It also drains your mana, hampers normal movement (independently of freezes and stuns), regenerates its own health and employs a mechanic that nullifies almost all character abilities that increase damage output, making many of the possible character builds useless for that encounter. There were moments during later fights where I would have been better served going to make coffee rather than waiting for the stun juggles to end so I could move again. Needless to say, if you aren't very, very well practiced with your dodges, look forward to a lot of cheap deaths.\n\nThis game was at first very appealing, and I think that it has a lot of potential, but frustrating mechanics in the late game make it hard to enjoy for all but the most hard-core platformers who really want a punishing challenge.","January 19, 2014","false","20.0"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

I've only played one of the characters you can play as, but the skill tree looks to be pretty thoughtful, and I wonder how they differ over the different options. Also, the magic system gets a big thumbs up from me: initially I thought "This seems complicated, I probably won't use it," but the game forces you to delve into it, and I'm glad that it did. It is a bit overwhelming at first, but once you get it, it becomes second nature.

It's akin to one of the later Castlevanias - open world, exploration gated by abilities/items, RPG elements in levelling and character development, you know the drill. If you want that, this is a competent one, although a little on the short side. (Some of the achievements will make this clearer - beat the game under 3 hours, complete it all without saving, etc.) Got a lot of replay value though - 2* characters, multiple difficulties, and some branching of the world based on your actions (some characters die/vanish, entire optional bosses - got replay value is what I'm saying).\n\nI want to point out, before this next part: I wholeheartedly endorse this game. I kickstarted the sucker and I enjoy the pair of titles I've played from the developers (they were also behind Tetris Attack Puzzle Quest, aka Legend of Fae). If you are even remotely interested by the description above, buy and play VS:AC. The below is a caveat I point out for honesty's sake.\n\nThis game is not finished as I write this. Not in a "it's broken and buggy" fashion or anything, no, but in a "The game itself tells you more NPCs and quests are 'Coming Soon'" way. The "2* characters" above? Yeah, very clearly two others are going to be playable, they're greyed out on the character select screen and currently no achievements reference playing as them. They also show up in various cutscenes/throughout the game. I'll try and edit this at some point if I notice this changing (hell, I'll probably replay it again when that happens!), but as of the end of 2013, you're not getting the "full" package.

The exploring in the sunken city makes you backtrack for upgrades but never feels like it forces you to do so.

If you're good enough to get an S or A rank, bosses will award extra skillpoints or stats, which will make your character that much more deadly. In contrast, if you barely squeak by a fight with a C, D, or F rank, you'll get a handful of XP, barely more then you would killing some no-name minion.\n\nEach character has 4 stats (strength, agility, intelligence, and luck) and 3 separate skill trees which you can invest in, all of which can give bonuses and unlock new abilities.\n\nIn addition to the different weapons which I've already mentioned, you can also get about a dozen different kinds of armor, all of which have different bonuses; accessories, which tend to be very powerful, but all have some kind of tradeoff; and assistants, other characters who you team up with during the game who can be called into battle to fire off an attack and often give bonuses as well.\n\nOh, and your weapons, armor, and assistants can all be leveled up, improving their stats and often giving better/bigger/more attacks.\n\nIf I had to name some negatives, one would be that trying to max out everything (which isn't needed to complete the game) takes a lot of grinding, and that some bosses (especially some of the optional ones) are exceptionally difficult (to beat - let alone get a good rank on). Minion respawning (which takes place whenever you leave a screen) can also be a pain, although it can be used to help collect more materials for upgrading and/or gain levels.\n\nIn conclusion, an extremely strong game which has seen amazing support from the developer.","May 16, 2015","true","53.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Fighting in it rewards learning enemy patterns and conscious battling and its skill tree system doesn't hold your hand on what to get but satisfies those who like to create builds. While length might feel a little short, two playable characters with different skills and weapons (with two more on the way) help hold you for your dollar's worth. Art style is great and leaves character easily recognizable though the story comes across as a tad cliche with its angels and demons angle. At times, the dialogue and backstory veers into teenagers-RPing-on-GaiaOnline levels of corniness but it ultimately doesn't choke you with it.\n\nTo sum it up, Valdis Story is definitely worth the fifteen dollars and while it might have needed a bit of reining in on the creators' parts with dialogue and story, it's really a labor of love, shown in its well built combat system, an essential in this type of genre.","December 24, 2014","true","144.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Join the club.  Valdis Story is currently easily my favorite of the PC Metroidvanias I've played in recent years.  It features excellent, tight combat mechanics that feel somewhat like Devil May Cry thanks to the mobility and attack options from the game's spell system.  The world is mostly a joy to explore and new travel skills are given at just the right pace to keep the player interested in exploring more.  Furthermore, there are two characters (with two more upcoming, but in very slow development) and some impactful storyline changes that can add a lot to the replayability of the game.\n\nOne of my main complaints about the game is the lack of enemy diversity,  It's not a huge issue, and the game does change it up by giving existing enemies new abilities as you level up, but one of my favorite things about Castlevania SOTN was that just about every zone had its unique monsters that each added to the atmosphere of the zone.  In this game, it just feels like you're fighting those angelic monk dudes all the time except in different places.  Also, the game has a number of difficult platforming sections which can be very frustrating to some players.

The art design and music is beautiful, the controls are great, and the environments are incredible. Unfortunately I can't recommend it because it just isn't a satisfying game. The combat system is fun but the enemies feel cheap. I'm used to hard as balls Castlevania games but I've never raged as hard as at this game.\n\nTo start, while the combos are fun to pull off it feels pointless when enemies can just disregard them if they need to. There's a handful of great boss fights but most of them feel like cheap "to do" lists. I appreciate that the bosses get harder as you weaken them, but in practice it sometimes becomes absurd. The fact that many of the bosses spawn enemies during the fight is a total cop-out in character design. Bosses are where you should be showing off and challenging the player, but the game continually throws out arbitrary tasks like wailing on a crystal, beat these minor enemies. It really detracts from the finished product.\n\nThe good news is that this game seems like it could be great with a little more fine-tuning, but for right now it's a game that has a lot of potential, but for me is unsatisfying on nearly every level.","March 6, 2015","false","24.6"," 42 of 77 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","42","77","6","0"

As a spriter myself, SotN looked and felt amazing.\n\nValdis Story has absolutely scratched this itch for me.  Many of the game's mechanics feel highly fleshed out and leveling up gives the player a real sense of accomplishment.  Gameplay is challenging, even on normal difficulty, but highly enjoyable.  In a lot of Indie Metroidvania games, I feel like I'm fighting more with the sloppy or often-times clunky character movements than I am with enemies.  Valdis Story plays smoothly and movement feels polished and natural, with just enough friction to add a real sense of accomplishment when you traverse an expertly-crafted navigation puzzle (which this game is full of!).\n\nEnemies are challenging, so far I have not found myself coming into a situation where I've out-leveled a region of the map where enemies are so far below you that they pose as completely unthreatening.  In the right combinations, even simple enemies that stand little chance individually have been paired together to make an otherwise simple foe become a more exciting engagement.\n\nIn short, I love this game and it does the Metroidvania genre justice in both visual appeal and clean, professional-quality side scrolling action goodness.","March 8","true","7.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For a side scrolling platformer, this game offers tonnes of contents, replayablity and challenges. The story is rather typical and nothing to shout about but it keeps things interesting enough to get you through. However what motivates me are the items, skills and unlockables the game has.\n\nUnlike any generic RPG game, items you find will gradually increase in potential as you discard the old ones. In this game, items equipment you find will stay in your inventory and you change your equipment anytime base on your play style or environment. You can find rare items to upgrade these equipment via NPC found in towns. Weapons offers different offensive strategy and different heroes comes with 4 to 5 sets of weapons. So you can imagine the possibility gameplay style you can have. Accessories are rare items that you can equipt to give you certain edge but comes with a slight unfavorable stat so you need to use them wisely. On top of that you can also choose to have a companion which you can summon to aid you in combat. Each companion has different ways of aiding you, directly or indirectly.\n\nSpells in this game is rather different as you unlocks a set them as you progress through the game. Each set has 4 spells that you can equipt and change at anytime. Each spell is unique and behaves differently so again, you need to pick the right combination spells that suits your strategy.\n\nCombat, like the old days, are not head to head and potion mashing style. Each enemies behaves differently so you need to time your attack or exploit their weakness to minimize the damage taken although it isn't that punishing. However, some fights can be difficult especially boss fights can be really challenging. To put it in short, dying in this game is not the end of the world.\n\nThe game has several towns that offers different styles and you can quick travel between them. Each town serve as the main entry point to its theme dungeon. Each dungeon has different types of enemies and bosses and the size of each dungeon is just nice for you to explore. You will constantly need to revisit areas since some are only accessible with the right key or skills which are obtained elsewhere.\n\nIn certain areas, there are puzzles that you can solve in order to get access to loots or to proceed to the next area. These puzzle requires you to activate certain mechanism within the same map and there is a actually a time limit for you to get to the designated place. This can be rather frustrating at times because you might need to execute the puzzle flawlessly.\n\nSo there you go, generally all that mashed up you have Valdis Story. I do recommend this game to people who loves platformer and a challenge. By far, this is one of the most satisfying game in this genre I've played.","April 5","true","5.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is actually about 10 hours.)\n\nWhile I am generally a sucker for Metroidvania games, this one fell short for me. It has all the makings of an excellent game, but its unreliable mechanics and punishing design are often too much for it.\n\nIt's too bad; Valdis Story looks like it might be amazing from the start. Everything you see is lovely- the environments and enemies are beautifully designed, and aside from a few really ugly characters (just look at Wyatt's perpetual insomniac face), the human sprites are up there too.\n\nLikewise, the music and sound design are equally lovely, if a tiny bit generic. And from the initial story hints the characters drop, you sense that a decent amount of creativity went into the story. So artistically speaking, the potential is there.\n\nBut the mechanics don't bear it out. And I could make a bullet-point list of every aspect I find frusrtating, but it can basically be summarized thusly: this is not a true Metroidvania game because it wants you to perform and fight instead of explore. It wants to see how fast you can platform and how many infinite stun-lock combos you can dodge, but cares very little about discovery. I can think of no successful title in the genre that has taken this route, and there's a reason for that. The core impulse of Metroidvania games is exploration. Take that away, and it's just an awkward, ill-conceived juxtaposition of a platformer and a fighter.\n\nSo, will you get worthwhile secrets to find? No, you'll get infinite tiny crafting items hidden behind frustrating timed switches. Will you get a decent map to explore the world with? No, you'll get a rather pale substitute that only shows your local surroundings with no way to check what you missed or unlocked in other places. Distinct, compelling upgrades? No, just keys. Well, maybe at least some decent battles?\n\nNo, you don't really get that either. At first I thought the game was just challenging enough, asking a lot of me but never being unfair, but Valdis Story quickly deviates from that. There are just too many eccentricities of the combat system. For instance, why is it that everything is trying to stun-lock you into long combos that gouge out half or more of your health at once, even on the lowest difficulty? Why are enemies placed on ledges sometimes near-impossible to approach as they repel you with instantaneous, unblockable attacks? Why does being hit cause you to fall completely helplessly until you hit the ground? Can you imagine trying to play a Metroid game if Samus tumbled like a ragdoll every time an attack grazed her? It wouldn't be much fun. Most fights wind up feeling that way after the first couple of hours- a chore, not a thrill, especially since enemies only drop the most banal, meaningless "loot." When every crafting recipe requires 8-10 different types of ingredients, a single bar of steel feels almost worthless.\n\nBut, truth be told, I might have put up with this if the story was proving to be half-decent. This game's approach to storytelling is, in many ways, the inverse of Cave Story's: it dumps hundreds of little insignificant worldbuilding details on you, but never constructs anything meaningful out of them. About ten hours in, a village elder is polite enough to give you a staggering exposition dump; this is the first time the plot shows up. And it is not much of a plot. You're trying to find a relic of power before the other two factions. That's it. There you go. All that talk of angels and demons and the goddess Abghababa and freeing humanity literally comes down to that. Again, there's visible creativity at work here, but it's scattered and misdirected. You can read all about the individual ranks of demon and angel in the lore entries, but none of it is ever put together in a way that matters. And frankly, it's all just half-baked enough to make me feel silly reading about it.\n\nThere's some interplay of light and dark going on, which is normally another thing I am an absolute sucker for, but it, too, is absolutely meanigless. It might have some obscure gameplay impact, but mostly it just makes your outline glow red or blue. And the ease with which you switch from dark to light serves to undermine any meaning or finality that your choice of alignments might have had. And the game barely indicates what the light/angelic side and dark/demonic side even represent. Perhaps it wants you to just assume that they stand for their absolute most generic interpretations.\n\nAnd the story was not a selling point for me- but you need to get either gameplay or story right to keep me going. Valdis Story got neither.\n\nBut, if you've stuck with me this far, let me tell you what actually made me put down the game- what made me finally give up on it. It wasn't the story or the combat, as such. It was when the game offered me a choice- upon defeating a boss, spare him or finish him off. I chose to spare him, curious as to what would happen. And what happened is that the game punished me for it with a nearly-unwinnable boss fight.\n\nYou're meant to fight a demon captain of some sort (you've met him before by this point, but again, he's just a little sack of details and backstory with no clear relevance to anything), and he's already challenging enough with his massive waves of minions and irritating dash-spam. But no, as punishment for letting that earlier boss live, the game throws him into this battle, too. He's a member of the angel faction, so I figured it would just be an interesting three-way fight. But instead, both sides focus on you and only you. They make only the most half-hearted attempt to attack each other, and they each summon their own legion of minions. And then, whichever boss you kill first, the other gains back all his health and gets powered up, Smaug and Ornstein style. (Except Dark Souls had the depth and refinement to back it up.)\n\nGiven the game's strong tendency towards stun-locking you, a screen full of minions and bosses all focused on you is not a good situation. I did beat the battle by using exploitative techniques, but it shattered any illusions of immersion I might have had. because A: your choices don't have logical or interesting outcomes in this world. B: for all that talk of angels and demons fighting, they really are just sprites on the screen who only know to attack you. And C: the whole fight reeks of an attempt at being climactic, but it just doesn't MATTER. Who are these people? Why do I care? All I've done is fetch items for village elders. I would just as soon run from the boss fight because fighting this stooge means nothing to me.\n\nBut just take note of this, guys: sure, if you want to make choices meaningful, then yes, they have to have consequences. But this was an utterly arbitrary, meaningless decision made without any context. And its consequences were almost too harsh to overcome. This is the WRONG way to offer choices to a player. It does nothing for them.\n\nI guess that almost sums up my feelings on Valdis Story. It's trying to do all the right things, but with no understanding of how they should work. It has a concept and a backstory, but no ability to hold a plot together. It has complex combat mechanics, but not the refinement to make them satisfying. It has rooms and hidden items and upgrades, but implements them in a way that makes the very thought of trying to explore this world unpalatable. (If I see one more timed switch...)\n\nSo I cannot recommend this game in good faith. If you want a Metroidvania game, go play Cave Story instead. Or Dust AET, if you  want something that feels kind of similar to this except done better. (Its plot is a bit wishy-washy too, but at least it isn't obnoxious.) Or really, play conceivably anything, but don't play Valdis Story.","January 5, 2014","false","3.8"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","1"

There is a difference between challenge and artificial difficulty and the issue that I seem to find the most glaring is already quite fixable in the game.\n\nBasically the combat is built around comboing your enemies and continuing said combo with a Skill Cancel which breaks you out of your animation and acts as a sort of invulnerability to dodge or get behind your foe and allow you to resume your combo anew, unfortunately you have a limited amount of these cancels and for some reason when you are in combat you cannot regenerate them unless you are completely inactive in a fight. Even a character who can summon minions is penalized for them attacking an enemy by not being able to regenerate. This probably wouldn't even be an issue if you had an alternative way of being defensive but unless you build specificially for blocking and parrying, a non defensive build character will not be able to block strong physical or any magical attack whatsoever, so you're stuck taking damage from an attack that you might not be able to dodge if you are out of cancels and cannot block without eating some heavy damage because any sort of attack no matter how weak will send you into a stunned animation that every enemy in the game will take advantage of. You're not even allowed to break out of a stunlock like you should be able to until an almost arbitrary number of hits.\n\nWhat's worse is that with these flaws is that the game expects you to be perfect with a ranking system in bossfights that at first seems pretty neat, until you release later on that perfect ranking is very heavily out of your favor. You're ranked on how fast you kill the boss, how well you attacked without taking hits and finally by not using any life potions or essentially never losing all your health. This is fine but you soon learn that bosses become damage sponges who love to prolong fights by either constantly running or even blocking your attacks midcombo, can easily stunlock you out of cancels in their usually cramped arenas that they take up a good chunk of, and in later game do high damage that you can hardly seem to mitigate so getting downed is probably likely if you're not aware of their patterns, if they even have any. Its just an amount of perfection required that seems outlandish even for people that love this sort of unforgiving "challenge."\n\nI want to love this game but damn was the magic gone when I saw just how unenjoyable it was at times.","June 25, 2015","false","42.2"," 32 of 58 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","32","58","0","5"

I decided to buy it when it went on sale for $3.50, and was delighted to find it be one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've had this year.  Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a beautiful Metroidvania that has great combat and platforming.  This is enhanced by its extremely fluid controls (I played on a 360 gamepad).  There is also an rpg-like character progression, skill tree and lots of unlockable weapons, spells, allies and equipment to provide your characters with a ton of customization options.  I just beat the game for my first time, and have started playing a second playthrough with a different character and build.  I played a completionist run for my first playthrough that clocked in at around 13-15 hours.  Upon writing this review, there are currently two playable main characters implemented in the game, and two more planned to come in the future.  This game has a ton of replay value, and I'm sure that will only increase once the final two characters are implemented.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the most pleasant surprises I've had with a game, and is (in my opinion) by far the most enjoyable metroidvania game I have ever played.  I would give this game a 9/10.","January 4, 2014","true","19.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Given life through Kickstarter, the Devs really created something special which will certainly provide you with a longing for more.\n\nWith 4 difficulties and 2 characters to choose from right off the bat, the option of choice is quickly acknowledged. Play as hardened warrior Wyatt or the swift monk Reina in an Atlantis-esque landscape where Angels and Demons fight for control. All the while a neutral party has appeared, fearls...neither Light or Dark have become to run rampant in the underwater world and has been causing townsfolk to be wary of strangers. As Wyatt or Reina explore the world, you'll slowly uncover why this abyssal city has become a battle ground of the gods.\n\nAt its core, Valdis Story can be described as a Tactical Hack n' Slash RPG. Combat being the main focus, involves a light attack and heavy attack with combos being performed as multiple inputs are given. Combined with the ability to strike in the air, cancel your animation in order to seamlessly meld into another combo, and cast 4 different types of magic, one can imagine the styling of Valdis Story's combat can be quite the visual. The game may be overwhelming at first due to the immense amount of status effects, buffs, and items...but soon transforms into a short but dense experience like no other.\n\nThe art style is fantastic and the environments each have their own unique spin. The combat, spells, and animations are all top notch and fit the mood of the locale perfectly. The soundtrack is on the same level as the rest of the game as I found myself just leaving the game paused and taking in the hauntingly lulling pieces.\n\nSome aspects may appear frustrating such as some timed platforming and I would have liked to see the character change in appearance depending on what armor is worn but that is completely understandable considering the the dev team makes up less room than a nuclear family.\n\nI could go on but hopefully you can see why this is a must own game if you enjoy Hack n' Slash/RPG/2D Exploration games and if you long to play another Castleroid then this is close as you'll get!","January 8, 2014","true","35.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Man o man, was I surprised to find such a fun and charming game.\n\nTaking from the Metroidvania style of layout and combat similar to that of devil may cry, this game makes out for some fun times. The music is great, the combat is great, the platforming is great...for the most part. I say the most part because there are some tedious level designs that require a lot of attempts due to nearly impossible requirements in speed and platforming. Other than that the game is amazing and easily has become one of my most fun and memorable games of all.\n\nGiven that there are two charcters, both with their own stories, the game begs for a second playthrough; which I am working on now :D\n\nI sincerely hope the developers decide to make a sequel or another game in this same style.\n\n\n\nEasily a 8.5/10\n\nUpdate: After finishing the game with Reina and playing throught the new content, I have to say, STUN LOCKING is a HUGE problem with this game!!!!!!!! It is frustrating an infuriating!!!! I still stand by that this is an over all great game but the two GLARING flaws in the game design are some of the platforming and definitly the stun locking that some of the enemies put you in and definitely the eye of Myrgato and the final boss.......wow, I have never been more frustrated with a game.

I really enjoy free-exploration games, but missable content immediately shatters a relaxing gaming experiences with the looming specter of "did I just inadvertantly lock some content for the entire playthrough?" Don't do that. That means I need a guide to enjoy your game. Speaking of, none of the maps online are up-to-date. The Hollow and the Mine, and a few other places are incomplete.\n\nAlso, some of the controls are wonky. Grab a ledge. Now, jump off the ledge. I bet you guessed that would be the jump button. No, that makes you climb up. Press the directional button opposite the ledge. THAT makes you jump. Unintuitive. Also, the Magic controls use a modifier-button system, but don't require the modifier to be pressed prior to accepting input. So, something like (holding up)->RB(hold)->right will actually probably result in the Magic bound to UP being cast, rather than waiting for a keypress after holding the modifier key. So you really have to think of it differently. The direction is the modifier, and the trigger is "cast something." This isn't exactly how the game introduces the concept, and it definitely takes some getting used to.\n\nThe overall game flow is pretty good, once you get past the unnecessary hurdles.\n\nThe story is a bit of a mixed bag. The core concepts of the world are cool, but the worldbuilding with names and such is a complete mess. Everything from pseudo-Latinate to pseudo-Norse pseudo-Japanese is represented in a way that is distracting. If they'd have at least mapped these different phoneme-sets to the various races of Angels, Humans, and Demons, they could have probably come out with something resembling cohesive. As it is, it sounds too much like nonsense words.\n\nAs for the art, that, too is a little mixed. It's mostly great. Smooth animation, detail where it counts, that sort of thing. It's not without problems, though, like the rest of the game.\n\nFor one, backgrounds and foregrounds can blend together in places. In the first town, Tagrum (Human, Latinate), there are yellow-brick platforms. Some are in the background, some are solid, and you can usually tell the difference, but not always.\n\nFor another, the characters designs are of inconsistent quality. Reina (Human used to be allied with Angels, Japanese-esqe name) looks great in her character portraits, but in her sprite, her hair mostly covers her face a lot of the time. It's like she's constantly looking slightly away from the screen, either way you face. Other characters have slightly odd head/face proportions. One guy is named Shadoboxxer (yes, two Xs, no W) for some reason. (See what I mean about the naming, though?)\n\nIn the end, it's a decent Metroidvania that sacrifices the relaxing exploration element I love for some branching plot I don't care a lot about, and adds some really intricate fighting mechanics that are probably more contrived than elegant. Still, if you can look past the flaws, it's pretty enjoyable.\n\n","April 6","true","19.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But try as I might, I cannot bring myself to enjoy Valdis Story.  The controls are horrible and unintuitive.  Your character doesn't get any invincibility frames when you take damage, so large groups of enemies (which are everywhere) can easily juggle you to death if you slip up and get in a tight spot.  This is supposedly not a problem because you are temporarily invincible while you dash, but I've found plenty of situations where it seems like that just doesn't help.\n\nBonus experience for your character is doled out based on the rank you obtain while fighting bosses.  Bonus experience is vital in Valdis Story because, while you technically can grind, normal enemies give so little experience that it will be an incredible slog to catch up.  Getting good equipment often requires the completion of time-based puzzles, several of which are incredibly frustrating because the controls suck.\n\nTo give this game a fair shot, I restarted after learning more about it so I could gather more bonus experience from bosses.  I will admit the gameplay can be smooth, but even when I was doing really well in the first part of the game, I still hated the controls and fought against them the whole time.  Obviously, it's possible to completely master the game and get an S-Rank on all bosses, and I know some people will enjoy this game enough to get that good.  I won't deny that it has the makings of a great game, I just feel poor design decisions mar it too much for me to recommend (or even finish myself).","January 17","false","6.4"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","22","40","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/recommended/252030/","Auburok","Auburok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/","581 products in account","This is a repost of my original review here[www.sophisticatedmayhem.com].\n\nWhen I'm asked what my favorite game genre is, I reminisce of Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Both were huge games with their own forms of progression and a sort of open-ended exploration element, which was controlled through movement upgrades and keys. Neither were particularly tough, but they offered a gradual increase in difficulty as the games went on. This genre of 2D exploration games took both titles in its portmanteau namesake: Metroidvania (or Castleroid if that's your thing). There's been quite a few of these games in the past few years, but Valdis Story: Abyssal City by EndlessFluff Games, is a particularly different one. While it has all the elements from a typical of a Metroidvania, it sandwiches its own in there: hard as balls combo-centric combat.\n\nThe game begins with the player selecting difficulty. Unlike many games, the player is free to select "Normal" mode all the way to "God Slayer" mode right from the start. I went with "Hard" since I definitely wasn't a "Veteran" of Valdis Story yet. The game also lets you select between two characters: the brooding swordsman Wyatt, or the spunky monk Reina. There are two other characters with greyed out portraits, Gilda and Vladyn which apparently are to be added later. There are some variations in the story when playing as either currently available character, and different weapons and spells as well. The game begins with Wyatt, Reina and their crew of merry seamen hot on the tail of a warship carrying the Demon General, Gernot. While preparing to ambush, their ship is attacked by a huge sea creature that is neither Angelic nor Demonic. The ships sink and a flash of light ends up protecting the crew as they plummet to the lost city of Sitheil. The crew is split up, and your character quickly discovers that the war between Angels and Demons has reached here as well.\n\nImmediately, the game thrusts you into combat. In the beginning of the game, your character has a variety of spells and some basic attacks at their disposal, which can be used in the chaining of combos. Light attacks and heavy attacks can be fluidly chained with spells, and experimentation with this is encouraged in the game with ratings and experience bonuses. Further on, the player gets the ability to do a "Skill Cancel", which allows the player to dodge an attack, dash through an enemy or pound to the ground if in the air. Skill Cancels require a short recharge time before using again, and additional charges are available later on in the game. Combat quickly goes from button mashing to methodical cat-and-mouse within the first twenty minutes. In addition to this, there's an ability called "Focus Mode", which is a bar that fills from doing combos, killing enemies and taking damage. Once it's filled, it can be activated, bestowing the player with various buffs depending on equipment and skills. Before it has run its course, the player can deploy a finishing move from their repertoire that expands as the player plays.\n\nWhile Valdis Story has a particularly complex combat system, there's also a generous helping of RPG mechanics. Characters level with experience and are granted stat points and skill points for each level (up to level 20, which is the cap). Skills are divided into three trees: offense, defense, and spellcasting. Skills are entirely passive and have a strong influence on your character's optimal playstyle, but can be reset for a price halfway through the game if you've made a mistake. Armor also has a rather large influence on a character's playstyle by not only imparting stats and special effects (and some weapons, accessories, and spells), but by controlling your player's affinity between neutral, dark and light. You can go through the game without knowing or caring about affinity, but it's another straw on the pile of RPG mechanics.\n\nUnfortunately, there's only a few weapons in the game, and they come pretty late. The upside to this is once the game is completed, any of those weapons will be unlocked for subsequent playthroughs. Outside of this, there is no "New Game +" mechanic, but the game wouldn't particularly benefit from it considering how quickly it can be completed once combat and layout are mastered.\n\nThe name of the game in Valdis Story, however, is difficulty. I only played on what they've deemed "Hard Mode", but it was unrelenting for a first try. There's little margin for error for a fledgling player and it takes a while to hit the ground running when walking into a boss fight, but a little practice goes a long way. Bosses have patterns and occasionally a boss will have some minions, but there's always a weakness to exploit. There's major incentives for playing well, as beating the boss quickly, without getting hit often, landing a bunch of combos and without using a health potion contributes to a grading system. The player is ranked from "S" to "F", with bonuses ranging from none for doing terrible, to free skill and stat points. The only particular issue I had with the game was the platforming aspects. Jumping is the only thing in this game that feels mushy. There's not very much control in the air, and flinch animations lock you in to tumble that make you feel you're playing I Wanna Be the Guy at times. These sections are definitely doable, but many of them feel unnecessarily difficult for being in a main path of progression. One section of the game requires you to perfectly complete a long section of platforming and timed switches to even leave. There are plenty of difficult platforming sections that will have you tearing your hair out, but this all depends on if you seek challenges from games or purely experiences.\n\nThe game is beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent, but there's a lack of polish when it comes to the opening and ending scenes, which are motion comics without sound effects. There's a few other minor quirks, like some extremely static sprites and a lot of enemy pallet swaps, but nothing egregious. The story is actually pretty well written and considerably less tacky than I was expecting, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nValdis Story: Abyssal City is a surprisingly interesting addition to the Metroidvania genre and is worth checking it out if you're into these sorts of games. That said, this particular game is without a doubt championing triumph over uneven odds with skill, even on normal difficulty. Consider it the Dark Souls of Metroidvanias, which should excite as much as it should terrify.","December 31, 2013","true","15.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Now the main part. As you can see, if you knew Maple Story, megamanX you will see this game so familiar.\n\nBut! Game combat ? Awesome. You can watch the featured video to know more. You can do a combo to 30, even 40 and 50 hits. But it's very hard. You must do it with the lightning speed, and try different moves to continue the combo attacks.\n\nGraphics ? Awesome.I'm playing this game on fullHD screen, and this game doesn't support fullHD. Yeah, but it's still good.\nPuzzle ! So hard (to me) the first time. You can go from happy to angry when try to solve the map puzzle :P And btw, the map familiar to the game called: Castlevania. Why ? There are rooms, and many special spots that you can not enter when you are weak. Only if you defeat the bosses, they drop skills and then you can use those skills to enter.\n\nYou will have an hour running all the map to find the treasures, lost crews and do quest. Because there is no quest's hint.\n\nWhat can i say ? Buy it now and stop asking if it's worth your money or not.

This game is extremely challenging, to the point it can be game breakingly bad at times. If you like a good challenge, this game is for you.\n\n\n\nIt's been a while that Ive truly gotten frustrated and angry at a game. Usually when I run into something that is annoying or just plain bad, If there isn't something else in the game that really makes me want to continue playing it, then I just simply stop playing. But when I actually want to continue with the game because it has some really great stuff in it, but is constantly hamstringed by very poorly made choices in the gameplay, then I get frustrated because I want to keep playing but certain aspects of the game make that difficult.\n\nIll start this off by going with what's great about the game. The premise of the story is actually pretty damn cool for the most part. While not entirely new, it does give a fresh feel to things. While not super in depth, the story is good enough to where I want to keep playing. The playstyle and feel of the game is both nostalgic and new, and for the most part very fun to play. The music is great and really adds atmosphere to the game. SO with all this great stuff going for the game why only 3/5  rating?\n\nI usually am not one to complain about this, but the biggest problem with this game is difficulty. Normally I tend to play games I own on hard settings. I do this because I find a challenge rewarding personally. But this game I honestly feel goes to hardcore on the difficulty. When starting this game, I chose normal, because I was not familiar with this games mechanics right away, so I wanted to play with it first before going to a more difficult setting.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that this games normal setting would be equivilant to most games very hard settings. And it's done for a few reasons. First and for most it's the problem with the fighting in the game itself. The game is very exacting on the timing aspect. If you screw up your timing, you take a fairly high amount of damage. Im all for being punished for messing up, but with the exacting nature of the timing against some enemies, and the punishment recieved, it's too finely tuned.\n\nThe second is dealing with multiple enemies results in juggling. In certain combat situations, you will be pitted against multiple enemies at once. In most games, they compensate this factor by weakening individual enemies a slight bit so you are able to deal with them. This is not the case in this game, which is fine for the most part except when the game has a nasty problem with juggling. Your character will flinch when recieving damage, and this problem results in that when multiple enemies hit you, you can literally be locked in perpetual damage till you burn up one of your lives in a single encounter. This is compounded when they included normal enemies who have long stuns, disables, and other abilities, as well as the ability to block your attacks, or spam theirs. There are countless times when running through places  that you can get a game over because of mis timing one evade. The game attempts to make this up by creating aritificial check points through out the game that will allow you to restart from there instead of the last save point. However, this doesnt change the ease of which enemies can really kill you. And this is normal mode too.\n\nOn the same not of difficulty, some of the trap puzzles are also to finely tuned. Where the difference between making it through a door on time or not is determined by pixels and fractions of seconds. There is no room for error and things have to be timed precisely with great reflexes. This can lead to a lot of frustration when trying to attain treasure chests in the game. Once again, for normal difficulty, the leeway should be greater, and more finely tuned for the harder difficulty settings.\n\nThe next problem with this game is actual direction, which stems from a few things. What this game lacks is a quest log tab of some kind, so you can keep track of where your objectives and goals are. While the map screen does give you a small little text of information on what you are trying to achieve in the bigger picture, there is no way to keep track of what I would assume to be side quests or minor quests, so keeping all those things in mind will have to be done via memory, so if you dont play through this game in a week's time, youll likely forget what you were doing if you were to come back to it.\n\nAlso, because of the lack of general direction, you can actually stumble into boss fights. Something Ive done a few times. While simply looking for a save point, Ive walked into rooms with boss fights and spent a lot of time just trying to get through the fight by the skin of my teeth. This could be a good point cause it does give it more adventure feel, but considering the difficulty, a little bit of heads up of what lurks nearby is a good thing.\n\nThere are a few nostalgic, but terrible game mechanics that really need to stop being used. The grid map system where rooms are defined by squares with holes for doors is a system from when there was a limitation of what could be shown on map due to memory space in the games. Now that we dont have that issue, using a grid system is pretty terrible. Maps should have a bit more detail to them to more accurately define what is where. Also, a global map system should be pretty self explainitory. The map only shows you teh rooms visited in the zone youre currently in. And in a game where trying to find where to go next is a pain as it is, not having the ability to look at the maps of other zones so you can see whats where is just bad design.\n\nThe dungeon jumping mechanics, while fun in most cases, is nothing short of being god awful in situations where youre pitted against new enemies in large numbers. There are a few cases where you can be knocked off a platform and fall 3 screens, fight your way through a horde of enemies you already beat, just to get back to the newly unveiled enemy you dont know how to counter yet only to get knocked off the platform yet again. This mechanic is once again heavily punishing a player before they have time to learn and adapt to the situation.\n\nAs I said before, I do like this game. I love a lot of the ideas, the visuals, the mechanics of the fighting system, the music, story, and so on are really good. What really just kills this game is the rediculously hard presicion needed for decent play, and the game breaking mechanics as mentioned before. The advantage to steam is that they can patch and update, which I hope they do. A game for normal difficulty should NOT play this hard from the get go.","January 17, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The music sets the atmosphere well, and is one of my favorite parts of the game. Gameplay is your standard Metroidvania affair of finding items to access new areas, or revisit previous ones and obtain things that were out of reach. The game has a levelling and experience system, which seems to give the player a lot of options as to how to build their character. Grinding appears to become essential by the end of the game, which is a disappointment. I enjoyed the flow of the game for the first several hours, but hit a brick wall about 5 or 6 hours in. That break in the action is a terrible killjoy to experience, and its akin to something like Circle of the Moon, where you can romp through the game up until the final parts, where suddenly you need 20 more levels.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad, but I was playing on the "normal" difficulty. Why have 4 different difficulty modes if the lowest one doesn't allow you to play through the game with any sort of consistent pace? I understand having a hard difficulty to challenge experienced players, but it is weird to me to have 4 difficulty modes, none of which allow the player to just make consistent progress.\n\nThe game seems to dish out tons of extra damage due to its lack of invulnerability frames during damage. This means enemies can combo you while you are helplessly watching. Spikes can play pinball with you and kill you, rather than just dealing some base amount of damage and offering you a chance to escape.\n\nPerhaps the most annoying aspect is how the game handles saves with regards to boss battles. If you enter a boss room, you are locked into that fight until you either win it, or load your previous save. This wouldn't be a problem if you always encountered a save room prior to a boss fight. It's not necessarily the case that you find the save room before the boss room, though, and I found it hard to even know I was in a boss room before the door closed and locked behind me.\n\nOverall, I like Valdis Story, despite these minor complaints. It would be nice to see these small issues I had with it addressed in some manner. In particular, I'd like to see the lower difficulty settings emphasize flow of gameplay over punishing the player repeatedly. Punishment can be reserved for the players who want to experience that highest level of difficulty. I just want to play the game, because the game that is there is addictive.","January 20, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And in a game where trying to find where to go next is a pain as it is, not having the ability to look at the maps of other zones so you can see whats where is just bad design.\n\nThe dungeon jumping mechanics, while fun in most cases, is nothing short of being god awful in situations where youre pitted against new enemies in large numbers. There are a few cases where you can be knocked off a platform and fall 3 screens, fight your way through a horde of enemies you already beat, just to get back to the newly unveiled enemy you dont know how to counter yet only to get knocked off the platform yet again. This mechanic is once again heavily punishing a player before they have time to learn and adapt to the situation.\n\nAs I said before, I do like this game. I love a lot of the ideas, the visuals, the mechanics of the fighting system, the music, story, and so on are really good. What really just kills this game is the rediculously hard presicion needed for decent play, and the game breaking mechanics as mentioned before. The advantage to steam is that they can patch and update, which I hope they do. A game for normal difficulty should NOT play this hard from the get go.","January 17, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The music sets the atmosphere well, and is one of my favorite parts of the game. Gameplay is your standard Metroidvania affair of finding items to access new areas, or revisit previous ones and obtain things that were out of reach. The game has a levelling and experience system, which seems to give the player a lot of options as to how to build their character. Grinding appears to become essential by the end of the game, which is a disappointment. I enjoyed the flow of the game for the first several hours, but hit a brick wall about 5 or 6 hours in. That break in the action is a terrible killjoy to experience, and its akin to something like Circle of the Moon, where you can romp through the game up until the final parts, where suddenly you need 20 more levels.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad, but I was playing on the "normal" difficulty. Why have 4 different difficulty modes if the lowest one doesn't allow you to play through the game with any sort of consistent pace? I understand having a hard difficulty to challenge experienced players, but it is weird to me to have 4 difficulty modes, none of which allow the player to just make consistent progress.\n\nThe game seems to dish out tons of extra damage due to its lack of invulnerability frames during damage. This means enemies can combo you while you are helplessly watching. Spikes can play pinball with you and kill you, rather than just dealing some base amount of damage and offering you a chance to escape.\n\nPerhaps the most annoying aspect is how the game handles saves with regards to boss battles. If you enter a boss room, you are locked into that fight until you either win it, or load your previous save. This wouldn't be a problem if you always encountered a save room prior to a boss fight. It's not necessarily the case that you find the save room before the boss room, though, and I found it hard to even know I was in a boss room before the door closed and locked behind me.\n\nOverall, I like Valdis Story, despite these minor complaints. It would be nice to see these small issues I had with it addressed in some manner. In particular, I'd like to see the lower difficulty settings emphasize flow of gameplay over punishing the player repeatedly. Punishment can be reserved for the players who want to experience that highest level of difficulty. I just want to play the game, because the game that is there is addictive.","January 20, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's an indie game published by Endlessfluff Games, who consist of Carolina and Kyron. For a game being made by just two people, it is very good. I can tell they put a lot of effort into this game, and it is games like this that make me wish triple A game companies would try harder.\n\nThe game's story is decent, but nothing amazing. It's enough to make you want to continue through the game. The gameplay is where the game truly shines. Since it is a metroidvania styled game, it has the basic side scrolling action and platforming, and you also have magic spells, which you can customize which you want in the menu. It also has RPG elements in the game. As you level up, you get to choose a new skill from three skill trees. Each skill tree is focused on different aspects, like combat, healing/defence, and magic. A lot of the replay value is from choosing different skills and customizing you'r own skill tree combination.\n\nI liked the simple, yet beautiful graphics of the game. A lot of people compare the look of the game to something similar to MapleStory, which i can sort of see, but I didn't really notice it until it was pointed out to me. I also enjoyed the soundtrack to the game. The music really set the mood for me, and I even found myself listening to the soundtrack when not playing the game.\n\nEven though I really liked this game, I still have some complaints. My main complaint is the forced, difficult platforming sections. I've checked gaming forums, and noticed this is a common complaint. I feel that difficult platforming should be left for optional items. This is the aspect of the game that will most likely get some people to "rage quit" the game. The other main issue I had, was random errors. I'd be playing the game, enjoying myself, and then a random error would come up. It wasn't very often, but it happened a couple times, so it got a little annoying.\n\nDespite some of the issues I had with this game, it is still quite a good and I recomment it to anyone that is a fan of metroidvania styled games. I hope to see more games from Endlessfluff Games in the future. If I had to give this game a rating, I'd give it a 7/10.","January 5, 2014","true","9.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is worth every penny and more. I feel guilty buying it at the discounted price, to an extent, because you are guaranteed to get your money's worth at the normal price point.\n\nSome describe this game as a "Metroidvania" type game, and that is correct to an extent. However, this game differentiates itself from either the handheld Castlevania sidescrolling RPGs and Super Metroid in that it is very to-the-point. This game is not about massive exploration, tons of backtracking, and acquiring new abilities in order to repeat the two previous steps. It is all about the action: that is, a diverse combat system complete with combos splicing all-out physical assaults and magical barrages, and that is all it needs. Thus, instead of describing this game as "Metroidvania" inspired, I prefer the term "Streetvania" inspired, because it is all about the fighting.\n\nWhen you pick up Valdis Story, prepare for a game which leaves you lying in wait for each boss encounter, because there, alongside its diverse RPG system of specialization in play style, is where it truly shines (outside of its Odin Sphere-inspired graphics and beautiful soundtrack, which are great in their own right). The game can be and is difficult, but difficult in a fun and challenging way. Each boss fight is scored on a system, and if you are anything like me or a perfectionist to begin with, you'll find yourself repeating these fights in order to get higher scores; which by the way, the game rewards in kind.\n\nThe pacing is perfect. It does not waste time on the frills of exploration, the old-school formula for stretching play time out of a game. Each area has just enough amount of screens to satisfy probing its secrets, but not so much that it wastes your time without your knowing. This acts as a great stimulus, because the game will take as long as it needs to, but never feels long enough, serving as a stimulus to delve into it for another playthrough, this time trying out a new niche with a new character (it has four, each with a menagerie of different play styles you can specialize in, leading one to want to try it all out).\n\nIn sum, I definitely recommend this game, and I am looking forward to the next game release by this development team.\n\n","January 5, 2014","true","56.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The art style and soundtack should not go unnoticed; Both set a beautiful stage and give the game a soul commonly lacking in modern games.

That was definately not the case.\n\nThe game features a lot of difficult and challenging content even on 'Normal', don't let the difficulty fool you. Even though the content can be tough at times it keeps you going back for me. It incorporates many timed challenges that either provide a reward or passage to the next part of an area though the ones for items were much more challenging.\n\nBosses in the game are hit and miss though. Some are down right easy while in other cases you can spend a good hour and get nowhere by the end of it. This could just mean you are going about it all wrong or you are there too early and missed some crutial item along the way that would make things so much easier.\n\nThere is a fair bit of back tracking during the game to access areas that were closed off before you gained an ability from later in the game. The lack of a world map however makes it seem like the map look a lot bigger than it actually is. At the same time the lack of a full world map will probably drive you a little insane.\n\nHaving played the game with a controller I can say that it is relatively fluid and feels right. I liked how double jump isn't something that is readily available for you at all times. The constant remapping of spells was very interesting as well.\n\nHaving finished the game once after a few multiple hour long sessions it still makes you want to go back and play it through again in either a harder setting (trust me normal was difficult already)  or finish with other characters.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of hack and slash/ rogue like games.","January 8, 2014","true","20.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A Metroidvania-esque action platformer set in an interesting world caught in a war between angels and demons, exploring a long-lost city which sunk into the depths of the ocean long ago. It has multiple playable characters, each with three skill trees to advance through as they level up, four stats to raise in the same manner that can affect your playstyle dramatically, four weapons, and plenty of armor options with their unique benefits as well. Not to mention that both your armor and weapons can be upgraded with the proper materials and NPC. Add to that the accessories, support characters that you can call on cooldown to attack and, in some cases, heal you or some such, as well as finisher attacks that put you into a more powerful focus mode, and the combat is rich with options. Oh, and did I mention that each character has their own set of magic spells, in addition to gaining more magical options as the game progresses, and that those can be upgraded too?\n\nIn addition, the game uses a unique form of mobility called the Skill Cancel, in which you enter a state for a second or so in which you can dash to either side and dodge through enemies and attacks completely, and it gets even better the more 'charges' of it you can hold at once, or the further down a skill tree you go to improve its effects. The game has many small puzzles which include using it properly to navigate a room quickly and activate switches and such. It makes moving through the game feel very fluid and satisfying.\n\nI find myself on my third playthrough of the game at the time of writing this review, and I'm still finding things that I've missed before - from item pick-ups and side characters, a couple of well-hidden rooms, to a few things that affect the world the game takes place in. Between S-ranking the bosses, finding 100% of the collectibles, and trying to go through the game quickly, as well as many levels of difficulty (including one that removes the ability to save completely for an ultimate test), the replayability is quite high - which is only complemented by its incredible soundtrack.\n\nComposed by Zack Parrish, Valdis Story: Abyssal City's music is never found lacking. Moving from haunting, beautiful melodies to complex guitar rhythms and a few very in-your-face boss themes, flowing effortlessly from locale to locale, the soundtrack itself is a masterpiece. The first time I entered The Pit, even though you find out quickly that you cannot advance through the area when you first encounter it, I just stood around and listened to the music for a few minutes. It's a wonderful experience. I recommend that you see for yourself[zackparrish.bandcamp.com] whether you choose to buy the game or not.\n\nAll said, my first playthrough of the game took me around six hours, but I had hardly seen all that Valdis Story: Abyssal City has to offer... and they only intend to offer more through future character releases. This game is a true gem, and it doesn't seem to have much visibility nor the largest playerbase (I only have one friend to talk to it about!), so here's hoping a few of you see this review and decide it's worth picking up for yourselves.

Read on for more details.\n\nGame Play 6/10 - Game is very easy to get into but requires the old and tired rinse and repeat process till you succeed method.  Defeating bosses are your traditional meat and potatoes, try & die until you learn their attack patterns for openings here.  All too often the difference of 1 pixel is all the leeway you will to have navigating some of the puzzles which is frustration for more of a casual gamer such as myself.\nSound/Music 8/10 - I would rate the Sound & Music for this game to be above average for your general jump & slash game.\nDifficulty 3/10 - Game has a very inconsitent difficulty... very easy to waltz through most of the game, but advancing certain parts or aquiring the teddy bear for example to early can leave you with an over powered boss (blocking your path) too soon in the game, which happended to me.\n\nThis game is more of a niche type/old school.  While it does have a very similar playstyle as a MedrioVania game, I would still rank it more of an action platformer due to the necessary acrobatics necessary to reach special places or to even proceed through some areas of the game.  While I would not fault a game for keeping extra special items behind difficult to reach places I do fault it for making overly convoluted platforming to advance the story.\n\nI did not complete the game because it reached the point of excess in my opinion for overly contrived puzzles which do not fit in with a traditional MetroidVania game.","January 23, 2014","true","15.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With the 4 available characters, each who have 4 completely different weapons and skill trees to choose from, the sheer amount of choice makes the game very easy to personalize for your own playstyle.\n\nThe story is pretty good too, I won't spoil anything but the lore is very deep and fun to read, and they also provide an incentive for actively reading the lore as you get bonus stat points to spend if you find these "books of the old gods" scattered around the map.\n\nArt design is fantastic, the game looks really good. The main heroes are all fairly unique aesthetically and have individual back stories suited to their play style, but more than that the design of the enemies is great. The diversity from the angels to demons to ferals really makes each sub faction more distinct and individual because of the lengths taken to make them each seem unique.\n\nOverall I give this game a solid 8/10, would recommend always buying it on a sale if you enjoy tougher expierences or rpgs, or buying it on full price if you love the genres listed at the top.","May 16, 2015","true","27.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game is also in how well it tests your technique and actual skill with enemies scaling and variety so there's always some challenge. Though some of the bosses do feel unfair and some feel like they pop out of nowhere but that shouldn't deter you if your looking for a challenge. If that isn't enough to get you buying it has a lot of replay value with multiple difficulties and characters to try out! The story isn't won't win any awards but its decent and keeps the game's flow going while linking the fights together.\n\nValdis Story is a hidden gem and worth your money.\n\n\n+ Fighting System holds up pretty well\n+ Pretty Visuals\n+ Exploration is fun to do\n+ Has a lot of replay value\n\n- Story isn't groundbreaking\n- Bosses can be infuritating\n\n8/10","December 20, 2013","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A great artwork, soundtrack and gameplay mixes together to create a journey leaving the player wanting to find out more of the story and the characters. It can be difficult with the platforming and boss battles but the grading system leaves you striving to do better than before. The only complaints I honestly have are areas with constant health drain, and timed platforming, an annoyance that I hate and this game seems to perfect. It would do better with a more in depth quest log (since I tend to "blah blah blah text" through a lot of the main story driving dialogue) and perhaps an overall map rather than just the current area. I found myself trying to think of how I progressed through the game in order to figure out where one area was located. Did I mention platforming boss battles with health drain, and regenerating bosses?

Storyline is comical at times and keeps you intrigued on what comes next. Dual storyline playing through as one character have yet to see the second but can't wait. Interesting variation between mobs you fight demons, angels, and beasts known as ferals (which seem to be the toughest), all of which are having a war within this world, humans seem to be barely able to survive in this war thrust apon them. All in all this is a game to buy as long as you like a nice action sidescroller, if you have issues with a game where you will die a bunch of times look elsewhere, but this game fits the bill for vigorous fighting while keeping a intriguing storyline that makes you want to be better at the game to see more of it.","January 7, 2014","true","6.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The name instantly screamed "RPG" to me and with that being my favored genre of game, I looked into it. What I found was highly intriguing and so I purchased it on a whim. Now, after having finished it, I'd like to share my opinion:\n\nStory: 9/10\nI've been gaming for the better part of 25 years (started at age 3 with the NES back in the late 80s) so I've seen and played a lot of games through all their stories and plot twists, both good and bad. Compared to the titles released by a lot of the AAA companies and developers, Valdis Story stands just as tall as some of the best games I've played. You control a man named Wyatt with an intense grudge and a desire to slay the "false gods" as he travels through a forgotten city beneath the sea following a raid gone wrong. The characterization, the pacing, story and the world presented to the player is both simplistic/easy to follow and very well developed. It definitely takes some creative liberties because I've never seen a world where both "heaven" and "hell" are the bad guys, but the execution is nearly flawless. My only complaint, if it can be called that, is that I was a little confused starting out as far as the lore goes. The confusion is cleared up as the game progresses, for sure, and perhaps that was the intent of the developers. The game definitely raises a few questions still and leaves itself open for future installments with some very nice plot twists.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nFor any gamer that grew up in the 90s, Valdis Story is best described as a "Metroidvania" style game. It has the exploration and progression of a Metroid/Castlevania (Symphony of the Night, anyone?) fused with the level up and individual customization of any good RPG as far as stats, skills, and equipment go. For anyone not familiar with the above term, the best way to describe it is somewhat linear, but as you progress through the game and obtain new abilities and powers, expect certain areas that were previously inaccessible to be reachable now. As far as combat goes, it's very fast paced and fluid as you chain together combinations of light and heavy strikes, aerial attacks, and spells to devastating effect. At times it can be intensely thrilling and at others it can be brutally unforgiving. Don't expect every enemy you encounter to have the same pattern -- half the fun is in studying the foes and discerning their pattern and developing a strategy from there. What's even more exciting is that you are actually graded on your performance, not just in boss battles, but the entire game! As far as boss fights go, you are scored on how fast you win, your combo count, and survivability (did you die and use any healing potions) and are rewarded accordingly with some nice stat boosts. End game scores you on things like your number of retries, the number of civilians you saved, how much of your crew you located, and a combined total score for all the battles you engaged in. For anyone who enjoys a challenge, Valdis Story delivers!\n\nMusic: 10/10\nI thoroughly enjoyed the wide range of music throughout Valdis Story. Each song lends itself to the different atmospheres very well and the boss fight theme, especially, the way it starts out, really gets you in the mood for a confrontation. Even some of the more somber themes like those in the towns you visit make you feel the quiet desperation all the more.\n\nVisuals: 10/10\nValdis Story employs some beautiful, almost cartoon-like, visuals. For me, I loved the simplicity behind them, but they're far from poorly crafted. If you're expecting something top of the line as far as graphics go, you will be disappointed, However, the backdrops and the character sprites are all richly designed and thoroughly different from one another. It's not hard to tell that a lot of care and love went into the art style of this game.\n\nReplayability: 10/10\nThis game can quite easily be a "one and done" sort of game if you like, or it can be something you revisit from time to time, but the developers gave plenty of options for replayability. There are multiple difficulties (only two are available the first time you play, to be fair) as well as the chance to replay the game through the eyes of another character. And if you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ like me, you'll at least be attempting multiple playthroughs.\n\nOverall, for an indie game, I was thoroughly blown away by how well done this game was. I haven't played a game that kept me riveted like this in a long while and it was a very refreshing change of pace. Nowadays, you can expect to pay 50-60 bucks a pop for a Triple-A title, but you don't always get your money's worth. I picked this up when it was on sale for 6 bucks (it's around 15 normally I think) and the amount of time I've put into the game has been well worth the cost. Endless Fluff games has definitely been put on my radar for all future developments.","January 8, 2014","true","14.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game allows you some time to get used to the basic controls, and an easy few levels to start building your char, when most enemies can be defeated by simply blocking and attacking. Before you know it, though, even the common enemies will have you on edge, and some of the boss fights are absolutely brutal. There's also a fairly low level cap, so grinding for extra stats only works for so long, meaning you'll really have to learn the enemies' weaknesses and your build's strengths if you want to progress.\n\nThe exploration seems to strike quite a nice balance between not telling you where things are, but you somehow finding them anyway if you take a few moments to explore the surroundings. There's a few moments where looking for a certain quest item can be a bit frustrating if you didn't quite catch that one non-repeatable line of dialog that offhandedly mentioned where you should look for a new area, but on the other hand you really won't mind the extra level and additional upgrades you get while looking for them. And seeing how you unlock greater mobility and more keys as you progress, there's usually something new to find every time.\n\nI can't name many negatives about the game. The artwork's nice, there isn't a bit of music that I didn't enjoy listening to.

Character wide platforms with a character that has hairy jump controls at best and is bundled with frequent timed jump puzzle rooms that require pinpoint jumps or you get to wait for another attempt. I do empasize the word "wait", as the timers have to fully expire before you can try again (something which IWBTG solves by just letting you reset and go from where you were, that idea escaped the developer in this case.) So if you mess up early or midway, enjoy sitting out that 45+ second timer you were given, because you can't skip it. Best case scenario is you have a room entrance nearby you can leave, and return from, provided it itself isn't barred with a timer jump challenge door that will lock as soon as you enter and force you to redo the previous room also.\n\nIf the dev's would of reigned in their IWBTG fetish later on, this would of been an excellent title.","January 2, 2014","false","5.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Turning the boss fights from being challenging to just plain frustrating as you're trying to manuever to hit them or avoid attacks.\n\nThe dash command which is vital to beating many of the enemies was simply not firing when I entered the command for it and the game could have done a better job in explaining a lot of the underlining systems like spell alignment.","January 13, 2014","false","3.9"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

Its an orchestral masterpiece, that is most of the time rather calm but adds to the flair of the game without getting annoying. Weapons and armors are different enough to be satisfiyng and encourage you to try them out.\n\nThe fighting system is easy to learn and hard to master. It makes you feel part of the fight!  I wish I could say that about the controls (I will come to that later)\n\nThe game also has a sweet crafting-aspect that is subtle enough to keep the focus of the game, but it encourages you to pick up items dropped by enemies or received from chests.\n\nGraphics: As expected for the budget not full HD but still gorgeous. It reminds me of the days of castlevania on the gameboy advance, where they had to make the best of each pixel. It is incredibly satisifiying.\n\nSo this makes up for a great game, right?\nYes indeed. But on top of that solid base, the makers decided to put a thick layer of BS. Excuse my language.\nIt is just so frustrating to see such a promising game to sort of be torn apart by those things.\n\nRidiculous controls: Pressing the guard-button and the spell-button simultanously will open up the spell menu, which itself only requires you to press one directional button, to swap a spell. So guess what happens to you all the time:\nYou guard, then want to cast a spell, then end up messing up your spell-config. Also you need to press down, then press an other direction to dash. Sounds complicated? It is. Of course you can change that. But remember, the evade/dash-button is also used for the dive-move (which lets you fall down incredibly fast). This will especially annoy you, when you have to do parcours under time pressure in order to get to those chests that you might want.\n\nOh yes chests: There are golden-red chests, and grey ones. You might think, the golden ones are more valuable? Well, nyes, they usually contain lvl1 armor which 90% of the time may be weaker then your current one, and needs to be upgraded. Grey chests dont even have to contain frequent items, some of them may even be rare. Oh boy oh boy.\n\nCombat-system:\nThis one is a big letdown, and one of the main aspects that almost ruin the game so listen up:\n- 90% of your enemies can block your attacks. Which means you spend way too much time on trying to somehow break their defense.\n- No recovery time. You do not get even half of a second of invulnarability when being hit, and every hit stuns you for about half a second. Enjoy the stun-locks. You will get them a lot.\n-BS- Bosses. I know I know... Bosses need to be hard. But also, they need to be fair. As your bossfight will be graded and rewarded according to your perfomance you would expect a fair fight. But no, while your grade gets worse about every minute or so, your enemies will do their very best to either:\n-Heal themselves\n-Run away (by teleport)\n-Build up a complete shield instantly, if you give them even just a millisecond of time to do so\n-Make 90% of the screen a 99% deadly hazard-zone. (yes, once you get caught you lose one life most of the time)\n-Do a combination of the things above\nIn effect the bossfights are quite frustrating. Also: BOSSFIGHTS are NOT announced. In other games you get a checkpoint, or a lot of chests, or a BIG HUGE DOOR that says "DANGER, DANGER! HIGH VOLTAGE!". Not in this game.\n\nThen two pet peeves of mine: Sometimes, areas that have been accessible before will be locked until further notive without any announcement, THANKS OBAMA!\nAlso: SOme of the areas are large in vertical measure, one wrong button press and you fall about 6 stories deep, without knowing whats going on. Happy climbing.\n\n\n\nTL, DR:\nGraphics, sound, fighting system are awesome.\nI hope you now understand why this game frustrates me. I love it I hate it. It is like a good castlevania game and expands the horizon by cool caracters, lots of skills , crafting and such. But it ruins it by adding bosses that act like little finches, complicated  controls without any need for that and a good deal of unfairness.\n\nIf you are totally into Castlevania and stuff  like that  and you can take a beating without crying, give it a try.\nIf you cannot deal with an unfair game and clumsy controls then hands off.\nLove you guys,\nGoobs out!\n\n\n","January 2","false","11.1"," 41 of 80 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","41","80","4","0"

I think you can roughly think of this as playing Zero on the Megaman series, since most of the action is melee. But it goes way beyond that.\n\nThe characters have smooth animations, the bosses are unique and have interesting treats and the puzzles are in a varied range of difficulty. Some things might be frustrating, but hey, those are the rarest items you're striving for, keep that in mind!\n\nVery few maps have some trap elements which were present in famous platform games, such as Castlevania or Megaman. One of these, for example, is when you are hit by a monster and there simply isn't any type of air recovery, which means falling. Sometimes falling can mean going down one of two maps, which means going through the monsters again... But, hey,  those parts ARE supposed to be hard, the player IS SUPPOSED to pay attention!\n\nAll in all,\nPros:\n+ Fantastic Graphics\n+ Fluid\n+ Rewards player skill rather than grinding\n+ Rewards for good boss fights\n+ Has a fair bunch of secrets/missables for replayability\n+ has two characters to choose from and two more to come, all of them unique in playstyle and customizable\n\nCons:\n- Not a walk in the park game, beware!\n- If you skip some of the dialoque, you might never have a chance to read it again, so pay attention\n- Occasional framerate drop in some very specific setups (city waterfalls, _one_ specific boss)","April 27, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also lots of boss fights, and not bullet sponge bosses, ones that will make you retry multiple times the first time you fight them. And no bugs, like, at all, nothing messed up the game, which is rare for a game made in the last 5 years (how f***ed up is that?)

This becomes extremely annoying at later levels in the game when some enemies and bosses spawn projectiles and sequences that take advantage of this mechanic.\n\nSave point system is also strange, since you cannot go back and equip the proper item in order to fight a boss or a environment hazard in some situations.\n\nOther than that, it´s a good old school Metroidvania.","July 29, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mapping feature is not quite as good as the SNES Super Metroid as it only shows you the section of territory you are currently in.  You will find a lot of customization of your character based on how you want to play the game.  Between armor and skill variations, along with a few choices in weapons, you can generally find a path of play that works best for how you want to go through the game.\n\nWhile the main story can be completed in around 5 to 8 hours on the first play through, it has a lot of potential for replay and continued play as more then one character is available for play (up to four different characters after you complete the game the first time).\n\nI would strongly recommend a controller of some form with shoulder buttons.  There are a number of options for special attacks and magic that a 8+ button controller is highly beneficial for game play.  While it might be possible to play with just the standard keyboard, I personally would have had alot of issues with the game play due to the way magic is activated in the game (holding the main control pad in one of the four main movement directions and then pushing the magic button).  The ability to switch magic effects on the fly is also much easier to handle if you have access to shoulder buttons on the control pad you are using.\n\nWhile the story of the game is interesting, I would not say I was overly won over by it.  If anything, I felt like I was playing the middle chapter of a longer game.  Effectively you are dropped into the middle of the story with very little background other then what is provided by the opening cinematic.  You get some hints at the character backgrounds as you progress through the various NPC interactions, but don't expect a deep and rich story.

With the stat increases I moved through the game more easily and I was finally able to beat the last boss (though I still had to skip a few optional bosses to maintain my sanity).\n\nI read a review once that said that this game is not for casual gamers...that might be true...and although I do wish this game had a casual mode, I am a casual gamer and I beat it, so there.

This is a great one. Huge map with tons of secrets everywhere, lots of different upgrades for every playstyle you would want. Combat is based around building up combos by stingin light and heavy moves with spells and skill cancels, with a focus mode that rewards long combos and a nice quick-swap system for spells so you can switch them out mid fight. Honestly, the combat is just really fun. Story is interesting, it throws a lot at you in the begining but once you play for a bit it's not terribly difficult to understand. The art is BEAUTIFUL, and the music is just as good.\n\nMy only complaints would be about difficulty, this is a very hard game, and it only gets harder as you go. With four modes of difficulty, it surprises me that they made Normal so punishing, I can only imagine what God-slayer must be like. However, it's not arbitrary difficulty as a skilled player that knows how to use skill cancels, dodges, and blocks can prevent most damage, but there are moments when enemies will juggle you for 40%~50% of you HP and the bosses tend to be damage sponges.\n\nHonestly, for $15 this is probably one of the best purchases you can make on steam, tons of gameplay with replayability and secrets to find.

Boss fights tend to feel like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: The Game, but they're clever and challenging, but not *too* difficult. So far, each boss has taken me three or four tries, which feels about right. The magic system is also clever, and adds a lot. Like Metroid, recently-acquired abilities have instant payoff in the platforming aspect.\n\nI can't wait to play more~","July 26, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hey, you. You there. Reading this review. Clearly you like games, because you're reading a review of one. By that reasoning, you probably also like being given a fair amount of control over the digital world of a game (or part of one). That feeling you get when you ride the fine line between "that was AMAZING!" and "that SUCKED amazingly!" That five second fingernails-on-a-chalkboard tense confrontation with a monster that has proven interested and capable of repurposing your spine as a coat tree. That instant where you finally throw the killing punch... only for the boss du jour to flip behind you and stab you through the everything - and force you to go and retrieve your hardware from halfway into the wall. Long story short: this game is bleeding-out-of-your-eyes fast paced, and if you are looking for anything like action, RPG goodness, or a difficulty spectrum ranging from challenging to spicy like hellfire, then you've found your destination.

My biggest complaint about the game is that you earn stat increases when you do well against bosses...which means the people (like myself) who need the stat increases don't get them. When I realized this, and after failing to defeat the final boss many MANY times, I finally decided to start the game over and retry every boss until I could pull off an A or S rank.  With the stat increases I moved through the game more easily and I was finally able to beat the last boss (though I still had to skip a few optional bosses to maintain my sanity).\n\nI read a review once that said that this game is not for casual gamers...that might be true...and although I do wish this game had a casual mode, I am a casual gamer and I beat it, so there.

The characters have some brief animations (like flinching when hit) that you cannot have control over, and can make you bounce like a pinball ball between the enemies attacks. This becomes extremely annoying at later levels in the game when some enemies and bosses spawn projectiles and sequences that take advantage of this mechanic.\n\nSave point system is also strange, since you cannot go back and equip the proper item in order to fight a boss or a environment hazard in some situations.\n\nOther than that, it´s a good old school Metroidvania.","July 29, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It offers an fairly high level of challenge, with boss battles on par with games like Dark Souls in difficulty; in both games, you can expect the fights to be extremely challenging as you learn them, and then be significantly easier with the right character build and player skill.\n\nWhat you get here is a great looking and well-polished Metroid-vania style side-scroller with lots of secrets and an emphasis on smooth combat that almost plays like a simple fighting game, all the way down to having assists. The game features a tremendous level of depth, with tons of equipment options, item drops and even a hybrid shop/crafting system that encourages you to kill all straggling enemies for their drops. The combat is really fun too, so you might find yourself going out of the way to kill enemies just because it feels great.\n\nWhat is quite unique about this game is the level of customizability that it offers, with multiple viable "builds" being possible among the 2 current playable characters; you can focus your skill tree such that your character is strong in melee combat, or you can make the character focus on defense and counters, or maybe you prefer to put a bunch of points into a specific branch of the spell tree that causes your attacks to scale with the luck attribute, doing extra melee damage to the enemy after you hit them with a spell.\n\nOn the negative side, this game is extremely frustrating (and I mean EXTREMELY), featuring a few obtuse (and often poor) design decisions that may cause you to have to navigate large parts of the map again because you were hit by a cheap attack from an enemy standing in an unfair vantage... or sometimes because your attack caused you to step just a tiny bit forward. There is lots of unnecessary design like this... highly remeniscent of the NES era of side-scrollers. That said, there is plenty of good here to make up for it, though the frustration may drive you away initally (so keep at it!).\n\nIt's sad to me that this game went so deep under the radar, since it's quite fun and very well made.

Frustratingly so!  Some of the bosses are cheap - and I mean extremely cheap.\n\nOthers are ... pathetic. You can stand in one spot the entire time and the boss basically doesn't do anything but jump all around the screen and eventually get near you so you whack the crap out of them.\n\nNeat story though confusing as sin when you first start the game. Some missables (meaning you'll never have a chance to go back and get them if you don't in the "right time" or at the "particular point in the game.")\n\nThe game is not designed really for the idea of 100% complete in all sections.  It is meant to be played over and over again.\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo, I started to play this game again in 2015 - it has been patched a lot from my first play through.  It is more polished, there are some bugs, but not as many as when I first played. It is _a lot_ better now.  It is still "about as finished" as when I first played though, they added a few more bosses. I am more consistent at getting "S Rank" on boss fights this time around as I understand the mechanics and the general "path" to follow to complete the game 100%.\n\nThere is only one area that I found was a true missable the last time I was in there and there are only a couple items/crew you can miss. So, 95% of the game is not "missable."\n\nYou can either find it or not and a good portion is "unmissable."\n\nSome of the "upgrading" is a bit warped - takes waaay to many materials to upgrade so I think that is a bug or a re-balancing issue.\n\nCertain builds (all or nothing) types are enthusiastically OP. If you don't build that way though... you will not have a good time. Or well, you will have a much harder game to complete. I really enjoyed my all stat/skill points in Luck Build that seems like one of the most OP builds in the game currently.\n\nI don't find the game as hard as I use - after configuring my controller a bit more to a more generic playstyle it is significantly easier than using a keyboard.","November 10, 2013","true","58.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Luckily even if you're like me and lack the ability to make the game work for you with it's skill cancels and wall acrobatics you can still get down and dirty giving as good as you get.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the game so far has to be the spells and affinity bar. Each directional key as well as jumping has a spell linked to it ranging from the left right directions being line shots to up and down having numerous utlity and damage uses from stealth to healing and even giving your attacks magical properties. The affinity bar is nifty because each slotted spell and equipped item (When they're aligned) slides it either towards Light or Dark giving you benefits related to your stats Neutral is naturally jack of all trades, Dark is for offense giving increase status effect chance and resistance penetration while Light focuses on survivability and utility giving bonus defenses and bonus damage on your Assists.\n\nI will reiterate that the game rewards skill relying on crackerjack timing for some of the puzzles...and sometimes just luck but the frustration melts away when you get to that chest and get a permanent upgrade, a snazzy new piece of armor or even make it to one of your crewmates who somehow got himself locked into a room you needed key items to get into...stupid crewmates.\n\nOn the whole Valdis Story : Abyssal City is fun, difficult and frustrating but definitely worth it if you enjoy games in it's genre or even if it's your first dip into the pool.","May 26, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Im guessing im just too stupid to take the whole story in though. There are some plot twists, but they are mostly towards the end and ,i'm sure, would have packed more punch to me if i had already known what the dogmas were.\nThe music all fits in perfectly and i found myself wanting to listen to it, "instead of muting it and putting my own music on like i do with most games", because i felt it might hurt the once in a lifetime experience that surrounds this game.\nIn our day and age, it's hard to get back the magic and wonder of playing and beating games like metroid and castlevania for the first time, one of the reasons being the internet. With a game this new and lesser known there is minimal online walkthroughs and guildes to help find stuff out, so a lot of the learning is left up to the player. I found myself multiple times looking for help online and finding none, and this isn't an easy game either.\nThe boss battles of this game are so amazing and well designed that i found myself really overjoyed and proud to beat them, "and with no help!"\nThere is however, a bit of a slow learning curve with how the game works and getting used to the fighting style. It took me until halfway through the game to learn how to use assists, "q btw."\nLeveling up is a little odd because of the stats being, "Str, Int,Agi...and...Luck?" most of my points in the end went to the Luck stat simply because it ended up giving me more boosts then the others for whatever reason. There is also a skill tree which can give you some really awesome advantages, i only wish i had focus on the skills i wanted to begin with and went to those first instead of last.\nThe ending of the game "NO SPOILERS", was kinda unexpected. I just thought it was like any other dungeon and had actually beat the final boss without even knowing. The ending of the game would have been really anticlimactic, if it wasnt for the fact of the sweet ending cutscene. The amount of pride that i help though, i'll remember for a long time.\nAll and all, this is a really great game and id totally suggest buying it, because believe me, you will never be able to get an experience like this again.","January 6, 2014","true","39.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For example, each crew member the Wyatt must find is detailed, unique, and have at least SOME backstory to give them personality\n-Levels are vibrant and also have a lot of variety\n-Enemies types are recycled a bit, but they have cool designs and the bosses are downright awesome\n\nA soundtrack that is, at times, beautiful, haunting, and tenaciously driving forward, all at once. Other times, it's just beautiful\n\nBittersweet Gameplay\n-Combat: move-canceling is introduced early on, and failing to use it to its fullest in respect to its limitations will leave the player frustrated and blaming the game's mechanics when the going gets tough. And boy, does it get TOUGH. Combos tend to leave one open for attack, so bad timing, spamming the attack button, canceling too early, and failing to mind enemies' attack patterns and environmental hazards will cause many to rage quit and not recommend the game. Once the player learns to cancel into a dash at the right moment, be defensive when the situation calls for it, utilize the right spells, and basically use the resources that the game gives you, the experience is fulfilling, as improvement can actually be felt with each boss fight won, each timed puzzle achieved, and each upgrade unlocked.\n\n-Movement: Not the best, but the cancel/dash is everything in this game. Certain platforming sequences are tough to pull off since jumping in this game is not as tight as others in this genre, but again, learning the mechanics of the game and working within them takes most of the kinks out, just not all. This game definitely needs a PS3 controller-type of D-pad to execute certain sequences with masterful precision. Unfortunately, too often there are platforming sequences where enemies are placed at the perfect position to hit you mid-jump, causing the player to be "stunlocked" so that you cannot recover in the air, thus forcing you to fall helplessly until you hit the ground. Additionally, the character can continously get hit by everything around them while in stunlock. The latter situation can be helped by move canceling into a dash, but the former can be overly punishing.\n\nAll in all, highly recommended for those that want a little bit of the technicality fighting games offer (I'm thinking of "roman cancel" from Guilty Gear and other fighters with canceling) mixed in with Metroid/Castelvania/Mega Man X level design and platforming and difficulty spikes that seem like they were meant as a challenge to only serious 2D sidescrolling fans. I personally would love to see more of this genre done this way and even a sequel to Valdis Story: Abyssal City that removes or limits "stunlock" and tightens up the overall frame data of combos and jumps, but even then, what makes these games great may turn off the majority of players out there. Therefore, the appeal really comes down to nostalgia for the SNES/GENESIS era and the prospect of taking an old genre and injecting modern gaming features (skill trees, customization, etc.).\n","January 6, 2014","true","19.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Watch the opening video, and you won't have any surprises in terms of what to expect. The video doesn't leave anything out. If you like what you see, consider buying it. If you don't, you won't like the game.\n\nIf you are thinking of purchasing the game, note that you could finish it in a single playthrough in about 3-5 hours. You will probably take a bit longer if you want to collect everything, or if you get lost or confused at where to go.

If you don't mind re-playing games, there's lots of difficulties, and you can build your character a different way every time you play.\n\nPros:\n-Fun combat\n-Good combat controls\n-Lots of difficulty options\n-Lots to find/collect to get 100% completion\n-Customizable characters\n\nCons:\n-Platforming controls can get frustrating\n-Short game\n\nOverall I recommend the game, but depending on your budget, there are some reasons to wait to buy it. I give the game a 8/10, taking a point for the length, and the platforming controls.","December 16, 2013","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But then I started it up. The menu music combined with the stunning handdrawn art immediately gripped my attention. Once in the game it felt responsive but limited until mechanic after mechanic were introduced and slowely everything in the world made sense. I felt in control at all times. I made the mistakes and I got the credit for achieving something but it's no DarkSouls. The game is forgeving in that you won't loose much progress by dying, since you'll just respawn in the same area, but unforgiving in that every enemy will punish sloppyness. Timing and propper use of your skills are of the essence. This combines perfectly with the rpg elements in the game. They are limited but during the game your character gets stronger, you get more skilled, and new movement mechanics add up giving you a real feeling of 'owning levels'. Now the story was rather enjoyable as well eventhough it didn't really matter to me but the endless fight between Heaven and Hell is always exciting and because the game has it's own lore for every element of that battle it was always interesting.\n\nThe use of magic felt a little weird at times though since I often triggered my dash instead of my spell but I loved the melee so much I didn't bother to get skilled at using magic. I felt like the itemcrafting wasn't explained at all but this didn't hinder me in the end (normal difficulty).\n\nFor some reason this game just clicked for me. It has rewarding gameplay in the line of DarkSouls, the looks of Bastion, and music like an older Final Fantasy.\n\nnote: I've played this game as warrior/guardian on normal.","January 10, 2014","true","11.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Currently two characters are playable, with two more promised: Wyatt is a swordsman who begins with dark and light magics that can be built to do a ton of damage and healing, while Reina is an unarmed monk whose starting magic focuses on utility and applying a powerful self-buff/enemy debuff combo that massively boosts her damage. Wyatt can also fight unarmed (using a pretty cool stance-based system), and both characters can obtain a few radically different weapons later in the game. The combat system basically consists of mixing up fast or strong ground attacks, launchers, aerial attacks, and spells (which are incredibly strong even for melee-focused characters). You also have skill cancels, charges which grant an invincible dash and also reset your animation to continue a combo.\n\nAs you gain experience and levels, you can place points in one of four stats: strength, agility, intelligence, or luck. Each level also grants one skill point, to be used in skill trees unique to each character. Building your characters gives a lot of potential replayability, as there are skills, spells, weapon upgrades, and accessories that dramatically alter how your character plays. For example, Reina can dedicate heavily to her Monk tree to get skills that raise her critical damage based on agility and further boost it during Focus mode, the length of which naturally increases with agility. Wyatt might choose to take advantage of his many skills that focus on slow attacks and strength, or he could become a spellcaster and take skills that increase the penetration and status affliction chances of his magic while making his normal attacks recover mana. Luck tends to be an all-around stat that raises different characteristics each time, but one accessory gives a massive boost to every other stat based on your luck while applying a constant HP drain. Each playthrough limits how many classes of magic you can upgrade, and you can only max out one weapon per playthrough, so there's an incentive to play again to try out different builds.\n\nThe normal enemies actually get to be very tough on higher difficulties until you get very familiar with how to deal with them, but the real meat of the game is the boss fights. Bosses hit very hard in this game, and you'll need to learn their patterns and when to use your skill cancels to stick on them without getting destroyed. You're ranked on how quickly and skillfully you kill the bosses, and gain permanent stats based on that rank.\n\nPlatforming is pretty easy early on, but gets to be VERY difficult in some of the later areas. This is kind of a con to the game, as the aerial controls are a bit limited and there's not really anything you can do to respond to an incoming attack that won't send you plummeting to the ground--the aerial dodge sends you straight down, and taking damage removes all control until you hit the ground. When there aren't enemies involved, it's a fair challenge.\n\nOther areas in which the game appears rough are the grammar (not well-edited), the story (which seems pretty cool and deep if you knew the details, but far too much is barely mentioned or explained), controller compatibility (360 controllers work, many others don't), and the resolution (which does not upscale well to fullscreen and only has 1x or 2x upscaling naturally supported for windowed). When using a controller, the skill cancel can be a bit touchy and go off at unwanted times, in my experience (and many others'). The game is still technically not complete, so there are some unfillable spots in the item list and a few other indications that something is missing.\n\nDespite those shortcomings, if you like challenging combat, RPG-style skillset building, replayability, a great soundtrack, and Metroidvania-style exploration and platforming, Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a great value as-is with more promised to come.","January 13, 2014","true","68.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I highly recommend it.\n\n[+] This game, unlike other metroidvania, is bit different. It's very fast paced hack and slash with combo system. In higher difficulty modes, even the minions you fight can be a battle. As for bosses, you try to get S grade to get extra bonus rewards and this will make you retry several times to achieve minimum of A (which can get frustrating).\n\n[-] But most frustrating part of the game isn't that. It's the odd / new controls. WASD isn't for moving and rather used for block/magic/light atk/strong atk. It doesn't stop there. This game takes some time to grasp the concept of how wall jumps and dodge (skill cancel) works. Not to mention that it probably has the worst double jump in gaming history (debatable). EVEN WORSE, the game has biggest "WTF WHY!?" moments. For instance, "The Pit" can be accessed without double jump. If you don't have double jump and go down, gg. You can't get back up. Another example, elder of Ishk asks for two items and tells where it's found. Never repeats it again. Just... WHY.\n\n[+]With that being said, there are many other things that make up for it. Such as, goddam, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing addicting. You feel so powerful when you cast magic and slash your enemies in combos. Likewise, magic spells in this game are creative and they aren't useless. You will have to backtrack but transportation system makes it so much easier. Lastly, two characters are available right now. They both have different playstyles, different weapons (each character has THREE different kinds), and different perspective of story.\n\nTL;DR despite some frustrating moments and odd controls, you will get used to them and will enjoy the game if you somewhat like metroidvania.","March 24, 2014","true","27.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Frustratingly so!  Some of the bosses are cheap - and I mean extremely cheap.\n\nOthers are ... pathetic. You can stand in one spot the entire time and the boss basically doesn't do anything but jump all around the screen and eventually get near you so you whack the crap out of them.\n\nNeat story though confusing as sin when you first start the game. Some missables (meaning you'll never have a chance to go back and get them if you don't in the "right time" or at the "particular point in the game.")\n\nThe game is not designed really for the idea of 100% complete in all sections.  It is meant to be played over and over again.\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo, I started to play this game again in 2015 - it has been patched a lot from my first play through.  It is more polished, there are some bugs, but not as many as when I first played. It is _a lot_ better now.  It is still "about as finished" as when I first played though, they added a few more bosses. I am more consistent at getting "S Rank" on boss fights this time around as I understand the mechanics and the general "path" to follow to complete the game 100%.\n\nThere is only one area that I found was a true missable the last time I was in there and there are only a couple items/crew you can miss. So, 95% of the game is not "missable."\n\nYou can either find it or not and a good portion is "unmissable."\n\nSome of the "upgrading" is a bit warped - takes waaay to many materials to upgrade so I think that is a bug or a re-balancing issue.\n\nCertain builds (all or nothing) types are enthusiastically OP. If you don't build that way though... you will not have a good time. Or well, you will have a much harder game to complete. I really enjoyed my all stat/skill points in Luck Build that seems like one of the most OP builds in the game currently.\n\nI don't find the game as hard as I use - after configuring my controller a bit more to a more generic playstyle it is significantly easier than using a keyboard.","November 10, 2013","true","58.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The graphics are nicely animated even if the backgrounds tend to come across a bit too obviously layered, the music does its job and the controls are for the most part functional.\n\nHowever, it has a number of laws that tend to make it somewhat more tiresome to play than others of its kind:\n\nThere's a severe lack of quick travel/warp options which isn't helped by the fact that NPCs that trade you items are all over the place: while most of them are located around the few quick travel points, there's at least one location with multiple NPCs you'll be bound to visit often that requires you to go through several enemy-filled screens to reach from the closest quick-travel point, and while the said location has an exit that leads back near the quick travel point, there's no equivalent entrance to it, which is just confusing.\n\nThe magic system, while varied, also has an annoying tendency to lump together offensive and defensive spells with the ones that're mainly used for exploration and while there's a quick-change screen for them, it'd be nice to have at least 2 or 3 layouts you could switch between depending on the enemy. You also can't see your currently equiped spells without entering the menu, which also slows down the process of switching them around.\n\nAs far as exploration is concerned, the game seems to have far too much focus on timed platforming puzzles: while having a few of them for variety's sake would've been nice, there's far too many of them in every dungeon for them to stay enjoyable. The jump physics also don't work quite as well with platforming as they do in combat, as the ledge-grabbing mechanics take some getting used to and jump velocity doesn't seem to match up to your movement. Finally, for whatever reason, your controls reset to neutral when you change screens, which can be extremely annoying during vertical screen transitions.\n\nI'm also not a huge fan of the way hitpauses are used in the game, as many of them seem to be too short to register mentally as anything but frame drops and take place during actions where they don't really serve much of a purpose, such as when activating a Focus Finisher. They would probably work better as slowdowns instead of action freezes.\n\nWhile the above issues aren't that severe, they still drag down the overall fun factor and playability in what's otherwise a good game: there's also an annoyingly large amount of mutually exclusive and missable content, including upgrades for entire sets of spells and skill points for the skills trees if you don't beat the optional bosses with an S rank. However, seeing as the game is still missing large amounts of its content, all of the above issues can still be fixed, in which case I'll be happy to recommend the game to anyone looking for a Metroidvania with a varied combat system and multiple unique characters, and as it is, it's still worth playing if you aren't turned off by the flaws listed above.","February 9, 2014","true","34.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061902191/recommended/252030/","76561198061902191","[Discon]Spectre","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061902191/","76 products in account","Let me just start by saying that I have about thirty games in my steam library I've purchased the past two years and this is the first one I will have played to completion (I'm very near the end).  I know many young adults are in this same predicament these days, too many games, not enough time.  Valdis Story is the first game I've played in a good while that was worth my time to complete it.  If you did a lot of growing up in the 90's and spent too much time playing super metroid, castlevania:sotn, and/or mega man x then this is a game you've been waiting for.\n\nThere are a lot of good reviews out there that go into more detail about the game and I'm going to leave it at that.  This review is more of a rebuttal to the negative reviews that I've seen.  Sure everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I'd hate for someone to be on the fence about this game and not buy it based off of imo a bogus review.\n\nFirst of all, I don't know why anyone would want to play a platformer without a controller.  The game is meant to be played with a controller, so yeah I guess it is frustrating playing without one.  This game, like many, requires xinput for your controller.  If you don't have an xbox or newer controller with xinput you can even get your old controllers to work using a program called x360ce (just google it) which emulates your old controller to a microsoft controller.  I have a 10 year old logitech controller I got for free and it works fine.\n\nSecond, difficulty.  I guess people just like playing interactive stories these days where you just keep moving forward and hitting the x button.  There are four difficulties, I skipped normal and went straight to hard, the 2nd of 4 difficulties, where I would say it provides a moderate challenge.  Moderate being I have never once died to normal mobs, a few bosses I have killed after my first try, most a few tries, and some several tries.  And I still made several mistakes when taking them down so there is definitely a lot of leeway there even on hard difficulty.  It is akin to contra where you have to memorize the pattern in order to succeed except unlike contra if you died you had to start at the very beginning of the game you get to start right at the boss fight again!  Thats right, you don't even have to run from your last save point back to the bosses room you can retry as many times as you like!  I imagine on the hardest difficulty you have to have the patterns memorized and play pretty much flawlessly.\n\nI've seen a few people complain about enemies juggling you.  If you allow 3-4 enemies to clump up on top of each other then sometimes, yes they can get a good juggle chain on you, it is something that rarely happens and when it does it is it is always your fault and it is never long before you can evade out of there.\n\n"Blocking does nothing."  At the start you can only block light attacks, you can upgrade your block to block heavier attacks.  This is something I actually very much like.  I read a review on steam where the person said enemies get stronger so it never feels like you never get stronger and I have to disagree with that, I think they hit a good balance between making enemies non-trivial and with all the abilities you pick up, still feel very powerful late game.  Also, I started out putting all my skill points into offensive things since killing things very quickly is usually a good strategy, but eventually I had to spend points on defensive abilities and things like purchasing a block upgrade really make your character feel more powerful.\n\nThere is no way for the game to punish you for exploring because even if you did make a wrong turn at albequerque you can just load from your last save.  But I never felt like I couldn't progress.  I will say there is one boss near the beginning of the game when you start really backtracking for the first time that may seem kind of harsh, but he is intended to be that way because it is completely optional to do so.  Just like there are optional bosses at the end of the game that are tougher than storyline bosses, because it is optional they increased difficulty to give challenge to those who seek it.  And even though that boss did seem very powerful for my character at that time I was still able to beat him after a few, ok several, tries.\n\nAs far as time puzzles and super mario jumping, none of the time puzzles have taken me more than a few tries.  I just recently went through the area that had one of the time puzzles I really struggled with and it was comical how easy it was after having played the game for awhile.  For jumping, I've been through the entire game except for the hallway to the final boss and there are only 2 areas where its a bit tedious on the super mario jumping skills.\n\nSo anywho, that is my review.  Game is well worth buying/playing through and has above average replayability.  If you played video games in the 80's/90's you might pee your pants laughing at the people saying this game is too hard on even the easiest difficulty.","February 11, 2014","true","69.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"I bought this game on a Steam sale..." I picked it up because it was cheap and vaguely remembered the Kickstarter. I never really thought I'd play it but once I started the game I powered through in just under three days (~8 hrs). The game's combat system and world are well realized and there are multiple characters and builds to play as (with more coming). It's a classic Metroidvania style game that hits the progression loop well.\n\nAt times I found the combat frustrating though. Many of the game's enemies can get you in a stun lock if you're not careful and the bosses in the game come with a three step recovery program. 1. Get your butt kicked, 2. Try again and do marginally better, 3. Take the boss down once you get down the pattern. This works well but until you understand the boss the battle can be rage inducing and life threatening to your controller of choice. Also I wish you could see a unified map rather than just pieces of it. Overall though if you're looking for a fun, well done, combat oriented Metroidvania I'd recommend the game.","February 14, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With the skill trees and attribute points you can customize a character as you see fit. Specific gear you find is also based also caters to the three skill trees. This allows you to play in various different ways. Magic abilities also change their effects based on where you position them in your ability slots. So the same spell being placed in your Up+Magic Attack and Down+Magic Attack will have completely different actions.\n\nThe game has a story that seems to go throughout the game as well, and so far it isn't something to write home about but it's nice that its there. Overall the game has a very fun atmosphere and with 4 different difficulty settings you can easily find a nice place to set your own challenges. You'll also find mini-platform/time based challenges in some rooms that lead to huge rewards. Normally I find this sort of thing frustrating but I have found it to be an enjoyable challenge so far in this game. Boss fights can also be fun and unique as they seem to have their own very unique abilities and ways of defeating them.\n\nWith a controller the game handles very well and plays with very few problems. I have not tried the keyboard option but these games usually don't work well with one. The music is also pretty top notch.\n\nI recommend this to anyone who enjoyed any of the Side-scrolling Castlevania games, especially if you like the idea of building your character the way you want.","January 1, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

While only two of the four main characters are playable right now, those two are quite well polished, and not only do they have their own distinct playstyles, but separate personalities as well. Wyatt is, well, angry, angry at the goddesses for how they treat humans and angry at the demons and angels for working with them. Unlike many characters like him, his anger is also reflected in how he acts around his friends. He may not be attacking them or insulting them, but he speaks in small amounts and doesn't give off the feeling that he particularly likes pretty much anyone except for Reina, the other character that can be played right now. Reina, on the other hand, was raised as a monk and acts quite differently than Wyatt. Where Wyatt sees angels and demons and attacks them on sight, Reina will often ask them to let her pass first. She's more polite and more controlled, and often seems to wish that she could avoid many of the fights that happen.\nAs far as the gameplay goes, not only do the two offer very different playstyles from the start, but the unlockable weapons add more variation from there. My personal favorite was a bow and dagger that Wyatt could unlock- it couldn't break blocks nor could you block while using it, but the added range and speed worked very well with my playstyle, even more so when I upgraded the bow to poison targets. Overall, the game is very well done, particularly for a game that's still a work in progress. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes combat platformers.","January 1, 2014","true","98.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has so much of what I look for in a video game; fun combat mechanics, beautiful visuals, and an awesome story. This is basically a 2d style side scroller with a metroidvania feel to it. If I had to compare this to other games, it's kind of a cross between metroid prime, castlevania and megaman x (with some of the platforming mechanics). However, it also has an RPG system that allows for different game play styles, but isn't too convoluted either. This game is gorgeous, but I would definitely say the highlight would be the fun, challenging and visually breath taking combat.","May 18, 2015","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Let's do pros and cons.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-The music is quite filthy. Bits of the main theme can be heard in a lot of the songs, which I like.\n\n-Nice art, everything looks great and unique, a nice break from the onslaught of pixel platformers.\n\n-Plenty of loot and secrets. The best loot is your crew you can find scattered around the place. It's really cool finding them and being able to talk to them, get upgrades from them, or even use them in combat. Finding new armor is always good as well.\n\n-Combat is pretty fun, beating up demons and stuff is great.\n\n-There's a good amount of customization as far as combat goes, with skill trees, unique and interesting weapons and armor, and a few stats you can put points into.\n\n-Lots of extremely cool bosses.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-The map could stand to be a lot better. It only shows the area you're in, where the exits are, where save points are, and where locked doors are. Ideally, I'd like to see it show the entire world, or at least have labels on the exits saying where they go to. This problem lessens a bit as you become familiar with what goes where, but it can be a bit confusing.\n\n-Main story objectives are not clear at all sometimes. When you open the map, it'll tell you them, but it'll just say things like, "Go find this item". It won't always remind you where you're supposed to go to get that item. Also, even if you know where you're supposed to go, the map isn't particularly helpful in getting there, as it doesn't say where exits go to.\n\n-Not a lot of warning before bosses. I wandered into a room, and for some reason the avatar of the light god was there and murdered me. Maybe a special boss door before boss rooms or something would be nice.\n\n-There's this one jumping puzzle near the beginning that's timed and way harder than any other jumping puzzles I've encountered so far. The rest have been fine, just this one was annoying enough to be a con on its own.\n\n-Wall jumping isn't as smooth as it could be, and sometimes you're trying to wall jump but you cling on to a edge instead. This is most annoying during timed jumping puzzles.\n\n-Minor complaint, but I didn't like the default keyboard and mouse controls at all, so I rebound them, and now it gives me the wrong key prompts.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'd definitely recommend it. If you're a completionist or something though, I can imagine it driving you absolutely insane trying to get all the S ratings and all the items and everything. I've been playing it with a somewhat casual attitude and I haven't regretted my purchase.","July 13, 2014","true","22.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has a fantastic story, great character development, a lot of awesome music, beautiful art, and a combat system that suits everyone's personal playstyle. As like any traditional RPG, your character levels and you are allowed to set points into stats and skills (Meele/Defensive/Spells). Currently, there are 2 playable characters that, as far as I can see, share the same story. If you finish the story on one character, the other one shouldn't be too tough to play. At the time of this review, the developers are planning on releasing two additional characters; so look forward to that!\n\nNow, to the gameplay. On my first playthrough, I tried the game on Hard difficulty. First of all, you may want to rebind keys that are the most comfortable for you. Personally, I like WASD for movement and IJKL for combat and the CTRL key for blocking (I don't have any experience with gamepad, but this game definitely supports it). The game starts off pretty easy, but man does it get tough later on. There are the basic light/heavy attacks that you can combo and the armor/accessories that provide passive skills (ex. Extra damage every 6th attack). For the main character, there are about 4-5 weapons that each have unique attacks and can totally alter your playstyle. Most importantly, you have an ability called Skill Cancel that gives you about a 0.25s invincibility frame that you can dash with and avoid deadly combos. This ability takes about 2sec to recharge and doesn't recharge while you're attacking or being attacked, so you have to avoid attacks (like blocking) often. Later on, you gain more charges of Skill Cancels and have passive skills that recharge it more quickly. Bosses get really tough and test your abilities. They become easier when you know their pattern, but it's still hard to avoid some of their attacks as they require perfect execution within a miniscule window of time.\n\nWhen you defeat bosses, you get scored for your time, damage taken, and skill (Like combos and dodging their attacks). Get a great score (Rank A) and you get stat boosts. Achieve an amazing score (Rank S) and you get a skill point. Personally, I've only been able to get Rank S on a few bosses, in which there are dozens, and it took me many retries. You only get one chance to kill the boss and get a good score, else you have to start from the save point and fight 'em again. If things get too rough, you can farm monsters and level up. I personally didn't find grinding all that boring - I used them as opportunity to test out combos and refine my skills.\n\nMy only issue is that sometimes, the movement feels a bit wonky. When you do an attacking without pointing a direction after landing on the ground, it does a little dash forward. There was this extremely annoying boss that stands on platforms the width of 2x your character and you'd always fall off into a pit of poison that drains health/mana. Wall jumping sometimes gets confusing in such that they made it so that you can't jump off the same side of the wall twice - if you miss the parallel wall while wall jumping, you cannot jump off the same side again and you will plummet down to the bottom and do it all over. This is an annoyance for the larger gaps.\n\nTLDR;\nAmazing Metroidvania-like game with RPG elements. Great story/character development/gameplay/music/art. Combat has a steep difficulty curve in regards to bosses, but still fun and rewarding. Skill Cancel is vital to gameplay; won't be able to defeat bosses without it. Some minor issues with the movement. Many, many hours of great fun!","January 2, 2014","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

While only two of the four main characters are playable right now, those two are quite well polished, and not only do they have their own distinct playstyles, but separate personalities as well. Wyatt is, well, angry, angry at the goddesses for how they treat humans and angry at the demons and angels for working with them. Unlike many characters like him, his anger is also reflected in how he acts around his friends. He may not be attacking them or insulting them, but he speaks in small amounts and doesn't give off the feeling that he particularly likes pretty much anyone except for Reina, the other character that can be played right now. Reina, on the other hand, was raised as a monk and acts quite differently than Wyatt. Where Wyatt sees angels and demons and attacks them on sight, Reina will often ask them to let her pass first. She's more polite and more controlled, and often seems to wish that she could avoid many of the fights that happen.\nAs far as the gameplay goes, not only do the two offer very different playstyles from the start, but the unlockable weapons add more variation from there. My personal favorite was a bow and dagger that Wyatt could unlock- it couldn't break blocks nor could you block while using it, but the added range and speed worked very well with my playstyle, even more so when I upgraded the bow to poison targets. Overall, the game is very well done, particularly for a game that's still a work in progress. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes combat platformers.","January 1, 2014","true","98.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art and music both wonderfully form the backdrop for a very in depth story, and while all the art and script alone would make a great show or movie, it's all simply the stage for a highly customizable combat game. It starts easy and simplistic, and ends with a complex battle system that you slowly master. Extra points for high replay value due to the extra bosses, hidden items, game elements, AND multiple ways to build each character. Building a high strength character using one weapon plays very different than the same character building int/agi and using a diffent weapon and skill priority.\nI can't wait for futher development of this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forcesofodin/recommended/252030/","forcesofodin","ForcesOfOdin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forcesofodin/","342 products in account","Incredibly beautiful and satisfying "metroidvania". The Metroid and Castlevania Symphony of the Night (CSotN) games are the most famous of the early attempts to turn 2d games into open world games. Exploration is key, and progress usually involves a new ability or item allowing you to explore new areas, and new secrets within areas you may have already explored.\n\n\nThis game takes a lot from Castlevania Symphony of the night, with a similar Trigger Button + direction to create magic, with its focus on melee combat outside of spells. Fans of CSotN might be dissapointed by the (relatively) small amount of equippable items. Besides that, I have to say this game is absuletly incredible and a real contentder for the best metroidvania game since Metroid Prime (I wanted to say since CSotN but Metroid Prime is stupidly good). Here's what I like about this game:\n\nMultiple characters to choose from, where they really are different in movesets, weaponry, spells, and stats wise. The first two characters you start with unlocked, and two more to be unlocked. The first is a male sword wielding warrior, and is considerably easier to use (at first) than the monk-like, female second character. Either one controls flawlessly, with VERY responsive controls (I played using an xbox controller).\n\nThere is a block button, but the block button is usually not as good as the dodge mechanic. The dodge mechanic has you hitting "A" on the controller, and then a move of your character to the left or right will have your character do a dash in the direction you chose. While dashing you're invulnerable, and there's many attacks that require you to dash through them. If you're in air the "A" button will have you plummet to the ground quickly, which is a nice convenience, a puzzle element, and a get-the-f-out dodge for aerial attacks.\n\nYour melee attacks are two-fold, a light attack (X button) and a heavy attack (Y button) which can be mixed and matched or repeated in order to create a surprising variety of combo attacks. The attacks feel satisfying, and are fun to play with because of the variety in which light and heavy attacks can be combined into novel combo animations.\n\nThe movement is rock solid in general, although the platforming is a little, very little bit floaty. You don't build up momentum like you would in mario, though this never really bothered me. Even when you have to jump to and from very skinny platforms, falling felt like my fault and not the fault of movement mechanics/physics. You grab on to ledges automatically, which is nice, but I do wish that grabbing was its own button because sometimes you'd rather wall jump off the near top of a platform instead of grab-on.\n\nMagic comes in several elemental varieties , with most having to be unlocked. Four spell slots ( corresponding to up, down, left/right are the same but in-air is its own spell slot so there are four) can be assigned one spell from any of the elements, The spell type depends on the element and which slot it is assigned to. Left/right holy magic, is always the same spell, but is a different spell than you would get assigning dark element or any other element to the same left/right spell slot.\n\nA problem that plagues many games is the usefulness and balance of the spells. I'd say that I feel healing spells are a little bit costly for the amount they heal, and that some of the Damage over Time (DoT) spells are a bit overpowered. Like the potion in castlevania series, the DoT attacks launch a projectile that stops upon monster-impact or after a fixed maximum distance. When they hit their mark they do damage each second or so until the spell wears off. The variety of spells is excellent, with 6 or 8 elements and 4 slots you have between 24 and 32 spells. Many spells in a given element have similar counterparts to spells in another element, but each element has its own flavor and elemental differences come to play in the rpg mechanics of the game.\n\nThe game is very much an rpg, with experience points from combat leading to level-ups, which give you a stat point and a skill point (a la Diablo). The skill tree is typical of post-Diablo skill trees. There are three different "trees", offensive, defensive , and magical. Each tree has 3 skills per level , and 5 or so levels. Points in the second level can only be placed if you have 5 points placed in total AND at least one of those points is directly above the desired second level skill.\n\nThe music is honestly not amazing, it's just there. It certainly detracted nothing from the game, but it pales in comparison to CSotN and Metroid's legendary soundtracks. However the sound effects are a notch better, still not the best you can find, but plenty satisfying when it comes to hit sounds, unique monster noises, and spell effects. Some sound effects (notably those in the wintery area) are almost laughably similar to those in CSotN, but that may more of a nod to the predecessor than a symptom of carelessness.\n\nThe monsters provide a solid variety of movement/attack behaviors. Some are about your character's size, and some are huuuge. Some fly, some walk, and some do a bit of both. You'll find that the enemies each have their own patterns and openings which are learned through repetition (a la Dark Souls). However, like Dark Souls, the enemy variation more than makes up for the redundant feelings that accumulate over time. You will kill the same enemy type many many times, but I never got bored of the killing. Killing a monster because you know its pattern is very rewarding, and it's excellent to play a game where skill is as much of a factor as your character's "level" (again like Dark Souls).\n\nThe visuals are stunning 2d, with beautiful tile sets that vary a lot around the different areas in the game world. The enemies and Character sprites are very colorful and detailed, with smoother features than you'd find in more pixelated old-school games. The usually bright, contrast heavy color choices are well done, and don't make the game feel cartoony in a trivial way. The whole look screams production value and care. It's some of the best 2d graphics I've seen outside of the last two Rayman games (which are INSANELY beautiful), and it's not quite as good as CSotN's pixelated style (it is close though).\n\nAll in all I'd say you're a fool if you miss out on this game, and I reccomend it whole-heartedly to anyone who likes the metroidvania style of 2d games. Let's call it an exploratory-action-rpg-platformer.","January 4, 2014","true","5.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Different weapons, armors, and spells keeps things fresh and the level up system (three branching skill trees) allows the game to played in a variety of ways. I am not a nihilist for perfect grades, but I found I liked the Boss grading system. This system gives you a letter grade based on how you performed in a boss fight-if you used any potions, if you kept the combo counter high, and time to complete. You are usually given a reward in the form of a permanent upgrade in a stat. I find myself purposefully losing a boss fight so I could retry it and get a better grade.

Overall -- 85/100.\n\nThe combat is challenging and extremely fun. You have light attacks that combo quickly, heavy attacks that break guards but will get interrupted at times, block (with option to parry if timed correctly), magic actions, an assist function (similar to Marvel vs Capcom i guess), and a quick dodge system.  You can also choose which kind of armor (all offering various bonuses), weapons, and skill points to use to suit your style of play.  This is not an easy game if you choose a high difficulty setting.\n\nThe story is interesting, although admittadly not its selling point.  At the very least, it makes sense and doesnt try to confuse you with nonsensical plot developments.  Its a simple Angels vs. Demons conflict with humans struggling to survive in the midst of it... and theres not too much more to it.\n\nLength and replayability wise.... first playthrough may last you 5-10 hours depending if you attempt the side bosses and are on a reasonable difficulty setting.  The story doesnt really change between the 2 characters very much, but the combat style is different so it may be worthwhile there.  The developer has promised 2 additional playable characters in a free DLC in the future... whether or not the game will change much beyond combat style, i dont know.  Either way, you may just wish to try the game again on a higher difficulty and test your skill.\n\nPresentation wise... there are a few glaring issues that really need to be addressed, but the total package is still very good.  The graphics are very pleasing, combat is well animated, and even a lot of the backgrounds have great detail.  The music is absolutely fantastic and really helps set the mood.  The sound effects are generally good, however... there are times where they will suddenly spike in volume (especially water flowing) and create extremely unpleasant scratchy sounds.  The UI is fine as far as equipment and skill trees is concerned, but can often be very clumsy equipping magic especially because some of the magic is almost entirely a platforming gimmick (ice wall, im looking at you).  Another annoyance is that the game overfills 1920x1080 monitors in windowed mode, but if you are playing in fullscreen mode and quickly switch to another application (such as skype), the game will revert to windowed mode, requiring you to go back into the options and select fullscreen again... would be much simpler to have a borderless windowed option or simply minimize when switching to another application momentarily.  Alternatively you can use software such as shiftwindow to alleviate this, but i dont feel it should be the user's responsibilty to use a 3rd party program...","February 13, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The combat is the high point.  They implement a lot of ways to attack and pull of combinations using both light/heavy attacks along with magic.  Each power you get has multiple uses either for the environment or in combat, ie the double jump can also juggle enemies in the air if you hit them with it.  There is a lot of treasure to find and each has their own unique properties that can change your playstyle along with a skill tree.  Currently it has 2 characters that are quite different from each other and you will want to try them both out and 2 more on their way.  Story wise it has it's own lore and world, if you get into it you can enjoy it but I was just having too much fun to care for it.  Bosses and enemies are well done in it so you have to read movements and utilize different strategies as the game goes on.  Some parts can get quite difficult but there's nothing stopping you from grinding a bit since enemies respawn the moment you reeneter a room.  Later on you might feel a bit overpowered but it has multiple difficulty settings and each character has it's own skill level so if you play as Wyatt first and use Reina in the next playthrough you'll have to adjust and come up with new tactics.

There is an element of trial and error as you learn attack patterns, but nailing a tough boss after a protracted fight is extremely satisfying. The game gives you a large enough toolbox to make fights organic and exciting. A boss' attack can be evaded with a dodge move or a timely jump. You might also be able to block it with your shield or blow through it with a defensive spell. Perhaps you could even be prevent the attack altogether with a well timed big hit. No matter how you play it, it's all very satisfying and deaths are not severely punished the way they are in certain other 'challenging' games.\n\nThe main issue with the game is it seems to enjoy doing puzzle platforming sections that rely on basically leaping from ledge to ledge against a timer. Nothing has been too irritating yet, but I can see this being frustrating for some.\n\nThe game's skill and magic system is also a bit obscure. You'll get an item that says it needs to be 'patched up' and the game will give no indication about how you might do that. The skill system is also filled with all sorts of terminology that the game doesn't bother explaining in the least bit, leaving you wondering if it's a good idea to inflict Retribution or gain a defensive bonus after dodging.\n\nStill, those drawbacks are set aside by some good old Metroidvania action.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forcesofodin/recommended/252030/","forcesofodin","ForcesOfOdin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forcesofodin/","342 products in account","Incredibly beautiful and satisfying "metroidvania". The Metroid and Castlevania Symphony of the Night (CSotN) games are the most famous of the early attempts to turn 2d games into open world games. Exploration is key, and progress usually involves a new ability or item allowing you to explore new areas, and new secrets within areas you may have already explored.\n\n\nThis game takes a lot from Castlevania Symphony of the night, with a similar Trigger Button + direction to create magic, with its focus on melee combat outside of spells. Fans of CSotN might be dissapointed by the (relatively) small amount of equippable items. Besides that, I have to say this game is absuletly incredible and a real contentder for the best metroidvania game since Metroid Prime (I wanted to say since CSotN but Metroid Prime is stupidly good). Here's what I like about this game:\n\nMultiple characters to choose from, where they really are different in movesets, weaponry, spells, and stats wise. The first two characters you start with unlocked, and two more to be unlocked. The first is a male sword wielding warrior, and is considerably easier to use (at first) than the monk-like, female second character. Either one controls flawlessly, with VERY responsive controls (I played using an xbox controller).\n\nThere is a block button, but the block button is usually not as good as the dodge mechanic. The dodge mechanic has you hitting "A" on the controller, and then a move of your character to the left or right will have your character do a dash in the direction you chose. While dashing you're invulnerable, and there's many attacks that require you to dash through them. If you're in air the "A" button will have you plummet to the ground quickly, which is a nice convenience, a puzzle element, and a get-the-f-out dodge for aerial attacks.\n\nYour melee attacks are two-fold, a light attack (X button) and a heavy attack (Y button) which can be mixed and matched or repeated in order to create a surprising variety of combo attacks. The attacks feel satisfying, and are fun to play with because of the variety in which light and heavy attacks can be combined into novel combo animations.\n\nThe movement is rock solid in general, although the platforming is a little, very little bit floaty. You don't build up momentum like you would in mario, though this never really bothered me. Even when you have to jump to and from very skinny platforms, falling felt like my fault and not the fault of movement mechanics/physics. You grab on to ledges automatically, which is nice, but I do wish that grabbing was its own button because sometimes you'd rather wall jump off the near top of a platform instead of grab-on.\n\nMagic comes in several elemental varieties , with most having to be unlocked. Four spell slots ( corresponding to up, down, left/right are the same but in-air is its own spell slot so there are four) can be assigned one spell from any of the elements, The spell type depends on the element and which slot it is assigned to. Left/right holy magic, is always the same spell, but is a different spell than you would get assigning dark element or any other element to the same left/right spell slot.\n\nA problem that plagues many games is the usefulness and balance of the spells. I'd say that I feel healing spells are a little bit costly for the amount they heal, and that some of the Damage over Time (DoT) spells are a bit overpowered. Like the potion in castlevania series, the DoT attacks launch a projectile that stops upon monster-impact or after a fixed maximum distance. When they hit their mark they do damage each second or so until the spell wears off. The variety of spells is excellent, with 6 or 8 elements and 4 slots you have between 24 and 32 spells. Many spells in a given element have similar counterparts to spells in another element, but each element has its own flavor and elemental differences come to play in the rpg mechanics of the game.\n\nThe game is very much an rpg, with experience points from combat leading to level-ups, which give you a stat point and a skill point (a la Diablo). The skill tree is typical of post-Diablo skill trees. There are three different "trees", offensive, defensive , and magical. Each tree has 3 skills per level , and 5 or so levels. Points in the second level can only be placed if you have 5 points placed in total AND at least one of those points is directly above the desired second level skill.\n\nThe music is honestly not amazing, it's just there. It certainly detracted nothing from the game, but it pales in comparison to CSotN and Metroid's legendary soundtracks. However the sound effects are a notch better, still not the best you can find, but plenty satisfying when it comes to hit sounds, unique monster noises, and spell effects. Some sound effects (notably those in the wintery area) are almost laughably similar to those in CSotN, but that may more of a nod to the predecessor than a symptom of carelessness.\n\nThe monsters provide a solid variety of movement/attack behaviors. Some are about your character's size, and some are huuuge. Some fly, some walk, and some do a bit of both. You'll find that the enemies each have their own patterns and openings which are learned through repetition (a la Dark Souls). However, like Dark Souls, the enemy variation more than makes up for the redundant feelings that accumulate over time. You will kill the same enemy type many many times, but I never got bored of the killing. Killing a monster because you know its pattern is very rewarding, and it's excellent to play a game where skill is as much of a factor as your character's "level" (again like Dark Souls).\n\nThe visuals are stunning 2d, with beautiful tile sets that vary a lot around the different areas in the game world. The enemies and Character sprites are very colorful and detailed, with smoother features than you'd find in more pixelated old-school games. The usually bright, contrast heavy color choices are well done, and don't make the game feel cartoony in a trivial way. The whole look screams production value and care. It's some of the best 2d graphics I've seen outside of the last two Rayman games (which are INSANELY beautiful), and it's not quite as good as CSotN's pixelated style (it is close though).\n\nAll in all I'd say you're a fool if you miss out on this game, and I reccomend it whole-heartedly to anyone who likes the metroidvania style of 2d games. Let's call it an exploratory-action-rpg-platformer.","January 4, 2014","true","5.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The spell system can get a bit annoying as you can only equip 4 spells to each direction ala smash bros style, and there are certain spells that is required to go through new areas such as a fire fist which breaks walls and the obvious double jump.  This forces the player to keep them on as the player can get constantly  annoying in doing so.\nOther then what was said above, i highly recommend this game to anyone a fan of this genre.","February 12, 2014","true","56.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It has a great fighting system, which is easy enough to pick up but  difficult to master. I love the variety of the loot. Different weapons, armors, and spells keeps things fresh and the level up system (three branching skill trees) allows the game to played in a variety of ways. I am not a nihilist for perfect grades, but I found I liked the Boss grading system. This system gives you a letter grade based on how you performed in a boss fight-if you used any potions, if you kept the combo counter high, and time to complete. You are usually given a reward in the form of a permanent upgrade in a stat. I find myself purposefully losing a boss fight so I could retry it and get a better grade. Though I have yet to beat the game, it is a great game and I honestly have to say it is my new favorite of the metroidvania genre.","February 12, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Overall -- 85/100.\n\nThe combat is challenging and extremely fun. You have light attacks that combo quickly, heavy attacks that break guards but will get interrupted at times, block (with option to parry if timed correctly), magic actions, an assist function (similar to Marvel vs Capcom i guess), and a quick dodge system.  You can also choose which kind of armor (all offering various bonuses), weapons, and skill points to use to suit your style of play.  This is not an easy game if you choose a high difficulty setting.\n\nThe story is interesting, although admittadly not its selling point.  At the very least, it makes sense and doesnt try to confuse you with nonsensical plot developments.  Its a simple Angels vs. Demons conflict with humans struggling to survive in the midst of it... and theres not too much more to it.\n\nLength and replayability wise.... first playthrough may last you 5-10 hours depending if you attempt the side bosses and are on a reasonable difficulty setting.  The story doesnt really change between the 2 characters very much, but the combat style is different so it may be worthwhile there.  The developer has promised 2 additional playable characters in a free DLC in the future... whether or not the game will change much beyond combat style, i dont know.  Either way, you may just wish to try the game again on a higher difficulty and test your skill.\n\nPresentation wise... there are a few glaring issues that really need to be addressed, but the total package is still very good.  The graphics are very pleasing, combat is well animated, and even a lot of the backgrounds have great detail.  The music is absolutely fantastic and really helps set the mood.  The sound effects are generally good, however... there are times where they will suddenly spike in volume (especially water flowing) and create extremely unpleasant scratchy sounds.  The UI is fine as far as equipment and skill trees is concerned, but can often be very clumsy equipping magic especially because some of the magic is almost entirely a platforming gimmick (ice wall, im looking at you).  Another annoyance is that the game overfills 1920x1080 monitors in windowed mode, but if you are playing in fullscreen mode and quickly switch to another application (such as skype), the game will revert to windowed mode, requiring you to go back into the options and select fullscreen again... would be much simpler to have a borderless windowed option or simply minimize when switching to another application momentarily.  Alternatively you can use software such as shiftwindow to alleviate this, but i dont feel it should be the user's responsibilty to use a 3rd party program...","February 13, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There is an element of trial and error as you learn attack patterns, but nailing a tough boss after a protracted fight is extremely satisfying. The game gives you a large enough toolbox to make fights organic and exciting. A boss' attack can be evaded with a dodge move or a timely jump. You might also be able to block it with your shield or blow through it with a defensive spell. Perhaps you could even be prevent the attack altogether with a well timed big hit. No matter how you play it, it's all very satisfying and deaths are not severely punished the way they are in certain other 'challenging' games.\n\nThe main issue with the game is it seems to enjoy doing puzzle platforming sections that rely on basically leaping from ledge to ledge against a timer. Nothing has been too irritating yet, but I can see this being frustrating for some.\n\nThe game's skill and magic system is also a bit obscure. You'll get an item that says it needs to be 'patched up' and the game will give no indication about how you might do that. The skill system is also filled with all sorts of terminology that the game doesn't bother explaining in the least bit, leaving you wondering if it's a good idea to inflict Retribution or gain a defensive bonus after dodging.\n\nStill, those drawbacks are set aside by some good old Metroidvania action. It's fun. It had a boss based on Rubick, what more do you need?\n\nThe one flaw:\nI don't like the game's ranking system though. It's one of those "You got hit, D rank" games that get a bit obnoxious. I don't need some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ judging me after I beat an incredibly tough boss fight.

The longer your combos are the more experience points enemies are worth but getting hit ends your combo so you'll have to use parries and dash cancelling to maximize your combos. Boss fight ranks are based on speed, damage, and your remaining health. Do good enough for an A or S rank and you gain permanent stat increases!\n\nAll weapons have different combos and all armors and accessories have unique abilities so instead of just picking the ones with the best stats you can choose the one that best suits your playstyle, even unarmed has equipment to buff it! There are three skill trees (offense, defense, and magic) each with 15 skills but only 20 levels to gain skill points with, though you are awarded a few points for sidequests as well.\n\nYou can only save at save points which also fully heal you and are the only healing outside of magic. Anytime you do get a game over you are given a chance to retry, this restarts you in the area you died with full health and mana so you don't have to walk all the way back from the save point everytime you die to a boss.\n\nThe games puzzles are all activating doors, by ground stomping or magically charging a switch, and then dashing to get through it before it reseals. Most hard ones are optional so if you aren't good at platforming you can still get through the game and there are some abilities that help make them easier such as double jump and wall jump.\n\nEvery area has things you can't get the first time through but the backtracking isn't bothersome because quite a few areas have new bosses when you return and enemies scale with you as to not make it boring.\n\nOverall, Valdis Story: Abyssal City is a great game and I recommend it to anyone looking for an action platformer.","January 8, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I would personally highly recommend this game to individuals who are a fan of the genre and would still encourage any fans of side-scrollers to at least give the free demo a shot. As a side note, its soundtrack is excellent.\n\nCriticizms would probably be a steep learning curve, events that you can overlook that can greatly impact your playthrough, and the fact that the game is rather short after 2-3 playthroughs; when you've become quite familiar with the general game path and have a solid grasp on combat, the game flies by.\n\nAll that said, though, bang for buck this is a truly excellent purchase that I cannot recommend enough.","January 1, 2014","true","87.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The short list of accomplishements are the combat which is fluid and entertaining, the fast pased gameplay, and the gorgious environments which I take to include the soundtrack.  This for me was not a game that sat in my steam library and never got played.  I turned it on, and started at hard mode, which privided just enough challenge to bring out the worst in me, but every challenge I faced was conquerable, it just actually required me to strategize, and plan ahead.  It has been a LONG time since a game made me think like this.  I also do want to comment on the level design.  Every stepping stone is well placed, and i've yet to find a single exploit or lack of flow.  Well done.\n\nNow for my very few qualms which are all things that can and hopefully will be added in later patches.\n-The graphics in the game are all very intentionally low res, but if atleast some of the interface items could go up to 1080p level ppi that would be nice.\n-The map system leaves something to be desired.  I would love to be able to zoom out and see how the different maps connect.  ( I realize now that I havent checked the manual to see if this option is hidden somewhere.)\n-I debated on counting this as an opportunity, but the objectives are always a bit bland, and dont ovffer much guidance as to where to go next.  Right now I progress through just by finding doors I wasnt previously able to go through WHICH IS EXACTLY THE POINT!  I still however would enjoy some more sidequests, and maybe even mini games to break up the play style in between venturing out to obtain the next arbitrary artifact that we desperately need to solve this problem.\n\n\nThis is longer than anyone will read, but  I still want to comend this game and its developers for sticking with the project, and focusing on getting the core game (which is vast) out in a beautiful way.  I cannot wait to see how the project expands.","January 22, 2014","true","25.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Combined with the fact that much of the game relies on these controls, for things such as "s" ranking prizes with little room for error, and for generally just getting around, it really comes off as a "best of intentions concept," but a do not buy. Unless, of course, you have the calm state of a buddha.\n\nA shame as the art style and much of the game has the feel of a castelvania-ish 2d platformer that steam has a short supply of, and maybe, as they patch some of the issues, many of the issues (such as pound platforms not registering even when hit) will be fixed, but a large part of this game comes down to bad planning in both the control scheme and puzzle layouts.\n\nIf however you enjoy games that offer a "swearing inducing challenge" due to split second, near inhuman reaction requirements and can put up with more then a few errors, then this may still be the game for you. But for the layman gamer?\n\nRun.\n\nFor future designers of games, please remember, don't make dash "press down, then forward" and then also assign magic spells with a cast time to the same thing your going to link timed puzzle pushes too, that use the exact same button+movement, plus that self same dash one microsecond before hand.","January 11, 2014","false","6.2"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","0"

How could anyone say this game was designed so well? Enemies stunlock you all the god damned time in congested groups, or even just ONE of them. The jumping "puzzles" are overly precise and not really based on skill, seeing as I seem to get a different jump height every time I walljump. Plus, the wall spikes and such have massive hitboxes. The enemies will even stunlock you midair while platforming with ranged attacks, usually offscreen or too far away to hit. The bosses can go from super hard to super easy in a heartbeat, from one to the next. The Yeti is a prime example of that. Enemies are recycled CONSTANTLY. I don't seem to be doing anymore damage than before after leveling strength, or upgrading a weapon. The skill trees have some really lame filler skills that you have to buy or else you can't get the better stuff. A bunch of somewhat interesting characters are introduced, and then discarded from any importance immediately. You can miss some items because an area is blocked off. Platforming is not very fluid because a lot of it is based on grabbing ledges (Why is this a problem, you may ask? Platforming is a big focus for the game, and even IT is clunky and slow), and sometimes you don't grab ledges for no reason. Sometimes your character will stand completely still for no reason during combat (not stunned, possibly a glitch). The controls with a controller AND on keyboard are awful. Sometimes the character will swing more times than you press the button. Speaking of buttons, the hitbox for ground pound buttons doesn't even cover the whole button. Everything is a lame jumping puzzle and you end up having to fall down 20 times to get all the chests that they put under them. Sometimes these chests are anti-climactic, getting Cloth or something. Most armor pieces in the game are terrible and not worth getting or using. The camera is panned too high up, and too close to the player. Some artwork is WAY WORSE than others. Some bosses have weak attacks, and your attacks even weaker against them; this just ends up being grindy and boring. Blocking isn't very useful. The story lame and cliche. Farming isn't fun for upgrading, and never will be. Magic is overly weak.\n\nI think I sequence broke once or twice just by abusing wall jumps and ice pillars.\n\nOn the upside, the graphics were nice, the combat was somewhat satisfying, and the music was great (albiet VERY LOUD in some spots compared to many others).\n\nOverall, this game is pretty okay, but extremely frustrating. I would not recommend this to anyone with anger issues, or standards for a good RPG.

It is truly a diamond in the rough.  I hope that the new curation system will result in it getting more recogniition for the unknown indie gem that it is.\n\nI think its good and bad points can easily be esstablished by reading other user reviews.  So i'll start with the good.  The combat and boss battles.  The game packed to the brim with amazing engaing boss fights.  The rest of the game is basically filler surrounding a successtion of well executed boss encounters.  The next bit of greatness in the game is the art design.  The art in this game is a labor of love.  Each inch of it hand painted with a careful attention to detail.  So hats off to the artist.\n\nOk now the not so great stuff.  The platforming is horrendous.  The saving grace of the horrendous platforming is that most of the really painful platforming is entire optional.  That of course comes with the caveate that you will probably need that option loot to take down the game's many challenging bosses.  Another minor flaw is that the metroidvania design can lead to a good bit of replaying areas, which is just a draw back to that design style.\n\nAll in all a wonderful game.  The flaws don't even come close to trumping the myriad of other highlights.\n\n(note I have a lot more hours clocked in this game, but I originally owned it on Desura before it was even greenlit)","September 24, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is truly a diamond in the rough.  I hope that the new curation system will result in it getting more recogniition for the unknown indie gem that it is.\n\nI think its good and bad points can easily be esstablished by reading other user reviews.  So i'll start with the good.  The combat and boss battles.  The game packed to the brim with amazing engaing boss fights.  The rest of the game is basically filler surrounding a successtion of well executed boss encounters.  The next bit of greatness in the game is the art design.  The art in this game is a labor of love.  Each inch of it hand painted with a careful attention to detail.  So hats off to the artist.\n\nOk now the not so great stuff.  The platforming is horrendous.  The saving grace of the horrendous platforming is that most of the really painful platforming is entire optional.  That of course comes with the caveate that you will probably need that option loot to take down the game's many challenging bosses.  Another minor flaw is that the metroidvania design can lead to a good bit of replaying areas, which is just a draw back to that design style.\n\nAll in all a wonderful game.  The flaws don't even come close to trumping the myriad of other highlights.\n\n(note I have a lot more hours clocked in this game, but I originally owned it on Desura before it was even greenlit)","September 24, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The stroy was amazing, the art is fatastic. Don't even get me started on the game play. Its nice, with fluid combos. I loved the DnD feel it had to it when upgrading! It was really challenging; at one point i thought of Ninja Gaiden 2...its not that level hard all the time, just on some of the boss fights...a lot of them. The enemies level with you so to speak. When returning to an area in the begining, I was surprised when they were doing different moves and it took a little more damage to kill them.\n\nThe only real "bad" thing I hated about this was when you reach an area border, you have to re-click the direction you were going most of the time. That part was really anoying when you are jumping into a different area. I didn't have to do it all the time though which was strange, but any time I really needed to keep moving forward after a screen change (time limmet parts), it happend.\n\nThis is going into my all time favorite games for sure.

My only gripe was that the movement is geared more for combat than platforming, which made some of the platforming puzzles harder than it should have been, due to having to correct for touchy movement and falling off a ledge.

Everything works, no major glitches/issues throughout, and it's definitely well-polished. It has major issues in terms of gameplay though. Some of the puzzles can be really obtuse or just incredibly difficult, and there's a bizarre power spike in enemies in the middle of the game that makes everything extremely hard very suddenly and very briefly. The game's mechanics didn't really make it feel new or interesting, and there isn't a lot of innovation which is not good for a metroidvania game--there are many other options that have more innovative concepts and are much more fun.\n\nThat's the biggest problem; it just isn't that fun. I'd just so much rather be playing any castlevania game or super metroid instead of this. Not that it's bad, it just isn't good enough.

It was on the one hand unbelievably frustrating, but on the other hand it was an absolute blast! This is much closer to an old school SNES or NES metroidvania style game than anything else, and on top of that the game can be pretty brutal. I played through my first time going for the bare essentials achievement. It wasn't all that easy for me, but I never felt that it was unfair. And that's the most important part.\n\nThis game isn't complete at the time of writing this review, but that doesn't stop it from being very fun. I like the style of the characters and world, and the game play is wonderful. There were a couple of times where I had to just get up and walk away for awhile because a boss was just beating me into submission, but I knew it had most to do with my own in ability to dodge or block at the correct time. In the end that just mad me want to learn to play the game better, and that's a mark of a well made game.\n\nOne thing that is frustrating right now is that there are portions of the game that say that they're coming soon or are clearly not implimented. It'll be fun to see what this game will be like when it is finally complete. I'm especially interested in the two unavailable characters. The other thing is that this game isn't very strong on plot. Really though, that's not too bad for a game like this since most of the plot is just an excuse for opening more places to explore.\n\nThere are a couple of gripes that I have with this game. I'm not sure if these will be features in the final game, but they are sorely lacking. One is definitely that there needs to be an update to the map system. It helps show some handy things, like where save points are, but it really needs two additional features. One is that it should list what crew members and how many treasure boxes are in each area and how many I've found. I really felt like I was wandering blind and ended up missing two treasures. Two, that's frustrating. Sure I could look them up on the net, but that's still annoying. The other thing is that there are enemies that stun lock far too much. I'm specifically thinking about the spider mini boss and the ice ferrals. When those things were in the room I usually ended up losing a health potion. Heck there were ice ferrals with some mini bosses and full bosses and they were usually more frustrating than the boss themselves. Even if there was a good way to quickly recover from stun that would be nice.\n\nThat aside this game was a blast. I admit my frustrations largely come from doing the bare essentials run with the monk on my first go. Even through the frustration I found myself feeling great whenever I would pull of a combo or finally defeat the boss I was stuck on. If you're looking for a fun challenge definitely give this game a go!","March 16, 2014","true","28.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Personally I bought this game around release, and did not like it.  After reading rave reviews I decided to give it another chance, and was pleasantly suprised at how good the game actually is.  This game is megaman, ninja gaiden, shinobi, metroid, and castlevania all rolled into one tight little package.  The game can immediatly be picked up and played by anyone, but it takes quite a while, and some good hand\eye coordination to master.  The OST produced by Zack Parish (spelling?)

It was on the one hand unbelievably frustrating, but on the other hand it was an absolute blast! This is much closer to an old school SNES or NES metroidvania style game than anything else, and on top of that the game can be pretty brutal. I played through my first time going for the bare essentials achievement. It wasn't all that easy for me, but I never felt that it was unfair. And that's the most important part.\n\nThis game isn't complete at the time of writing this review, but that doesn't stop it from being very fun. I like the style of the characters and world, and the game play is wonderful. There were a couple of times where I had to just get up and walk away for awhile because a boss was just beating me into submission, but I knew it had most to do with my own in ability to dodge or block at the correct time. In the end that just mad me want to learn to play the game better, and that's a mark of a well made game.\n\nOne thing that is frustrating right now is that there are portions of the game that say that they're coming soon or are clearly not implimented. It'll be fun to see what this game will be like when it is finally complete. I'm especially interested in the two unavailable characters. The other thing is that this game isn't very strong on plot. Really though, that's not too bad for a game like this since most of the plot is just an excuse for opening more places to explore.\n\nThere are a couple of gripes that I have with this game. I'm not sure if these will be features in the final game, but they are sorely lacking. One is definitely that there needs to be an update to the map system. It helps show some handy things, like where save points are, but it really needs two additional features. One is that it should list what crew members and how many treasure boxes are in each area and how many I've found. I really felt like I was wandering blind and ended up missing two treasures. Two, that's frustrating. Sure I could look them up on the net, but that's still annoying. The other thing is that there are enemies that stun lock far too much. I'm specifically thinking about the spider mini boss and the ice ferrals. When those things were in the room I usually ended up losing a health potion. Heck there were ice ferrals with some mini bosses and full bosses and they were usually more frustrating than the boss themselves. Even if there was a good way to quickly recover from stun that would be nice.\n\nThat aside this game was a blast. I admit my frustrations largely come from doing the bare essentials run with the monk on my first go. Even through the frustration I found myself feeling great whenever I would pull of a combo or finally defeat the boss I was stuck on. If you're looking for a fun challenge definitely give this game a go!","March 16, 2014","true","28.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The anime/fighting game inspired combat takes some learning but is compelling, entertaining and combined with the challenging platforming drives the story. And the story, so well told! Similar to dark souls uncovering the story requires the player to invest time into gathering items, lore and engaging in dialogue but the complete picture is well worth it. The AI is really strong providing a challenge at all levels, scaling really cleverly into the late game and higher difficulty settings. The music is incredible sometimes a serene wailing as you explore derelict masoleum corridors, other times an exciting score as you face down a giant deity determined to end you.

The boss fights are the best part of the game. The game is like a devil may cry/metroidvania I was told. The combo system is not as fun as I hoped as I mashed out the same combo for the whole game but it was still a fun game. two of the character out of the four total are locked behind game completion with one of the two starter characters. Tried out the two other character for a bit after I unlocked them and they seemed really cool but I was done with the game by then. The main complaint I have about the game is that I spend my time wandering around lost mostly and had to look up guides where to go cause the map system was not too great. The game gave you directions where to go to advance the storyline at the start and then stopped giving them when they ask you to go find two items. It was frustrating to be lost so much.\n\nsummary.

Cutsey art style belies the very deep fantasy story. The anime/fighting game inspired combat takes some learning but is compelling, entertaining and combined with the challenging platforming drives the story. And the story, so well told! Similar to dark souls uncovering the story requires the player to invest time into gathering items, lore and engaging in dialogue but the complete picture is well worth it. The AI is really strong providing a challenge at all levels, scaling really cleverly into the late game and higher difficulty settings. The music is incredible sometimes a serene wailing as you explore derelict masoleum corridors, other times an exciting score as you face down a giant deity determined to end you. Add to that an evolving game world, great twists and tonnes of replayability, you have a truly great gaming experience.

There are things I hate about this game. Don't get me wrong, I S-ranked this game on the hardest difficulty. I just don't want people to buy it, and then discover that they actually hate it. So I'm going to focus on the negatives after breezing through the good stuff.\n\nThe good stuff:\n- tight controls\n- great combat\n- setting (music and art) looks very good\n- great boss fights\n- good nostalgic feel (if you like retro games, then you'll like this)\n- characters and enemies are designed well\n\nFirst of all, this game is hard. But it's not the feel-good Mega Man 9 kind of hard. There are times when I hit a snag in a boss fight or a tricky platforming segment and it just feels unfairly difficult. One of the reasons for this is that your character has no invincibility frames. This means that you'll get combo'd really hard sometimes, where you'll find yourself at full health one second, and zero the next (I'm not sure if they changed this or not, but there was this one stupid enemy that was capable of stun-locking you. What the heck is that all about, seriously?).\n\nThe story, in my opinion, had a lot of potential, but I was really annoyed about all the forced tropes and forced "fantasy" names to things; they don't sound like natural words to me. Plus, all the characters are, to avoid spoilers, "special" in some way, as if it's wrong to have some sort of normal main character. IIRC, one character is the last living member of an ancient civilization, one character is the daughter of a god, one guy is half-angel-half-demon or something, one is the only half-dragon or something?. What I did like was the premise. I really like the demons and angels warring against each other, and that neither side was right in the eyes of the main characters. The premise was good, the characters, not so much.\n\nLastly, this game has retro roots. Because of that, it does feel dated. Things like not having enough clues to tell you where to go next, or clues that only appear once, or sidequests that don't give you enough information feel dated compared to newer games. While this isn't much of a problem for some gamers, it's a problem for most. People are lying if they say that they never had any struggles with lack of direction with games like this one.\n\nIt still comes recommended, but as long as you're okay with VERY cliched characters, sometimes BROKEN gameplay, and potentially being LOST, then go for it. But if you're down for some retro gaming style, then go for it anyway.","June 2, 2015","true","257.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Valdis Story is probably one of the best of it's genre that I have played, so I would recommend giving it a chance. TLDR at the bottom, for those who aren't looking for the specifics.\n\nValdis Story has tight melee centric, fighter-esque gameplay, uncharacteristic of what you might expect of the genre. There are 2 basic attack buttons, light and heavy, as well as a button toggle for magic with several directional options to change which spell you are using, and assist characters who can help you chain combos together or provide useful secondary effects. Skill cancels (dodges) and parries become available later on for the purpose of damage mitigation or as additional offensive tools. Combat is easy to learn and hard to master, with grades awarded based on performance on boss fights and numerous rewards for good play.\n\nValdis Story has two characters, Wyatt and Reina, who both have 3 different weapons each (not including barehanded combat) and several supported playstyles and builds each, based on 4 stats. (Luck, Str, Agi, Int) Each character has 3 different skill trees that you can use to customize the character to your gear and intended playstyle. Wyatt is a very straightforward fighter that can be anywhere from a pure brawler, to an assassin or a spellsword. Reina is a bit faster and weaker than Wyatt, and has to rely more on combinations of magic and attacks early on but can later become anywhere from a powerful mage, to a lightning fast brawler lategame.\n\nValdis Story is also an rpg as much as it is a metroidvania, there are many pieces of interesting gear scattered around behind unforgiving timed puzzles that you may end up running through the game a few times to try incorporating into a new build. Some cons to the game are that it is perhaps a little melee centric, that some bosses and timed puzzles are rather unforgiving on your first or second time around and that there is no world map, though like Dark Souls the world is small and interconnected and you will eventually memorize where everything is.\n\nWhile not relevant at the time of this review, there are two characters planned to be released later which may extend the lifetime of this game later on. I also feel that it would be selling the game short to not mention the excellent soundtrack it has going for it.\n\nTLDR: I strongly recommend you play this game if you are a perfectionist, or enjoy metroidvanias. You would really be doing yourself a disservice to pass on this game if you like either of it's main genres.","July 14, 2014","true","113.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Definitely one of the best I've played.  Combat is very rewarding, level design and art is great throughout, and bosses are very well put together.  Bosses also have a rating system, and a rather forgiving retry system (it hurts your rating to restart a boss fight - but ratings have a very slight affect on the game, and it is really only their as a slight punishment - I thought this was a fantastic compromise between challenge and hand-holding).\n\nHonestly my only critique is the games platforming sections.  While controls feel great for combat - I had a harder time when trying to navigate tiny floating platforms.  It feels almost as if there is a slight input delay - that lends itself well to the combo based combat, but not so to navigating an obstacle course.\n\n","October 25, 2014","true","56.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/recommended/252030/","ichikumer","ichik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichikumer/","1268 products in account","This is the world, where gods kill one another, and where armies of angels and demons are fighting for forty years after the downfall of titular supreme goddess Valdis. Armies are controlled by her twin daughters, red-tinted Myrgato and yellow-glowing Alagath. And humans are used as foot soldiers and fuel source (a lot of that magic runs on soul power, so yeah, sucks to be human in this world). Obviously this dystopian fantasy world requires a rebel protagonist. And there they are —all four them, plus all their bad-♥♥♥ crew of warriors, magicians, rebellious demons and traitorous angels, travelling on their cool flying magical ship. Pursuing different personal goals they all agree on the subject war, that is must be stopped, and not be either of sides finally winning. And this is unusually large flying beast who tears this ship apart. Crew, separated by strange magic falls underwater to the different locations of legendary Sitheil. Long lost sunken city still contains some breathable air in its caverns, and shelters dangerous beasts, scattered survivors, magical artifacts and old mysteries.\nThis is where the game begins. Player is prompted to choose main character. Though the developer intends to add two more playable main characters in the future, keep in mind that Valdis Story: Abyssal City was initially announced in 2007, and it took long 6 years before it was finally released with current two heroes, so it might take a while. Red-haired Wyatt wields gigantic sword, was raised by the demons and is in a search of his father. White-haired Reina starts with a bare hands and relies on her monk-training and magic. Their stories share same major pieces, but actually not replace one another, but rather intertwine and meet in the end. And it actually is quite worth noticing. Because, here's the thing, despite the fact, that my brief retell of major facts of this setting may seem like a generalised uninteresting mess, the actual lore and story aren't. Partly because all of that, except the flying beast are not actually told to the player in the prologue, but must be collected piece by piece from dialogues, item descriptions and story development. But mainly because retell presented you rather simplified version. Lack of the actual knowledge on characters' history and state of the world throughout the game creates delightful puzzle, and I'd rather not steal this pleasure from someone who intents to play Valdis Story. Let's just say that there's more than one twist, and the biggest one in the end, so it's more of a first tome in the series, than a closed book. Not all the questions will be answered, but this piece of a bigger story is of an amazing quality.\nTwo characters have separate sets of talents (three different progression paths for each one) and weapons. They also start with a different armor and two souls each. Souls is the source of magic in Valdis, each provides four spells. With the Soul of Centurion Reina for example can attack foes with divine magic in three different ways and charge her weapon with it. During the game player collects different kind of souls, gaining access to the new types of magic and abilities, which help in visiting previously inaccessible areas. Also there's keys, quest items, armor, different kinds of loot for upgrading equipment. Resulting system feels just right: not too overwhelmingly complex, but not too simple either, being extensive enough to provide means to easier killing another particularly hard boss with choosing another approach, another set of magic, different, magic, armor, trinkets or assisting character.\nWhat stands truly unique here is combat system. You have two types of attack. Each can be used for a limited amount of times, increasing your combo rank before your character kind of feels tired. Here's what happens next, with the timed use of magic assist-attack you can increase the length of the combo. And longer combos deal higher damage. But the actual key here is using a special ability “Skill Cancel”. When used it dashes your hero forward or down, if you was in the air, giving him or her a few frames of invincibility and keeping combo chain on hold. So with this skill an experienced player can avoid damage and keep the initiative in fight. Also there's more boring blocking, and finally giving and taking damage fills your focus meter, which when fully filled can be used to enter focus mode, which heals you slightly, increase your stats and boosts your attacks for a limited time.\nEnemies have different strategies, abilities and weaknesses: some of them are nimble, some are heavy-hitters, some even try to poison you. But the true gem here are the bosses, who are challenging and unique. You'll fight lightning-blasting teleporting monk in the room with electrified walls, minion-summoning archangel blocking you from the use of magic with his attacks, and spore-spitting plant in a location slowly filling with poisonous gas. Like in some kind of slasher you can score a different rank for killing a boss, from d through c, b and a to s, with various aspects of battle taken in consideration.\nWhat’s truly amazing for the indie game is the amount of optional content in the game. There are whole areas and optional bosses that aren’t really needed to finish the game. Also some of the quests given by the NPCs are not mandatory, and you can ignore them. But hopefully you wouldn’t. Story actually is a bit non-linear and can be affected depending on player actions. Not of all those actions are really intuitive, some things are hidden well. The secrets of the game go as far as including concealed optional bosses which have to be slain before the timer runs out, or the story can take some unexpected turn concerning the survival of some of the NPC villages. Of course, there’s also more conventional dialogue choices for player to affect the story.\nAll of those said above is packed with truly amazing visuals and soundtrack, making Valdis Story one of the best-looking 2D games. Characters move flawlessly with smooth and fluid animation. Backgrounds are truly detailed and a pleasure to look at. Design seems to be a true descendant of SNES era with its anime-like cartoon style, but it is executed by true artists who really have a passion for it. Same goes for music.\nValdis Story: Abyssal City is one of the best modern 2D metroidvanias, if not even the best. Made by just two people, it really is an achievement. And what’s more amazing, considering its quality and size (I managed to finish it in 17 hours, while missing some of the areas completely), is that they continue their work on it. Not only they plan to add two more playable characters, who will have much more different stories, but they add all type of stuff like optional bosses, areas and items. They truly deserve your money.","May 15, 2014","true","17.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulechelon/recommended/252030/","soulechelon","SoulEchelon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulechelon/","285 products in account","This game.. is difficult. And I don't mean "Difficult" as in challenging. I mean "Difficult" as in straight up "Oh there's an enemy I can't see that's killing me" or "As soon as I jump on that platform an enemy will appear and knock me off it to plummet all the way back to the start of the dungeon" or "This boss is pretty fun-oh wait, it's almost dead and all of a sudden it can fully heal itself while spamming near impossible to dodge attacks at you". Yes. That kind of difficult.\n\nThere is a bit of skill involved in this game, and that's the fun part. The problem though lies in the fact that it seems as if the developers made -sure- that almost every single part of the game is tailor made to annoy you. I swear they placed certain enemies in places that WILL mess you up unless you knew they were there beforehand.\n\nEvery single boss of this game starts off as hard, but challenging. There's a pretty intricate combo system involved that really can be enjoyable. But, as stated in my first paragraph, these bosses greatly enjoy ruining the fun for you by suddenly healing themselves, or teleporting away to places you can't get to quickly, or spawning a ton of enemies while teleporting away to heal themselves, or doing this, doing that. I don't mind an enemy healing themselves or teleporting away and so on - but the way the developers implemented these tactics in this game is truly, truly infuriating.\n\nOkay, now that I got that rant out of the way....\n\nThe gameplay at its core is fun. Very combo oriented. You can block/counter, dodge attacks, aerial combos, and so on. It's mainly a platforming game - I'd akin it to a far more platform-oriented Dust: An Elysian Tale with a bit more in depth fighting system. Not to say this game's better though... Definitely not as "smooth" or fluid. Combat animations don't flow as well, though it does get the job done.\n\nControl-wise, as just stated.. not very flow-y. Everything has this odd air of being "blunt" and stilted. Platforming can be a bit floaty and hit-miss as well. There were times when I'd totally miss a small platform because the jump in this game is floaty. Also, the Dodge button is basically down+left or right. This in itself is a huge problem for controller users. Every once in awhile you'll accidentally press down while trying to maneuver a harrowing pathway or fight an enemy. This can mess you up completely - especially since your dodge has a cooldown.\n\nDeath is somewhat forgiving (and you'll get used to it fast). You just start at the beginning of the current map you're in.\n\nReally, if you enjoy Metroid-Vania-esque games then you'll enjoy this one. It's just...the difficulty. Truly aggravating. I had fun with this game while also extremely hating it due to the troll-like positions of enemies and the aggravatingly resilient bosses. Infact, when I found a boss that I was able to kill before it could start its spamfest of powers, I really had fun with that battle. Not because I WON, but because it was all about dodging, blocking, countering, comboing, etc instead of getting stunlocked by abilities/spawned enemies or stopping said boss from healing itself by destroying crap way on the other side of the arena, and so on. But anyway, I digress...\n\nI really don't know if I should recommend this or not - but I will, because the game at its core is fun and enjoyable. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have put in as much time as I did with it, and I still want to play through it again as another character.","January 17, 2014","true","16.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Shortly after that a new patch came out adding the final boss (see what I mean about early access?), and there hasn't been another update in nearly a year since. Two of the four playable characters are still missing.\n\nThe game would still be enjoyable in its current state if not for some particularly rough edges. Most important among them, the game lacks immunity frames, so if you hit certain types of traps or get hit by certain attacks, you'll lose your entire life bar in a single hit (which is really a dozen hits landing all at once). Given the current state of the game I can't tell if that's a bug or by design, but it's terrible either way. Add onto that some extremely unbalanced bosses that make you feel underleveled even at max level, and the game just isn't any fun after awhile. It feels punishing in a very unfair way.\n\nI'd say wait for an update before getting this game, but I've been waiting a year and it still feels like early access.

Unlike Castlevania, this game emphasizes quality over quantity when it comes to item drops and spells. Enemies drop crafting ingredients, not gold or items. Each character has only a handful of armors and weapons, and every one caters to a different playstyle and has multiple upgrade levels.\n\nThe gameplay is more akin to a fighting game (especially in boss battles). There is a heavy emphasis on dodging over blocking. Striking enemies at opportune moments is much more important than simply hitting them as much as possible. You do have a revive built into your abilities, but you are still fairly fragile.\n\nThis is much easier to play than a fighting game, though. Your skill cancel is a simple press of the down key, and dodging is just pressing left or right after that. Your assist has its own button, and spell casting and super mode have modifier keys. The game offers some tutorials, but muscle memory is the only real stumbling block here.\n\nBoss battles emphasize pattern recognition and reaction time over button mashing, and since your skill cancels have a short cooldown, spamming will get you nowhere. Killing a tricky boss after spending four lives learning their patterns is a very satisfying feeling. Retries are unlimited and place you right in the boss room, but its still crucial to keep your cool and respond to attacks carefully.\n\nThere are downsides, of course. Whenever the game chooses to focus on platforming over combat, it becomes significantly less fun. Thankfully most of the timed platforming challenges are optional, though you will be missing out on a few items if you ignore them, as I chose to.\n\nLike any non-linear game, there are times when you will be unsure where to go, or where you accidentally miss important things because the game doesn't tell you enough. This is compounded by some occasionally suspect level design, particularly areas where it's easy to fall down several rooms and be forced to repeat an area, or where enemies can stunlock or toss you easily.\n\nThe map and menus are rather bland. While it has some nice sprite work, the graphics options don't really give everything room to shine. It also doesn't scale well, so if (like me) you have a fairly large monitor and play in fullscreen, the upscaling is very noticable.\n\nThe story is nothing exciting. Like Castlevania, it's mostly relegated to text boxes whenever you find a new area or kill a boss. It has a few engaging reveals and some pleasant backstory here and there, but the story is not a reason alone to play this game.\n\nUltimately, this game doesn't hold your hand, but it has a reasonable difficulty curve and skill floor. It expects you to work a little bit for your victories, but it is neither impossible nor unfair. If you like action platformers and skill-based combat, look no further. Just be sure to use a controller.","November 17, 2014","true","7.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I enjoy difficult games, and i like a challange, however this game demands more of it's players and controls it's than i think is resonable.\n\nThe excellent game design show, "Extra Credits" once gave this advice to indie developers, "If you think that the difficulty of your game is just about perfect, it's probably way, way too hard."  In other words, as a developer makes the game, they become so familiar with it, that their sense of the difficulty is off, and they tend the game and it's challanges more difficult than they indended, even if they intended to make a challanging game.\n\nThis is most easily seen in Valdis Story's many timed puzzles.  Often they require you to hit a series of switches in order, hitting as many as 10 in a row before time runs out on the first switch, with platforming in between.  The margin for error on these switches is *incredibly* small.  It's not uncommon to hit a switch in this game and see it's giving you 2 or 3 seconds to find the door that just opened and dash through it, often a ways off screen.  So for the long sequence switches, you often have to hit the first, run to the second, hit it, look for the door that opened, find it, then go start the process over because you spent too long looking for the second switch, hit the first again, hit the second, hit the third, look for the door, start over again because you lost time again... etc. etc. etc.\n\nOnce you do find all the switches, and their respective doors, you are then tasked with hitting every one in order literally without a single missed jump or ledge grab for the entire sequence, something i don't believe the controls are tight enough to warrant, and i know i certainly am not a good enough player to pull off more than half the time.  What adds the frustration cherry to this gameplay sundae, is that failing a run early on will force you to sit and wait by the first switch for the timer to tick all the way down before you can restart and give it another shot.\n\nAll in all, this is a very interesting game from a very promising studio, and i look forward to seeing their future projects assuming they can master the difficulty curve a little better in future.","January 4, 2014","false","4.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I give this a D-, because I reserve F's for games that are nonfunctional due to bugs/DRM.\n\nHere's a limited sample of the frustrations:\nMany of the games actions are mapped to keyboard button combinations - for example, s+d, s+w, s+up.  You can figure the individual keys, but can't configure the fact that it's a combination rather than the MUCH simpler and more intuitive single button press.  There's no justification for this, other than the developers being LAZY as this is console port and they 1-1 mapped the buttons from the original.\n\nMany of the boss fights involve the following - boss punches the ground to use a shockwave attack, boss punches forward, boss makes stuff rain from the sky, repeat.  I've encountered this pattern (with very similar, if not identical sprites) on at least 3 bosses and I'm nowhere near the end of the game.  If you don't grind levels - and you level VERY slowly - most boss attacks deal 10%-50% of a full life bar when juggling, damage over time, and what not are added in.\n\nLoads of enemies have ice attacks that freeze you in place and want you to wiggle (<- -> repeatedly on keyboard) to escape getting endlessly rejuggled.  This game LOVES to juggle you with no control given to the player, no or limited combo break opportunity, and no chance to escape.  Just put the controls/kb down and let it do whatever.\n\nThe game does not have money.  Instead, the merchants - of which there are many - want to barter for a very particular set items.  The game has ~50 or so things that can drop for barter, making trying to get anything from the merchants a ridiculous chore.  The game lacks any sort of in-game tracking for targeted trades.

And let me tell you - there's a very good reason for that.  It's also just a little bit lacking in the explanation department about game mechanics (especially with the spell system).  Some retro gamers might dig that "drop you in and let you sort it out" kind of gameplay, but I think a little bit of handholding can be a very beneficial tool.\n\nA couple other annoyances:\n- If you change scenes while holding down left or right, you won't start moving until you lift off the key and press it again.  This might not sound like a big deal, but after 10-20 times of this happening it starts to get on your nerves.\n- The boss battles are graded.  A good grade gives you permanent, otherwise unobtainable stat buffs (which can be equivalent to the stats you gain from several level ups).  But - you cannot go back and repeat a boss. If you beat one with a bad grade, that's it; and you're Don Goofson.  This ends up giving more stats to the skilled players that don't need them, and stunting the growth of unskilled players, making the rest of the game even harder.  It seems a bit counter-intuitive.\n- The graphics will occasionally lag for seemingly no reason and I have neither the time nor the inclination to figure out why and/or resolve it.\n\nIt's a shame, because this really seems like a game I could get into and thoroughly enjoy if it weren't for the frustrations listed above.

Valdis Story has excellent production value, but the art direction ends up a cluttered mess.  Light and shadow play no role in this universe, coming and going as they please.  It nauseates me, even though I love the anime aesthetic most of the time.\n\nThe controls feel floaty and awkward.  To dodge attacks requires something akin to a three button maneuver, involving jumping and then performing the Hadouken joystick movement.  It is, quite simply, redundant and tedious seeing as most titles in this genre set dodging to one button.\n\nThe platforming is an abomination.  Even very early in the game platforms are often tiny, and I often find myself falling all over the place, forced to retrace my steps.  Toss in archers/spellcasters who barrage you with projectiles whilst trying to platform and you've got a cocktail of frustration.  The problem is the core design.  Platforms don't need to be huge because he can hold into ledges, allowing for a lot of wiggle room.  The issue with this is that the characters are almost useless in mid air, so they depend on platforms to dish out attacks.  Hanging on ledges slows down the gameplay and cripples the characters to the point of absurdity.\n\nAll things considered, this is a quality title that many can find enjoyment in.  It offers a deep development system of stats and skills.  And, as aforementioned, the quality is high.

They're alright overall and ♥♥♥♥ing garbage when you really need them for some of the platforming and dodging. The whole combo system doesn't make sense, the more you hit ♥♥♥♥ the higher the combo but the combo tiers/exp rewards differ sometimes when you get the same combo length. There are also only a couple of good boss fights in the game but overall they're tedious as ♥♥♥♥ to take down with each one having their own obnoxious gimmick. The bosses themselves aren't exactly the worst ♥♥♥♥ to kill, it's when you get scored at the end of a boss fight that makes it obnoxious as hell. You get scored on how long it took to defeat it, how many times you got hit/how high your combo was, and how many bars of life you needed to defeat the boss. Trying to get that 'S' rank on a boss is hard as ♥♥♥♥ and annoying as ♥♥♥♥ to do. ♥♥♥♥ING DESTROYING CRYSTALS TO STOP A PASSIVE REGEN ON A BOSS ONLY TO HAVE THE CRYSTALS RESPAWN 30 SECONDS LATER FOR YOU TO RUN AROUND AND DESTROY AGAIN IS NOT FUN, IT'S TEDIOUS AS ALL ♥♥♥♥. Now I'm all for hard games that are actually, you know, hard. You get a feeling of mastering the game with your own skill. Valdis Story fights are mastering a cheesy gimmick and hoping that the controls don't ♥♥♥♥ you over when you have to dodge, jump and run around platforms. It's incredibly aggrevating.\n\nA few of the enemy designs are also annoying as hell to deal with, and you have to deal with them a lot. Like there are these floating ferals that can cast a wave of spells on the ground and if you get hit once, you're in for the whole ride. Man i wish the controls were better. Then the same enemy also has a shield they will deploy once they hit a certain threshold of hp, making them invinicble for about a few seconds. and the do this twice. this completely halts any action on this one specific enemy.

Unfortunately I got an unripe fruit that doesn't seem to ripen any time soon, if ever.\n\nValdis Story: Abyssal City should be labeled as early access game. The game is (mostly) complete but it lacks severe polish and feels unfinished because of it. The controls are a bit wonky, there is some control lag and for some reason they are queued so if you input controls too fast, the character will perform all of them before stopping. On top of this all the font used reminds me of countless horrible Korean MMORPGs. Why was it chosen?\n\nThe story is complex and I gave up trying to understand most of it. To get the best possible ending you are supposed to save all the cities and their inhabitants. This involves doing several tasks with some vague hints but if you venture too far in the game, you can't complete your task at hand. The game doesn't give you any indication of this. Oh yeah and you have to find all your friends too for reasons unknown. Most of them do nothing. Characters in general are all too shallow.\n\nI like challenging games when they are challenging for the right reasons. Most of the difficulty in Valdis Story is artificial. The hit detection and hit boxes are weird. There is no mercy-invincibility, which means you will be stun-locked and you will lose plenty of hp. Most of the bosses have tons of hp and moves that are impossible to dodge or guard against. To get the best grades (and rewards that help immensely!) you have to beat the bosses fast, without taking damage and performing a long enough combo on it. Save points are scarce and you have to keep backtracking to them unless you feel like being ambushed by a boss monster, dying and losing at least 30 minutes of gameplay. There are also plenty of timed puzzles and they require pixel-perfect maneuvering with various skills. Good luck with that with the weird controls.\n\nThe game isn’t without good aspects and an update or two would fix most of the bad things listed but as of now, I can’t recommend this to anyone.","January 2, 2015","false","21.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Your character will cling to every single wall it so much as touches, making some of the time-based challenges almost impossible, especially when not only does the character stick to walls, sometimes the walls stick to the character, leaving you unable to do anything for several seconds at a time.\nThe combat feels fluid to make up for that, but have fun finding a good key setup, seeing as the game has no mouse support at all and simply re-uses the same keys in different combinations. Also, to get that key set-up you desire will require you to systematically rebind every key in order. Got one wrong? Thought of something better during the process? Made a mistake? Too bad, you've got to redo the entire key-binding process.\nAltogether, I enjoy the game for it's combat and flow, it feels  good, the idea of being torn between good and evil is also compelling, but it feels like I'm trying to have sex with through a blender every time I have to go through any dense platforming section.

Orchestral masterpieces are pretty much the standard.\n+ The fighting system is pretty interesting. Kinda hard to make use of at first, but also interesting.\nRealy wish I could say that about the controls (See the negativ section, mate)\n+ The crafting-system is alright. Nothign special nowerday, but very enjoyable. Common items will be able to craft rare once, and multiple rare once will make a super rare one. You can also get rare stuff right from your enemys.\n+ Graphics. God! Do I even have to say anything? Just look at it! (Recomend playing in full screen though, window is really smallI.)\n\n\nAll of this does point to a great game, right?\nYes! That is why I bought it! But with all this lovely sugar coded candy you will soon notice that the core is a solid block of BS! It is just so frustrating to see such a promising game to sort of be torn apart by those things.\n\nBS stuff:\n- Unhelpfull controls: Pressing the guard-button and the spell-button simultanously will open up the spell menu, which itself only requires you to press one directional button, to swap a spell. So guess what happens to you all the time:\nYou guard, then want to cast a spell, then end up messing up your spell-config. Also you need to press down, then press an other direction to dash. Of course you can change that. But remember, the evade/dash-button is also used for the dive-move (which lets you fall down incredibly fast). This will especially annoy you, when you have to do parcours under time pressure in order to get to those chests that you might want.\n- The Story is stitched to getter at best: No really, you would think the story of shipwreck in weird place, find your friends, survive, explore place would be enough of a story. Apperantly endless fluff dosn`t agree. Instead you get a lot of weird throw in lines about some old war. (To be honest: you CAN read up on it)\n- I hope you like odd words for simple concepts... Not wanan spoil it.. but yeah.\n- Odd "Hitboxes": This will really only annoy you at first. Any veteran video gamer will except to move out further on a clif than you can here. Leading to you having very little if any idea when to jump.\n- Chest are BS: There are golden chests, and grey ones. Golden once SHOULD contain better items. Well, kinda... they usually contain lvl1 armor which 90% of the time may be weaker then your current one, and needs to be upgraded. Grey chests will usually only contain comon items... no fun there.\n\nBut i could forgive all of this, BUT!\nCombat-system: This one is a big letdown, and one of the main aspects that almost ruin the game so listen up:\n- 90% of your enemies can block your attacks, INCLUDING the "blockbreaking" (yeah, sure) heavy attack. Which means you spend most time just waiting for them to let you hit temr.\n- No recovery time. You do NOT get any invulnarability when being hit, and every hit stuns you for about half a second. Enjoy the stun-locks. They happen. A LOT! Usually until you die.\n\n-BS- Bosses. Hardness aside.. I rarely ever found them hard, more anoying!\nWhy? Because they will do one IF NOT ALL of these:\n--Heal themselves\n--Run away (by teleporting out of sigth)\n--Build up a complete shield instantly (sometimes timer based)\n--Cover 80% of the screen in poisones ♥♥♥♥, or electrizity... just bad ♥♥♥♥\n--Stun lock you until you loos a life\n--Giving zero indication of actually appearing (have fun beeing on your last life when you enter)\n--Appear in bossrooms once used before, and give ZERO indication\n\nSitenote: A lot of areas are large in vertical measure, one slip (which happens a lot with these controlls) and you just lost your last 10 minute of climbing. Better do it again.\n\n\nEndresult:\nIt looks and sounds amazing. Hell it even has the potentiol to FEEL amazing. But it does not... It feels awkward at best...\nBuy it if you want. Just.. dont excpect it to be as great as it looks.\n","January 19","false","12.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","7"

However, none of that makes up for the horrid level design and what can only be discribed as cheapest bosses and boss like minions. The story would be good, however 90% of the time you have no ideal where to go as there is no direction or hint, and unlike other metrovania game you are unable to look at the whole map or even tell which map is what area. Normally by the time you ever get to a place where your suppose to be you have forgotten what the story was to get there in the beginning. Not to add since you have no ideal where to go or which bosses to fight, 3/5 times you go looking for the story you will find a seemingly unkillable boss. Which then leads to basically repetitive moves and eventually you getting stunlocked and beaten to death. Sometimes this is even more likely with the smaller "weaker" enemies as in everything in this game and basically eventually become immune and more often then not they begin to "combo" you or for a better example, hit you launching you into the rest of there attacks. The Devs made a good effort however havent really put there best foot forward alot of this could be solved by lowering stun times, or with some minor monsters getting rid of there immunity all together.

The dodge move, bafflingly assigned to the down key, works only 50% of the time, failing seemingly when the player needs it most. Combos are sluggish and unresponsive, resulting in frenzied button mashing which only traps your player in a loop that only the temperemental dodge move can interrupt - when it works. Add to this the need to open the magic menu with a combination of both the 'block' and 'skill' buttons (?!), two buttons that it's often easy to mash together accidentally, and combat feels less like a challenge and more like an ordeal.\n\nPlatforming feels no better. Clambering stiffly up ledges feels unnatural, and actually worsens with the introduction of the wall jump 'ability', seeing your character ricochet blindly between the game's many contrivedly narrow ledges and low ceilings. It all clashes dreadfully with the level design; stages are immaculately presented, but they're a mess of scattered platforms and dull geometry.\n\nThe worst thing of all? Throughout it all, there glimmers the promise of a truly excellent, open ended Metroidvania which is actually bolstered by tremendous graphics and music. How sad that absolutely none of it can detract from a game that feels less like entertainment and more like effort.","January 4, 2014","false","8.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","5"

The graphics and art style are gorgeous but the game is slow to reward the player's efforts and some issues with the responsiveness of the controls make for some very frustrating combat and platforming.\n\nThe game has a non-linear structure with a semi-open world  but no useful map of any kind. No quest markers or indicators of directions or places where you haven't been yet.  Prepare for lots of clueless searching for hidden things, and backtracking. The old-school enemy re-spawn after a screen is re-entered makes for some annoying exploration too: Areas are split into screens (for no good reason in this day and age) If you exit a screen and then change your mind and re-enter it, you have to deal with all the stuff you just killed all over again.\n\nHope to see issues fixed with an update as this could be a fantastic game.\n\nPS I have played for over 7 hours, no idea why Steam says its only one!","January 5, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game begins with your character dumped into an underwater city along with your now lost crew and point is to try search all of them and find out just what is going on.\n\nPopulation of the games world is split into 2 main factions which are Angels and demons, both sides trying to obliterate the other. Humans are minor third faction whose existance is comparable to fodder for both larger factions and their souls are used to bolster ranks of angels and demons. In Abyssal city another side called Ferals come into this equation, dangerous species who skulk around the Abyssal city and ruthlessly kill any who come in their way but for some reason they specifically hunt only angels and demons.\n\nYou are a freedom fighter demi-human, a leader of your little crew consisting characters from all 3 factions. Every crewmember has, for personal reasons, pledged to your cause to fight both angels and demons. Each member gives you either an ability to summon him to aid you in a fight, work for you as a vendor in specific place in the game or teach powerful, castable finisher attacks to improve your combat performance.\nThe game itself is basically sidescrolling hack and slash coloured with more or less difficult enemies, occasionally somewhat tough platforming and just insanely difficult bosses who are likely to have your hide several times until you figure their patterns and weaknesses. Thinking how you place your hard earned skill and stat points along with upgrading your picked up gear is imperative to make it to the end and using spells and buffs is occasionally a matter of life and death. For example an Ice buff against fire type enemies or bosses might actually save your controller/keyboard from immediate obliteration caused by momentual lack of better judgement due frustration.\n\nAs it is, combat is very fluid, magic system works very well with melee combat system, weapons, armors and assistants are more than worthwhile to level up and with cooperation of skill trees and stats posses heavy effect to your combat style while allowing you to build, at least almost, the kind of fighter you want.. be it counter attacking warrior or backstabbing assasin type.. or just yolo going megacrit maniac.\n\nValdis story has few game time connected events and doing something before its too late actually affects the later parts of the game. You are likely to waste much more time on your first playthrough but if you think it as a mere training run before the actual fun begins on the 2nd run, it makes Valdis Story : Abyssal City much more satisfying experience.","November 26, 2013","true","47.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The combat is fluid, and there's really nothing "wrong" with it, it just doesn't give you that same satisfaction and pure love that it's predecessors like Symphony of the Night, and Metroid have given. If you're looking for games in that genre, Dust: An Elysian Tale (sp?) does a better job and really pours the love into the game.\n\nAll in all, this game looks great, and could be a ridiculously amazing, addictive game, but there's just something that makes it "ok they made the mechanics good, but they pieced together level design and a non-engaging story".

However, none of that makes up for the horrid level design and what can only be discribed as cheapest bosses and boss like minions. The story would be good, however 90% of the time you have no ideal where to go as there is no direction or hint, and unlike other metrovania game you are unable to look at the whole map or even tell which map is what area. Normally by the time you ever get to a place where your suppose to be you have forgotten what the story was to get there in the beginning. Not to add since you have no ideal where to go or which bosses to fight, 3/5 times you go looking for the story you will find a seemingly unkillable boss. Which then leads to basically repetitive moves and eventually you getting stunlocked and beaten to death. Sometimes this is even more likely with the smaller "weaker" enemies as in everything in this game and basically eventually become immune and more often then not they begin to "combo" you or for a better example, hit you launching you into the rest of there attacks. The Devs made a good effort however havent really put there best foot forward alot of this could be solved by lowering stun times, or with some minor monsters getting rid of there immunity all together. Seriously a good chunck of the minions could be bosses with how strong they are. Theres literally no explaination for anything ever, trade this for that, or that for this, and more often then not you have no ideal what either do or why you would need them. I tried my hardest to like this game and for 4 - 5 days i kept comming back but why continue when you have less of a chance to beat these bosses then you do of getting a good win on candy crush. I would rate this easy a 4/10 and hopefully the devs try to fix stuff like the horrid hit boxes and all around unfair gameplay in the future, but honestly until then this is more worth like 5-8 dollars instead of the 15 they rip from your soul.","December 19, 2014","false","13.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You could sneak up on enemies, or hit them hard with your magics, you could be an extremely agile character, running back and forth hitting your enemies, or simply facetank them.\n\nThe skill system provides unique synergies, some more obvious than others, and the playable characters have a few different weapons you can use, each having their unique combos, ranging from lightning fast attacks, to slow and hard hitting, and even some with special quirks like long range attacks or granting buffs to yourself via combos.\n\nOn top of the playable characters, part of the game is finding your crew, which provide you with support. You can summon some to attack your enemies and buff yourself, while others grants you techniques, upgrade your gear or simply function as extra shops.\n\nAnd you are going to need all that help.

The bosses in Valdis Story are incredibly well put together.  The fights are hard, but structured in such a way that you can learn from your mistakes, and improve your play over time.  As a result, it is immensely satisfying when you finally take down that boss with an S rating.

Unfortunately only after it playing it for a couple hours am I just not able to recommend it to anyone, unless you’re a glutton for punishment like you would not believe.\n\nI personally got as far as the guardian temple, and what looked like a boss with the fire element.\n\nMy first encounter with frustrations in this game was in the form of an brutish enemy with a shield. You cannot attack them after their spell, and you cannot jump over them as they just knock you away. The stealth spell works to move around them, but eventually I fought one in small space where there’s no room to jump, without mana I was forced to backtrack or wait until I had mana to pass it.\n\nThere are other problems mostly in terms of gameplay; not knowing anything of what to do next, enemies juggling you without reprieve, and being 100-0'd by normal enemies let along a boss.\n\nI kept going but I finally just gave up when I walked into a room in the guardian temple (ended up being a boss room), and when the character animation played (of Wyatt walking in) it put me directly into a square spike that landed multiple hits, instantly killing me.\n\nUpon reviving with the life potion, and starting the boss fight I was treated to the boss jumping into the air and landing a huge barrage of fire based attacks, pushing me into a geyser and obliterating my health 100-0. This was when I put the controller down and was done; I'm all for a difficult game and like to be challenged but for this to be "normal mode" is absolutely asinine.\n\nThe game is beautiful; I loved the art and the soundtrack, but those alone are not worth the headache the gameplay gave me.","June 27, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Probably the most irritating instance of this is the wall jump that behaves counterintuitively to how you'd expect it to and sends you jumping in the opposite direction from the direction you push.\n\nHaving just played a reasonable amount of Ori and the Blind Forest, which has some incredibly tight, responsive controls for a platformer, this doesn't have the same fluidity.\n\nAnother gripe is the respawning enemies. Leaving a room means that all of the enemies respawn when you reenter the room, which can turn some rooms into a massive grind, especially if the adjacent room only contains a treasure chest.\n\nProbably worth investigating as part of a cheap bundle, I wouldn't recommend paying full price.","July 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's just pretty much me just looking at the manual trying to make sense of how the game mechanics work, that and also forgetting that the game is open in the first place.\n\nFirst of all, yes beginner tutorial for this game is very 'light'. As in, they only pop-up at the beginning ONCE and never again to be seen anywhere. Not to mention the fact that they barely even any explanation that exist in-game about how the skills works in this game. If you want to learn about the mechanics, then google the .PDF manual for this game. Yes, it is that saddening. In this day and age where game manuals are not used anymore, especially the fact, that it should not be usable for a game that only exist as a digital download.\n\nSecond, the fighting techniques are not satisfying at all. I find that fighting the mobs and bosses, was just a very 'meh' experience. The usual jump, dodge, then basic attacks (barely ever need to use the skills, or maybe that is just me, cause for the life of me, they seem useless and doesn't make sense despite the manual's explanation) is not exactly fun. Compare this game to other platform games like 'Guacamele' this is just "Eh, not worth it," in my honest opinion.\n\nThird, the one that annoys me the most about this game is the map system. It's useless, I don't even freaking know where I was at, and where I am supposed to be in the first place. I just end up going around maps, back and forth without any indication where I am supposed to be heading for. The mainly reason why this game is lost on me.\n\nOverall, I really, really wanted to like this game. But I just can't. Quite frankly, I am annoyed I spent money on it. It's a very visually appealing game that comes with a great soundtrack, but the game mechanics are making the experience not fun. I'll probably try to play the game more and more in the future because I truly want to like the game, but at the moment, I just had enough of the game's bad mechanics.

I really really want to like this game and it was on my wish list forever but it was quite a disappointment.\n\n\nPROS:\n-Its metroidvania!! (I'm a fanboy of the genre which makes this review that much more painful)\n\n-Great art style\n\n-Variety of moves and spells: You can find various spell orbs that grant a class of spell (fire, ice, etc) that gives 4 abilites. Some are used for mobility which opens up new map areas.\n\n-Variety of viable builds\n\n-"Money" consists of collecting varios crafting mats and trading them with vendors. A very good change from traditional coin collection.\n\n\nCONS:\n-Recoil in combat results in chain-stuns. This is especially prevalent in the air. In the forced fight rooms, it is not uncommon to get hit once in the air and then chain-stunned to death (from a long series of 3-5 damage hits). Look at how many other negative reviews complain about this issue.\n\n-Only one save slot alloted to each character. You can have different character runs saved, but each character only gets one save slot. This, combined with the fact that you can end up in "dead-end" situations where your character is too weak to beat an enemy but you're retry point is stuck, you are forced to backtrack. Not too often, but it happens.\n\n-AWFUL air combat/controls.\n\n-SWING AND A MISS! Sometimes you will swing at enemies *directly* in front of you but completely miss. This is almost always followed up by you getting hit by them, of course, leading to the aforementioned chain-stun issue if other enemies are around. (especially prevalent in air combat)\n\n-Can't look down.  At the top of a tall room and need to work your way down slowly? Sorry, tough luck. Just jump and hope you land on a platform.\n\n-No quick retry option: retrying restarts you in the room with full health (so you dont use up your potions since the game does not have save points [which refill potions] before bosses...). You must either wait to die or go to your inventory -> main menu -> yes i want to quit -> skip opening video -> retry...it doesn't take that long but why the 3 extra steps? I should be able to hit Escape->retry.","July 4, 2015","false","5.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Controls feel delayed, there are harsh recovery times after you perform an action that will constantly having you take more hits then you should. Jumping is a pain since you constantly grab onto ledges you don't want to, you will often do a mario style ground stomp by accident and fall for miles, and the inconsistancy when you want to grab on a wall and jump off of it and your guy simply refuses to do it half the time.  Most enemies block, which can prolong what should be a simple smack it and move on fight into a 10 second ordeal for just 1 enemy; this is increased 10 fold when you are in cramped corners and can't get around said enemy and all it does it block, you have to just wait and wait until it moves.  Spell casting using the D-pad, and each direction doing a different spell (i would MUCH rather have spell slots that you can equip to it's own button).

The magic system is interested but again not very well explained, and all the controls felt very stodgy on the PS3 controller. There is weapon crafting too but the weapons I had didn't feel very unique or characterful.\n\nThis is the other RPG element that doesn't really work. as the character you meet all stand in place and lack movement and personality. That includes both the team mates you pick up and those you meet in the world.\n\nThe missions too lack variety, and a lot of the world is about collecting keys to open a door to punch more people, there wasn't a big hook to the story to push you onwards, and the plot assumed you already cared enough to move on.\n\nReturning to the controls, with gamepad, the controls feel messy, with four spells activated using up, down, left combos when they could have just been mapped to the L and R buttons. This makes combat more fiddly than fun, and as it does end up like a bullet hell at points the lack of precise controls undermines this.\n\nIn addition, you don't feel each hit you make, other games give opponents howls when you finish them off and big reactions when you even hit hem a little, but this really doesn't make that connection between player input and good chunky sounds. I really didn't feel the combat was either graceful or powerful.\n\nIt felt like a game where the RPG elements had been borrowed but not really understood or expanded in a flavourful way (which is bizarre given how the angels vs demon aesthetic suggests creative minds at work)  while the combat doesn't feel particularly precise or rewarding.

You need only look at the dank, miserable two hit kill boss rush of any of the Metroidvanias or the tedious grind of the Infinity Blade games for a primer on that.\n\nBut if you had to put stats in your game, you could do a lot worse than copying Valdis Story.\n\nEven though you are only using attack and magic as your tools of the trade, even though any and every build you use will require you to use both (A Dex Wyatt swings bleeding critical strikes, an Int Wyatt swings magical strikes...), and even though there are really only four stats, each stat, along with the perk trees and the light dark alignment, ensure your path to dealing endgame damage will be distinct from all the others.\n\nAnd yet the perks and points are all in the realm of added effects and slide bumps here and there. The power creep is tightly controlled. You CANNOT ignore build planning but at the same time it will rarely ever ramp up to make the game trivial.\n\nIt's a shame then that this system, like so many others in the game, hides most of its info from you. Valdis Story seldom communicates clearly to you. It speaks English, but always seems to be talking past you, like it's the second game in an imaginary series. The world is a bit vague, the dialogue is so sparse you barely can match face with name on the characters, the weapon and armor upgrading is spread out to vendors in various towns and quite often you don't realize the scarcity of the materials you are using for upgrades until you run out and there simply will not be any more. (In the brilliant simplicity of this game though upgrade trees are seldom any deeper than two upgrades off base. The fat is cut completely out of this system.) Entire towns can disappear from the map, sometimes if you don't pay attention to their problems but other times if you fail to meet entirely arbitrary and unhinted criteria.\n\nBut it's worth meeting Valdis through this. The combat is solid and satisfying, with some truly brutal enemies and combos flying back and forth, instant cancel/dodges, a wide variety of spells to chuck and a few different weapons to swing around. The bosses especially are wild rides. The art is memorable, sharp colors with pleasant maybe-sorta-anime-but-probably-some-other-culture character design. In the game's typical unpolished style, some of the spells are stinkers and some hit far harder than their animations suggest, so experimentation is rewarded. The soundtrack too is quite lovely.\n\nIt's hard to put into words how disconnected Valdis Story feels from the gamer though, with all the little imperfections at the edges creeping up on you. Bizarrely strong/weak enemies placed haphazardly, the language of the game never quite engaging you, the hit effects on spells and weapons never quite suggesting your power as much as the number flying off the enemy... But Valdis is worth the extra effort it takes to engage. It's quick, briskly paced, with two different characters (More coming soon... but Valve soon, it seems.), each with at least three viable builds to their credit. There's a lot here, and though it will never quite gel to be the ideal indie metroidvania and it will take a bit more effort on your part to figure out its cryptic song, the mix of solid RPG stat mechanics, good action combat and bosses, and the lovely world is worth your time.","June 16, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(You gotta have the mechanics to back up your claim if you're going to go that route.)\n\nIn addition, an uninspired story, what voice samples there are repeat over and over annoyingly, and it's just not an interesting game overall. One positive note: I really like the art style.","June 29, 2015","false","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngrehToast/recommended/252030/","AngrehToast","Duplicity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AngrehToast/","248 products in account","As a lover of other Metroidvanias, this game frustrates me to no end. I'll try to sum up my complaints in a manner that is meaningful to those looking into this game.\n\nFirst of all, I feel like a distinction needs to be made. This game is not a Metroidvania at heart. At heart, it is an action RPG with (minimal) exploration elements. Valdis Story's focus is on combat, and that's fine because combat is one of the things that it does quite well. The problem is everything else feels like it is tacked on. It feels like the combat system was developed first and then the rest of the game was developed around it.\n\nThe map, for a metroidvania game, is awful. It is always scoped in on the area that you are in and there is no way to see any of the other areas you have been to or how they even connect. I would even be willing to forgive that, were it that the map actually showed anything useful at all. It is only comprised of boxes that represent the rooms of the area and the entrances and exits of each. It doesn't show anything else useful, like treasures you missed, or locked doors, or anything along those lines. Some of the rooms are color-coded, but there is no key, so the player has to try and figure out what color means what - the only thing I worked out was that green rooms were save rooms. The map leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe platforming controls are terrible. The combat controls are good, but the platforming controls are bad. The jump feels really stiff and floaty and the wall grabs and wall jumps take a lot of time to get used to. This really wouldn't be a huge deal, but the game likes to throw platforming sequences at you where you need to be precise. I also don't see why the developer decided to throw some of the later abilities - double jump, an ability to make a platform to reach tall spaces - into the spells category, so every time you need to use them you have to mess with your spells and make sure you have enough MP.\n\nThe boss fights are the thing that kept me coming back, because some of them are fairly interesting, but they get cheaper as the game goes on. You should pretty much expect to get completely wrecked by never-ending stunlock combos the first few times you try a boss, because you have no invincibility frames upon getting hit. I think the developer intended for the player to use the cancel you are given to dash out of these situations, but there are times when that is impossible - try it in big attacks and you will simply waste a cancel while still being caught in the move. If you try to dodge one of the many enemies placed on the edges, you'll end up slamming down into the pit that you were trying to clear. Not to mention, if you don't get a good grade on the boss fight, you miss out on stats for your character - why they thought this was a good design decision, I have no idea. It only benefits those good or lucky enough to attain those grades and further punishes players who are struggling.\n\nMost of the collectibles feel pretty worthless, because they are either crafting materials that only feel important when you want to make something and don't have enough, or sets of armor or accessories that aren't as good as what you have because they don't fit your build or playstyle. There are health and mana upgrades, but they are mixed in with the rest of the lackluster collectibles.\n\nThe story feels really contrived and generic, and there just wasn't enough there to make me care about who I was playing, or why.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with decent combat and a cool cancel mechanic, I'd recommend picking this up. But if you're looking for a true Metroidvania, I'd at least look a little harder before buying it.","August 7, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Really down-to-earth good.\n\nCombat becomes increasingly fluid as you increase the complexity and variety of attacks in your combo by mixing up light and heavy, ground and aerial, melee and magic skills.  The rating of your combo improves based on length and variation and awards an exp bonus.\n\nSome bosses are very hard, but their patterns are deliberate.  Study them, bring the right magic.  A patch sometime last year began saving your spell layout even when you adjust it after a savepoint - this makes a world of difference when you're testing and adjusting your strategies.\n\nWith four playable characters, each with many unique build paths depending on stat, spell, weapon, and item allocations.  Stat and spell resets are available in-game once per playthrough at a special merchant.  Save before resetting points at level 20 and you may quickly test all max builds.  However, different allocations will also greatly affect boss strategies in early-to-mid game if you're going for speedruns.  Your character building decisions are meaningful at all stages of the game.\n\nThis is my most highly recommended game for 2013-14.","December 15, 2015","true","71.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Valdis' biggest strength is it's combo based fighting. It's quite fluid and once you get the hang of it the game becomes quite fun to play. Enemy and boss encounters don't feel routine and that helped a lot with keeping me engaged in the game. Valdis also has back tracking to find additional hidden goodies once you unlock certain skills that help to aid in your exploration. If that isn't enough for you there is also 4 different characters to play as with unique weapons that all play differently.

It feels rewarding going back through and making light work of bosses because of your skill. The story is decent if you decide to look through it, but it's not necessary.

Enemys and bosses look great too, and there are a lot of effects put into every attack.\n\nThe Story is to the most part interesting, it's a really cool setting, and there is a lot lore if you want to read it, otherwise you don't have to.\n\nGameplay wise it offers a lot of diversity, from different weapons, enemy tactics, and lots of magic spells, for attacking enemys or platforming. I especially liked the leveling system, with many skills that will give your character a different looking effect.\nYou can really put a lot of time into perfecting you fighting skills, but after about 15 hours you should reach the level cap of your character. But fear not, you can still upgrade your character with equipment and gain skill points in other ways, so it's allways usefull killing enemys.\n\nApart from that there are 4 different characters to play, which are all worth checking out. There is also a lot of replayability in raising the difficulty, even though I admit I couldn't do with the hardest one, getting my ♥♥♥ kicked really often.\nSo you can really put a lot of hours into the game if you like, or just play through once in 15-20 hours. (At least that's how long I took, and I really took my time.)\n\nSo I can only recommend the game, even if you aren't into side scrollers, you could really enjoy this.","August 22, 2014","true","37.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didn't fully dismiss this game but at that point it wasn't something I intended to get unless it was part of a bundle.\n\nAnd then Humble Bundle put it in a bundle. So here we are.\n\nI'm definitely glad I gave this game a chance, it's pretty enjoyable in its own right. Though it leans more towards the vania of metroidvania, which is my less-preferred style of gameplay, there's still pretty decent platforming controls. Sometimes a little stiff and sluggish, but. Good enough. The combat is really fast-paced and pretty satisfying, hard to master (I still haven't come close) but rewarding the better your character gets. The RPG elements in the game are a bit shaky, most accessories have too strong of a tradeoff for one, and the best way to build a character in this game is, without fail, dumping all your points into a single stat. There's a lot of spells I never even touched because I just wasn't interested in the magic of this game, you have a pretty limited MP pool and no real way to recharge it in-combat. The game's overworld is pretty meaty in size, some 15 or so unique zones with different enemies and gimmicks, quite a lot of treasures to find and timed platforming challenges to overcome. It's satisfying to explore and find all there is to find, definitely, and that's one of the game's biggest strengths. The story is... shaky, really, you're dumped in the middle of a new environment with characters who seem to know each other well and the backstory for the plot is confined to secrets. I think more of the basic plot could be better conveyed aside from just an opening cutscene. There's some frustrations to be had, though. The controls' stiffness can get in the way of platforming at times, there's a lot of instances of enemy spam or badly-placed enemies making rooms harder than they should be to traverse, a really badly designed escape sequence halfway through the game, and extra bosses that are way tankier than they have any right to be (especially the last one, which is the barrier to getting the best weapon in the game, at a point where it's not really useful anymore... oh well.) There's a few boss arenas that are kind of awful, too (Shu Gohth and Treu especially, Jazracht is a close third). And the fact that the game's towns can disappear if you miss events is a bit of an annoyance; you can be in a situation with basically no way to improve some of your gear if they vanish.\n\nIt's far from a flawless game but it's enjoyable enough and definitely merits its asking price. New stuff is constantly added, too, apparently! So there may be even more to find in the future, who knows. Check it out if you like metroidvanias, certainly.","July 11, 2015","true","27.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I got this game quite a while back in a sale, and finally got some time to start clearing backlog. I was rather looking forward to this given the screenshots I had seen, and it seemed fun enough at first. Times change.\n\nFirst of all, you get almost zero explanation on anything, yet you are expected to know anyway. You'll be afflicted by status ailments whose effect you will not know, you will require upgraded gear that you are never prompted to make, you will have to run all over creation to revisit old places, and you will be stunlocked to hell if you get hit at an inopportune moment.\n\nI had some problems with early bosses, but I was still figuring out mechanics and controls so no biggie, yeah? Other bosses were even quite fun. You'll find a few eventually though that will just be brick walls. I would slam my head against them for an hour and barely squeak past. I finally struggle my way to the final boss, who I discover to be the most awful of the lot. After coming close to actually physically slamming my face on the desk I decide to see if I can find any help online, only to discover almost all the tips out there suggest specific talent and stat builds or items which, ding ding ding, are very poorly explained in-game or likely not at all. It was here that I finally decided to give up because the last save point I was given was before another boss who I really didn't want to deal with a second time.\n\nAlright so you might want to go beyond my limit and tough it out, right? All the enemies in the game scale with your level, making all that backtracking you're going to have to do to find those items a right pain in the ♥♥♥. The "fast travel" system (if you can even call it that) is almost hilariously limited so you'll be trekking around the entire map for hours to get all the stuff you want. The terrain is incredibly annoying to traverse after the first time, in part due to having to swap out your magic spells that are required for it, which may not be the ones you want in combat.\n\nI'm not usually one to back off from a challenge, and the difficulty here is actually manageable (if perhaps mislabeled on the select screen). But this combined with plethora of poor design decisions and pure irritation so many other facets of the game can cause just make it not worth the time.","January 31, 2015","false","8.0"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","3"

Combat is meaty but limited and often you get rushed with no chance of attacking until half your health is gone. The platforming is floaty and weak at times, which leads to incredibly frustrating battles as maqny enemies (and even some bosses) can knock you out of the sky with a single hit. There's a weightlessness to everything that makes Valdis Story hard to love and sometimes a chore to play. If you want a retro-style game experience, complete with clunky controls and often unfair failures, I'd say give it a go. If not, be prepared to take a lot of hits and deaths that don't feel like your fault.","January 2, 2014","false","1.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

It's seriously annoying to have to hit a button on one side of the screen and try to race to the other side before the door closes.  Really?\n\n\nBesides that the game seems to be perfect but adding in those ridiculous "puzzles" kills the whole gameplay and makes me not want to play after the 15 attempts to trying to get to the door before the timer runs out.\n\nHopefully they fix it because it really has taken the fun out of the game.","January 1, 2014","false","4.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Your spell choices are quickly handcuffed because your exploration abilities are in specific spell slots.

The combat is fun, it is fast paced. The story isn't to bad to follow just be sure you read and remember what they are talking about since there is no quest log or anything to check.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game is the timed jumping puzzles. They are neat at first and you feel like you accomplished something after getting by it but as the game progresses you begin to notice you are having more and more trouble with it until it just gets to the point where you feel like you just want to chuck your monitor out the screen in blind rage when you step on a spike.\n\nAll in all the game is alright besides the jumping puzzles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JeiMK/recommended/252030/","JeiMK","JMK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JeiMK/","549 products in account","Valdis Story: Abyssal City belongs to that funnily named genre which happens to be a favorite of mine: Metroidvania. The gist of the 2D platforming genre is to relatively freely explore different maps and environments. There are usually many places to explore and as you gain new abilities or improve old ones you gain access to even wider selection of locations to visit. Usually there are enemies on the way and defeating them earns you experience and as you level up your character gets stronger.\n\nThe visual style is really pleasing in a cartoonish way which I enjoy very much and the movement and combat is, while not necessarily perfect, very serviceable. Your character will occasionally cling to ledge you didn't actually want to cling to or jump away from a ledge when you wanted to cling on it etc., but this isn't a game-breaking issue.\n\nWhat is a game-breaking issue is the way the player is kept pretty much in the dark about the core gameplay. Seriously, there isn't an effective tutorial nor text screen which would, for example, tell you what an "Automatic Skill Cancel" does or how much a block chance actually is and whether or not you can block a certain attack or not. See, the combat system is, while interesting and one that offers lots of possibilities, it also a bit of a hazzle to get the hang off. You pretty much have your normal attack, heavy attack, your spell, your seven other spells and your "shadow power" from the get-go and you will soon quickly get "break points" and "finishing moves" and "assisting characters" and wait could I actually get a small tutorial here? Please?\n\nNone of this stuff is explained that well, if at all, and when choosing which skill to upgrade you might not actually know what some of the skills do, for example the previously mentioned "skill cancel". What does it exactly cancel? Is it my skill? The enemies skills? When does it do that, on normal attack? Heavy attack? Combo? In "break mode"? When I block? What are these skills actually, since my characters "Skills" are all passive so does it negate opposing passive abilities? Or the spells they are using? I don't even... Also blocking seems to work, but not always. I guess it doesn't work against certain attacks. Or something.\n\nAdd to this the fact that there is one of the most obtuse elements of the game: scaling monster and boss statistics. That means that the monsters and bosses get stronger by dealing more damage and having more health, but it is a bit unclear why and even on the forums there's speculation. Maybe it's the player characters level? Maybe it's the areas you've visited? Maybe it's the time you've spent? Maybe it's the angle of the moon related to your computer? All I know is that I managed to get myself stuck to a certain boss fight. I couldn't quite beat it, so I went and leveled up three times and tried again. This time, I fared considerably worse! I took more damage and dealt less, it seems. Now as a player I'm unsure what to do, level up more? If the boss gets stronger then I really shouldn't, but then again I can't really be arsed to spend hours upon hours mastering the finicky combat system. Scaling difficulty level in an RPG is inexcusable to me. It makes the whole leveling system redundant and you'd be much better off marketing the game as non-RPG action brawler or something.\n\nIn conclusion it feels like there was a great game here with great feel and great aesthetics, but something went clearly wrong in the end. Perhaps there wasn't enough playtesting? And by playtesting I mean with real players, not the devs themselves who had SEVEN YEARS to play and test the game hours on end. To them the ridiculous difficulty level might be trivial. To them every "+1 combo when rage full", "skill cancel" and "limit break" is probably mechanically clear. Unfortunately the player is left in the dark wondering what he is doing and what is happening. To me, the game is broken.","January 7, 2014","false","10.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It's clear they've put a lot of work into the combat mechanics, but they remain pretty baffling and hard to use--dodging, for example, is not a single button press, but requires you to activate "skill cancel" (bound by default to "down"), then press left or right.  "Skill cancel" is a function which is intended to let you interrupt various moves, so that you needn't be hit by being stuck in a long animation.  That sounds good in concept, but it has a cooldown, and the main animation that got me stuck in the first place was the "dodge" animation, so the cooldown meant I couldn't cancel that animation. "Dodge" got me stuck because it would sometimes allow me to pass through enemies and get behind them, which was a critical tactic in tight corridors, but other times (I think it was if they blocked while I was dodging?) it would take me right up to the enemy and then freeze me in place for the rest of the dodge animation.  The interactions with ledges were similarly frustrating--by default, once you get the ability to grab ledges, you'll grab on whenever you can, and you can then climb up, drop down, or spring away in the opposite direction, all with directional presses. Unfortunately, it's very finicky about whether it thinks you can grab a ledge or not, and the height of "you can jump and grab this, but failed to on this try because you jumped from the wrong point of the slope next to it" and the height of "you can't jump and grab this" differ by only a few pixels, so it's often down to just trying a few times and then giving up.  In a metroidvania, it's important that the distinction between "you can reach this now" and "you can't reach this without additional equipment" be usually pretty obvious, so you don't waste a lot of time trying to get to things you can't possibly reach, and that's very much not the case here.  It's also fairly common to run across a boss fight as rather a surprise, and if you die during the fight, your only options are to retry the boss fight, or go all the way back to your last save point, which are few and far between, so if you find yourself underlevelled, it's a tough call whether to keep trying the boss or to redo a lot of lost ground and grind to try to power up a bit.  Boss fights are graded; I generally had to redo them a couple of times while I learned the patterns, and then squeaked by with a "D" grade.  It also appeared that XP awards for bosses were reduced if you got a poor grade, although I may be mistaken about this, because that would be pretty backwards--if you were underlevelled and barely made it through the fight, surely you need a boost of experience to make things a little easier, whereas if you're cruising through the fight barely breaking a sweat, you probably don't need much help in the levelling department.\n\nI haven't brought up the story yet, which is partly because the game doesn't bring it up much either.  There's a long opening cinematic, consisting of text over still images, but it still doesn't give the player control over the speed at which this advances, which is a minor pet peeve of mine; and it relies on invented nonsense words to try to create a sense of exoticism.  Actual line from the opening cinematic: "We've been searching for Gernot for many months now.  He's the last living Hyogokun Knight in Myrgato's Dark Army."  We have no points of reference for any of these names, so it's virtually meaningless to the player.  But this story is almost entirely discarded after this opening cinematic, so it doesn't make that much difference. Once you're playing, all that's really addressed is that you're looking for your crew, you're ostensibly at the bottom of the ocean but that apparently doesn't preclude the typical forest/ice caves/crypt etc. fantasy settings, and the enemies you keep having to fight are classified sometimes as "angels," sometimes as "demons," and sometimes as "ferals," although the distinction between the three is obscure.  It's fairly generic fantasy nonsense, and if it were more of a focus in the game it'd be aggravating, but as it's all treated as window dressing for monster bashing, it's reasonably inoffensive.\n\nThe music is kind of similar.  It's not actually bad music; it's kind of generic bombastic fantasy fare, but it's well made.  Unfortunately, it blares at full maximum-drama intensity at all times, with no sort of modulation at all, which is very quickly tiresome.\n\nIn short, then, the movement and camera and controls felt off to me, and that really drove me off the game.  The artwork is nice, but focussing on it led the designers to zoom far in on the characters, which hinders the exploration and platforming that are the core of the gameplay.  The music is well done, but misused in the game.  The story is bland but mostly out of the way.  There's basically nothing here that's compelling.","July 3, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Yet like all too many indie games, it lacks the precise mechanics to be really enjoyable. Too many pointless deaths come from something that should have been dodged, if only the character had responded as expected. That, and a breakdown of the gameplay mechanics would be nice, perhaps a proper tutorial. I feel that I spent way too much time just figuring out what the difference pieces and parts were and how they all went together. In some games, that is fun, but in one with the learning curve as steep as is here, it is not.","January 16, 2015","false","5.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I was very much enjoying this title.\n\nBut I kept running into one huge design flaw that just made me eventually drop the game without getting anywhere near completion.\n\nBosses.\n\nBosses are all in certain areas, but there is no save point near them and there is no warning you are about to enter the boss area.\nThis would be no problem if you didn't have leveling and equipment. But what happened to me 3 times now is I end up with a save stuck in the boss room (it autosaves once you enter the boss room, so you can't go back) but discovered my character is too underpowered to fight the boss. This effectively kills that save.\n\nI guess that could be addressed with quicksaves (there are none) or multiple save files (again, there are none, there are character slots, but you can't manually save in a certain save slot)\n\nSo if you end up stumbling into a boss underpowered, you have to start the game over. From the start.\n\nI did this three times and got a little further each time, and even found bosses that gave me no trouble at all. But once you do run into a boss who is too strong for you. Be prepared to start the game over again.","June 28, 2015","false","2.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I played Veteran because found Hard a bit too easy when I played it, but that is because I didn't play against the bosses yet. In retrospect, I should have played on Hard, but hard seemed too easy at the time and the game eventually fustrated me to an instant uninstall.\n\nRealistically, Valdis Story is probably one of the better Metroidvania for purchase on Steam, ot at least the closest game to the 2D "semi-difficult SOTN-Style" Castlevanias outside of the Rogue-lite Rogue Legacy and colorful and slightly easy and very short Guacamelee.\n\nThe combat is a mix of being great due to combos and magic, and fustrating due to the skill cancel and enemy/boss attacks that can stun-lock you and drain tons of health.\n\n-The skill cancel allows you to dodge or drop quickly while in mid-air by pressing down, and then the ability to dodge if you press left or right after activation. This key mapping is fustrating in platforming as you accidentally may press down on your game pad and is cumbersome in combat, but at least it is remappable to alleviate some fustration.\n\n-I like the fact that the same soul can be mapped to different directions Smash Bros style to offer you different magic abilities, but I have many times accidentally used Smite (Dark Magic Button + Right) while after making a Platform (Ice Magic Button + Down)\n\n-I eventually unlocked a Team Assist attack, much like Marvel Vs Capcom 2, but the Assist was weak and had a 10 second cooldown, and it sometimes misses - I was better off using normal attacks.\n\n-While combo's are cool, i'll admit that I miss the combat of Castlevania's where the game was about managing your "single attack press" and avoiding hits which caused knock back with temporary invincibility, but not stun-locks into combo barrages.\n\nPerhaps in the future I will reinstall when I'm in the mood for a Metroidvania again and play on a lower difficulty. I stopped at the Guardian Temple which is where I became completely annoyed, though it looks like I was relatively far into the game. I recommend looking at a few negative reviews before you Add to Cart, though if you play at Normal Difficulty and are decent at this style of game, then you may enjoy it..provided you remember to remap your skill cancel key.","September 16, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And I like it a lot! The combat in particular is executed very well: you have dozens of spells, various combat moves and techniques, dodges, parries, and a large ability tree. There's a lot of skill involved in figuring out how to fight effectively, but once you do, you become a machine. The enemies are quite varied and the boss fights are spectacularly balanced, especially on hard mode. On the downside, the levels can feel a bit generic and there are a lot of timing/switch puzzles. I also don't love the writing, although the character art is really great (and a bit similar to Bastion).\n\nOh, and for anyone claiming that the game is unfair: DEPLOY YOUR DODGE AND YOUR BLOCK LIBERALLY. Especially the dodge: it makes you invulnerable for a few frames and is absolutely essential in some sections.","October 28, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Good story, Great graphics for a "platformer", and it can be very challenging at times which that is kind of a good/bad quality.  The good of course meaning there are times when you just want the game to get more exciting and button mash like crazy, the BAD part of it is that there were times when it brought the rage and constant yelling at the screen out of me lol.\nYou will see what i mean when the times come. Just to elaborate quickly it involves pulling various switches and making mad rushes to certain points while also having enemies ♥♥♥♥ you off by getting in your way or knock you down off a platform just to have to go the long way around to get back to where you were :)\n\nThe Good outweights the bad for this game though by a longshot. My first impressions of this game made me feel like i was playing a Castlevania SoTN clone with the graphics of Grand Chase/Elsword.\n\nThe combat and skill system is great. You can do a mix of light and heavy attacks with magic skills thrown in the mix to create some nice combos. You have 3 skill trees that you can put points into as you level up to increase "Passive" boosts to your characters. For example extra armor, hp, physical damage, magic damage, etc....\nThe actual magic skills you aquire are just from defeating Bosses during the story.\n\nLove the item trading system as well. No currency in this game. You aquire random item drops from enemies and you can go to vendors with the required lists of items and increase your different armors or sword's defense/damage.\n\nMy Final thoughts!\nIf you love platformer/metroid-vania games, you must buy this because its one of the better ones out there. Great soundtrack and gameplay. Even though the store page claims partial controller support, it is indeed FULLY controller operational and i highly recommend using a controller or you will get frustrated at times. Even with a controller there are times of utter frustration and constant cursing the computer screen lol. The story is good but could be better in the way its presented but all in all I did enjoy the game thus im giving it a Rating of........................\n\n9/10","January 25, 2015","true","7.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This was due to a too hard difficulty for a first playthrough in normal.  The reason for the difficulty are:\n- Some bosses are seriously too punishing to be fun.  I ended up screaming in anger in front of the screen and that's not good if you want to have fun.  At times, you really have to "cheat" to beat them (eye of Myrgato for example) and even then, it takes minutes to kill them.\n- Some places are really super painful: mobs sending you flying from far away, locking you up in attacks removing half your health, making you fall 3 screens and asking you to redo it all.  The biggest problem there is that it is even made like this by design.\n- You get too much possibilities to upgrade gear you find / spells and weapons but the decisions have a very strong impact.  For a first playthrough on normal, having no help / guide, I ended up with a build that was not doing much damage in the end, always ending up barely killing bosses and being told I was super bad (which was the case but after a point, it's just too late to change).\n- The important places (like the libary) are far away from each other so you end up running a lot from place to place.  Painful.\n\nSo, why did I continue in the end?  Why do I still recommend this?\nBecause I still think in the end that the game is worth being played.  I'd recommend reading some guide before because of the punising difficulty but all in all, it's really well done, the design is really awesome, all what has been poured into the game is worth checking.\n\nHonestly, I'haven't been that angry at a game for very long but it was still a good experience in the end.\nWithout the mistakes explained here above, this could have truly become an unforgettable hit like metroid... but it's not.\nPlay it if you like platformers but be prepared for mixed feelings :-)","January 12, 2014","true","18.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

One of the best features about this game is that it is CHALLENGING, which makes the victorys gratifying.\n\nThe combat is Melee/Magic based, with equipment that you scavenge from chests and upgrade. There is also a 3 tier skill tree, which lets you customize your character based on the way you fight.\n\nThe visuals are fun, i personally love the animaton style, and the soundtrack is a cut above the rest.\n\nONE LARGE PROBLEM is the command for healing magic is so sloppy, many of the later bosses send torrents of attacks your way, and the "heal" command shares the same button as the jump command" (WTF?) So when you find a second in the fight to cast a much needed healing spell, half the time you jump in the air, and get hit by another attack or cast the "Air" spell which gives hang time. Either way the second you had to heal is gone and you end up taking more damage because of a bad key setup.\n\nAlso there are many NPCs that are very flat, saying only one line. Endless Fluff could have done a better job making them more engaging. The story/terminology is also slightly confusing, not giving the main character a clear backstory (Why were they on a ship, where were they going?) Your sort of ploped into this fantastical world to look for your "crew" while also hearing that you are an ex soldier from a demon army, and they never tell you how you got from one point to the other. Lastly they seem to have abandoned the "Lore" section of the game, which could be finished in a couple hours. Very sloppy\n\nMinor criticisms aside, Valdis Story is very entertaining and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys games of the same genre.","October 27, 2015","true","56.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There's a skill tree, stats to ugprade, accessories, assists, etc.  Through trial and error I discovered moves and abilities, but even towards the end of the game, I was still discovering basic game mechanics because it didn't bother to tell me anything.  Worse yet, even on normal mode, the game can be pretty difficult.\n\nAs you level up, the enemies level up too (making the entire process basically worthless).  There are no easy areas.  Come back to the starting section after reaching level 10 and you'll discover the enemies have all leveled up too with new abilities and skills, increased defense, and increased attack power.   This becomes especially frustrating because the game requires a lot of backtracking if you want to collect everything.  Or in some cases, it's required just to progress.\n\nBoss fights especially are hard because they have extreme amounts of health and you can barely scratch them.   If after twenty minutes the boss's health is only at half, then something is wrong.  Even worse, many of them can heal, so it's entirely possible to spend an entire hour fighting a boss and have them at full health.\n\nStatus effects are never explained either.  Hit an enemy and a strange symbol appears over their head.  The game will never tell you what it does.\n\nFinally, about halfway through the game I decided to sit down and really commit to searching for information on the game.  And let me tell you it is almost impossible to find anything decent.  What is out there is scattered through several dozen forum posts and a wiki full of mostly blank pages.  It was only by spending time carefully combing through posts and following dubious and often broken links, that I discovered there are suggested builds and stats for the game.  (Although don't expect to actually find an explanation of these builds or a guide to stat upgrades.  They either don't exist or are extremely vague.)\n\nAnyway, three-fourths of the way through the game I discovered that because I hadn't done hours of research prior to even starting, I wasn't going to be able to progress.  My stat upgrades, skill tree path, weapon upgrades, and the items I'd wasted unique currency on were all mismatched because I'd been stumbling around in the dark.   Even the options to respec didn't help because I'd failed to achieve S-rank grades on boss fights, meaning I'd missed out on certain upgrades or bonuses I didn't know existed.\n\nAll in all, this game is a giant waste of time.  If it bothered to explain even 1/10th of the information I had to carefully glean from internet forum posts like a prospector panning for gold, it might have been salvageable.  It doesn't.  Save yourself time and go into a windowless room, turn off the lights, and walk around bumping into things at random.  It'll be the same basic experience.","January 17, 2015","false","18.4"," 24 of 52 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","24","52","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stevepunk/recommended/252030/","stevepunk","⎝Stevepunk⎠","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stevepunk/","308 products in account","Valdis Story takes a Metroidvania framework and adds technical combat, move-cancelling, timed block/parry and likeable characters that don't trap you in endless conversations loops.\n\nThis is an action game and it shows.\n\nI found every single boss fight challenging (unlike Castlevania SotN where you can just SoulSteal past every boss), and the timed platforming challenges had me swearing at the screen every time I made a mistake, but were oh so satisfying once completed, and my skills were that much better as a result (not to mention the extra loot).\n\nThe game has a unique potion system whereby potions are never lost when used, but refilled at a save point. They effectively act as continues, rezzing you automatically at the spot you died in the midst of the battle. It's really satisfying to find an extra potion as they are quite rare!\n\nThe move-cancellation system is a real treat! At any time you can press down to cancel whatever you are doing. This can be to cancel out of a longer attack animation, or to recover after being hit. This also has the effect of hammering you towards the ground post haste, so can even be used to move around the levels quickly.\nAlso once you hit the ground (or if you were already on the ground), you can immediately press left/right to dash in said direction! This is often used to get behind enemies that block from the front, or that are telegraphing overpowered attacks.\n\nEven when running from A to B, a quick 'down, forward' on the D-pad will give you a burst of speed to make the slight hesitation of pressing down worthwhile!\n\nThe cancellation is on a 2 second timer so can't be abused after every single attack animation, but you can find/craft more charges, and learn skills that reset the charges.\n\nAs you play the game you begin to transfer the cancel/dash and other moves to your muscle memory (the timed platforming sections are great for this, as while they start off easy enough, they soon become really challenging and require as many dashes and wall jumps as humanly possible).\n\nOnce you are performing these technical moves on the battlefield, you feel like such a badass, dashing, dodging, countering, wall jumping, building combos and triggering assists from your 'party' (think of any recent fighting game that allows you to tag in a backup character for a second), or going all out in focus mode!\n\nThere is no dodge rating or block percentage in this game; all skills must be performed by the player and timed perfectly for maximum results. Grinding can help to soften the edges of boss battles, but it's still on you to play well, especially once the timed platforming sections go from optional to compulsory, later in the game!\n\nAll in all, Valdis Story is a great action platformer in the style of Metroidvania, and is the most fun I've had with a game since I replayed Castlevania: Symphony of the Night on PS1 (earlier this morning).","January 4, 2014","true","20.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I came in looking for a metroidvania game after playing virtually all that are out there for NES, SNES, PS3, XBOX360/1 Nintendo DS/3DS, etc. I've been playing game for 30 years now on virtually every system ever released and I think I know quality when I see it. This game is just not there. The graphics are crisp and simplistic to the point that I really feel like I'm playing a flash game that should run for free on a website for people bored at work. The controls, at least on OS X are pretty laggy. They are also a little bit overly complex the second you jump into the game. The character/story development right off the bat is not intriguing or understandable. They just talk about some gods of the past without any real plot development. Of course, some of the greatest games like Metroid or Cave Story also started out with little to no plot development, but they also had mysterious and intriguing worlds to explore. This game really doesn't. You start out in some kind of cathedral that is totally uninteresting. The save points are also impossible to find and the map system is horrendous. What does the color coding even mean? I almost feel like just ignoring the map is more helpful. Anyway, I have plenty of money to spend but I still regret this purchase because I feel like I gave money to a developer who turned in a lackluster effort on this game...","July 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

First of all, this boss has WAY too much health for a boss so early in the game. Dashing is hardly effective for dodging anything because it's tied to that stupid skill-cancel feature that for some reason suddenly takes twice as long to refill unlike everywhere else in the game up to that point, which you'll totally trigger on accident from being forced to mash on the joystick to break out of its attacks (since mashing left-and-right on the D-pad is the most uncomfortable thing ever). Why can't I just double-tap left/right to dash like y'know, every other platformer ever made? You get magic and this "special meter full" mode to use against it but they're basically useless, same with blocking. The boss did eventually die after a dozen or so rage-filled attempts and even then I barely beat it thanks to that revive potion. Right afterwards you immediately stumble into enemies that hit even harder and faster than that boss and can do MORE ice attacks you have to button-mash out of. That's when you finally realise that you're playing Fake Difficulty: The game, and that the developers only made the first few minutes of the game easy to deceive you into thinking this game will have a reasonable learning curve when really it's the hardest most miserable thing ever since Battletoads, and even Battletoads at least had bosses that didn't take forever to kill.\n\nAbout the only good thing worth saying is that the game has a nice artstyle.","January 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/252030/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The “Metroidvania” platformer enjoyed its heyday some 15-20 years ago when Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night ruled the roost, and eventually found their names lent to the genre’s title. While many games since then have borrowed the tried-and-true mechanics of these classics, Valdis Story: Abyssal City is one that does so while also re-creating the aesthetic of the old-school consoles — its colorful art style would feel right at home on a PlayStation. The hours of engaging gameplay at hand will especially satisfy the nostalgic.\n\nIn a world where demons and angels are at war, Wyatt and his crew set sail in order to track down his missing father. During the voyage, their ship is attacked by creatures from below and sunk. Beneath the water's surface, they find a slowly dying ancient city under constant attack from angels, demons and ferals. Separated from his crew, Wyatt must now reunite them while continuing the search for his father. During his journey, he discovers lost secrets and unravels mysteries surrounding him and his friends.\n\nAs with its classic inspirations, the bulk of the gameplay in Valdis Story is spent battling enemies and exploring the side-scrolling landscapes. The satisfaction of a good Metroidvania game is intact; you’ll come across many inaccessible doors and return to them hours later with a means of entry, filled with anticipation of what could be behind them. The location of your next task is not always obvious, with a vague line of text serving as the only clue. This lack of hand-holding might frustrate in other games, but it’s a boon to Valdis Story, as revisiting areas to more thoroughly explore only enhances the whole. Valdis Story rewards those who go out of their way to explore; a vital aspect of this Metroidvania-style game. As you leap around the beautiful 2D world, you acquire new equipment and spells that allow access to previously unreachable locations. Summoning ice pillars as temporary platforms, short-range teleports and wall-kicking are just a few of the abilities needed to fully traverse the city. Dozens of hidden items, chests and crew members wait to be found, some of which are extraordinarily hard to find, making it sweeter when you do.\n\nThere’s a solid progression system in place, injecting RPG aspects to great effect. Experience is earned through defeating enemies, with a substantial amount of unlockable skills and stat upgrades to choose from as each new player level is achieved. There’s even somewhat of a crafting mechanic — materials collected in the wild can be provided to vendors to increase the effectiveness of armor and weapons, or create new ones outright.\n\nThe combat in Valdis Story is fun. Stringing together combos with the aid of unlocked skills is enchanting from start to finish. Magic plays a major part, serving as a gratifying complement to melee swordplay. By the game’s conclusion, you’ll have access to a generous amount of spells ranging from elemental attacks, to stat buffs, to abilities that help you reach otherwise-inaccessible areas. The depth of combat comes to light most effectively while entrenched in the numerous boss fights. Some of these tests are quite stiff, particularly later in the game. Success comes through experimentation, practicing different spells on different bosses, and even exploring the area where the battle takes place. But if nothing’s working out, doubling back for some old-fashioned level grinding goes a long way.\n\nCombat flows smoothly, and stringing attacks together is fast-paced and exciting. The keyboard controls are clunky, but they can be rearranged or a gamepad can be used. You can execute short-ranged dashes that allow you to dodge and move past foes, or employ more than twenty spells to deal damage, heal, boost your own abilities or reach new places. The sound effects that accompany them are appropriate, though a little artificial-sounding at times. Nevertheless, spell diversity is outstanding, and there are dozens of ways to approach combat in any particular battle. Often, you will need to mix up your strategy as some enemies focus on speed and manoeuvrability, while others are heavily armoured or stand back and shoot. There's a solid variety of foes, though their design relies on palette-swapping as the game progresses. On level up you can assign stat points and choose to focus on magic, melee or a mix of the two. It's a fun, flexible system that provides great variety on additional plays.\n\nThere are plenty of bosses to test your skills against, both story-based and optional, and you'll always need to be at your best to beat them. Monstrous armoured angels and sleek, agile demons are just a few you'll encounter. Different bosses require you to take down shields, stay above poisonous gas, navigate precarious platforms, destroy healing devices and even beat a time limit in order to destroy them. There's terrific variety, and, even on the normal difficulty setting, they are a real challenge to defeat. Once you do so, you are given a rank based on how soundly you thrashed them, and may be rewarded with extra experience or even additional stat or skill points to assign. At the end of the game you receive an overall ranking too, so completionists have a huge task ahead of them.\n\nI had a wonderful time playing Valdis Story. Time and time again it exceeded my expectations, and it's a privilege that I was able to play and review it. Just when I thought I had seen the greatest boss or most intense challenge, it threw another one at me. One play through, as Wyatt, takes about 10-15 hours, so there's at least twice that to play as Reina and collect all the hidden items. Throw in Gilda and Vladyn, and you can double that play time again! As long as you're prepared for a challenging game, I can't recommend Valdis Story enough.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 2, 2014","true","37.6"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","15","34","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/252030/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","3/10.\nWanted to like this game, had high hopes, but this game was a resounding disappointment. Lets start off with the game setup. The art is nice, so is how "open" it is and there is a lot to collect. The story seems interesting and there are a lot of bosses.\nNow the bad. The way the game is setup is with this giant map with tons of different vertical platforms and interconnected levels. There is also no real map, markings, information, quest markers, or anything. Quests give you no information, besides potentially tell you a direction to go in or maybe a specific area to get them, or maybe even neither of those. Don't mind that the map doesn't have the whole world, nor does it label anything. This leads to wandering a round and wasting hours on end with no idea what to do. This has led the community to create a map, and tons of people posting how they are lost because of no direction or information given by the game. Then, since every level has tons of different platforms and is super vertical, but has doors, levels, magic walls, it is impossible to get to half the stuff. I get some people love the "metroid" style but it basically is just backtracking, having to remember a wall you saw 3 hours about that you now have a power for. You never know where to get anything, or what to do with it.\n\nYou collect a bunch of team members but they don't seem to do anything nor does the game tell you what to do. You have tons of inventory spots, and levels of abilities, but the game doesn't give you any information about them either. I played for hours and still had tons of empty spaces in my inventory. The item system works by you basically collect a bunch of random mats that drop and you trade in a bunch for one thing. This means to get 1 thing you need 15 different types of mats, and if every single one hasn't dropped you don't get it. So instead of actually getting things, you're left with 1/2 the required amount needed of mats in your inventory without getting anything new ever. I used the same chestpiece for the whole time, because nothing I picked up was better.\n\nThen theres the terrible platforming. The controls are way too finnicky and floaty. Sometimes you guy will grab a ledge, other times he won't. Sometimes he will wall jump, sometimes he wont. If you use the analog when you jump you will slide off. Then there is the dash and the ground slam. They are done by using the directional buttons, instead of a button, wich would make more sense. This means tons of times when you want to jump, just because you touched down, you will slam down to the ground. Or you will suddenly dash without wanting to, just because of their terrible control scheme. Other times your guy won't jump soon enough when you press it, or he will just slide off the ledge. The controls are anything but tight, which you would expect for a game like this. Then, in annoying poorly done fashion, if you get hit there is the terrible "I must be interrupted and go flying backwards for no reason" which means while you are jumping or on a ledge if you get hit all and fall back or off a platform, which is frustrating when it shouldn't be.The game utilizes way too many timed mechanic puzzles just to open doors or get chests. Every area has, unlock 3 things in a row with 0 margin of error just to get an item you won't use, or a single mat.\n\nThe combat is pretty bad too, because each hit stuns you, you can get constantly chained and juggled by 2-3 normal enemies who just with continually hit you with no cooldown while you keep getting stunned. Not to mention they do tons of damage. In 1 group of regular guys I lost 2/3 my health in 2 second stun chain, which is soo dumb. The dash in combat is super finnicky too. There are guys that you can't walk past, who have shields you can't attack from in front. If you try and jump over they just slash up in the air and with the questionable hitboxes you will get hit no matter what. This means you must dash past them. But you can only dash once because for some reason it needs a cooldown. If you aren't exactly right up next to them you won't go through them. This means youll stand in front of them and they will just be able to hit you because you can't get past them for some reason, and dashin is dumb.\n\nThen there are the boss fights. Most of them are more annoying than they are fun. You never know when they are coming. You suddenly enter a room and the boss fight started, meaning if you don't have potions you are screwed. You cannot leave the area either if you don't want to fight. And since you only can restore potions in the 1 save checkpoint per giant area you will unlikely be able to do it. Some guys use almost instant kill attacks that you can get caught in like a fire pillar.Many people on the discussion forums talk about all the different annoying cheap boss fights that weren't fun, so there are many ones. I fought a stupid annoying boss that you can't hurt until you climb a bunch of platforms while doddging homing swords, to destroy a crystal, so you can then hurt him, but your magic and weapons do very little damage, and once the crystal heals itself it then will heal the boss. This means I made almost no progress and there was nothing I could do about it. Each time I would do about 1/20th of his health after he was healed.\n\nThen theres the spells. Instead of being easy to use, they are triggered to holding R trigger and ALSO pressing a directional key. So you have to remember which spell is related to which directional preference, also, since they are directional, this causes problems with movements and dash/slam. Many times I would go to cast a spell and it would make me move off a ledge, or instead of casting it would make me use a cancel/slam. Also, there are different types of spells :light/dark/fire/ice. The problem is is some do no damage to enemies and others are weak to some. This means in each area, you have to figure out what each guy is, and what they are weak to, then switch your spells to them on the wheeel, which isn't easy to do as its finnicky when using the quick/change ability. Add to it that some abilities you need to get up to ledges or through doors and it becomes annoying. You somehow level up abilities but that isn't explained nor didn't seem to happen much. You level up, but only get to add 1 attibute point total, and the abilities in the tree you choose from are boring, like 10% more health, crits deal more damage, you deal more damage in 5 chain hits, etc, and the higher level abilities can only be gotten once you get a level, but ALSO once you get 2 different abilities that form a tree to that ability, meaning you will have to waste points in things you don't want to get something later on.\n\nThe way the open-endedness is done is just terrible. Sure there is tons of things to unlock and a big map to explore, but the levels have 5 ways to go, are super vertical and annoying to navigate through, there is no real fastravel (besides btw 3 villages), no markers/waypoints, no maps, no information about anything at all. For this main quest, I was supposed to go into these 2 different areas, but one of them required a key that I didn't have. Why would the main quest send me to somehwere I can't go. Apparently I was just supposed to wander around a ton or fight some random boss or do something random to get that key. The other area had this annoying healing boss I did no damage to. From watching videos some guys did tons of damage with the same spells that I used that did none, but my spells were level 1. So apparently either this video guy was too high level or I was supposed to level up my spells, but how I don't know. I either had to grind levels or find some random area/ optional boss that helped me level them up. There are new weapons and abilities to get, but you need to find the random chest/puzzle/optional boss/teammate instead of natural progression.","September 1, 2015","false","9.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/forksandknives/recommended/252030/","forksandknives","Forks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/forksandknives/","180 products in account","Beautiful game falls short of expectations. The artwork looks great. (1/5)\n\nThere are many problems that CANNOT be overlooked in this game.\n\n1. The controls. The dodge button is really difficult to proc and it is the same button you use to 'cancel' an attack. They should have just had a dedicated button to 'dash' and another button to cancel. There are so many keys on the keyboard and buttons on a gamepad like the XBOX 360 PC Controller that it baffles my mind why some of the button combinations are so god awful.\n\nAnother thing, the block and Magic button, when pressed simultaneously, it brings up a screen to rebind your magic. Here's a tip, GET RID OF THIS GOD DAMN BIND. IF we wanted to change up our magic combinations, we should just go back to the menu in our inventory instead of this 'fast' changeout of magic skills. The problem is if you are blocking an attack then attempt to do magic, sorry, you go to the magic skill screen to swap skills. It's very annoying, breaks the immersion, and impacts the ability to fight.\n\n2. Jumping onto platforms should not be this difficult. The character model looks like they'd be able to 'latch' onto a ledge, but they don't. It is VERY unpleasant to miss a jump, then get chain attacked by mobs.\n\n3. Combat. If you are surrounded my a bunch of mobs, they WILL chain attack you and juggle you, to the point where you cannot fight back and you're dead.\n\n4. Combat & Mobs. This is an RPG with not enough mobs in a damn map to kill in order to actually GET sufficent EXP out of them. Furthermore, there are NO consumables, so you're dependent on save points to regenerate HP/MP, kill maybe 2-3 mobs, and then head back to base to regenerate. Although you get potions later in the game, they only proc when you're DEAD. Running back to base when you've got 50 HP left is NOT fun. This was incredibly short sighted on their part.\n\nThere is NOT enough mobs to get Experience from, which greatly hinders your ability to get levels and blast through bosses. You end up staying in 1-2 areas killing a few mobs over and over again. It hurts the immersion and the feel of the game.\n\n5. There is no 'up' attack. You jump up and do a horizontal attack in one of the two directions. There WILL be mobs either flying or directly above you attacking you and you have no way of attacking them unless you use magic.\n\n6. Puzzles with Timers. There's very little time to get to through to the area with the activated door, and you have to rush to the area spamming your abilities. Timers are something like 6-12 seconds, average is 6 seconds. In my opinion, they should have just had switches activate and gotten rid of the time. The game attempts to add too many obstacles to a game that already has issues that hinder progression as seen by the terrible and broken keypad interface.\n\nClosing Statements: The game looks incredible; however, it's just that, it only LOOKS good. The game is hindered by it's control system, consumables (potion system), and the way the characters gain experience. It feels like I must spend 20 minutes grinding an area for 1, maybe 2, levels before progressing to another area to take down enemies. The story looks good, which is sad because it's being ruined by essential components in the game.\n\nThe lack of healing items and regenerative abilities.\nThe lack of experience gain from enemies.\nThe lack of enemies in general, and when they are plentiful, they all attack at once and juggle you to death.\nThe lack of consistency in jumping and grabbing onto ledges. It's 50/50\nThe implement of timers is poorly done. The timers should be increased by 2/3 times. It really a component that is not necessary in this game.\nThe poor use of buttons/key combinations for skills. They need to fix the dodge and quick magic skill menu.\n\nJust stay away from this game. Your time and money is better spent elsewhere on a game that works as intended.\n\nAn alternative RPG game like this genre is Y's Origin. It's a much better and consistent Hack and Slash with great replayability due to it's 3 playable characters, each with a different twist on the story.","March 14, 2014","false","4.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

It's pretty, to be sure, but the gameplay is a complete mess.\n\nThe controls are so messy that I can't actually predict what my character is going to do. Hitting the attack button three times will result in my character attacking 2-4 times. This is BRUTAL when you're fighting enemies that will parry/counterattack after a certain number of blocks.\n\nThere's an ability called "Skill Cancel" that lets you dodge, but it's so fiddly I can't actually predict which way I'll dodge, or if I will at all.\n\nBosses aren't balanced at all. In the time I played I noticed that there are bosses that are totally, 100% unkillable until a certain ability is unlocked or item purchased, at which point the boss is completely trivial.

Everything looked nice on paper; the production value seemed high, the ideas seemed great, but the execution fails rather fundamentally and takes what should be an action-packed exploration of a fantastical wonderland and boils it down into a frustrating and poorly finished combat system with which you fight more than the in-game enemies.\n\nAs is the custom, first are the PROs:+Soundtrack is well done (at least, what little I heard of it)\n+Backgrounds and environments are colorful and pretty (with some small visual design issues I'll get into later)\n+Character art is charming\n+Animations are purely gorgeous, though they can, on occasion, move too fast to understand what your player or enemies are doing.\n+The concepts behind the combat are exciting, though they're a letdown in terms of execution\n\nThen, the CONs:-Often times, interactable things like doors and enemies are difficult to discern from non-interactable elements.\nThis is the visual design whoopsie I mentioned. Efforts are clearly made to make them "pop" from the background with a small, glowing outline on doors, but this garnish, too, blends with the palette and other elements of most environments, disabling the intended effect.\n\n-Controls. This was a bit big, so I needed to break it into paragraphs. Apologies.\n\nPut as succinctly as possible, the controls are very floaty and imprecise. Every movement carries far too much weight, causing your momentum play a BIG part in the gameplay. Running and jumping while pressing the opposite direction will cause your character to continue much of his forward motion and stopping and starting movement on the ground is stiff and wishy-washy. It feels like you're trying to wrangle your character whenever you try and get from one spot to another. This game requires much, much more precision than it's willing to give you, and all it leads to is frustration.\n\nWhat this game needed, and perhaps tried to emulate, is the Castlevania style of movement, where changes in momentum are immediate and everything responds as soon as you can think it. Based on the attack patterns and speed of the enemies, this admittedly unrealistic style of movement is an absolute requirement if fairness and a sense of player agency is to be upheld. Most of the time, you end up being helplessly bounced around, struggling to regain control of your own character, much less trying to attack enemies. If you still find it difficult to imagine, just think of ice-floor controls, but everywhere. It's not nearly as pronounced as that idea, sure, but it's fundamentally what I'm talking about. By the way, this game does employ the ice-floors trope in certain areas, which only accentuates the aforementioned flaws.\n\nAdditionally, the acceleration in moving your character is inconsistent, clicking into a "higher gear", so to speak, after what seems to be an arbitrary amount of time. This isn't the only thing which is inconsistent, as getting hit can sometimes cause your character to cease all horizontal motion and begin a control-less freefall down what is often a significant amount of floors. Precision is made impossible by the whimsically activating acceleration as well as the oddly perilous distance your attacks seem to carry you, often flinging you off of things and missing enemies.\n\n-There are no invincibility frames upon taking damage.\nThis is pretty self-explanatory, really, and it results in very frequent stun-locking. I don't think it needs to be said, but stun-locking the player is never fair nor is it engaging. I hate to generalize, but if you ever find your game putting the player into a position where punishment is doled out either with inconsistent relation to the player's actions or with plain abandon regardless of the player's actions, you have something that needs fixing. Stunlocking can occur without direct relation to how badly a player screwed up, and it is also a position in which the player has no agency. This type of inconsistent punishment puts stress on the player, as he/she can never fully predict whether a light tap will result in a bit of damage, or an extended tornado of pain.\n\n-Enemy design\nMost enemies fire projectiles. Avoiding them takes nimble aerial movement, which this game lacks, but many times projectiles are fired at you from off-screen, making them impossible to predict. This robs the player of the ability to anticipate their trajectory and space oneself accordingly. Even regarding the enemies on-screen, projectiles come out so fast and without warning that the optimal strategy when dealing with an enemy is to wait for them to attack first before approaching, as you can get close to an enemy, prepare an attack, and be knocked back suddenly by their projectile. When attacks like that can seemingly come from nowhere, the player is forced into a very stilted, slow mode of progression, which is detrimental to this game's design, overall. Add the floaty controls to this, and you'll feel like 90% of every hit was taken without justice.\n\n-Exploration techniques which use mana\nI didn't play far enough to know if there are multiple instances of this happening, but one spell you can cast called "frost tower" is necessary as a tool for reaching high ledges. The problem is that this mechanic uses MP, so if you approach such a ledge and you are without MP, you cannot progress until you stand around a wait for it to recharge. A tool of progression should not be tied to a limited use mechanic, otherwise it just gets in the way of exploration. As one of this game's core mechanics, exploration should be handled with the utmost fidelity.\n\nIn summary, I thought that this was a game that really deserved to be good. The combat ideas were interesting and the game looks and sounds like a dream, but the mishandled combat and exploration elements were just far too strong a turn-off for me to continue playing. Personally speaking, this is a project that I would have LOVED to be a part of during development because I think it could have been easily be turned around, but as a finished product, I can't recommend it even for a niche audience.\n\nIf you are someone new to the Castlevania-type of games, of which this is an example, then I would recommend playing a Castlevania game. If you are someone who has played a Castlevania game before and is looking to satisfy that special itch with something fresh, then I would especially recommend staying away, as you will be even less likely to tolerate the lack of polish here. As someone who has played nearly every Castlevania game multiple times and really craves something new in that vein, it's actually more appealing to re-tread those old grounds than to accommodate this game's flaws.\n\nTo be honest, it really hurts to hate this game as it has clearly had a LOT of effort put into it, but every play session devolves instantaneously into pure rage at the broken mechanics and unfair, unpolished, rookie game design.","March 18","false","2.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

There are some questionable design choices regarding that in Valdis Story, none the least of which is ledge clinging which requires you to press up to climb up. This makes bosses with platforms a very awkward affair, as you will need to be moving quite a bit to avoid certain attacks. Compounding the movement issue is poor air control, making jumping to small platforms extremely annoying.\n\nCombat is fairly simple, but bogged down by the most annoying magic system ever concieved. Hold the magic button then press a direction to cast one of four equippied abilities, which have to be set through one of two menus (why?).\n\nBoth combat and movement is hampered by the game's dodging system, which requires you to press the down directional key to activate it, and you will have to use the dodge mechanics in and out of some boss fights. Since the dodge system has the secondary function to trigger stomping (for activiating floor switches) this can create issues for players during jumping sequences.\n\nThe RPG elements feel rather pointless. Including stat point distribution (out of 4 stats), a passive skill tree to which you allot skill points, as well as items and equipment to pick up (not simply upgrade items like wall jump which are necessary for progression). The way they interact really feels like the entire system was cobbled together from disparate ideas, and could have been streamlined far better into a much simpler system.\n\nGraphically the game's 2D sprites look ok, are decently animated and work well with the over all astetic, except when it comes to the menu interface, which is pixeleated halfway to oblivion despite setting the resolution scale to 2x (It reeks of a port). Which brings up another problem. There's no resolution option apart from the scaling at all.\n\nOverall, the game developer's inexperience (Valdis Story is their second title) shows, but if you can over look the rough edges I'm sure you can find some entertainment out of this title. I personally reccomend picking it up on sale.","May 7","false","3.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stalination/recommended/252030/","stalination","Yawzheek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stalination/","95 products in account","Well, having spent the better part of a few days with Valdis Story, and I'm sure I'll play through a bit more, I feel like I'm finally ready to give my opinion on it.\n\nShould you buy it? The short version is "no." The long version is, "Yes, but..."\n\nLet's quickly figure out why you're here first - you heard it was either difficult, or Metroidvania, right? Well, the game isn't hard, and what's Metroidvania about it is a Frankensteined mess of some of the worst aspects of a Metroidvania game. That's not to say it has no good qualities, but the bad outweigh the good by far.\n\nBad platforming seems to be a staple of Metroidvania games, and Valdis Story most emphatically doesn't disappoint. It's the worst, and the controls just aren't up to the task without extreme frustration. Some of the most egregious of these processes not only involve extended sections of bad platforming, but bad platforming on small, moving ledges, again with conveniently placed enemies designed to knock you back off, falling down a floor or two, sending you back through rooms you've already cleared to re-clear them and try again. Will you grab the ledge, bounce off the wall, or fall harmlessly down it? Hard to say, but it'll probably annoy the hell out of you. Really, many of the enemies are obviously placed with the sole purpose of knocking you off the platform, as they pose no real threat, but are placed in such a way that actually getting to them without being knocked off is the real challenge.\n\nMost of the enemies are fairly well-rounded, and bring some interesting mechanics. Again though, they're not really challenging, and most can be pretty easily dispatched by charging in head first and mashing buttons. Of the few that don't fall to such a basic attack, some of them are rather entertaining to play, if not a bit cheap in some of their moves. There's something about an enemy going invulnerable and casting a nearly unavoidable ice storm that freezes you, forcing you to waggle an analog stick to break free, only to be hit with yet another ice attack, become frozen directly after escaping the first, and going through the waggle motions again.\n\nThe bosses are the real highlight of the difficulty, but those... it's really tough to say they're difficult. Some run the gamut of being mildly challenging to somewhat difficult, but it's safe to say all of them generally fall to the same tactic of avoid their 2-3 moves, grab a few quick hits (or stunlock them, if the fight permits it,) run away, and repeat. They become quite predictable quite quickly. Thankfully, the game incorporates a Devil May Cry ranking system based on a few factors, speed being one of them, that encourages risky tactics to fell them quicker, which grant better rewards based on your rating at completion. An especially nice touch that I really appreciated, and some of the battles grant significant rewards, such as massive amounts of experience to stat bonuses.\n\nWhile we're on the topic, the combat system for melee is quite basic, but typically does its job well. There are quite a few aspects of it, however, that get more in-depth, and the game is very tight-lipped as to explaining what they do, and why you should care. Having a browser open isn't a terrible idea. Unfortunately I can't give praise to the magic system. Many of the spells are rather useless, and though you will NEED to use some of them to accesss secret/hidden/progression areas, there's a good chance that's ALL you'll use them for. The control scheme for them is atrocious, where holding right trigger plus a directional area on your D-pad or left analog stick is disgusting, plus the fact that holding down on your D-pad or analog stick causes another reaction, and shifting spells is typically done with right trigger+B, at which point you have to cycle through them all until you find the desired spell... it's just bad. Really, really bad, and the spells themselves are pretty underwhelming. All said and done, melee works rather well, but avoid magic like the plague.\n\nFurther, the map is almost completely useless, which is a real sin considering the game involves large amounts of backtracking to find places you couldn't previously access. The UI is bad and could use a severe overhaul, and for whatever reason, when you've triggered enough hits to access your "combo breaker" or whatever it's called (also VERY underwhelming) it lets off so many sprites you actually think there's something going on that requires your attention in the upper-left of your screen.\n\nI won't touch on the story too much, since there's not much more you can say outside of convoluted, difficult to follow, but still dull as hell. Angels and demons are waging a war, you've been caught in the middle of it while attacking a demon ship, neither the angels nor demons like you, and you need to save the day while reuniting with your crew and befriending other citizens caught in the middle. It's not interesting, and if you skip through the dialog, I wouldn't blame you.\n\nAll that being said, the game has enormous amounts of replay, unlockables, secrets, etc., with multiple ways to play. If you're a person that doesn't mind frustration, and enjoys the Metroidvania style of play, despite its numerous flaws, it's a solid game that will probably give you quite a bit of entertainment. If any of that doesn't appeal to you, I don't think you'll appreciate Valdis Story. The game has some great ideas, and moments of good fun and combat, but those moments are few and far between, and require enormous patience on the part of the player.","October 12, 2014","false","6.3"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

For example, you can spend several minutes standing around waiting for mana to recover to heal yourself (particularly fun on levels where you lose 5 hp / second because it's cold). Often, missing a single jump means you fall off the current screen and have to fight two screens back to the same jump. If you want to collect items to upgrade your equipment, you'll be grinding for hours. The map doesn't show information like where passages go or what treasures you haven't collected. Then there's a "puzzle" where you jump back and forth up a long shaft and need split-second timing to activate seven different doors and missing one means starting all over - turns out you need some upgrade that I didn't even know existed.\n\nOther than wasting your time, the game often feels written by people who hate you. For example, save points are fairly uncommon, and then SURPRISE BOSS FIGHT. Or to enter the Guardian Temple, you fall into it - there is no sign you're about to go in, and no way to climb back out. Enter a room and SURPRISE four enemies are now all around you! (And yes, the doors are "magically sealed" for the ambushes.)\n\nAnd it's not like you can overlook these things because the game is particularly clever or cute or has a compelling story or characters. Basically, you're going to like this game if you like mastering rapid-fire key press combinations, but that's really all there is to recommend it.","September 30, 2014","false","4.6"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Several enemies can stunlock you, which results in one lucky attack causing you to die helplessly (or get knocked down 3 stages below). This is particularily annoying with certain bosses (Looking at you Gernot), since he uses stun spells,a bad spread of attack will get you killed through your whole lives since he can hit you as soon as your revive animation goes through to stun you again and keep the circle going.\nThe controls are not very tight, firstly they have a weird setup to begin with, I highly recommen changing it (Down then forward to dash? Who ever though it would be good idea). The ledge jumping gets tedious as you'll never know if your character will decide to latch on or not, introduce enemies that shoot at you sometimes from anywhere in the map and you get some annoyance.\nFinally, the biggest problem of this game, the hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. Enemy attack animations are only loosely representative of where you'll actually get hit, Demon Widows being the worst offender in this case.

It is *so close* to being a good hack 'n slash side scroller, but the developers made some choices with the controls that I just can't get over. You find yourself jumping and clinging to ledges, and then climing up them, very frequently.  The player looses control for just a part of a second while the animation for this happens, and then once you are done climbing the ledge and returned to a nice standing position, you will have control again. You do a spinny sword move in the air, and there is a brief pause between hitting the ground and regaining control. Your main dodge move is considered some kind of "special" ability which has a short (second-ish maybe) cooldown. There is no indication on the character animation as to when you're ready to dodge again, just a fading purple indicator in the upper left corner. So if you want to know when you are able to /dodge/ in a boss fight, you either need to have the timing memorized, or be watching your indicators while trying to dodge. I've never played any other game where simply dodging has a cooldown.\n\nPlaying Valdis Story feels like playing a really good platformer that freezes for a split second every few seconds. I understand the value of delays and cooldowns in movement and abilities in games, I just don't feel like were well executed in this game. The movement feels like it's being frequently interrupted for no good reason.","October 23, 2014","false","5.6"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

If you can grab it cheap and you want a platformer this is fine, but don't expect it to be your game of the year, unless you're 12 or an absolute manchild.","July 31, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

Have fun with that one, completionists/perfectionists!\n\n-The controls actually aren't as bad as most people say, however they are made vastly worse by the lack of mercy invicibility. Enemies that have a guaranteed freeze attack? Enjoy that stunlock.\n\n-Enemies hit like trucks, have poor telegraphing, and have very low exp rates.\n\n-Too many puzzles. This is a Metroidvania with clear indications of it leaning towards the -vania half. "Vania" has very few puzzles, and the ones that do exist are rarely, if ever, based upon split-second timing.\n\n-Items are in limited number. You cannot obtain every item in one playthrough. Oh, and you don't have a Newgame+, so you can NEVER have every item in one file.\n\n-Leveling is very slow, unrewarding, and caps very early (20/25). If you thought the RPG elements would save you, you were wrong.\n\n-Retrying is actually a detriment, as overall retries will lower you final score.\n\nMAIN Positives\n\n-The soundtrack is lovely and helps capture the feel of the current level.\n\n-The sprites are superb and very fluid.\n\n-The art style is unique, combining elements from Anime-themed games and classic Castlevania.\n\nVERDICT\n\nIf one of your favorite games of all time is Symphony of the Night (just like me), you shouldn't try this game. This was a huge disappointment wrapped in a beautiful shell.","April 5","false","8.3"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","1","10","0","4"

This is a metroidvania version of I Wanna Be The Guy. If you like that game, you're going to love this one since it's built on the same principles:\n\n* EVERY enemy is a cheap, multi-hit air-combo juggling spam-fest. If you fight more than three enemies at a time and they crowd you, it's better to simply put down your controller and wait for them to kill you. If you survive the encounter, your bad healing ability will have you wait five minutes before you can fight the next batch of enemies only to repeat the cycle. I can understand elites in a game, but when every single unit has the health and skills of an elite that invariably juggles you in the air until you die on NORMAL difficulty, then that's a problem.\n\n* Pitfall screens, so you're up three stories in a dungeon, you get hit by one of the enemies, you fall two screens down and have to climb back up. This is not fun, this is punishing.\n\n* This has been said a lot, but the jumping mechanics and mantling are really bad. Unless you hit just the right part of a wall, down you go again. Combine this with the level design that seems geared towards you falling into pitfalls and you have a really bad result.\n\n* This is especially infuriating when you have to do timed jump/run puzzles where your inability to properly walljump punishes you by having you redo the puzzle again. And really, these puzzles are insanely complicated in some instances.\n\n* Boss rooms aren't marked on the map, why is this a problem?\n\nWell, here is a typical flow of a quest in this game:\n\n1) Get a hint from someone to go somewhere.\n2) Navigate annoying pit-fall maze with juggling enemies that forces you to stop every ten minutes to heal.\n3) Get hard to get treasures with jump/run puzzles\n4) Save somewhere in the middle of the dungeon\n5) Navigate even harder pitfalls and environment hazards, get killed a few times.\n6) Get more treasures through puzzles, defeat more enemies, level a bit\n7) Stumble over boss room and realize boss is impossible for your current level.\n\nAt this point, you can't quit the game. Either you defeat the boss and progress, or you lose ALL progress you've made since point 4 in the list above. Again, this is punishment, not because you're bad, but because the design decisions are bad.\n\nSo after having played ten hours and gone through the same cycle over and over, I realized that I wasn't having fun, I wasn't enjoying the scenery, I wasn't pondering the story. I was just focused on exploiting the AI and how to not get killed and that's really not my idea of fun in a game.\n\nAnd really, considering the fantastic world this game throws at you, it's a huge shame.","April 22, 2014","false","9.3"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

Well don't play this game. 90% of the bosses scenarios and enemies feel like you are simply up against unfair borderline cheating. Did you dodge that super blade? Nope! Did you grab that wall? NOPE! did you enjoy yourself? NOPE! This is seriously on the edge of I wanna be the boshy, except the controls feel like they simply do not care what button you are pressing at key moments. if the game wants you to take a hit when you are hitting the dodge button YOU ARE going to take the hit. Does the game decide you can't wall just out of the poison? Well guess what it doesn't matter how many times you hit that button you aren't jumping out of the poison. Aditionally this should have come with a quick reset button.(Edit) It does come with a reset option HOWEVER you must\n1 go to the main menu\n2 hit retry\n3 make sure you have the gear you want to use, because if you change your gear mid fight, it doesn't remeber it.\n4 Dodge the obnoxious fast Boss risking losing an S ranking becuase you need to pause instantly to change stuff.\n\nAll that aside you CAN have fun with it, however I do not suggest going in blind. look at strategies, look at how other people do, and then try it for yourself.\n----------Summary------------\nIf you like the "I wanna be the -" Games play it, you may enjoy it. If you like Punishing grueling teeth grinding games Play it! If you want a 2d version of darksouls Give it a whirl! But if you want a game that you can simply enjoy without developing a brain tumor, stay away.\n\n(side note) this game doesn't lead you anywhere, you can miss VERY important things by going straight to the objective. This is a great part of the game.

There are unlockables to this game like support charraters (your crew) and they help you upgrade your magic or help you when you fight which is a big bounus in this game. I would really recomend this to people who like platformer games that have rpg elements and are completetioners. :D","July 27, 2014","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The drawings and the flowing motion of the animation gives this game a fantastic atmosphere as does the soundtrack . Also it contains its share of difficulty by having both the normal difficulty level starting from normal and becoming harder as an extra difficulty provided by the character you wish to control as the main character .

Well don't play this game. 90% of the bosses scenarios and enemies feel like you are simply up against unfair borderline cheating. Did you dodge that super blade? Nope! Did you grab that wall? NOPE! did you enjoy yourself? NOPE! This is seriously on the edge of I wanna be the boshy, except the controls feel like they simply do not care what button you are pressing at key moments. if the game wants you to take a hit when you are hitting the dodge button YOU ARE going to take the hit. Does the game decide you can't wall just out of the poison? Well guess what it doesn't matter how many times you hit that button you aren't jumping out of the poison. Aditionally this should have come with a quick reset button.(Edit) It does come with a reset option HOWEVER you must\n1 go to the main menu\n2 hit retry\n3 make sure you have the gear you want to use, because if you change your gear mid fight, it doesn't remeber it.\n4 Dodge the obnoxious fast Boss risking losing an S ranking becuase you need to pause instantly to change stuff.\n\nAll that aside you CAN have fun with it, however I do not suggest going in blind. look at strategies, look at how other people do, and then try it for yourself.\n----------Summary------------\nIf you like the "I wanna be the -" Games play it, you may enjoy it. If you like Punishing grueling teeth grinding games Play it! If you want a 2d version of darksouls Give it a whirl! But if you want a game that you can simply enjoy without developing a brain tumor, stay away.\n\n(side note) this game doesn't lead you anywhere, you can miss VERY important things by going straight to the objective. This is a great part of the game. Punishment is the key word here and I suggest you are ready to be punished like a masochist before playing this game.","January 2, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story feels JRPG-ish with the way the dialogue is set up, which I personally find as a plus. The leveling system adds several different ways to go about fighting, as does the element system which allows for a combination and easy-swap to counter any monster type at any moment.\n\nWhile the platforming can be difficult at times, its more than likely that it is for a completely optional item that may or may not help you. I see a lot of complaints regarding the platforming, but most of the "difficult" ones are simply optional.\n\nAs far as progressing through the game, there is no hand holding. There is a simple indicator on which area you need to go to and the direction it's in. There is a lot of exploration to be done, especially later in the game when backtracking is essential to completing that old puzzle you didn't have the ability or means to complete before.\n\nWhat I have a minor issue with is the restricted trading system, as it sometimes feels like it doesn't give anything of use. There are obvious exceptions to this such as the weapon/armor upgrades given later in the game, but otherwise there are only a few other items that you will be looking for each time you find a trader.\n\nMy biggest issue though is the lack of "navigation completion". By that, I mean that the maps don't indicate very well that this particular room is complete, giving the feeling that there's always Something left to do it there, when in reality there isn't. It's a little frustrating for the completionist in me because I want to be sure I collect every treasure and complete each room to its fullest.\n\nOverall, a must-get for anyone looking for a Good Metroidvania game. 9/10","January 2, 2014","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

This game, to me, has set the bar for what crowd funded indie games can achieve. It was a totally addicting journey from start to finish. I normally don't do metroidvania because I am conceptually against backtracking and it certainly didnt help that I havent been into platformers since maybe the late GBA era, but this game persisted to me as a stand out title. I love so much about the game, the music, the combat, the level of character customization (weapons, armor, accessories, meaningfully branched skill trees, etc.), the well implimented story and all the little details and encounters. It reminds me of Dark Souls in a more colorful way. Angels are trying to murder you (and everyone else) and harvest your souls, demons are trying to do essentially the same thing and you are here to sort that out with nothing but the simple goal of shredding two oppressive and militant Goddesses. I normally dont PC game all that much, so the controls were innitially kind of a brick wall to me, but I was enjoying the game so much that I found mysellf trying very hard on the first playthrough to actually adapt to using my fingers instead of my thumbs for playing the game (The game supports game pads, but apparently only Xbox because my PS3 controller wont work).

Often there is no clear way of knowing how your actions will or won't affect what happens later. Nothing is TOLD to you, you just have to get there by luck and a little bit of knowing what's going on.\nFinding your way around can be a total pain as well. You have a map, but you can't switch the map to scan other zones for unexplored areas. You have to physically go to those zones to check for things you've missed.\nThe other problem is that the story is ultimately a little muddled and I'm not given any reason to truly care about any of the characters - not even the protagonist. There is nothing that makes anybody particularly memorable or loveable. They exist, and you can talk to them, but there's no reason to care about them. During the final moments of the game, a few characters even appear and 'assist' you in killing enemies, but there's no reason for their appearance and you can't talk to them. They feel like an afterthought thrown in to help serve the ending scenes.\n\nIt's a fun little game; it's not amazing, but it's pretty good.","February 16, 2014","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As angry as the puzzles can make me, as harrowing as some of these boss battles are, AS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AS I CAN ♥♥♥♥ING GET AT THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME...\n\nIt is worth every dime you pay for it. Despite the challenges, or even because of the challenges if you can get past the possibilities of rage quitting, it is a wonderful game. The graphics are stunning, the mechanics of the game are pretty spiffy, the characters are pretty awesome, and the plot keeps me interested. The enemies are broad in variety, the bosses are a league of their own, and finding crew members is a fun side game of its own, I'd have to say.\n\nThe fact that your main character's soul can gain either a dark, light, or neutral affinity based on the armor you choose, the spells you use most often, and the accesories you choose to wear is pretty novel. Most games, it's what you choose to say. This game, it's how you choose to fight, and that is a rather cool idea, and at the very least, really ♥♥♥♥ing intriguing.\n\nI would suggest this game to anybody. Especially if you love hacking and slashing, some witty one liners, using magic spells, and the occasional puzzle. I'll admit, as much as they ♥♥♥♥ me off, they provide an edge-of-your-seat challenge that tend to have this really relieving and rewarding feeling when you can manage to make it to your goal in time.\n\nDefinitely buy it. If you got 15 dollars, I would recommend this game. The replay value really speaks for itself, and you can play as one of a few characters, so hours of fun are something to be had with this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evsknight/recommended/252030/","evsknight","evs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evsknight/","495 products in account","I'll start by saying this is a great game, the only thing that stops it being a fanstastic game though is some flaws which bleed through into frustration inducing headache.\n\nIt's your normal 'start with nothing but your sword' affair and then go to villages performing their run of the mill tasks 'please get me X item and i'll unlock this door for you' and so on and you run around dungeons with a different colour/environment with slightly different spikes/traps in each one. Rinse and repeat until bosses are killed, find some other people from your ship that sank to get extra shops, story and perhaps an attack or two and repeat the formula until the end.\nThere's no originality here but what it does, it does well.\n\nThe Soundtrack is magnificent, very impressive and gets the blood pumping in battle and sets a superb orchestral haze for general exploring. It's arguably some of the best 'fitting' music for a platform ARPG since Zelda 'A link to the past'.\n\nGraphically and animation wise it's top notch, there's a few games in the same category which trump it but the style serves well and has a strong western anime feel to it.\n\nStory wise? Again decent yarn, you are the grey line inbetween demons and angels and battle both. Done to death with diablo onwards but still its pretty interesting but not great.\n\nSo down to the meat of it:\n\nExploration? Check. There isn't a million rooms but my god the back tracking. I'll say it now, if you don't like backtracking in games, remembering where items/chests that are unreachable are and committing it to memory/paper or notepad then forget it. This is your personal hell. The map isn't that great and you can end up spending hours running through the same puzzles/traps/monsters etc just to find out which way is up and where you are meant to be going. Especially on the puzzles where you'll be force to run through the same ones several times.\n\nCombat? Correct and present. It's not that complex, just rack up combos, block/dodge, rack up some more and so on. You get a nice dash feature called a skill cancel, it also allows you to break out of some frames of animation in a combat setting but generally speaking it's not that great and far too many puzzles expect it.\nThe worst bit about combat is the juggling that occurs on you. Too many opportunities to have 2/3 enemies which bounce you around like a basketball and it's unblockable/cancellable.\nThankfully it doesn't happen often but it's incredibly annoying getting pinged between them an no hope of escape.\nThere's also a nice limit break /rage feature called focus allowing you to special attack for a large amount of damage. Which most of the time you wont bother and will ignore it, mainly because its a key combo to turn on the rage and then another to execute a super attack. I think it's probably why I just disregarded it as with the split seconds you get an attack opportunity on bosses, it's more bother than worth trying when you can just heavy attack instead.\n\nPuzzles/traps/chests? Yarp. None are difficult in working out what to do, many are painful in execution. You are talking pixels and split second timing on some puzzles to get that elusive chest which, 9/10 times is rubbish anyway. The movement of the character is wooly at times, often you can be stood on a switch graphically - but you aren't and need to scootch over a little to activate it. Same with jumping onto walls to grab them, the collision can be horrible on some of the later dungeon walls which are crumbly graphic wise but you are actually guessing where to jump to. Bad design here unfortunately.\n\nBosses? All here and as 'boss by numbers' as you'd expect. One is weak to magic. One is weak to fire. One is weak to melee. One is half the wall you have to break bits of and so on. You've killed all these ten times before in every other game.\nOh and don't forget the obligatory mini boss rush at the end of the game. None of them are standout though. After you've killed them all you won't remember them.\n\nRPG skills/experience/talents? +1 to X skill gives more attack and so on. Standard stuff, max level 20 and 1 talent point per level and 3 different trees that are unlocked as you move through them at levels 5/10/15. Standard fare and apart from the guardian tree, they don't alter your character play through that much. It's nice and simple which means it's easy to get into and you can even redistribute at an NPC later in the game. I would have preferred that each tree was far more weird and wonderful towards the bottom rather a mundane 'some extra HP' or 'more magic damage'.\n\n\nOverall I enjoyed it - a second play through or a third? I don't think so. Not in it's current state anyway.\nEven with the unlocks for a second play through or even a different character or two, the frustrations of backtracking/collision and juggling really takes the shine of what could have been the makings of a classic.\n\nIt's clear the developers are going for a multi game story here so here's to hoping the 2nd builds on this.\nOverall B-","February 4, 2014","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't entirely finished, but has a decent amount of replay value and was definitely worth the couple of playthroughs I've given it so far. It's a little on the easy side, but that seems typical of the genre. Last I checked there are two additional playable characters on the way, and I'll probably be playing through one more time with Reina, before they are released.\n\nThe combat system takes a little getting used to, and with a little attention can be used to create ridiculous combos and damage. That was actually one of my bigger problems, as most of the normal enemies died entirely too quickly to get a feel for the combat system. A few bosses in however, I'd figured out how to outmanuever enemies, essentially utilizing combat based-sequence breaking.\n\nI spent a little bit of time backtracking, and the map isn't exactly enormous, but if you're any good at this sort of game you'll find it a cakewalk. And I have yet to try the game on any of the higher difficulties, so I figure my perception that the game is easy may be challenged later on.\n\nOverall it's fun game with nice music, solid mechanics and decent replay value, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in 2D platforming or dungeon crawling.","January 2, 2014","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Usually I'll go 15 minutes or an hour.  This game is just that good that I can't stop playing.  Any metroidvania fan MUST get this title.","January 2, 2014","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will spend some time exporing.\n\nControls - The controls are a bit hard to master. I use a keyboard, and I imagine it would be slightly easier to use a joystick. It takes a bit of getting used to.\n\nNew armours - To receive new armour, you have to perform jumping challenges, where you must execute a series of jumps in perfect succession. Some of them are relatively simple, while others can be more than 10 jumps. This can get frustrating at times, but collecting all the armours is not required to complete the game.\n\nAs you defeat bosses, you will unlock new abilities to access new areas. Certain new abilities will make these jumping challenges easier. You can also return to old areas to completely loot it with new spells.","January 2, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes there are sections arbitrarily locked off, but that always happens in these kinds of games.\n- Level up/skill system allows for a vast variety of playstyles, whether you like magic, tons of HP, glass cannon crits, you can do all of that!\n- Most boss fights/random fights are very fun!  Also the characters are all very unique.\n\nCons:\n- Seems unfinished somehow.  It is a very short game (BUT you can do multiple playthroughs with different builds, and there is a "high score" mode)\n- Difficultly is somewhat random, you'll have easy boss easy boss IMPOSSIBLE BOSS easy boss.  The challange is nice, however.\n- The item upgrade/store system is ridiculously confusing, and needlessly so.  However, you can beat the game even if you don't bother with it.\n\nOverall if you like metroidvania style games you will probably like this.","January 8, 2014","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I backed it on Kickstarter and I'm glad I did. Some of the timed platforming puzzles/challenges can be grueling and leave absolutely no room for error but the most difficult ones are optional--the game never forces you into a timed puzzle you can't reasonably get out of with a couple of tries. Having said that, the rest of the game is great! The level design and story are fantastic, the character designs and animations are excellent, but the best, and maybe most surprising component of this game is Zack Parrish's soundtrack.
