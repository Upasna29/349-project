TheHunter is one of those games. What can you do for free, you ask? Well, you can hunt Mule Deer. That's it. That's all you can do. Shoot Mule Deer with one gun, one type of ammo. The default stuff you start with is all you get. It says you can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits, ah but the catch is you need to buy the correct gun to use in order to be allowed to hunt it. So, Rabbits aren't even free either.\n\nCan you earn enough to eventually buy another gun? Only one other gun is available for purchase using the game's earned currency (called gm$). Every other gun must be bought using real world money (called em$). And that's not all.\n\nWant the privilege to be able to hunt something else? You need to buy licenses. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they come in 1 day, 7 day, and 28 day variants. Yup, that's right. They expire. So you have to buy them multiple times to continue hunting what you want. Buy a 1 day license but then get called in to work? Congrats! You've just wasted your money! You CAN buy these with gm$, but the costs are so high that you'll be farming Mule Deer for weeks in order to finally be able to experience something else.\n\nOh but hold on. It's not like each kill you make earns you gm$. Hah! You wish! Nope. The only way to earn gm$ is to complete "missions" which range from tracking certain animals, spotting certain animals, and harvesting certain animals, among other similar tasks. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they typically reward only 100 gm$ for each mission, and your shotgun costs 6300 gm$, a typical 1 day license costs anywhere between 1800 - 2400 gm$. For ONE DAY, for ONE SPECIE. Let that sink in.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Based on its business model at the time of writing? NO WAY. Stay FAR away from this cash-grab game, unless you enjoy having them grab at your pockets the moment you try their game.\n\nAlso, NEVER EVER EVER DO ANY OF THE 3RD PARTY STUFF THEY ASK YOU TO DO. You can do things like surveys, downloads, watch videos, etc. to earn some em$ (that's right, paid currency). But most of these third party "offers" infect your computer with all sorts of malware, and most of them don't end up forking over the em$ at the end. You'll be turned away from most surveys because you "aren't the target consumer". For instance, when I answered that I was a white male on a survey, I was immediately declined and turned away, reward not given.\n\nIf the payment model is improved? I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. It's fun to play, all the shady practices considered. I just wish they had gone about their payment model better than this garbage. Oh well, someone else will come along and do it right eventually.","October 21, 2014","false","74.7"," 3,265 of 3,513 people (93%) found this review helpful 229 people found this review funny","93","265","3","229","78"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/barbarenbaer/recommended/253710/","barbarenbaer","Barbarenbaer goes ballistic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/barbarenbaer/","673 products in account","Hello everybody,\n\nI play this game since nearly the beginning, have seen the initial developer go bankrupt and the new developer take over. I have seen month with nothing happening in terms of developments and I have seen the last few month after multiplayer was released with new stuff released every few weeks.\n\nIf you love hunting simulations, theHunter for sure is the game you want. It's way more realistic then Cabela's games, it has pretty nice graphics and huge different hunting locations with many, many animals to hunt. Every species feels special and there has not been a really good hunting simulation since Deer Hunter 2005.\n\n- Pricing -\nThe downside: You need to invest a whole lot of money. To really enjoy the game you need a membership for about 5$ a month. No membership and you can only hunt very few species, need to buy ammo for all but the default rifle and can't create multiplayer games. Sure you can stick with some basic guns, but to take part in competitions and finish missions you need a whole lot of different guns. Each between 3 and 5$. Not to forget, there are tree stands, ground blinds and tents you would like to use sooner or later because there are very few fixed hunting towers on the maps and... yes, each of these items is another 4,50$ from your wallet.\n\nJust a few numbers for you:\nAll weapons with scopes (not caluclation different skins or "premium" skins)\nmore then 150$\n\nAll callers (no decoys, no consumables like scents):\nabout 20$\n\nDecoys for one full area for each species:\nabout 30$\n\nClothing depends on what you want, so I don't add a number to this, but each clothing set is about 5$... and you guess it: Some work better in different areas or against different species.\n\nStands and tents... lets say two of each for each reserve, you place them permanently, you don't want to pick them up after each hunt, so you can't really use the same two everywhere.\nmore then 200$\n\nSure, you are free to choose if you want this items, but to get everything out of the game you want this stuff. And more, every few weeks there is a new weapon, new cool cloth and your membership runs out every now and then.\n\n- Earn ingame money -\nThere are ways to earn ingame money: Win competitions, but without spending money you can only take part in very few competitions and so the chance is low (and the prize money gets you nowhere). The developers also have partnered with third-party pages who offer you some money for playing other online games, taking part in surveys or downloading and using different applications. The results are spam on your email address, malware and a lot of these offers simply don't reward you.\n\nThere is a different ingame currency you earn completing missions, but you can only use this "money" on consumables and you need a good bunch of weapons to finish most missions, so again: No way without spending money. There is no way to grind the gear inside the game.\n\nWithout spending money you stick with the .243 for the free Mule Deer and you can unlock the Single Shot Shotgun to hunt Cottontail Rabbits, but you need to buy the ammo for it. That works with earned money for some time, but sooner or later you will run out of missions to do without buying weapons or a membership for real money.\n\n- Bugs -\nThe game is full of bugs. I personally can't say there are gamebreakers, but animals getting stuck in trees, climbing trees, nearly all weapons stuck into your arm and broken reloading animations and other smaller and bigger bugs are around since a long time and often they return after a few patches. Gamebreaking bugs get fixed pretty fast but smaller bugs are often not relevant enough (and the fixes can't be sold like new weapons or cloth) so we will for sure see this bugs for some more time.\n\n- Community -\nJust have to add it now, after multiple insults from fanboys. This game has a small die hard community that are happy to have this game, due it's the only one of it's kind. This makes them accept and defend every action the developers take. Since this review I often got friend requests from some of these guys that have nothing better to do then to tell me I'm a hypocrit to play this game a lot and not remommending it in my review. That's what you get from the community if you are not a 100% fan and don't think it's okay to pay a small fortune for this game.\n\n- Conclusion -\nAs said, I'm into this game since years, I love it and I will keep playing it, but since about a year this game is all about money and everything ingame is pretty expensive.\nLike with this the pre-release review postet on Steam, my personal experience showed me, that the developers break promises and contracts, lie in some cases, solve things always to their best and only communicate public what makes them look good.\n\n- Tipp for beginners -\nIf you enjoyed the small free part, go to {LINK REMOVED}bit.ly/1oEMUr0 or google for "theHunter 2014 box" and purchase a key from the boxed edition of the game. For about 17 € you get 6 month membership (hunt all species, get free ammo for all guns) some starter weapons that allow you to hunt all species ethically and some additional gear. It's the best deal you can currently get as a beginner. This box is also available at Amazon and some other retailers if you want the box itself.\n\n- Update after some actions taken -\nToday the developers release a new .22 handgun and to make the game more realistic, changed the existing and wide spread .357 handgun and made it unethical for some species. What might be realistic is clearly forcing players to buy the new gun for about 4$.\n\nChanging already sold virtual items might be common but this change make this weapon pretty useless. Why? Because a lot of players have it. It's not a good weapon against larger animals and was pretty often used against birds, now the only animals it's good for are fox and coyote.\n\nThe new reserve released some time ago included the new "feature" of climbing walls... what simply is a bad mini game and asks you to buy a new consumable: Climbing gear. Some would argue that it's purchaseable with gm$ and you can take 75% back if you remove it, but it's again something that will eat up the earned gm$ from free players and make this game harder to play for free (besides, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic that has nothing to do with hunting).","June 2, 2014","false","200.2"," 3,203 of 3,608 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","203","3","0","138"

Compare the amount of free content to the amount of content you have to pay for. It's unacceptable to make me pay money to access that much content in a free to play game.\n\nIt costs nothing to download, but I feel entitled to a refund.\n\nFirst of all, there was no tutorial for this. I was just thrown in, and expected to know how to hunt. I wandered aimlessly for a while, until I found some tracks. I followed them, and found some more tracks and some scat. There was so much scat, that I began to wonder if this animal was sick. I followed the trail for about one in game hour unril I saw it: a whitetail deer. Living in an area with a lot of rednecks, I was excited. Apparently deer are something you should want to hunt. I readied my rifle, and clicked the fire button. Nothing. Was the left mouse button not the fire button? The right mouse button readied the gun, so I figured the left would fire. Then a message popped up: "You don't have the required license to hunt whitetail deer". What? I just spent almost forty real minutes tracking this thing down, only to not be allowed to shoot it. This is a video game! I shouldn't need to buy licenses to hunt animals! And, since this was my first time playing, wouldn't it be nice to give me some licenses for free, so I can get a feel for the game before investing money in it (it's free to play, so I shouldn't have to pay to play it)! I quit the game, went to the store, and looked up how much licenses cost, only to see something that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. The licenses are temporary! Are you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me!?\n\nIf you don't buy the licenses, this is just "Hiking Simulator". I live in an area full of hiking trails. I can literally drive five minutes, and find a hiking trail. I do not have a gun, hunting equipment, or hunting licenses. I played this so I could hunt. After playing this, I might as well just get all of those things, because it would be something I could make memories out of, actually go outside, and do with my friends.\n\nValve, I am begging you, set standards for what can and cannot be free to play. I am asking that either this game be removed from Steam, or you make the developers add free content. I am not going to pay to play a game that is listed as "free to play". I will pay for extras, but only if the game is good.\n\nEDIT: Okay, so apparently I didn't notice that there is a tutorial. You people can stop commenting on it.\n\nSome people are saying "well, it's a simulator". Simulators don't have to be one hundred percent realistic. The buying lisences part did not have to be in it, and made the "realism" (it's just a excuse to have microtransactions) too much.","October 26, 2014","false","0.6"," 2,528 of 2,874 people (88%) found this review helpful 224 people found this review funny","88","528","2","224","52"

I just got in to the game, to see if anything changed, but nope.

Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).\n\n2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.\n\n3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.\n\n4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.\n\n5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.\n\n6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired.","June 21, 2015","false","2.2"," 3,486 of 4,369 people (80%) found this review helpful 3,931 people found this review funny","80","486","4","931","115"

It comes with a decent selection of weapons - all you have to do is buy some ingame cash with your actual cash. Is a bear threatening your backside? No problem - just buy the bear hunting licence for a few dollars and he'll be toast. Wanna play with friends? That's great - slap some more dollars their way and you're good. As a free-to-play character you get one rifle and you get to hunt a whole two animal types.\n\nThe visuals are fantastic for the year 2004 - I especially enjoyed having the animal I was watching at one point twist its head around and give me the bedroom eyes from behind before it vanished into the ether. Then my buddy sank into the river, where his eyes separated from the rest of his head.\n\nThe F2P experience is, in short, a complete waste of time.","September 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 341 of 408 people (84%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","84","341","408","62","4"

Solution: pay for hunter licenses.\nYou can only shoot deer, fox and coyote with the free gun. Solution: pay for more guns.\nYou want to play with friends in multiplayer. Solution: pay a sub so that your computer and your internet can be used to setup a server.\nYou don't get the carry capacity to do even semi-long hunts. Solution: pay for extra carry capacity.\nYou payed for extra carry capacity but you still don't have the carry capacity to do awesome long hunts whole day long. Solution: NONE!!!\nYou can travel free on maps from lodges but on all maps this is very time consuming with how they were layed out by the developers. Solution: pay for tents and camping equipment.\nYou don't get free ammo for 32 of 33 weapons in the game. Solution: keep paying money for new ammo (hardcore simulator?) or buy a membership.\nYou don't like your clothes or the fact animals can see you from miles away because there is no telling which bush actually gives you cover or not. Solution: Pay for clothing items.\nYou're tired of stalking animals for hours before you get a shot at them. Solution: Pay for callers, decoys, ground stands, tree stands, tripods, scent lures, feeders, bait.\n\nI'm surprised the developers don't ask money for every footstep you take into the game.\nIf you buy the $15 starter pack, you will be missing tons of guns and all other equipment that are simply needed to enjoy the game. But even if you spend $50 on the biggest starter pack, you still miss many equipment to hunt half the animals in the game and the weapon selection in the biggest package is rather sad (I wouldn't dare to say it was done deliberately to lure you into buying the more fun/better weapons later seperately wasting all the money you gave in the first place on guns that will be gathering dust).\n\n\nThis is the best executed hunter game ever if money grows on your back. We're talking at least €200 here to start enjoying most of the full game. If you really want to hunt in luxury (it's a game, who wouldn't want to?) you'll start looking at a lot more money than that.\nThe game is easily 8/10. The amount of money you have to throw at the game to actually get to that 8/10 makes it a 1/10 at best.\n\nMy library hopefully shows I'm not one to be afraid to spend money on games. But these guys brought it to a level that I have never seen before. Congratulations on surpassing Korean MMO's EW.\n\n\n\nAddendum: subscription\n\nAnd what are people paying subscription for?\nRetextured or new weapons? Because you have to pay to get those.\nNew animals? Because you have to buy licenses to hunt those.\nNew equipment for the new animals? Nope not that either because you have to pay for all the new callers and feeders and stands.\nMultiplayer? Well they did add MP afterwards but it can't be it since an MP game is hosted on our computer with our internet connection. And they didn't spend any effort on making a standalone server or adding any useful filters in the client browser to warrent anything special. That is if you are lucky enough the client browser is working without big lag and there are none of the many connection and disconnection issues.\nNew clothing? Again these cost money.\nNew maps? Well it must be maps then since there isn't anything else. So we're paying €35/year for the 4maps? they added in the last 5years. Those are some damn expensive maps!\n\nWe're not paying for continued development of the engine either.\n- View distance of 210m for weapons that can make accurate shots of 500m.\n- Trees that are literally square with highest ingame settings and the leafs are just flat green 'sheets'.\n- Game settings can only be adjusted outside of the game.\n- A fox and pheasant can just walk next to eachother because it's a fairytale land where all animals are big friends.\n- Mouse often feels laggy/jaggy however you want to call it. Many people have these small FPS drop problems and support just ignores it all.\n- The surface has the most annoying edges which makes it very awkward to crawl up to an animal and finding an angle where your gun gets enough depression.\n- Floating rocks, plants and trees everywhere you look on the map.\nI can go on further with a list of technical stupidities that were allready old tech 5years ago.","June 11, 2014","false","211.0"," 240 of 278 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","240","278","0","11"

This was the first time I played a hunting game and I really expected nothing from it.\nBut I was surprised how how good the game was from its technical view. It's not the best looking game but the flora and fauna really got some love and detail, the sound is awesome and the lighting and sun effects are also really nice.\nReally felt like being in the woods.\nNow here's the negative trait. This game's free2play model is nowhere near anything you might consider as free to play and fair. Everything costs a lot of money and either you join the membership or you have a walking simulator (you're only allowed to hunt rabbits and mule deers).\nIt's more like a demo when you don't plan to invest money. The game even calls you a guest.  And oh boy, the pricing is insane.\nProbably a good hunting game, but I can't recommend it. It's a shame cause it was really an atmospheric experience for me.\nThat said I think if you are a really passionate hunter in real life you would probably gladly spend money on this one and you would probably go nuts about all people who complain abouth the subscription model.","June 2, 2014","false","2.9"," 824 of 1,044 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","824","1","0","1"

But then I went to the store to check out the guns and stuff I could buy.  Well EVERY SINGLE GUN costs EM which is bought with REAL dollars.  There is no way at all for you to buy these guns unless you open your wallet.  Basic guns cost 5 dollars each and better ones well over 10.\n\nI don't mind the freemium models and actually spend a lot of cash on them lol.

You could spend 100's on 100's of dollars and still not have unlocked all the content (and its not because there is a ton of content..).  Plus no matter how much you play you will not be able to unlock it without using a ton of REAL money.\n\nThis game should be removed from Free to play because all it does is give you a VERY limited demo (I didn't have a license to shoot the anmal I found in the starter area) and then want money to do anything.\n\nDev's like these should be BANNED from steam.\n\n","August 20, 2015","false","9.3"," 157 of 179 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","157","179","15","2"

However the 'Free-To-Play' label is misleading. After downloading the 2GB game I looked forward to shoot some helpless animals but, as soon-as I loading in the open world I had no idea what to do or get started. No controls or help menu was available in-game, so I had to resort to an online video on the internet.\n\nAfter getting used to the main controls I ventured out to hunt… I found a trail of a Blacktail deer and ID’d it with my gadget. A pop-up appeared saying I need a licence or a membership to hunt this animal. I then looked up to see what I could kill. Apparently there are only 2 animals you can hunt and 1 weapon you can use in this F2P game.\n\nI now know this Free-to-play is actuallya Fee To Play and Pay-To-Win game, with micro transactions, donations and memberships everywhere.\n\nSorry, but I looked forward to play this game and not Pay-To-Win… It has really good graphics quality though.\n\nRating: 2/10","October 26, 2014","false","0.3"," 314 of 391 people (80%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","80","314","391","15","10"

As a limited member you can do the following:\n\nYou can enter all the reserves and wander around.\nYou receive one basic rifle, a scope and unlimited ammunition refills for that rifle. You will also receive a deer caller.\nYou can only hunt Cottontail rabbits and Mule Deers.\nHunting all other animals is prohibited!!. You can see them, but shooting them is not possible.\nTo shoot them you need to buy a license with real money\nUnlike other free to play games you can make points to unlock new content like weapons and other stuff.

I'm going to write a review.. This is my first review and probably my last because if I write a review, trust me I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as hell! And hell, am I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of now!\n\nAs you can see I played 700+ hours in this game and long story short, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. Believe me the game is worth paying money for, it’s WORTH IT’S MONTHLY prescription and please if you are here to play the game for free just turn around the way you came, this is not for you. It is only free to play as a DEMO, you get extremely limited options and playability. If you want to put money in this game it is definitely worth it IF NOT FOR;\n\n1)	The lack of multiplayer compatibility; (300 servers and only 5 you can connect to due to “could not connect to host”, “host has quit the game”(server still in server list 30 mins after the host quit the game already),  “lost connection to host”, server of my buddy up and running (TeamSpeak confirmed) and not in server list for about 45 mins, “error 16005” “I GOT IT”, “error 404 developer’s f*cks not found”\n2)	Abundant bugs (which NEVER EVER GET FIXED) and I’m not talking about the bugs previously discussed as connection bugs, I’m talking about bugs of getting stuck in scenery, floating ducks that stay stuck in the air (due to connection error again though), animals stuck behind trees and rocks, animals that have died on player side but not harvestable because of server misalignment,…,.., and the list keeps going and going\n3)	The developers don’t give a f*ck *(this is the most important part for my experience); They keep hiring new people with great new ideas about a new species like the “polar bear” (which you’re not allowed to f*cking shoot!, PUT YOUR DEVELOPING TIME IN SOMETHING USEFULL YOU IDIOT DEVELOPERS), persistent problems with connections which have been an issue and have been addressed numerous times by the community but have been left aside because getting new weapons and new animals is more profitable, priority is giving above all to getting a new skin on a new weapon which costs you another 5$ because the colour has changed on the weapon or because the colour of the animals has changed.\n4)	The game is not even near a complete stage, with its developers building on a broken game and making it more unplayable than it already is. They keep adding sh*t without fixing previous errors and by doing so they make the implementation of anything REALY worth it get drowned by the everlasting errors and bugs that follow it. The implementation of something good is followed by weeks, if not months, of issues resolving from this add-on and by getting the public back to the game the implement something new, which starts the hole sh*t train from the beginning.\n\nIf you have not already turned around and decided not to look at this game, I tell you again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR PUT MONEY IN TO IT IN IT’S CURRENT STATE. I don’t think this current state is going to change to anything good in the foreseeable future as the developers just don’t give a f*ck or are trying but are so inexperienced that my 6yo niece can make a better running game. This game has potential but it should have been a Steam GreenLight game and not a finished one and the enormous ego that makes the developers not think about gameplay but all about money made me vote this game as DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n\nI hope to god that the developers are reading my review and start working on the issues that need to be fixed to make this game worth it. If they are not, be wary of my next review, as I will be even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off as I keep playing this game in the hope it becomes something it should be.\n\n(PS: this review was 16 pages long but I removed a lot of the swearing, reducing it to 2. If you read this all please rate funny or helpful in the hope it reaches the developers of Expensive Worlds)\n","April 19","false","785.3"," 148 of 172 people (86%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","86","148","172","72","4"

However this is more or less a downright lie. TheHunter is a game that is designed to make the free to play version of theHunter be extremely linear and boring but show enough promise into what the game  could be  if you payed for the membership. These micro transactions are thrown upon you at almost every second of this game. Want to play with a friend? Nope you have to pay! Want to use a bunch of cool weapons? Nope you have to pay! Can I at least hunt and kill alot of animail's? Nope! Without membership you can only kill and select amount of animals.\n\nEven if the shady transactions and free to play model were not present it doesnt get rid of the fact that theHunter never stops being a boring and extremely glitchy game. Actully shooting an animal is near impossible due to the very laggy movement. I found myself having a hell of a lot more fun using the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brick breaker app on the hunters phone in game than actully hunting, which is never a good sign. Hunting games can be fun and interesting but theHunter with lack of a better work screwed everything up and created a pile of ♥♥♥♥ which is a disgrace to good games trying to get on steam these days.\n\n-AUS ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","January 28, 2015","false","0.3"," 182 of 221 people (82%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","82","182","221","35","0"

Emotions overfilled me so i decided to share my thoughts about this game//\nFirstly it seems to be pretty nice game. I watched trailers and saw a man hunting with a bow!!! Its actually my dream !\nSo..\nI launched the game and some kind of menu in browser style opens.. WTF? I was scared :p But then i got used to it its actually pretty convinient thing.\nThen i pressed *HUNT* and spawned in some kind of camp. Graphics in this game are nice. The movement is awful because when i pressed *c* button to sprint it was a ♥♥♥♥ing walking speed  -_- But its okay too. Then i saw my first animal! It was a deer i guess..) I wanted to shoot it but didn`t want to miss so tried to get closer and spooked it away. I was a bit sad about this but i had even more enthusiasm.. Right after that i saw a rabbit and shoot it. IT WAS AWESOME!!! But i didn`t know what to do with the body. Like how to kinda claim it.. And so i went on.I found deer traces and tracked it down my GPS. After 30 minutes of walking ( actually it was nice cause the world detalised beautifully) i found My dear deer drinking water from the river. That time i was really carefull and started crouching from 2 km long)) And i crouched for my ♥♥♥♥in entire life but it was nothing because i enjoyed it. BUUUUT when I finally got to the      *sniper point*  and aimed at deer head IT SHOWED THAT I CAN`T ♥♥♥♥IN HUNT CAUSE I DONT HAVE THE ♥♥♥♥IN LICENSE!!! I LOOKED WHERE CAN I GET LICENSE AND SAW THAT IT WAS ♥♥♥♥IN 100000$$$$\nThis how my story ends. ♥♥♥♥ this game. It`s better be paid then be free but BASED ON THE ♥♥♥♥IN DONATE!!\nSo decide. All things considered this game is really nice in gameplay way but ♥♥♥♥ the system of donation in this game.\n\nYou can play this game with satisfaction only if you`ll buy this crappy license. I SAY NO!\nHOPE I HELPED YOU GUYS :P\nSorry for a mistake!!! There actually is few hunting available animals like deer and maybe others i dunno... But anyway. I don`t like this certificate paid system.

If you just jump in you only get to hunt 2 animals, from what I have seen there is no tutorial to help new players out. Animals very rarely spawn in the time I have played 2 animals spawned and I coulnd't hunt eitehr of them because I'm not going to pay like $10 for 3 months to hunt animals.... The map is very bad it doesnt even tell you what the places are, most of the time I played it I was trying to figure out what the "!" sign on the map was :/ I do not recomend this game to ANYONE even if you love hunting games it would cost less just to buy like a $20 hunting game and hunt ALL animals instead of paying $10 for 3 months of hunting all the animals.

I have never really been interested in hunting, but  I was pleasantly surprised with how fun and relaxing it was for the first few hours. After I finally hunted down my first deer and killed it, I was really excited to go back to the store and see would I could purchase with the money I recieved from my hunt. It was then that I realized this is absolutely not a "free to play" game.\n\nI understand that the developer has to make money, and I have no problem with them making the free to play members work hard for what they get, but it is literally impossible for free to play players to progress. The only thing you can really afford without paying is ammo, and it still takes a while to get the money for it. You don't even get money for harvesting your prey. You have to complete missions (which by the way, most require items that you have to buy in order to complete) to get the in game currency and the prices for the items that you are allowed to purchase with in game currency are astronomical. All of the weapons have to be purchased with real money. All outfits must be purchased with real money. The licenses' are available through in game currency, but it will take you a year of playing to get a 7 day license for one animal. The worst part is that the items in this game aren't even cheap. Almost everything is $3.00 and up, and that money will add up considering you have to buy basically each individual item (with the exception of some bundle packs).\n\nMost free to play games offer premium and free to play. Usually, premium makes it a little easier to progress and adds more content to premium members. Not in this game. "Free to play" in this game is literally just a demo. You have to pay to play if you want to do anything other than hunt mule deer, keep the same weapon, stay on the same hunting ground, make your own game, and constantly get kicked from games after doing nothing wrong. So basically.. you have to pay if you want to do anything fun, and that's why I got this game to start. I would not recommend getting this game unless you plan on spending loads of money.\n\nI also want to add a note to the developers. People will still spend money on this game if you make it more friendly towards free to play players. You are severely limiting the crowd of people playing your game by making it "pay to play". I know a bunch of people that have never had the slightest interest in hunting that would love to play this game. If you open up the game more, more people will come, and more people will be willing to support you and pay money. However, as of right now, I would not support this game because you have mislead me and many others that downloaded this game believing it was "free to play".\n\nMy review will change if the developers ever decide to remove the extreme restraints that they have placed on the players. If nothing changes, they need to list this as "demo" and put a price tag on the actual game, because the store page is very misleading.","June 21, 2014","false","7.1"," 94 of 113 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","94","113","0","0"

(read below)\n1. This is a free to play game. It costs absolutely nothing to play this game.\n2. You are given a .243 riffle, and a single shot 12 guage shotgun, both with unlimited ammo.\n3. You can go into any map of the game. An immersive and realistic environment that sits on my top 3 most realistic of all time, in any game i have ever played. 2x Geforce GTX 970. At full detail levels. On the other hand player avatars can use a realism update, but the animals definately do not, and as this is a human vs animal game that is what counts.\n4. You can hunt Whitetail deer, pheasant, and 3 varieties of rabbit. (to start; fact is it cost nothing to hunt the other animals)\n5. The ballistics and damage models are by far the most accurate in any hunting game to date. Source: My opinion; I have hunted just about everything legal on the north american continent in the last 35 years, Including 6 Alaska hunts. and i have played Cabela's [titles here] hunting games as well.\n5. You can take part in in-game missions (quests) that reward you with in game currency (gms) To purchase perishable supplies like scents and baits, as well as licenses and ammo. (pssst this is the how-to)\n\nBiggest problem with the game is:\n1. Most people dont know what the hell they are doing they are running around like they are playing Battlefield 3 or Gears of war....this is the playstyle that they are failing at with this game. While you don't have to be a ninja to aquire a target in this game, you will need some patience and a little stealth to get anything in the trophy range (hello...real animals spook as do these, if they hear or smell you, you probably wont see them)\n2. You arent getting any full auto weapon in this game. Every shot (except those made at the range) are tallied to your permanent record. The only semi-autos in game are a few select shotguns.\n3. No grenades, sachel charges, land mines or tow missles, sorry.\n4. People think programers work for free. They don't and this game wouldn't exist if players didn't take "shortcuts" and buy weaposn, gear and licenses and instead used the gm method of hunting to get the very same things.\n\n\nBottom line: This game is free to play and you can hunt everything in the game without ever spending a dime of real currency. If you cannot do that, you are doing something entirely wrong and likely not in the scope of the game i.e. hunting and harvesting game.\n\nIf anyone really needs any more clarification on the how to hunt all animals in this game as a guest, send me a message and i'll try and simplify it further for you.","April 30","true","461.9"," 90 of 118 people (76%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","76","90","118","12","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skucho/recommended/253710/","Skucho","Skucho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skucho/","260 products in account","theHunter Review\nA disgustingly bad business model on an otherwise fantastic game..\n\nIt's such a shame when you come across a fantastic game that's ruined by one of the worst payment models in any game you've ever seen. TheHunter is one of those games. What can you do for free, you ask? Well, you can hunt Mule Deer. That's it. That's all you can do. Shoot Mule Deer with one gun, one type of ammo. The default stuff you start with is all you get. It says you can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits, ah but the catch is you need to buy the correct gun to use in order to be allowed to hunt it. So, Rabbits aren't even free either.\n\nCan you earn enough to eventually buy another gun? Only one other gun is available for purchase using the game's earned currency (called gm$). Every other gun must be bought using real world money (called em$). And that's not all.\n\nWant the privilege to be able to hunt something else? You need to buy licenses. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they come in 1 day, 7 day, and 28 day variants. Yup, that's right. They expire. So you have to buy them multiple times to continue hunting what you want. Buy a 1 day license but then get called in to work? Congrats! You've just wasted your money! You CAN buy these with gm$, but the costs are so high that you'll be farming Mule Deer for weeks in order to finally be able to experience something else.\n\nOh but hold on. It's not like each kill you make earns you gm$. Hah! You wish! Nope. The only way to earn gm$ is to complete "missions" which range from tracking certain animals, spotting certain animals, and harvesting certain animals, among other similar tasks. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they typically reward only 100 gm$ for each mission, and your shotgun costs 6300 gm$, a typical 1 day license costs anywhere between 1800 - 2400 gm$. For ONE DAY, for ONE SPECIE. Let that sink in.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Based on its business model at the time of writing? NO WAY. Stay FAR away from this cash-grab game, unless you enjoy having them grab at your pockets the moment you try their game.\n\nAlso, NEVER EVER EVER DO ANY OF THE 3RD PARTY STUFF THEY ASK YOU TO DO. You can do things like surveys, downloads, watch videos, etc. to earn some em$ (that's right, paid currency). But most of these third party "offers" infect your computer with all sorts of malware, and most of them don't end up forking over the em$ at the end. You'll be turned away from most surveys because you "aren't the target consumer". For instance, when I answered that I was a white male on a survey, I was immediately declined and turned away, reward not given.\n\nIf the payment model is improved? I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. It's fun to play, all the shady practices considered. I just wish they had gone about their payment model better than this garbage. Oh well, someone else will come along and do it right eventually.\n\nSkucho :D","February 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","45","48","7","0"

Going out in the wild with your friends and tracking down all kinds of game in the forest. The game is very beautiful and nice. I was astonished by the level of complexity and detail put into this game and still maintaining nice visuals and aesthetic. That is until you want to progress past shooting Mule deers in the beginner area. To get anywhere in the game you have to pay out of your pockets, they claim to have a method where you just do some surveys and get in-game currency. This sneaky survey system is not something you want to touch with a 10-feet pole. Remember those adds on shady websites? Win an iPad? Lusty girls in your neighbourhood? Yes, long lists of these adds, that they want you to click and register on. If you for some reason would do that, there is a 33% chance that you MIGHT get a little bit of in-game currency. For some reason they decided to put in two different currencies, currency you can get for doing ridiculously hard tasks and the one i explained above (real money). This other currency, gm$ is utterly USELESS, there is about 10.000 available for each player, and you can use them for two things: Ammo, for guns that you don't own, for game that you can't kill and for licences (1 Licence for 30 days is about 8500, nearly all of the available gm$). Now you might think that buying a bit of ingame currency can't be that bad. Yes, yes it can. First you will need a membership, the smallest one is 15 euros which allows you to kill all animals. Then you need a gun, add atleast another 5 euros depending on the gun. Then you will need calls for the animals you want to hunt. Add another 5 euros, and here we are, for 25$ you can play the game to some extend for 30 days. TheHunter is such a great game to play with your friends, but to get anything above what a demo would deliver you would have to empty your pockets into an endless hole. Please, if you would make a one time purchase option I and others would gladly pay up. If you dont want that you can go with the TF2 system, pay for an item above 5 euros and get acces to the full game, and then you can buy more things if you want to speed things up. Atleast make it possible to progress without paying. If you did this or the one time purchase i would play and support this title again, but with the current system and business practises i cannot support the game, it's disgusting.","June 4, 2014","false","19.1"," 125 of 176 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","125","176","0","1"

It has some major flaws though.\n\nFirst I'd like to state that I never bought the game, but played it as a free to play.\n\nFirst thing is the wind, the wind always blows from the south-west, making it quite boring and inefficient starting from any souther point on a map in my opinion. While a small problem, it is still an issue making the game dull at that part. A wind change every X hour or having it randomly set to one thing at the start of a map would be better.\n\nThe biggest issue is the microtransaction part. As a free to play game you can only hunt mule deer and cottontail rabbits. You get all the equipment for the mule deers straight away, but in order to get the weapon required for cottontail rabbit, you have to go through microtransactions or watch ads/register on sketchy sites to obtain in game currency. There is a currency in the game that you can earn by doing missions, like shooting and confirming the kill of an animal or tracking and spotting a certain animal. But this currency cannot be used for buying weapons, only ammunition and other items such as scent removers etc.\n\nPaying the subscription allows you to hunt every single animal, and some packs give you weapons and sights to get started. But none offer said air rifle for use on rabbits, mallards or pheasants. I find this a huge problem as I wanted to shoot rabbits.\n\nThe game could go very far if it had better ways of obtaining things. The ads for currency should be removed, everything should be purchasable with the free to play currency and it should be possible to obtain it from successfully shooting and killing animals that give points (mostly male animals)","December 28, 2014","false","11.7"," 62 of 77 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","62","77","5","0"

Hunting sims, not games..\n\nSo this is not an arcade hunting game whatsoever. You will spend a lot of time running around tracking or even trying to find anything moving at all. The graphics are actually pretty nice looking, and the game runs very smoothly.\n\nThe main problem with this game is that it is listed as Free to Play. It should really say Demo with paid content. or Pay to Play.\n\nYou start out being able to only shoot mule deer. Doing this will earn you points (that don't actually do anything, it seems). There are quite a few animal types in the game, but if you want to go after anything other than mule deers, (oh yeah, rabbits too) than you have to get a license to hunt them. How do you get a license? Well, by spending in game money. How do you get in game money you ask? Well, you can do missions... 3 of them. Once these 3 missions are done you will get a small portion of in-game money, however, not enough to actually buy anything. These are not daily missions either. They don't reset ever, once they are done they are done. The only way to unlock more missions is to buy a license to hunt a new animal.. So how else can you get in-game money then? Well, the only way is to buy it with real money. This is not free to play... this is actually more expensive a game than most AAA big name games.\n\nIf you want to play the full game expect to pay a ton of cash, and then, only for whatever time limit you have bought for your licenses, then you have to rebuy them again. Lol\n\nTerrible terrbible terrible pay model. One of the worst I have ever seen. I'm not saying it should be totally free, but this is absolutely just not the way to do it.\n\nI don't recommend this game at all.","September 25, 2014","false","9.9"," 57 of 72 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","57","72","0","1"

Spend hours hunting down animals alone or with your friends. Hunt down deer, bears, ducks, pheasants, rabbits, boars, ect. The amount of hours that any player could have put in to this game would have been amazing.\n\nSounds like a good game right, well if its a good game why am i not recommending it, well here is the reason why. The store page is lieing, to you there is nothing in this game that makes it free-2-play. The 4 hours i spent playing this game i was so confused on why i couldn't shoot a boar THAT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. Turns out you need a liecense for almost every animal. You can only kill 2 animals if you are a free-2-play player, which is mule deer and rabbits (which in my opinion the hardest animals to find). I spent 2 hours looking for mule deers, I looked up guides, I tried different approaches, and still couldn't even see one. i was following a mule deer's tracks for a full hour and everytime i would get close it would run away (now keep in mind I was crouching the entire time and I didnt even get to see the damn thing). Also, while I was looking for the mule deer i found a whitetail deer, a pheasant, and a boar, WHICH WERE EASY KILLS. So this the games logic, I have to pay in order to click on animals. Yes that makes so much sense, my god i would rather go hunting in real life. Oh and i didnt even get to the equipent, guess how many weapons you get, just guess, ONE. It makes no sense to me how you only get ONE weapon in a hunting game. Ok let me tell you everything you get when you first start the game. You get a sniper rifle, a huntermate (a GPS/tracker), a mule deer caller, a camera, and binoculars. Now you might think that that is exactly what you need to go hunting. Well your wrong, because the full 4 hours i was playing the game i kept finding everything other than mule deer. Oh and I almost forgot mule deers are only found on one map, and there are i believe 8 maps. So let me get this straight there are 8 maps in this game, the animals that you are able to kill are only available in 1 map, and you only get 2 animals that you are able to kill. Yeah this is definatly free-2-play. Oh yeah also, if you want to be able to kill all the animals in the game you have to get a license. If you want to know something similar to this system, its like Xbox Live. You pay 14.99 for a 3 month license. WTF thats criminal now a days, now if you are the kind person that doesnt mind paying, then thats great this game is for you. But its still very stupid that you have to do such a thing like that.\n\nHey Expansive Worlds and Avalanche Studios, let me teach you something about free-2-play.\n\nIn order to make a good free-2-play game you must be able to make sacrifcises. Sacrificises such as being able to hunt down every animal in 1 map (not 2 you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s), be able to give the player 1 of every weapon, and a caller for those animals. Now is that so hard. If you listen to this review and do what i say this will definately make this game, The Best Hunting Game Ever Made. It has the potential.\n\nThe final verdict for this game is:\n\n3/10\n\nand if you listen to my suggetions it would probably make the game at least:\n\n7/10\n\nThink about it","November 2, 2014","false","4.3"," 53 of 69 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","53","69","4","0"

It's a demo, not a F2P game by any regard. There's no logical way to progress without paying.\n\n2. It's subscription-based despite being mainly a singleplayer game with token multiplayer.\n\n3. Even if you subscribe, there are semi-arbitrary limitations on what guns can be used on what animal, forcing you to A. Buy two more guns B. Buy a shotgun and then continuously buy special ammo. C. Buy a bow, which is far harder to use than any other weapon. Either way, you either pay more or pay some and gimp yourself.\n\n4. Even if you buy the subscription and then guns you've only made the game passable. Forget about accessing any other guns, utilities or clothing without paying even more. So be prepared for about $18 just to get the very basics, and at only a 3-month lease to boot.\n\n5. The retail version of the game right now is about $16, for which you get 7 weapons, 6 months subscription and assorted goodies. The 'Starter Pack' closest to that one is $32 for 4 weapons, 6 months subscription and assorted goodies. Here's a hint. The first one is a decent price. The second one is deliberate milking of its customers for even less content.\n\n\nSo yes, the game itself is something I'd definitely see myself playing, but even after subscribing I can't motivate myself to throw more and more money at it to get anywhere. It's a nice enough game, with well-made environments and soundscape, but without a campaign of any kind or more elaborate multiplayer experience it's more of a 'pick it up every now and then to relax' type of game. Which is fine, but completely hampered by the constant money grabbing - as a one-off I'd happily pay $25-40 for it, but for that kind of money now you'd barely get 10% of the full game and a subscription ending\nto watch out for.\n\n[edit] Turns out that even if you have the licensing and the appropriate gun, you need to shell out more cash for hunting some species (e.g. mallards) for decoys and whatnot, or get shafted.

This wouldn't be so bad if there were only mule deers on the map, but no, every animal that is huntable, you can find and thats where it really gets frustrating.

Its a beautifully crafted game and you can tell there was love put into it. It is a solid title, however, I cannot enjoy the Hunter because I am constantly stopped by pay walls with it. Microtransactions are abundant and the game takes the fun out of it being a video game by making you have to pay for (like in real life) rounds, rifles, pistols, holsters, hunting licenses (which are temporary) and all sorts of other manner of hunting equipment as well.\n\nIts a great game, it could use vehicles, but the major downside is how all the equipment is blocked by constant cash fees. You can't just go out there and hunt whatever you like without paying the developer something and that is definetaly not what I am looking for in a hunting simulator. I will say you start with some basic equipment and are able to hunt hare and whitetail deer (correct me if I am wrong).\n\nI could understand and appreciate mechanics that dealt with ingame currency by rewarding you with cash for trophy kills, but that is not the case. I wish this was a standalone title, but sadly it is not. There is a multiplayer aspect to it and I really did not delve into it. If this is a MMO-like/multiplayer game with a deep community I could slightly understand the microtranscation fees. I still however in my good conscience cannot reccommend this game.\n\nIf there is a standalone version where I can just buy the whole product and am not blocked by microtranscations, I would gladly pay for it. It would be well worth it in my honest opinion, but until that point this game is a no from me.","June 11, 2014","false","13.7"," 37 of 54 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","37","54","0","1"

If you are looking for a gameplay or more balanced review, please Google for a “Let’s play” video or read another review instead. The positive recommendation only applies if you deem the pricing model as discussed acceptable.\n\nFirst things first - This title is not Free to Play.If you are looking for a free to play hunting title i have to start this review with some bad news: this game is not free to play by most interpretations of the term "Free to play". As a limited member you can do the following:\nYou can enter all the reserves and wander around.\nYou receive one basic rifle, a scope and unlimited ammunition refills for that rifle. You will also receive a deer caller.\nYou can only hunt Cottontail rabbits and Mule Deers. Hunting all other animals is prohibited in the sense that you cannot do so at all. You can see them, but shooting them is not possible.Unlike other free to play games you cannot feasibly unlock new content by playing the game a lot or by being good at it. You are stuck with what you have and that is it – and it’s admittedly not too much.\n\nThe pricing model.So, you made it past the initial post explaining the game is not free to play and might be considering picking the game up? In that case, let us talk about the games pricing model and what it entails. The games pricing model is twofold: there are both subscriptions and items purchases.\n\nSubscription:  Subscription starts at 9.99 for a 3 month period which is arguably quite good compared to most MMO's. In exchange for your subscription you will receive unlimited ammunition for all the weapons you own, and a license to hunt all species of animals in the game. It is also possible to buy ammunition and animal hunting licenses as separate items though the monetary exchange rate for this is fairly bad in comparison. (But perhaps worthwhile if you are a very casual player)\nItems: Buyable items cover a broad range of possibilities. There is weapons, scopes, clothing, deployables (Hunting towers), utilities (Animal callers, storage increasing backpack) and temporally power-ups (Wind indicators, facial paint et cetera).\n\nExcept for the power-ups all items are permanent once bought, with the caveat being that you will need an animal license and ammunition to hunt specific animals. There is an additional caveat as well: Each weapon can only be used on a subset of the animals in the game - you cannot use a pistol on a bear or a rifle on a pheasant for example. If you want to hunt all animals you will need to buy multiple weapons. The utilities sold are somewhat more optional though a huge convenience: callers enable you to coax animals them out of hiding or locate them, while specific clothing will provide superior camouflage thus fewer running animals as you try to sneak upon them.\n\nBottom line? Expect to buy a membership and - depending on playing preference - one or more weapons, scopes and clothing if you wish to fully enjoy everything the game has to offer. The cheapest variety would be buying the wayfarer pack for about 15 Euro's; this includes 3 months of membership, a shotgun, a pistol with scope and some consumables. The shotgun itself is - with different ammo types - able to take down every type of animal in the game.\n\nAlternative you can do some research and find yourself a relatively cheap combination of items that allows you to hunt virtually everything the way you want it. Still, don't be surprised if you end up forking 20-30 bucks over initially if you chose this route (that figure includes a 3 month membership).\n\nFinal thoughts.Despite the games price model arguably being steep I personally find myself enjoying the game quite a bit, so for me it is well worth the triple-a equivalent price I spend on it so far. Considering my current time invested, the subscription fee and my lack of a need to buy new items the game will be cheaper than a regular subscription MMO if I keep playing it another month or two, while spending a similar amount of time on it.\n\nThat said: I can only advice the game to people who – like me – enjoy hunting simulations quite a bit. If you plan on picking up the game you should be able to live with the thought of having to possibly do a relatively sizable investment initially, followed by a fairly mild recurrent billing scheme. It is not a good pickup for people looking exclusively for a free to play title due to the rather sharp limitations and the inability to unlock content by playing a lot or being good. Still, the game itself is a lot of fun if you like hunting sims. If you can stomach the need for payment and don't mind doing some research into the items you want i can hearthily recomment it.\n\nAddendum - How to make the most out of your game without paying a dime: There is an excellent guide on the forums by Maverick that discusses the topic of getting the most out of the game without paying a dime for it.

But his family was starving, so he decided to give it a shot.\nSteve found an old rifle and som bullets in the cabin where they were living, and set out to find some food.\n\nHe hadn't been searching for long, when suddenly a wild boar appeared.

He was shocked at first, but later realised that the gun didn't want to cooperate beacuse he DIDN'T OWN THE LICENSE TO KILL THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THING.\n\nDissappointed, Steve set out to find some other animal.

It's not easy and it's not cheap. But nothing even comes close in the hunting game genre. Yeah, it gets negative reviews from people who either have no clue about hunting or can’t afford the game. But it's an awesome game if you like to hunt or think that you’d like to hunt. The landscapes are immense, detailed, and very realistic. Each of the many maps is a work of art. The sounds are realistic and captivating. I wish it weren’t so expensive to play and maintain membership.  But, once you have all of your favorite gear, the membership fee really isn’t too bad considering what I’ve already said ^^.  If there were something better for less I'd definitely be interested. But I've looked and there isn't. So until then this is my hunting game of choice.

The game tosses you in without any little hints and stuff.\n\nSecond, You can't hunt anything unless you have a permit for it or the game's membership.\n\nThere's also the fact that the running and several of the controls are just completely whack.\n\nOh, and did I mention that your character holds the "sniper rifle" butt against the middle of their chest and hold the stock like some wand? Because the stock CLEARLY DOESN'T go against your shoulder.\n\nNext, the graphics are Playstation 2 style. They're outdated and poorly done.

So when I saw this game for free, I thought it's worth giving a go. I haven't seen another game in this niche for 10 years, so I was keen to see what it offers.\n\nI'm going to deal with the free to play issue. This game can be played for free. You can access all areas of the reserves straight away, and beautiful they are. Yes you are given one weapon/scope only, and are restricted to one species of deer to start with. However if you play well and complete missions you can earn enough in game currency to buy another weapon with which you can then hunt all animals in the game if you buy the appropriate license also with in game currency earned through missions.\n\nYes there is downloadable content to buy - if you want to - but it's not at all necessary for the enjoyment of the game. I compare it to a well known MMO tank game; you can do it all for free if you want and earn your way to stuff in game play or you can add real money and do it quicker and funner. TheHunter's the same - it gives you the option to use real money if you really want to.\n\nPricing if you want to use real cash? Well it's minimal. Yes there is the option to buy a membership which for me is 8 English pence a day giving me licenses for all animals on the reserves plus free reloads of ammo. In terms of £ spent to hours played, as I have bought some extras, I'm on about £40 for over 200 hours, and I can see the hours going up and the £ spent staying at about £40. Considering I was charged £1 to aprk for 30 minutes today in town, I don't find this bad value for money at all.\n\nGame play and graphics are ok - I do find it very immersive with TrackIR and Dolby 7.1 headphones. 60fps at highest graphic settings doesn't strain my middle of the road desk top PC.\n\nWhat makes this game a challenge is that stalking and fieldcraft are probably more important than the shooting element. This is not some sort of immersive shooting gallery. Game can be elusive, wary, spookable, and even dangerous. If all you require is a game to blast holes in things try Sniper Elite.\n\nThe only downside for me is that the designers have had to make some gameplay approximations and simplifications which make the game less realistic, and less of a challenge. The most notable one for me is that the rifle trajectories are effectively flat, and range finding isn't really part of the game as your encounter ranges tend to be well under 50 metres. There's no wind effect on the shot either, so real life skills of range finding, usind hold over for range, and allowing for the wind don't appear here which is a shame.\n\nGame play summary: you will spend a lot of time walking slowly from cover to cover straining your ears and eyes for the signs of animals which you can then track and if you get it right you will eventually see them and get in a position to shoot. A critic called it a walking simulator - sounds like he was a poor hunter as stealth is the key.\n\nSo thinking of trying it? Well all you have to lose is the download time to your disc. If you like the first couple of hours you'll probably decide to splash a little cash for a basic membership to give you quicker access to hunting species other than the free mule deer.\n\nI've seen a review below where someone makes out that if you want to play the game you need to buy this and buy that and the sums run into large amounts of $. It's not so. You do not need to buy every bit of kit in the game - one shotgun with its birdshot, buckshot and solid slug will let you take on every single species on the map.\n\nSo that's it for me. It is a good hunting simulator. There is Gucci gear available for real £ but you can do a lot with a very little £. You can do massive amounts with no £ at all as long as you accept:\n\na) you need to work your way up the game to earn in game currency\nb) you need to use the right skills to do this - play like a CoD buffoon and you'll never succeed\nc) that people with real £ can buy goodies if they want to without stopping the game being free to play\nd) that there is no 'win' in this game other than the satisfaction you get from hunting with skill","August 6, 2014","true","832.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Once playing theHunter you will realize you are not playing a F2P game, but you are playing a demo. Yes you get to play with a starter gun, get unlimited basic ammo and you can shoot mule deer but that does  only scatch the surface of what game is available. That content you will see prancing around you as you are powerless to engage these creatures.\n\nMechanics in the game like ethic hunting (not shooting a bunny with a 50. cal) are warped or solely exist to force the player into a pay to play model.\n\nMultiplay hosting is tied into a member subscription. Making you reliant on the scarce and mostly unstable starter area servers. The MP client is tied into a peer 2 peer model reminiscent of oldentimes or grand strategy or RTS games, halting everybodys client if one player is having a connection issue.

The rating on the review is because of immature idiots who want everything for free - got nothing to do with the game. If you're a spoiled immature brat wanting more handouts to go with your welfare cheque, mark it down and ♥♥♥♥ off. Don't bother with entitlement whining in the comments, I'll just kill it.\n\n..oo00oo..\n\nNow, the game.\n\n- GRAPHICS -\nThis is gorgeous. A 6.00am start at Redfeather had me mesmerised. There are some placing issues, grass and trees above ground etc. but it's really only aesthetics and does little to detract gameplay.\n\nWith my trusty 670gtx/i7/8Gb rig this game shines with only minor fan speedup when scene changing. A steady 60fps with only minor tearing (I haven't bothered changing the default yet so could probably be sorted easily enough).\n\nVery easy to look at and the animalation (now there's a word) is very attractive. Slightly robotic at times but hey, if we had 500,000 vectors to plot per animal we couldn't play without a Cray.\n\n- SOUND -\nThere could be a little more control over some of the ambients, eg: ocean waves, as sound is a critcal and tactile sense in this game and some of it gets over the top. Rain, wind etc. is good and animal calls, while lacking in some bearing seperation, is true to form.\n\nAnd the guns? Wow. Crank it people. It might take 2 hours of tracking before you fire but I get great delight hearing the .308 reverb off the valley walls. My kids, avid fans all, bounce off their chair! The bang-ratchet-bang of the pump action while pheasant shooting is as sweet as.\n\n(Err.... an 11.00pm .308 shot scored me some wife-wrath so headphones people!)\n\n- GAMEPLAY -\nIf holding shift + W is your only way to get somewhere this is NOT your thing. If the destination is more important than the journey or you're expecting a gluttony of "shootables", DO NOT BUY.\n\nThis requires patience and lots of it, much of it is tedium. This is hunting. You are a hunter. Stealth. Cover. Shadows. Crouching. Camoflauge. Downwind. ALL of this comes into play.  I've even suggested on the forums that you need to move like YOU are the hunted for best results.\n\nAnimals, particularly those munched on by predators have an uncanny sense of smell and hearing. And it IS fascinating to watch animals through a scope pausing, sniffing and treading lightly. "Wary skittishness" has been modelled beautifully and really adds to the sense of the hunters plight... Let's face it, we're blundering lunkheads in natures true arena and you'll pay the price for it.\n\n-Shooting.\nIn RL, I have probably loosed close to 10,000 rounds. Mostly night shooting for foxes and roos. As a staunch user of the .243 in that era I took great delight in how well this acts, sounds and plays like a .243 ingame. I can "feel" the shoulder kick and smell the powder. (I know, it's psychosomatic but you get what I'm saying....)\n\nScope tracking is well mimiced and looking downrange for a headshot @ 150m is frustratingly difficult. Zoom capabilities are also true-to-form in that higher zoom will produce greater scope movement. Nice work in this department. Note that there are many scopes, sizes and types, many aimed (yck yck) at quality shooting and range judgement.\n\n- The shotty is divine albeit a rather blunt instrument.\n- The .30 is popular and goes off like a firecracker on steroids.\n- The Anshutz .308 -a spend money on it- gun has just entered my inventory and is a darling to use. I linked it up with a 9x50 and I'm REALLY loving this outfit.\n\nI've made mention on the forums that I'm concerned that there is no score rewards based on target range despite the obvious (monetary) push to high-quality equipment. In my view this is wrong, both ingame and economically. My weapons and equipment need to be valuable to me but there is no reason to use anything other than a 12 gauge with the right ammo for the kill. Why charge up to $15 RL money for a gun and scope that counts towards.... nothing?\n\n-Animal Tracking\nI like the way this has been done. It's very difficult to mimic the senses from a 3D enviroment in a 2D rectangle and yet this gives a sense of tracking success with target sighting as the eventual reward. The kill itself does become secondary on the harder to track species and I've once or twice found myself shooting only a photo and simply walking away. Seriously.\n\n-Competitions\nGood fun and ultimately (at least for me) is the reason I play. Nope, I haven't won any as I write but I've got close. The planning and dedication required to win a trophy is high level stuff and really needs to be worked at. I'm loving them. Soon.......\n\n- GENERAL -\nIn the interests of brevity I'm going to mention the words achievements (LOTS of them), missions, multiplayer, XP building all in the one sentence. The reasons will be quite obvious. You gotta pay to play, not a real lot, and it's worth every cent.\n\n- UI -\nIn a sentence on the launcher windows. Messy. Clunky. Confusing. EW. Get someone on this. Rule of thumb, evaluate your UI on your grandmothers. If they're confused it's bad OK?  Even ingame I find some "habit formed clicking" breaks on some changes to equipment.\n\n..oo00oo..\n\n- SUMMARY -\n\nCONS\nTedious at times with all that walking.\nCould ultimately cost quite a bit.\nUI.\nScoring is errr.... pointless. (pun intended)\n\nAs an Aussie, I find it filled with Americanised hunting claptrap and hyperbole. Less Greenpeace and more hunting is needed, it's a GAME :)\n\nPROS\nAwesome sound/graphics on good/high-end systems.\nGreat immersion and true-to-life animals and in particular their behaviour.\nGood choice of weaponry and associated peripheral match-ups.\nProvides a very real sense of hunting.\n\nIf you're an RL hunter but can't get out enough. GET THIS. No question.\n\n9/10 (amended score and review*)\n\ngg\n\n*Amended review to reflect continued use. 1000+ hours now and still immersed.

But on the down side its a free to play that should be more "Pay some you can actually hunt something good instead of ♥♥♥♥". You can only hunt two animals which are the Mule Deer and Rabbit, when trying to shoot anything else you will no be able to till you buy a basic account which is about $5 USD. Sure its not much, but for a hunting game its got to be really ♥♥♥♥ing good for me to lay down $5 every month.

Really wanted to like this, but wish it was a one time purchase for the whole game, and if I wanted other stuff such as guns or something I wouldn't mind laying down the cash but the way it is right now its not great.","June 20, 2014","false","1.6"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gathose/recommended/253710/","Gathose","Gathose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gathose/","125 products in account","Love this game, the only reason so m any people hate it is because it says free to play and it isn't. I would urge the makers of the game to remove its free to play status and just be honest. It is limited for free to play and it's mostly a pay to play game. With that being said, I'll continue with why I love the game.\n\nIt is an EXCELLENT pay to play game and literally the only online game I have subscribed to aside from World Of Warcraft when I was younger. Me, my buddy and my girlfreind spend hours at a time stalking and killing Elk with the amazing tracking system and the detailed injury system, allowing you to see exactly what organs you've hit on the animal after you collect the kill. This helps you to make a more precise and fast kill the next time, eventually leading you from shooting wildly at the animal and tracking it forever, to shooting the animal exactly where it's vital organs are, killing it in one swift killshot. This get's even better when you use weapons that are silent like bows or crossbows, enabling you to kil animals quick and silently without alerting others in the heard they are travelling with. I've taken doiwn 4 or 5 animals in one silent swipe with my buddy before, making tandem kills and picking the off animals lagging behind the rest of the heard.\n\nI also enjoy that there are many different ways to earn the in game real money currency "em$". Aside from spending your cash on it, you can also earn it by completing competitions, which with a free memebrship can be very difficult, but with just the basic package, it allows you to kill nearly all the animals (with the exception of a few that require specific equipment) and take part in most competition with at least some chance to achieve victory if you are really dedicated enough. You can also earn "em$" by completeing simple tasks such as filling out surveys, downloading apps onto your phone (tha can be immediatly removed) or registering to a website and confirming an E-mail. I've earned well ove 10,000 em$ through this process and although I have spent real money on the game, if I really wanted to, I could just keep completeing these tasks to earn whatever guns or equipment I wanted.\n\nFinally I'll talk about the dev team. With regular updates, bug fixes and new features being added to the game, it really feels like you're paying into the development of the game. New areas, new animals to hunt and just recently the addition of hunting dogs, really lets you know that the dev team is working hard to bring you new and exciting features for the game.\n\nMany people are turned off by the amount of money that can be dropped on the game, and I can see where the concern comes from, but this is one of the best hunting games I've ever played and although I hope they change their pricing model some day, I'm willing to pay for the amazing features in this game right now, given the quality of it.\n\nEdit: Also I should mention that the price of being able to hunt all animals is very low (in my opinion anyway). The first 3 month will cost you $5.66 a month and give you a pump shotgun which will allow you to hunt literallly every animal in the game. If you feel like doing missions until you can buy the single shot shotgun with the unpaid currency (Gm$) than you could pay for a 3 month membership for $3.66 a month and be able to hunt every single animal in the game. Since it gives you unlimited ammo you can hunt as much as you want during that time and it wont be a problem. Keep in mind that you can win competitions to get the paid currency, but they can be quite difficult to rank in.\n\nAlso, people seem to have a problem with the amount of game hours I have in the game so I'll explain why I have so many. If you leave the initial "thehunter" browser open, steam counts you as in game and thus you get a billion hours in a week if you leave it open. I leave my browser open nearly all the time since me my buddies and my gf play so often, and so I can get the latest news they have updated the game with. So if you think it's sketchy that I have so many hours in the game, it's literallyn just because I leave the main browser open.","June 14, 2015","true","982.2"," 156 of 287 people (54%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","54","156","287","35","16"

It's a free game that allows people to hunt Whitetail Deer, pheasant, and all types of rabbits. The graphics and realism of the animal's detection system is as realistic as hunting can be.

It is a very relaxing experience that grows in intensity once you're stalking your prey. Once you get your first kill, you'll want to come back for more.\n\nGive it a try, after all, it is free!\n\n---------------------------------------------------UPDATE------------------------------------------\n\nRecently purchased the 12 month Trailrunner subscription ($50) and I could not be happier! They give you 8 guns & an awesome bow, excellent camo clothing, callers, 3 deployable towers, a tree stand, wind indicator, a tent along with licenses to hunt every animal & host your own server.\n\nI absolutely love the stealth aspect that comes with stalking your prey. Using the bow is even more challenging since you need to get very close to your animal to get the best shot. Never thought I'd enjoy the bow better than guns, but when you can silently take out a flock of turkeys/deer/elk etc. it is very fun.\n\nI'll continue to revise this review as time goes on.","November 9, 2015","true","123.6"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","24","40","2","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HooCairs/recommended/253710/","HooCairs","HooCairs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HooCairs/","42 products in account","I am a long time player and will try to make this review informative and realistic.\n\n*** Gameplay\nI tried this game and liked it so much that I purchased a one-year membership after a few days. The relaxed and realistic atmosphere is likely one of the biggest sellers for the game. You basically roam the woods looking for animals, or clues that can lead you to them. There are a lot more animals in the game than what you would see in real life. Also the animals are less shy than in nature, so that you will find plenty of them even in a short hunting session. You will discover traces on the ground or hear animals call somewhere in the distance. Once an animal is tracked down, you may opt for a kill or move on. Tracking gets easier the more you play. With the increasing number of tracks that you pick up, your skill level rises and tracking becomes easier. It also happens a lot that you see single animals or a group of them roaming around as you walk through the reserves. This game is not for someone trying to get satisfaction in a lot of animal shooting in a short time.\n\n*** Memberships\nAll players start as "guest" and receives a free rifle and life-long free ammunition for this gun and some basic equipment. A membership is a time-limited license that will unlock all animals, free ammunition for all weapons, and also the ability to host multiplayer parties. A permanent license is not available.\n\n*** Hunting Grounds\nThe reserves in the western part of this world resemble of American continent-based areas, the eastern part holds areas that you could easily find in Europe. Currently seven reserves are available. Each has its own charm and of course its animal species. At the beginning of every hunt you select a reserve. You can start from a permanent lodge or from a tent that you have placed in the reserve before. The maps are very big and if needed there is a fast travelling system.\n\n*** Animals\nAt this point the game features 18 species. Some of them can attack the player. Many can be lured with callers, scents or decoys. Then there are baiting stations that will bring the animals to a certain location. Most bird species are only scored if shot in the air, which is always a fun challenge. For many species unusual fur variations can be found, some of which are truly rare. Shooting such a rare animal is just as special as a trophy buck. Shooting animals in theHunter quite demanding. The animals have bones and organs, and every shot should be thought through before the trigger is pulled. Hitting vital organs will lead to death, bad shots can result in a follow-up search.\n\n*** Weapons\nA host of rifles is available, all of which can be equipped with scopes for longer shots. Using the open sights can be just as much fun though. Depending on the knock-down capabilities of these guns they are allowed to be used for larger or smaller game. There is also a selection of handguns, some with plenty of power to even kill a moose. Shotguns can be used with three types of ammunition, which makes them all-around weapons for all animals.\nShooting guns makes all animals in the area flee. Bows can be used as silent killers and will not alarm other animals unless they are really close.\n\n*** Equipment\nThere is equipment that can be permanently placed in the reserves. Tents let you to start a hunt where ever you placed them before, and they give you access to your entire inventory just like a lodge. There are treestands that can be mounted to trees for a better overview of the area. Ground and waterfowl blinds protect you on the ground from being seen, and a tripod stand provides some elevation for easier animal spotting.\n\n*** In-game Money\nAll game items are paid with the in-game currency em$. It can be purchased with real money, won in competitions, or earned by completing third-party offers. Also there are gm$ that can be earned by completing missions, allowing to buy consumables. Non-consumable items belong to the player permanently, even if a membership expires.\n\n*** Missions\nCurrently there are a total of 245 missions available. Most mission packs start rather easy and become increasingly more difficult. You will end up shooting pheasants or geese in air with bows, or try to make a moose attack you for an adrenaline kill.\n\n*** Competitions & Leaderboards\nCompetitions are run around the clock for all animals. Players from around the world sign up and compete against each other. The top players receive a trophy which appears on the player's profile. In addition em$ can be earned. All animals of all players are compared during every season and represented on leaderboards. The best players will make their way into the Hall of Fame.\n\n*** Multiplayer\nMultiplayer parties are client-based, there are no MP servers. In the game it is possible to chat with others. Players can hunt as team or on their own. It is advisable that people from the same geographical regions connect for such games, or there can be lagging.\n\n*** Things I don't like\n- The website's style is not "outdoor-like". Also the font size and the line spacing are too large. There is a lot of scrolling to be done when going through statistics or the store.\n- The large antlers of the Red Deer are completely unrealistic. The red deer in the game does not look like the real one, and that is a real pity for me, being European.\n- Some animals have too large eyes and thus look like large baby animals. The most obvious ones are the Brown Bear and the Roe Deer.\n- It is not possible to jump or climb over the smallest obstacles and you have to circumvent them.  Sometimes it would be handy to climb a rock and gain a bit better overview, but many rocks cannot be climbed.\n\n*** Conclusion\nThe game is constantly being enhanced with new content. It remains one of the best games I have ever played, and certainly played for the longest time. Playing long nights is not tiring even if it gets really busy around you at times. It is unique with its  lively environment and ambient sounds, but can be just as much challenging when trying to pin down the trophy animal. There is a great random factor and unpredictability, which I think among many other things is the greatest achievement of the developers. I keep playing because every game session can be so much different to the former, and so the game just never gets old.\n","June 12, 2014","true","244.9"," 64 of 116 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","64","116","0","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainstardog/recommended/253710/","captainstardog","Fireballs of the Eucharist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainstardog/","161 products in account","Hi everyone! I hope you're all doing well today. So I gave this "f2p" a try and found it's simply "f2t" which means it isn't really free to play at all. It's free-2-try. The pricing is ridiculous. If I'm going to spend this kind of money, I'll be doing some real hunting. If you have tons of money and think you might give this a try anyway, I suppose it might be fun practice for some folks. Anyway, let me tell you how my hour in the game went, and you can judge for yourself if you want to try.\n\nI play on three monitor Nvidia Surround. Some games have built in limitations to make it fair, but I don't think that's the case with this game. The resolutions given in the options appear to support my setup, so I made the switch and bam! I get what looks like a normal widescreen view squashed flat and stretched across three monitors. Needless to say, I don't think the game looks very good that way.\n\nSo I see a cabin and decide to walk up to it, but can't get up on the porch even though it looks like I should be able to step up. Maybe the front of the porch looks lower to me because of the stretching effect, so I walk around to the steps on the side and get up on the porch... only to find I can't open the door anyway--or at least I couldn't figure out how.\n\nSo I look around and see a shooting range. I head over, pick a spot, lay down, and cannot clearly see all targets because they are obscured partly by the targets in front of them. I don't feel like creeping over to another spot because this one is clearly marked as viable and the movement mechanics are so slow and clunky, so I do some practice shooting with the one free weapon you start with by default. Wow! My persona must be a complete jitterbug because I can't seem to hold the weapon even moderately still. I open options and look for a key to let me either empy my lungs or hold my breath, find it, and... heh... not much help at all.\n\nAfter practice, I get up and just start wandering around the woods. I see a lot of bugs and a few birds. The sounds are great, and I think I might like this game for meditation if the view wasn't squashed flat and looking so completely odd. I do glimpse one deer off in the distance, but if I'm supposed to be able to track it I'll never know because I can't seem to find the spot where I spotted it. So I wander. And wander. I find a nice peaceful spot and sit down. And I wait. And I wait. And then I leave.\n\nIf they fix the resolution, I might come back and try my luck again. If walking around and waiting seem like a good game to you, give it a try. I know this is supposed to be realistic hunting, and I'm okay with that. Really I am. But when the view is squashy, the shooting mechanics are clunky, and the movement is so darn slow and irritatingly stupid, it gets tedious to say the least. If I could at least enjoy the scenery, it might not have been such a terrible experience for me. As it is, I can't even do that. I read that if you keep practicing, your ability to hold the weapon still gets better, but I'm not sure the rest of my experience rates a keep-trying approach.\n\nNo, I can't recommend this game. You might try it and like it, but for me, it just doesn't work. I'd rather be out in the real woods hunting real animals for practice. At least then, if I see a porch I want to hop up on, I can do that without having to creep slowly around to the steps on the side. Talk about silly.","June 11, 2014","false","1.2"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

If this game had a "you buy it, you get everything, all guns/licenses/reserves/etc for a flat $50.00" (which is a new release AAA price), I probably would've done it. But the nickle-and-diming ridiculousness of their membership plans is something I won't accept. Even most MMORPG's have a hard time maintaining a monthly subscription, yet theHunter thinks that people will keep doling out the money to retain to their guns/licenses/access to certain parts of the game.\n\nWhat if I don't want to play for the full 3 months? It makes the customer feel like they're flushing money down the drain. I'd rather hand over a big chunk up front, get my entire game, and be able to pick it up when I feel like it. Not, oh 5 months down the road I think about trying it again, and they want even more money.\nThe real trick is that if they do sucker you into paying for a membership, at the end of that time, you suddenly realize... I'm going to lose all my access, but I've got all this progress I want to keep working on, I don't want to lose it and should pay more to keep going! That's how they'll hook you and keep the cash flowing in endlessly, as opposed to simply letting people buy the full game normally and be done with it.\n\nAs to the actual gameplay... The animals are few and far between, and most of the time when you find a track, it's frequently not going to be the kind you're allowed to hunt. Which is pretty much only mule deer, and you have one gun. So every time annoying pheasants or whitetail deer pops up on the Huntermate tracking device, you get reminded to either fork over the money or you're blocked from certain content. It's irritating.\n\nThe game world itself is gorgeous, and the tracking system is uniquely detailed -- but that's not nearly enough to make me overlook the above issues. I would be a customer, if it weren't for their greedy scheme.\n\nThe other hysterical part is that they actually asked their fans to leave positive reviews, because they think all the bad reviews "create a distorted picture of the community's feelings." How about you stop trying to cover up people's genuine reactions to your greediness? The majority are voicing their complaints that this is a bad business model.","June 29, 2014","false","3.8"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","0"

It is free indeed, you can hunt three or four animals as a guest and those animals are as followed.\n\nWhitetail\n\nCottontail rabbit\n\nPheasant.\n\nThere's also special events that go on that allows you to hunt certain animals for a certain ammount of time for free, however. If you wish to invest in the game, it's actually a fair deal and they're not asking for a a lot either. 500 ems is worth 4.99 USD and 3 months of memberhip is around 10$ USD, there's obviously other options but those are the two cheapest and it's quite fair if you ask me.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game, it's a lot of fun getting to hunt the animals in the map locations, plus it's really good for time consumption as well. After all, I play this game when I do my homework while sitting in a tree stand or hunting tower lol.\n\nEither way to sum things up, don't judge this game by the negative reviews until you actually tried it yourself, you may or may not like it and this is as close as hunting I can get when the season for whitetail irl isn't opened.\n\nSo overall, if you're a fellow real life hunter as myself here, you'll enjoy the game!","May 8","true","908.9"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","21","35","2","0"

To other reviewers, yes you have to pay for a license to hunt game. Different states in the USA handle this differently, but it is pretty much the same. You buy a license to hunt at a certain time an only the game that is allowed during that time period. This is a hunting simulator! You can do things go earn money in the game to use instead of paying for the in game money. Aside from that, this game has some of the best graphics I have seen in a while. Also, it is nice to play a game where your movement isn't like supermans. The distance you travel in 15 minutes is pretty much like what you would travel in real life. I do plan on getting a month membership for the perks, but this game is fun to play even without them.","March 18","true","121.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Is it TOTALLY FREE to Play?\nA. Yes & No. This game has enough to play for free if, (A) you are just a casual hunter playing now and again,\n(B) you don't mind only hunting 5 types of anaimals (Whitetail Deer, Cottontail & European Rabbits, Snowshoe Hare, Pheasant),\n(C) you play to earn gm$ (in game money) by doing missions, then spend that on other game licenses.\n\nQ. Do I HAVE TO SPEND A LOT of Real Money to play?\nA. No not at all. If you want to hunt all the animals you can get a subscription that only cost $3.33 a month (less if you get a longer sub)\nIf you want to own a lot of weapons, clothing, hunting dog, etc. to customise your character you'll have to spend some real money to get em$ (the in game money that you buy with real money) but how much is up to you.\n*If you buy one of the "DLC" those are the subscriptions (3, 6 & 12 month) with bonus items, they cost slightly more then normal subscriptions, BUT you only by those once for the bonus items then resub at normal rate. The bonus items are worth the extra as it will save you money over buying them separately.\n\nAs a FREE Player you can hunt the 5 animals I mentioned above, you can track and spot any animal in the game.\nYou start with 2 free weapons (.243 Bolt Action Rifle and the Single Shot Shotgun).\nYou can hunt on anywhere on the map (some areas will have nothing to shoot for free players).\nYou can hunt with you friends in multiplayer...No You Can Not Shoot Your Friends No Matter How Much You Would Like To!\n\nQ. Can you walk for long periods of time and not spot anything?\nA. Yes, just like in real life you can hunt for long periods without spotting anything, you'll find lots of tracks to follow...\nAlso you will want to walk not run, this isn't CoD. Take your time walk crouched, listen for movement around you, just like you would have to do if you where really hunting.\n\nIf you like hunting games give it a try...it's got a great community, nice graphics, good hunting and it's somewhat Free!","March 4","true","99.7"," 41 of 74 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","41","74","5","3"

(you cannot host multiplayer as a free to play)\n\nSecondly there claims about being able to earn currency is a sham dont do any of the survey offers and especially dont do any of the offers that say pay $20 on such and such a service and they will credit you so much EM. I have spent about 8 hours filling out serveys and watching videos and doing all sorts of things and even useing all my correct information only to have my information stolen and nothing given in return, all the EM providers just claim you have not completed the requirements, even after I sent them all the copys of the email confirmations. and the hunter accepts no reponsability from what they link from there own game.\n\nIts a scam. I payed for access to software in one deal to try to get a good rate on EM currency which never arived and after speaking with their support staff found out that that company claims no affiliation with either the advertising company or with TheHunter so in the end lesson learned.\n\nGranted a small few of the "download and open this app" ones worked for a small amount on EM but nothing else did. TheHunter are advertising this service of earning EM inside there own game from and ingame window and should be held responsable for the clear violation of the fair traiding act in false advertising.","June 14, 2014","false","56.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I been on it for almost 3 years I believe. I really enjoy this game since this is the closest I can come to being a hunter without buying a hunting license, a gun and ammo, and a lease. I find the graphics to be pretty detailed and all the ambient sound makes it feel like I'm actually in the wild. As a F2P (a term everyone hates) shooter, its fun and relaxing at the same time. The game isn't perfect by no means with some AI bugs, pop ups, limited draw distance, and other hic-ups. But everyone grips about hunting only mule deer and having 1 rifle and deer calls. You have to buy a license to hunt other animals in the game that roam around in the same world. They grip about license expiring after certain set times. People forget that this is cheaper than going out and buying real life guns, ammo, leases, and a hunting license thats good for 1 year. Enough of my short rant. Only thing I don't like about the game is that to get em$, you have to ether buy it or do third party surveys, apps, videos, or other stuff they want you to do for the em$. The missions are a nice touch but only reward you with gm$ which you use to buy different ammo. And to buy extra guns, stands, and other calls you'll need em$ which is hard to come by. Other then those grips the game is a pretty run and relaxing hunting trip thats so much better than a Cabela's hunting game any day.\n\nMultiplayer - Basicly if you are a guest (F2P) you can't host any multiplayer game but you can join but due to the restriction of the guest, you can only hunt on Logger's Point. But members can host any game and set any restriction on who can join.","August 13, 2014","true","501.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

(BirdShot, Slugs and Buckshot)\nAlthough it would be a trial, and a management of Gm$ it's still available through that means without spending anything.\n\nAlso as a memeber you get umlimited ammo with every gun you have, apart from a type of arrow which do expend  which is the tracer bolts. (Not tested them myself)\n\nBut all in all, I've had a fantastic time playing the free version when I did, and I'm having an even better time with a membership.\n\nBest Hunting game around.\nIf it's not your type of game or business model, then just move along and don't play it :)\nHappy Hunting and good luck!","December 11, 2015","true","69.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/felix9112/recommended/253710/","felix9112","[Arctic Servers] Felix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/felix9112/","156 products in account","After taking a look at the negative reviews on this game regarding it saying 'F2P' when they have a Guest user system which is essentially their version of "Free Users", I don't see why you're all upset about this. The system works perfectly with the game and despite many of you saying "You have to invest lots of cash to actually do anything", you'd be supprised if you took a look around their starter packs page and various retailers for the game (Key websites, Amazon etc), you can infact find ridiculously good deals for this title, I'll explain that further on.\nI myself find the game to be one of the best hunting simulators I've played in a long long time, the Cabela's series honestly has been blown away by this title and the community as it stands is in excellent condition. The game is regularly updated and despite having a few issues in the past it's turning out to be one of my all-time favourite games due to the fact that there is an unlimited amount of fun that you can have, from having hunting competitions with your friends to solo hunting in the dense forests or in the mountain peaks. The graphics and the game ballistics & physics are clean and very well-done, despite having hiccups rarely with a few glitches they need to iron out you'd be supprised at how much you can actually achieve within the game. The achievement and rewards system for competitions and general milestones are another feature which adds a sense of achievement to investing your hours into the game, same with weapon skills and tracking / spotting skill levels.\n\nOn to the weapons, currency and customization within the game.\n\nCustomization is somewhat limited due to the fact you can't swap camo's on your weapon, so the marketplace often has weapons of the same type but a different appearance. But it doesn't really matter as they share the same skills / stats aslong as they are the same model. Character appearance is another feature you can customize within the game by simply mix and matching clothing to your desire, with the wide range available it's really not that bad. As well as you can swap out clothing on different enviroment conditions or depending on what you're hunting to give better visibility and sound reduction stats.\n\nCurrency (EM / GM) within the game is something you'd definetly expect for a game of this type. With a large multiplayer endorsement around the game I wouldn't have expected anything less than the requirement to buy different weapons, clothing and equiptment with the virtual currency, which is perfectly understandable for this title and was implemented well within the game. EM is the real-world exchanged currency where you purchase it using real-world money or you can complete surveys as an additional way of gaining it for those who can't justify supporting the title through currency purchasing. GM is the free currency which you can gain through suveys again or by completing challenges or competitions within the game, however you can purchase limited things using this currency.\nHonestly, despite what you guys are saying they should have no shame in calling themselves a F2P game, I've spent many hours within this game and spent what I'd say is a fairly reasonable amount on additions for the game. They offer a nice range of deals on their site for starter packs, for the price of $15 you can get almost everything you'd need to have a nice start to the game, the 12 GA Pump Action Shotgun included can hunt almost everything within the game, you gain 3 months membership and access to hunting everything and travel anywhere, as well as various other equiptment and a sidearm included.\nI didn't realise it before but I found various retail versions of the game available on certain retailer websites, and despite already having a membership and a nice collection of weapons, I went ahead and spent £14 on a retail key from ♥♥♥♥♥[uk.♥♥♥♥♥.net], who offer a very nice retail package for this, for the price of any regular game. So what's the shame in calling this an F2P game if they give you a variety of free options, and then the ability to upgrade to a full version of the game with a membership / starter pack / retail copy for the price of any regular game? It's perfectly justified.\nAnd for those who are interested in that retail copy, it is beyond belief what you get from it and I'd highly recommend that to anyone interested in starting or continuing playing this game. It includes 6 months membership, 7 weapons (2 shotguns, 2 sidearms, 2 rifles, 1 bow) as well as access to everything within the game and another large assortment of equiptment and callers to get you started. (Note: One of the shotguns is an exclusive non-market shotgun too!)\n\nWeapons in the game are definetly very fitting for the title. The developers have kept far away from unrealistic hunting weapons, despite firearms such as AR-15's and semi-automatic rifles being used regularly in real world hunting they have taken the right desicion to not spoil the fun of hunting and keep it to a nice selection of rifles, shotguns, sidearms and bows. They even added a muzzleloader for those who want a way-back hunting expirence. Perfect matches, for a perfect game.\n\nOverall, in my opinion the game is absolutely superb with it's stunning graphics, unbeatable realistic physics and it's very well implemented multiplayer, community and features. Definetly a 10/10 in my books, and for those upset about the pricing of things, seriously check out the retail copies and the starter packs. For the price of a regular game (Under £15) you can get everything you need to have endless hours of fun within the game.\n\nHopefully this was helpful, if not then I'm not sure what you were expecting from a review.\n(Note: Over 100 hours on the non-steam version)\n\n- Felix B.","June 8, 2014","true","27.7"," 70 of 130 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","70","130","2","8"

This investment is only worth it, if you enjoy a slow-paced realistic hunting game with hours of walking around, tracking and preparing. That is not to say that it will take you hours to make your first kill. With some due dilligence, a quarter of an hour is enough to encounter a deer that walks past your sights and gives you the opportunity to collect your first trophy. And that's what makes this game not only good, but at times even masterful. The satisfaction of landing a kill is immense if you spent a lot of work preparing for the perfect shot.

It looked like exactly what we wanted, it was someting we could goof off in with no real objective and the co-op functionality seemed like a good time. As we waited for the game to download we got a little excited at the prospect of sitting in a tree stand waiting to snipe bambi. once we created a profile we both saw that there were options for a membership which  we both assumed ment premium guns or rare hunts. when we tried to make a multiplay game we were told we couldn't host unless we had a membership. no matter we thought at least we can still join a multiplayer game. After about 10 min. of struggling with trying to get in the same game we found that when we both joined there was nobody else in the game. I mean nobody, none of the other players that were there when we joined, and not eachother. We were in our own individual game. "Oh well." we thought at least we can still play and talk. That is when IT happened my friend scoped up on a buck and was told that he couldn't actually HUNT it (in a game called "The Hunter") unless he payed atleast $10.  WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ GAME. This game is not free to play. this game is free to look at. free to walk around in by yourself. free to pretend to enjoy. but this game costs atleast 10 dollars to play.

Unfortunately these game devs have a horrible reputation for greed and poor customer service. They boast that it is they most realistic hunting game out there... and that's not quite true..\n\nWhile the terrain and landscapes are very well done; the draw distance is very limited in this game which is EXACTLY what a hunting game shouldn't have. The animals (excluding the deer) in the game are very poorly detailed, both aesthetically, as well as their movements.\n\nThe game engine and graphics are VERY dated. If you've ever hunted in Assassin's Creed 3 or Far Cry: Primal you probably found the animals looked much better, and moved much better. The weapon handling smoother. Not to mention the baiting and trapping you can do in those.\n\nThen there's the business model. Not only are you required to subscribe or purchase liscences (with REAL money) in order to hunt the different animals in different locations, but its also riddled with a boatload of microtransactions for guns, ammo, nests, blinds, and pretty much EVERYTHING the game has to offer. Basically its a wring out every dollar greed fest.\n\nOnly spend money on this game if their packages on steam are at a MAJOR discount.","February 11, 2015","false","42.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Shot 8 of them between the two of us, Pheasant got spooked and flew away after we shot them all, shot it out of the sky.\n\n8/10 would get angry and fire my 12 gauge into the air again.\n\nThe Hunter is an excellent spiritual successor to games like the original Cabela's Dangerous Hunts, however it often misleads potentially new players with a "Free to play" scheme, that is a blatant lie, the game becomes unplayable, much like the original "Free to Play" marketing schemes. However if you invest some money into it, (Around 15 bucks) the game is pretty decent, with well coded animal AI and plenty of quarry that behaves drastically different, you won't feel as though you were chasing the same thing with a different model. Kangaroos for example are almost oblivious to predators (I.E. you) and will remain fairly calm as you close in for a good clean one shot. Whilst deer will get spooked at the slightest step within 30 meters.\n\nI've yet to hunt every type of animal and am still fairly new to the game, I'd say if you like hunting simulators and have some buddies to play with on this it would be a decent purchase for a brief bundle pack, by its end you should have gotten your money's worth and will be done with this game.\n\n7.5/10\n\n+ Good AI.\n+ Gunplay feels genuine.\n+ Good with friends.\n+ Drastic change in environments keep the game fun.\n\n- Crappy store pricing.\n- Misleading "Free to play" marketing tactic.\n- Pay to play\n\nI'd recommend a cheap bundle buy, if you enjoy it you could invest more into it.

I enjoy both Hunting & Gaming, so finding & playing the best hunting game comes natural to me.\n\nTheHunter:  First things first...this is not a shoot-em'-up game where you sprint through the woods guns-a-blazin'.  You will often be crouching through the woods or sitting in a stand, if that's your preference.  Some will see this game style as a bit slow or even boring at times, especially if they're used to playing a FPS.  That being said, theHunter is a good compromise between Hunting Simulation & video game.\n\nStrengths\n\nVariety:  There are currently 18 different species that you can hunt in theHunter, and that number continues to grow as they add new content.  There are the small deer species (roe, blacktail, whitetail, mule deer), larger deer species (roosevelt elk, moose, red deer), waterfowl (mallards & Canadian geese), canines (fox & coyote), hogs (wild boar & feral hogs), bear (black & brown), birds (pheasant & turkey), and small game (rabbits).  There are also 7 different maps for you to hunt these animals, containing anywhere from 4 to 6 different species in each map.  You also have access to 32 different weapons with which to choose from, which allows you to hunt with a variety of rifles, pistols, primitive bows, compound bows, shotguns, a flintlock muzzleloader, or even an air rifle, each with different scopes for you to use.  Further adding to the variety offered in theHunter are the different types of camo & large equipment, such as treestands, blinds, feeders, bear bait barrels, etc.\n\nReplayability:    When you start a new game in theHunter, the animals are randomly generated on the map.  This only happens once, which is right when the game starts.  There are no “respawns” as you harvest animals throughout the course of your game.  Nobody knows exactly how this works, but suffice to say that you have close to an equal number of each species on the map that you selected.  There will always be animals that are trophy worthy, and it is up to you to use your skill & patience to find them.  Along with the trophy animals are rare variations of almost every species offered.  This gives you a real sense of accomplishment when you find an albino bull elk, that trophy piebald whitetail, or the rarest of rare bears.  All of the deer species use a system called TruRacs that generates the antlers that you see in-game, and it is different every time.  All of these things, combined with the variety above, give this game a great amount of addictive replayability.  In one hunt, you might be shooting for a red deer muzzleloading competition in Hirschfelden wearing the trapper outfit & in the next you might be hunting mallard ducks in the swamps of the Rougarou Bayou online with your friends.  Even if you start in the same location & hunt the same species repeatedly, no two animals you kill will be identical & no two hunts will be the same.\n\nAdding to the replayability in theHunter are Competitions, Missions, Achievements, & Skills.  There is at least one Competition available every day for each species, most often lasting a day or two each.  There are also 250 different Missions available.  These are optional, but now earn you a currency called gm$, which can be spent on some consumable items, such as scent eliminator spray.  You can also increase your Hunter score by earning Achievements, which are mostly earned through killing x number of species or x number of kills with each weapon.  You also increase your skills along the way, making you better at tracking & spotting game.  An expert tracker can tell the sex of the animal, along with good estimates of the track’s age & the weight of the animal, while an expert spotter can give you a really good estimate of the animal’s score.\n\nDeveloper/Community:  This is easily the best gaming community that I have ever had the pleasure of playing & communicating with.  The developers are actively involved in the Forums, and allow the community to make suggestions for future content.  They send out surveys regularly & then deliver the content that the community wants.  The community also hosts their own competitions that pay out significantly more than the official ones.\n\nSpecial Events:  theHunter throws out some pretty cool special events for certain holidays.  Sometimes, it’s just a special item (see Xmas beanie or St Patty’s Day hat) but sometimes it can be weeks’ long competitions that award guns or special trophies that are only awarded during that time.\n\nGraphics:  All in all, the game is absolutely beautiful, with nice water & weather effects.  Inside 200m the game is breathtaking.  The graphics do show their weakness if you’re zooming in with binoculars or a scope beyond 250m or so.  That is an engine issue, which I will talk about below.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nDated Game Engine:  The biggest weakness in theHunter is it’s dated game engine.  Specifically, the draw range of animals & most objects is limited to somewhere around 250m.  While the game boasts realistic ballistics & has beautiful scenery, that immersion is broken when you reach the summit of a mountain in Hammerfel and can’t spot animals on the opposite mountain.  You see, due to the limited nature of the engine, the game doesn’t draw those animals.  They exist, but you can’t see them until they come inside that 250m range.\n\nCost:  I personally don’t agree with this being a weakness, but I’ve been around theHunter long enough to know that most do view this as an area of concern.  First, let me say that the “Free to Play” is extremely limiting, and it should be.  I wish they wouldn’t even market it this way, as it gives people the wrong impression from the outset.  The bottom line is the game offers you a ton of content, much of which is not necessary, but costs money.  You can hunt every species in the game with the basic single shot shotgun that can be purchased with your gm$ earned through Missions, you can spend a little extra for gold engraved shotguns & rifles, or you can land somewhere in between.\n\nPurchasing the Trailrunner membership is easily the best bet for the new player, giving you all you need to hunt every species on every map for a year for $43.99, and is my advice for anybody that is just starting out.  If you still want to play after that year has expired, then in my opinion, it’s well worth the money to extend your membership.\n\nOVERALL:\ntheHunter is an addictive blend of hunting simulation & gaming, offering high replayability through randomly generated animals, enormous maps, variety in hunting methods & species.  You always have a carrot to chase, whether it’s finding that next trophy animal, looking for rare variations, trying to win competitions, reach the leaderboards & hall of fame, or completing achievements, missions, and increasing your skills.  If you can afford the Trailrunner ($43.99) membership and don’t mind the slower playstyle of a hunting simulation, then I wouldn’t hesitate to pick this game up.\n\n\n\n\n","June 13, 2014","true","302.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Want to shoot some other kind of deer? 10 bucks. Want to shoot a rabbit? Sorry your starter rifle isn't permitted, how about a shotgun with birdshot for 5 bucks? There is an ingame currency that you can earn doing "missions" but that is only usable to buy limited use lures and ammunition. Weapons? Real money. Clothing? Bags? Scopes? Your credit card please.

The graphics are extremly dated, there is a hard render limit of a few hundred feet after which animals are invisible, the animations and sounds are sloppy, gunplay mediocre at best, small selection of weapons and ammo and it is missing many key features of other games such as being able to rest your weapon on anything (how can you not have this in a hunting game?!), bullet cams, whatever you could hope for.\n\nDon't waste your precious time with this unless you have some autistic need to crouch through blurry forests for hours and shoot at pixelated deer and too much disposable income.

You can't have permanent licenses. You can buy membership to have all licenses for 3 - 6 - 12 months.\n-You can hunt animals only with the right rifles, meaning if you buy the license for Bear hunting but you don't have a weapon that's good for it then you can't hunt it.\n-F2P = license to hunt Mule Deer and Rabbit, 1 weapon with which you can hunt Mule Deer but not Rabbit. Unlimited ammo for that weapon, a scope and a Mule Deer "caller" ( idk how to call it i'm not native english )\n-You need to buy ammos for weapons. Meaning if you buy a shotgun then you need to buy it's ammos.

Or in other words: a stealth fps in a rl setting. The 10 maps range from arctic to arid climate. You can hunt 30 different animals form bisons to ducks and rabbits. You can use over 50 different weapons (rifles, handguns, shotguns, bows / crossbows and muzzleloaders). There´s a lot of equipment like different clothing, lures, callers, feeders, tree-stands and even dogs at your disposal.\nIt´s entirely up to you what you want to do and how you want to play. You can just hunt for fun - or watch animals and enjoy the scenery. You can hunt together with others (as host or on your friends maps). You can try to improve your hunterscore to impress fellow hunters (by hunting a lot of animals with different weapons). You can join competitions and try to win some trophies (or even in game money). You can join various events like christmas hunts ... or do the missions and earn some ingame money that way.\nIs it a free game?\nYes! No! ... ;)  The most negative reviews are related to that question and the pay system. Here are the facts: You can download the game and play it for free. You´ll be playing as a guest. Guests have limited rights. You´ll get one rifle and a shotgun. You have a guest-license to hunt rabbits, pheasants and whitetail deer. All other animals are off limits. When you try to shoot them you´ll get a message "you need a license for that" and your rifle is blocked for that shot.\nPay to win?\nNo! Yes! ... ;) The answer depends completely on the "win-condition". If you join a competition "highest-scoring whitetail deer" as a guest you could easily win it without any further equipment. The limiting factor is you game-time and luck. If you look at other competitions like "most turkey in 24h" you might have to invest in special equipment in order to win. But since all competitors will use the same equipment there´s no way to buy a win in that competition either. Non-equipped players are just factically excluded from the trophies. If you want to play in an ice-hockey league in rl, you´d have to buy the equipment. Would you call that pay to win? I think "pay to participate in some activities" would be more correct.","January 27","true","028.9"," 28 of 51 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","28","51","4","1"

Well, as soon as you get in the game you realize that you dont really have much to do, you can only hunt 2 animals and you get only 1 weapon, unless you pay that is, and this isnt some easy payment, you need to pay for guns, tents, and well, everything, and on top of that you would also need to pay for membership.

I'll give you my opinion of the game.\n\nTextures - 7/10\nTextures are reasonable for an open-world game, but could be better.\n\nScripting/Execution/AI - 7/10\nI'll give it descent credit because the AI is kind of detailed, but does glitch occasionally.\n\n3D Models & Art - 8/10\nThe 3D modellers for this game put a lot of work into the models, which I appreciate as a game developer myself.\n\nGameplay - ?/10\nYour opinion on this game's gameplay is very dependant on your playing style and your style of game. If you play games like Call of Duty or Team Fortress than you probably won't enjoy it all that much, but if you prefer slower-paced games like Minecraft, 7 Days to Die, or like Farming Simulator, you probably will enjoy it lots. But that's just my interpretation. On another note, this game can also be incredibly boring. You could be tracking an animal for three hours and only find their feces. But that's where the slower-paced gamers come into play. If you like to play games with your friends, than I HIGHLY recommend grabbing a couple of friends and getting into a game together. It gets a lot better if you have some friends with you.\n\nFeatures - 0.5/10\nIf you've played this game before reading this review than you probably know what I'm talking about. The per month fee that you have to pay to play this game is rediculous. Sure, the game is labeled as free, but in reality all you get is a really, REALLY limited demo of the game. In this demo you get to explore about 5% of the games full map, get one weapon, and you can only hunt a small number of animals. Like one or two. Once you think about it, you end up paying like WAY more for this "free" game than any other game if you are going to play it long-term. It's $15.99 for three months of minimum game features. You can pay more for some more weapons and gear, and EVEN more for what should've been offered with the original copy of the game. And even if you don't want to get into this game long term, you can pay more actual money for face-camos and things like that and you only get about 10 uses for $0.99.\n\nOverall - 2.25/10\nThis game could have been incredibly succesfull and entertaining if there wasn't some scam of a fee. I understand that they want to make money for their work, but it would have been a better idea to charge maybe $10.00 or $15.00 for the full game. If you like slower-paced games and you wanted to pay $15.00 for 3 months of partial features, or nothing at all for a demo. I do not recommend this game to anybody unless you have a few friends that are willing to pay the fee as well as you.","October 29, 2014","false","10.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As an avid hunter, I find it exciting to explore new places and hunt different animals that I may never have the chance to in real life.\n\nOn the downside, it is very expensive to hunt different animals. Ducks for example, you need to buy a shotgun, ammo, camoflauge, decoys, calls, blinds, and a dog to be efficient at hunting them. This could add up to hundreds of real dollars. It would be nice if they would make it possible to make in-game currency through certain tasks where you could buy all of the items with it. They do have an in game-currency, but you can only buy consumables with it and it is difficult to aquire.\n\noverall, 8/10","March 30","true","181.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's not so so much free to play as it is a demo tbh but a good enough demo to get me hooked.\n\nCosts involved are pretty minimal. With a memberships (about £3 or £4) a month you are allowed to hunt any animal and between the free rifle and free shotgun you have the capability to kill anything in the game except Bison which would require buying a more powerful weapon.\n\nA lot of the negative reviews are all moaning about licences but hey lets face facts here if these guys can't afford  less than a pound per week for membership then they have bigger things to worry about than computer games tbh.\n\nOn to the actual game,\n\nPros\n+Great feeling of being out in the wild and each reserve is styled on real world hunting locations,\n+Animal behaviour is well modelled\n+loads of missions to and competitions running every day in which you can earn ingame currency. (Free players can enter comps too)\n+The RPG elements of your skills works really well as you increase your spotting, tracking and shooting skill you get real benefits from the not just higher numbers on a stats page.\n+Really nice and helpful community especially on the official forums.\n\nSo what are you waiting for?, get started hunting now and keep in your mind that's it's free to try but to get a fuller game experience you will need a membership costing a few quid (£3-£4) a month.","March 27","true","246.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

YES...you need a membership to hunt all animals, but you can try the game for free  and hunt muledeer, with a rifle they give you for free. If you like the game then fine, you can order a 3,6 or yearly memberships, and its fairely cheep. The bigger the memberhsip you order the more free stuff you get. I ordered a 6 month membership and got everything I think I'd need to play forever, in guns anyways. If you have to collect everythign ingame yes it gets expensive but why do it? A shotgun can hunt anything...ANYTHING IN GAME ...because it has 3 kinds of ammo.\n\nthere are fancy guns with ingraving for people who need those, but never for free..doh....and several types of bows and arrows and sights scopes, etc and on and on...but you don't need all that. For less than the cost of lottery tickets you can play all year long, and hunt every animal you ever wanted in  great detailed forests and on cold snowly mountains. No...its not all free, but trying it out is, so try it or leave it, no problem...but its a good game, just not what many people hoped for.","February 15, 2015","true","664.6"," 55 of 105 people (52%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","52","55","105","10","0"

The graphics are just purely amazing and also the gameplay is really well done. You can decide yourself whether you want to walk around and sneak up to animals and take pictures of them or want to go hunting.\nThere are several different weapons and you can pick one for yourself depending on which one works best for you. There is a restriction of weapons though, while you can kill some animals with a certain weapon, you can't kill others with the same weapon. But this exists in the real hunting world as well, so if you've got experience in hunting already, this won't be new for you.\nIn my opinion theHunter is definitely worth the money and I will continue paying to play it.","June 26, 2014","true","194.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You get in the game and learn how to hunt and play. You finally find a dear or anything and try to shoot it. It then tells you that you need to have a membership to hunt this animal. A membership cost money and is very expensive for what you are getting. From my experience this is a pay to play game. This game would bor me if i continued playing it.\n\nIs it hard to run: No a positive is it is really easy to run and you should not have any problems if you have a decent computer. You dont need a titan to run this xD. There are settings to turn graphics down though if you do have problems.\n\nConclusion: There are little pluses in this game the truth is it is not free to play and if you want to proceed or get anything done that is fun in the game you will find your self paying 30$ or more.","October 5, 2014","false","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can't hunt anything besides Mule Deer and Cottontail Rabbits, making it where your limited to do nothing but just get "You don't have a lisencse to hunt this animal" over and over. Litteraly you can't track anything or do anything without having to pay. Atleast make people pay for the game and get stuff rather than claimaing that is free and making people waste their time downloading a game that isn't free. The game itself is pretty fun but when you can do anything without paying its terrible. I would not recommend playing this game past for any time longer than a hour.

If you want to unlock new stuff, you have to pay real money. Playing this game for a year is only slightly less expencive than hunting IRL. And I can't emphazise how slow the character is! The running/walking thing is ok, but the aiming, sighting, and operating of the weapons are so increadible slow! I've seen people that never fired a weapon before do it twice as fast.

The fact that is multiplayer is also a fun bonus. The false advertising rubbed me in all the wrong ways however; this game is not free to play (unless you like a hiking simulator dressed up as a hunting simulator). To actually hunt in this game you have to spend real money on licenses, guns, etc. I'm hoping in the future that this game will actually allow you to hunt a bit more without spending money (or just costing money right off the bat).

You can't hunt anything besides Mule Deer and Cottontail Rabbits, making it where your limited to do nothing but just get "You don't have a lisencse to hunt this animal" over and over. Litteraly you can't track anything or do anything without having to pay. Atleast make people pay for the game and get stuff rather than claimaing that is free and making people waste their time downloading a game that isn't free.

I really dig it. Walking trough the woods. with a pair of buddies. tracking an animal together. listening to animals calls trying to find the one you're looking for. But. Theres a big but.\n\nThe buissness model is simly awful. this should not be in the free to play section. but in a new section called Free to Pay. As the game will try to squeeze every penny it can out of you. What you do get for free. is a low caliber bolt action hunting rifle. With unlimited ammunition. a pair of binoculars. and a little bit of camping supplies for fast travel (consumables) The game features two currencys. Quite usual for the Free to play market. Yet also has a subscription! And one does not grant you the olther! Subscription or "Membership" Will grant you a "License" To hunt all animals. But the rifle you start with is not "Ethical" for all of them. thus you will have to spend even more money to actually take part in competitons. or get score for theese animals\n\nEM$: A currency used to get absolutly everything the ratio is 100 EM$ = Dollar. But the smallest package you can buy is 500. for 5 dollars. the larger packages save you a little bit of cash. EM$ Is the currency used to buy about anything. Clothing. weapons and so on. Yet a single item will cost you 3-7 dollars. For just a single item. "Happy Camper tents" Will cost you 550 EM. But there is no 550 Package. Forcing you to spend more money!\n\nWhile there are competitions in game with EM Prizes. To get to them. you will most likely have to spend money. Again!\n\nGM$: An in game currency. You might think that you get GM from hunting animals. And you'd be wrong. All you get is score. in a phatetic attempt to squeeze more money out of you. GM is earned by compleating missions. theese have a finite number. and most of them require you to use a peticular weapon or hunt an animal you will not have acsess too. without opening your wallet up.\n\nAnd do not ague that the microtransaction system lets you have "Choice" As it does not. The design of the game. maps. liceances. all of that is under the influance to squeeze more MONEY out of you wallet. And it will not stop untill you have everything. And once you do. They will still try and squeeze money out of you on a monthly basis.\n\nEIther have microtransactions. or a subscription. having both is disgusting.\n","June 17, 2014","false","38.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Now I've got a much beefier PC and decided to take the plunge and buy a membership. $54(CAD) for the Trailrunner starter pack (Best deal IMO) gives you a very nice selection of weapons/equipment, and all licenses for a year.\n\nAll I can say is wow. I'm not dissappointed at all with my purchase. I love the fact that this game is 6 years old and still amazing. At first I wasn't a fan of the whole "pay-to-play" sales model, but I completely understand why the dev's did it that way.\n\nIf this game was a "buy once and keep playing" type of game it would have been released in 2009, and stayed in basically the same shape it was is at the time of release.\n\nInstead, we've got a game that is constantly being updated, even 6 years after it's initial release, and that's due to the fact that the devs are still seeing an income from the game, which allows them to spend time/resourses updating it, and adding fresh new content, as well as fix bugs and add new features over time.\n\nIn my opinion, that makes it worth the $34(CAD) I need to keep paying in order to hunt all the animals after my licenses expire.\n\nDon't get me wrong, if I decide to not pay next year, I can still keep all of the weapons/equipment that came with my initial purchase and use them to hunt Mule Deer and Cottontails (I believe those are the only free animals), but I will definitely be buying my licenses again next year.\n\nI would even consider buying a higher priced "lifetime license" if the devs ever thought to release something like that, but I understand why they decided to go with the current business model.\n\nNow, if only they would do something similar with theHunter:Primal so it could be anywhere close to as amazing of a game as this is.","April 8, 2015","true","82.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You can unlock the ability to hunt other animals but it's only for specific amounts of time, which when it runs out, you have to buy AGAIN. This game is a money pit and NOT worth the cost to make it fun.

It's actually kind of fun to run around, explore, etc. It reminds me of STALKER, only filled with deer and rednecks instead of muties and Russians.\n\nBut you get nothing. You get absolutely nothing as a starting player. The only thing you can hunt are mule deer and rabbits, but you can't even kill the rabbits with your rifle. Great decision there. The clothes you start with are vastly inferior to the ones you can only get with money. Which would be fine, but you can't upgrade at all without money. At all. You can't get any weapons, clothes, etc.\n\nThe game says you can 'earn' currency by doing surveys and such. This is an absolute load. Every single site it links you to is sketchy as hell. Some of the 'programs' it wants you to download are blatant viruses that only an idiot would use. Nice. Of all the offers I went through ( most of them viruses or dead links that did nothing ), I managed to complete one. I got nothing. The currency never came.\n\nEven if you pay for the game, it's so damn stingy that you're basically going to need to spend money to keep playing. It's absolutely baffling just how much this company hates it's potential players and wants to squeeze every last cent out of them. This isn't free to play. This is a demo. It shouldn't even be in the free to play section.\n\nThe only reason you should even consider this game is if you want something to space out to while you're listening to an audiobook or doing something important.","June 16, 2014","false","16.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

With that said, it's incredible. Two notes on this work -- one, there are few games with better gunplay and two, it is the best hunting game (simulator?) available. theHunter has it all. Unfortunately, most of the content is gated.\n\nWant to hunt mallards? Well, you're going to need to buy a set of decoys, a blind, and a nice shotgun in addition to the license. Win boar hunting tournaments? That demands use of a hog feeder (and the feed), in addition to a tree stand for an optimal experience. And that's the key -- optimal. You do not need anything other than the permitted gun, ammo, and license to hunt a particular animal, HOWEVER, you'll have to work much harder to win competitions or have a successful hunt.\n\nIf none of this seems like it will dissuade you, and you've some cash to make your experience easier, it's well worth the value for what you get.","December 29, 2014","true","216.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It is a good game with some very nice hunting. But I cannot say it is a great game. There is long walks with nothing to shoot. I have had 3 hour game sessions where I only found one red fox and nothing else despite the fact that I have traversed the entire map and sat for a good while at a stand. Sometimes, there is just a lul in things to shoot. While yes this realistic, can't say it is very fun for a game.\n\nAlso, it is very, very expensive to play this game. I can tell you it is almost no fun to play the one map and hunt only the mule deer and ignore all the other tracks and sounds you hear. It is frustrating. Also you can't create multiplayer games and you can't always find multiplayer games that you can hunt in. So it is singleplayer for you. This might actually be a better idea because if you do play multiplayer with strangers, people like to follow you and make lots of noise. It can be maddning to finally find that mule deer, get your sights on him, and then have the guy that had been following you run up, pull up his gun, shoot, and completely miss scaring the deer away and anything else that might be around.\n\nI just think you should be able to do more without spending money or at least have more in-game ways to earn money and buy licenses. I like this game but I can't afford it.","July 20, 2014","false","10.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

It is very interesting for those who love hunting simulations. It's realistic, the environment you are in is important in relation to the animal you are hunting and if you miss a move, they're gone but you still can find them later with the track they leave behind. Also, there are a lot of places to go and the maps are big enough to trip trough forests and water.\n\nWhy don't I recommend this game?\nBecause if you want a good equipment, you need to spend a lot of real money or spend some time on third-party pages (eather you earn a little or not... yes, some links does not simply reward you). Well, you earn some virtual cash when you finish a mission but, you can not even buy a thing that is worth your work and time in-game. I don't even know how dare they call this game a F2P. When you are a beginner and don't want to give a few bucks, the only thing that can be done is tracking or kill one of the 18 species (you must have licenses for them ->money) with a single default rifle and there are a lot of missions to do but you can't complete them because you don't really want to spend your own money on that...\n\nAgain, it's a very interesting game but the store and monetary system in-game made me sick...","August 28, 2014","false","5.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

Players can enter different teams in a multiplayer game and compete with eachother.\nThe graphics are also outstanding and it's a really immersive experience and definitely the best hunting simulator to date.\nI've been playing this since early 2012 and will keep playing for years i'm sure.\nIf I had to give it a grade it would be around 95/100, there's no perfect 100/100 game, every game has its flaws, no matter how small they may be.

There is a lot of skill involved but at the same time the huntermate  and large population of animals help avoid boredom. Yes it is a "Free to Play" game that requires some payment to access all the features, but it really helps the game grow. They are constantly adding new features, animals and maps. The amount of huntable animals AND maps has almost doubled since I started playing this game two years ago. Anyone here who is giving negative reviews is doing so because apparently they do not understand the concept of what "Free to Play" is. Sorry if you couldn't figure it out before downloading the game, but seriously negative reviews should be reserved for the game itself not the fact that it warned you beforehand that it would require microtransactions.. This game is great if you love  hunting, just expect to put a little bit of money into it at some point if you want the full experience. Even so, guests now have more access then before and with GM$ and buyable liscences guests can still end up hunting anything (just takes a bit more work is all).","January 31","true","38.5"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

The GP sees a duck, and asks the Physician if it was a duck.\nThe Physician unsure and asks for a second opinion, whether it was a common duck, a wood duck, a water fowl, a pheasant or a quail,\nThen the Surgeon shoots five birds with six shells. BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, … BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, Handing the remains to the Pathologist, he orders “Here, see if you can find a duck.”\n\nYou are the hunter, you have your basic rifle, plenty of ammunition, deer call, binocs, and a handi-dandy pocket hunter.\n\nSoon you learn that the HunterMate can help you to track animals and the red semicircular and dome shapes on the ground are actually animal tracks. So out you go from the camp… You want a mule deer, not the female but the big male, to hang his antlers on your wall. You hear a call, but (according to the HunterMate) it’s a whitetail deer. Forget that, so eventually you find a few female mule deer and you follow them down to the Bayfront of what (I imagine) is a wilderness of Washington State. There is a beautiful scenario, a male mule deer standing on the waterfront, but you are too far out cause your rifle is shaking around. He spooks and flees, so you track him for a while, then you lose his trail, damn.\n\nSo you go up into the hills, and you spot another two mule deer bucks. Which one is bigger you ask yourself. It is raining, but you don’t let that put you off. Then you lose both of them, oh dear. So you go back down to the cliffs and spot another few females and you follow them for a while before you lose interest and go home.\n\nNext time in the camp, the weather is good, you find the range so you pop off a few rounds and hit the targets out to 100 meters. Full of confidence you head out again and repeat the above scenario. But every once-in-a-while…. You spot the mule deer buck and he hasn’t seen you yet so you move in quietly controlling your breath for the hunt. Then you get into position and he looks up at you - the Hunter, and you take the shot, he drops and you move in inspect your kill. Is he still there? Yep your bullet went through his lung, heart and spine from 43.6 m. Triumph! You think “Thank God the animal didn’t suffer”.\n\nSometimes you miss “The Shot” and the animal does suffer a lot, blood everywhere and when you find him tired and confused, and he looks up at you, his eyes pleading to end the suffering, well -perhaps some psychiatric counselling may help, you not the animal.\n\nWhat I don’t understand, is why the ammunition is free. Everything else is pay to use: licences, weapons and supplies, clothes, etc.  You should have to pay for your ammo! Something like say 30 bucks for a thousand rounds for your favourite rifle, should last a while might even allow discounts on your other supplies. This is a great game about hunting and that really captures the spirit of hunting, and getting that one perfect shot.\n\nThe Multiplayer game is about camaraderie, working together in teams of hunters to improve your hunt. Or whatever you say it is - such as a hunting competition…\n\nGood game. I have played over 26 hours and taken only 5 shots with three kills, plus I “accidently” shot a rabbit. Honest, Doc I was just checking the scope and the gun went off.\nIs it worth paying an annual fee to hunt more animals with a better variety of weapons and equipment? I don’t know I have not done that yet but it is tempting.\n\nAnyways I am off to go and get a first aid kit because I witnessed a feral hog maul a good mate to death, not pretty.","April 22, 2015","true","271.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","11","20","6","0"

You can do objectives that gives you in game money, but this only buys you scents, lures, bait, pretty much consumables.\n\nIn all honesty if you like hunting games this is the game for you as long as you have a good $50+ to spend on getting guns, clothing, calls, stands, sites/scopes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeremyhwilson/recommended/253710/","jeremyhwilson","Nightmare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeremyhwilson/","27 products in account","I have been into PC hunting games since the mid 90’s. Then in 1997 Deer Hunter brought it all to 3D. I have owned and played every game in that series from Deer Hunter in 1997 up to Deer Hunter Tournament in 2008 also Trophy Hunter 2003. Then I caught word of a new revolutionary hunting simulation that was in development called theHunter. They have taken PC hunting simulation into the next generation with its release back in 2009. Players have 7 large hunting reserves to choose from that range from open fields to deciduous and evergreen forest also from spring/summer environments to fall and winter. Free to play members can hunt mule deer and cottontail rabbit (2 of the 18 species available) on 2 different reserves. theHunter is new to Steam and a lot of people who seem to think that the gaming industry revolves around Steam also think that if it’s new on Steam then it is new everywhere. This is not the case. theHunter went live sometime back in 2009. Avalanche created a child company called Expansive Worlds solely to further develop theHunter. This shows that the company is passionate about this game and truly believes in its success.\nFirst Impression: I admit before entering the game for the first time I had my doubts about it seriously being much better than the Deer Hunter series gameplay wise and graphically. WOW! Was I ever wrong? Once I wondered away from the starting lodge and into the woods I found myself inspecting all the elements of the environment and vegetation. Astounded at the amount of progress that was made graphically for a hunting simulation. Then I hear a mule deer buck call off in the distance breaking me from my trance. Once that bucked stepped into view the rest is history. Here I am now in 2014 still actively playing the game nearly every day since its release in 2009 currently with 1057 hours of gameplay time.\nFree to play: theHunter is Free to Play. This is a very touchy subject for players. It does have 2 species on 2 reserves that are free to hunt. The mule deer and the Cottontail Rabbit can be hunted on 2 different reserves after completing missions for GM$ to buy the single shot 12 gauge shotgun. The downside is that you will also need to purchase the ammunition. My opinion is that if it can be purchased by EM$ or GM$ then ammunition should be unlimited. theHunter does offer very limited free content of the game. On the other side you have to take into account that the game is continuously in development with a team devoted to it. Which requires a steady flow of income.\nMembership: theHunter offers 3 basic memberships for 3, 6 and 12 months. 3 package memberships for 3 (Wayfarer), 6 (Pathfinder) and 12 (Trailrunner) months, each with a selection of equipment. Many argue that the cost of the game is high. Here I strongly disagree. In reality even with the membership cost and further micro transactions the game does not cost any more than a normal gaming entertainment budget. Most subscription based online games cost anywhere from $10-19/m, a cost of $120-144/y. Even console games that are released regularly will cost $45-60 for each new game and are released about once a year. The cheapest basic membership at theHunter costs $9.99 for 3 months which is $3.33/m or $39.96/y. A nice difference versus paying $45-144/y. Now take the Trailrunner membership, theHunter’s most expensive option. It is 12 months of membership and starter items for $49.99 which is $4.17/m. At least $5 cheaper than most subscription games per month and at least $70/y. Once your 12 month Trailrunner membership runs out you can renew with a 12 month basic membership for $34.99 which is $2.92/m. That is atleast $10 cheaper than a new console game or atleast $85 cheaper than 1 year for most other sub based games. The amount difference you saved playing theHunter versus the newest console game or most other sub based games can be used to buy any extra items you may want to spice up your inventory with. You can either play theHunter cheaper than most other games, just about the same cost or even more. It is all up to you as a player to decide.\nWeapons: There are 15 rifles, 5 handguns, 6 shotguns, 4 bows, a crossbow and a muzzleloader. All have scopes and sights that can be fitted to them. You really only need 1-2 weapons to ethically hunt every species. Buying more just adds variety to your arsenal. So do not be alarmed by these posts saying you need $300 to purchase all weapons. All of the weapons are not necessary to have but an option.\nClothing: Some clothing is purely cosmetic meaning that it offers no such advantage while other clothing such as the Basic Set variants, Boone & Crockett, Army Set, Trapper Set, Doc Monsignor Set and the Ghillie Suit offer different advantages over certain or all species for different types of vegetation. Those advantages are Scent reduction, Visual reduction and Sound reduction. Not every set is a must have. Hunting close range is where these specialized clothing sets have the biggest advantage. When purchasing clothing sets I can highly recommend the Bundles section in the store for a discounted price.\nEquipment: Here you have a good variety of items at your disposal. Optics such as binoculars, range finders and a compact digital camera. Consumables such as wind indicator, scent eliminator, camping supplies (for fast travel to tents) and first aid kits. theHunter does have some dangerous game that will charge you. These are moose, feral hog, wild boar, black bear and brown bear. If attacked you will need a first aid kit to continue or you must travel to the nearest lodge or tent (if you have camping supplies).\nPlay modes: theHunter has Single player and Multiplayer. You can create a multiplayer game for you and up to 7 of your friends to hunt together. There are missions you can complete for GM$. These can be completed in both single player and multiplayer.\nCompetitions: theHunter offers competitions for every species in the game, except for Cottontail Rabbit. Competitions for new species are introduced a short time after the species release. Competitions are for both Single and Multiplayer. They all offer a small amount of EM$ and a trophy for finishing in 1st, 2nd or 3rd . Special events are run giving awards for the top 10 finishers. During certain holidays special run events or missions will be run. There are also private hosted competitions by members of theHunter, myself included. These generally are listed in the Competition forum at theHunter forums. These offer better pay-outs for the top finishers than the official competitions. Some useful places to find these private competitions are here: http://thehuntercomps.se/, {LINK REMOVED}Derpy Competitions and White Out Hunting[www.whiteouthunting.enjin.com].\nThe Community: The player community is very friendly and helpful. Players have devoted a lot of personal time into the forums, theHunter Wiki and other fan pages. Theres alot helpful game information in the forums, the wiki, guides, videos and some even do live streaming of the game.\nThe Development Team: Last but definitely not least the development team. This group of men and women have done an outstanding job bringing us the best hunting simulation there is and will continue to do so. They keep us updated weekly as to what is happening behind the scenes. Each week there is also a game update. This can be bug fixes or larger updates such as new items, species or reserves. Proof that our support is being put to good use.\nI hope this will help you to decide to stay and help support a great game despite many negative reviews it has received from the Steam community. Use what is given as free content to help you further decide if this game is worth it. Every one of the 1000+ hours and the money I have invested in the game has been well worth it.\n","June 8, 2014","true","598.8"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

No questions, it looks great, it plays smooth and is realistic!\n\nIt does not have a long and hard learing cruve, you have a "Hunter mate" that can tell you what tracks it is that you just found and tell you where the track is leading. For me it took like 3 - 4 hours to really get the hang of the game.\n\nNow, as a "free" user you only get to hunt (i think its 2 not sure) 2 animals and you get 2 weapons. You get one hunting reserve that is huge. If you want to play the other 7 reserves and hunt all the 18 animals you need a subscribtion. When i started playing this game i first played as a free user and hunted for 1 hour per day just to see if i enjoyed it that much that i would like to pay for it.\n\nAnd i did! So i bought the 300kr (29 euros approx) package that gave me 6 months sub, a ♥♥♥♥ tons of weapons and equpiment. When my sub was gone, i still had all my weapons and equimpent left, so i just bought another 3 months for 80kr (8-9 euros) and started to play again.\n\nThere is a lot of stuff you can buy ingame, for example callers, baits and camo. I have used the regular outfit for more than a year and been able to hunt in every reserve and any animal with out problem. Its just for looks and making hunting a little bit easier (even though i think its funnier to just follow tracks and shoot them, some perfeer to sit near an open field with a caller and wait for somthing to show up).\n\nAnyway should you get this game? Install it and try as a free user. If you liked it, I recommend the 30 euro package, it gives you (in my opinion) the best rifle and some equipment.\n","June 4, 2014","true","25.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

First if you are impatient this game is not for you. If you crave constant action then you probably won't like this. If you don't want to spend any money then this is not for you. If you like to hunt, enjoy the reward of patiently stalking and killing something, have some money to spend; then you will probably like this.\n\nI'll comment first about the gameplay then about the pricing of the "free to play" in the second/third paragraph.\n\nThe game has a slower pace to it, I'll give an example of a typical hunt for me. I spawn at a lodge and load up my equipment in my inventory; I'm hunting whitetail and maybe turkey today so I want my shotgun for versatility and bow for stealth, I could take my .243 rifle but I prefer the shotgun. It's early in the morning and I can see the misty dew settling on the grass plains. The air feels fresh as I slowly wander about looking for my sign. A red tracker mark over some footprints point me in the way of a deer and I walk after it. I want to rush and sprint but I must be patient lest I spook it away. Droppings indicate to me how far it might be, more footprints help me close in on it when I hear the grunt of a buck. I crouch down and sit. I could stalk it down, but I'd rather the deer come to me. I pull out my deer call and mimic the sound of a doe to the open air. A call from the buck responds in kind. The bucks grunts get louder and louder, I know which way he's coming from but there is too much brush in the way. I lay down amongst some grass to make my profile even smaller and wait for him to reveal himself. At last I spot him standing tall and he calls out for the doe in my trap. He is still too far out so I maneuver onto a small hill for a better vantage while he gently and slowly walks in. I watch him closely and load a shell of buckshot into my shotgun, he suspects nothing. He has a decent set of antlers, nothing special, but he carries himself as a king. Still, I know my role as assassin well and wait for him to close in  enough to see the grain of his antlers. Finally he stops before me and raises his head high as I hold my breath to steady the shot. Silence tells him nothing until a cacophonous blast reverberates through the air and scares away any nearby animals from the king as he falls to his knees and lands his face in the dirt. I pull out my huntermate, snap a trophy shot, and claim my work. Walking away I eject the spent shell and load another, there's plenty out there yet on the reserve today.\n\nThe game looks pretty good and I can tell they put quite a bit of work into the environment. There are a few bugs that happen in multiplayer but otherwise the game itself is very good.\n\nNow for the reveal of the abnormal market. Since this appears to be a niche game, they have decided to get it paid for in a way, I think, most steam gamers aren't accustomed to. The free-to-play isn't, its more of a demo really. When you first start out you can only hunt mule dear and rabbit with your one .243 rifle, and shooting rabbit with your rifle will give you disqualifying kills. If you want to hunt everything then you can get, at minimum, a 10$ membership which is good for 3 months. On top of that you'll want calls, other weapons, equipment, which all cost real money.\n\nTo further the currency explaination: The game has paid for currency (em$) and earned currency (gm$). Em$ is a cent to cent ratio, 100em$ is $1.00. Almost every weapon is 4-6 dollars, yeah, I know. Each call is over a dollar, clothes costs a few bucks (don't buy individually, get bundles), stands, blinds, other items are all going to be 4 dollars or so. In other words, you can easily spend more than a triple-A $60 title. In other words, if you put money down, spend smart (research stuff) and make sure you're getting what you want.\nGm$ are earned by doing missions and are terribly underutilized and overpriced in the store. I do enjoy doing the missions, a little extra goal and challenge to a hunt, not too hard to accomplish. With gm$ you can buy one single shot shotgun for 6200 (I have it, I like it) otherwise you can get sprays to attract animals or bait and that is pretty much it. You would think at least some clothing but nope. You can get animal licenses individually with gm$ but its priced so high for a beginner its not worth it (1800 gm$ for 1 day of turkey hunting). I sort of understand why everything is so expensive compared to other games but I don't agree with it.\n\nA little more about my experience that may be helpful. I hunted with a friend who picked up items so I didn't have to get everything, he got a bunch of mallard gear, I got a bunch of geese gear. I only hunt with the .243 rifle (given for free) which is good for most deer and coyote and fox. A 12 gauge shotgun, which can shoot anything except birds with slugs and birdshot can shoot those (you get three kinds of shells and it replenishes for every trip). So yes, with one shotgun you can shoot any animal in the game, given somewhat limited range. Finally a compound bow which is great for stealth and when you have multiple animals coming as it won't scatter them like a gun. So my method is very up close and personal usually but only took the purchase of the bow; the pump-action shotgun came with a membership bundle. If you want to hunt big game with a rifle get something up in the .300 caliber range and you're good to go.\n\nSo as a result: Good game for patient gamers who have decent income. Bad game for someone looking for an actual free-to-play game like War Thunder or LoL and/or doesn't like somewhat realistic hunting. Of course you can always try it out yourself. Do the tutorials when you start it up (Hunt Now -> Tutorials) Also read up on the wiki (thehunterwiki.com) has a lot of useful information. If you do decide to get into the game and put down money. I recommend one of the membership bundles, you get a lot more than getting it individually.\n\nIf this review isn't helpful please comment why and I'll do my best to improve it with what you need to know.","June 22, 2014","true","362.1"," 58 of 113 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","58","113","0","7"

A lot of people gave this a bad review because non-premium people can't hunt many animals in the game.  Non-premuim like me can hunt "Mule Dears" and Rabbits I really don't mind that at all!  Even though lack of animals you can hunt it is still a very nice game,  this game makes you feel like you're in the woods hunting/camping.  I personaly love this game and I would recommend this to anyone.  overall this game is proabally a 10/10 for me.  I hope this review helped you!!! Try this game out for your self, you have nothing to loose it's "Free To Play".  I did not mind at all I think two species is very generous! Loggers point you can find tons of the animals their.  I've been a member for awhile now and I love it still my favorite game on steam. The Devs are nice and help ful they don't yell or get mad at people that trash talk this game.  theHunter is one of the best "Free To Play" Games on steam for me! well it is my favorite game even out of all my paid games.  In theHunter you won't be getting an adrenaline untill you actualy see an animal then thats when it gets very tense.  I use to play many Hunting games when I was a kid but this one here overtops all of the hunting games I played.  Another positive is the beatuifulness of this game it's so relaxing reminds me when I was in a cabin.  Just get the game and try it if you don't like it then it's fine but it's prob not your kind of game then.

This game makes me feel like I am actually hunting that nice big mule deer. But the game is not free to play. When you get it you are only allowed to hunt mule deer and rabbit in only one area of the game. If you want to hunt other animals you have to pay for licenses, and the weapons to hunt those animals.\n\nTo advertise a game like this as a free to play is wrong. It should be advertised as a free to win game as the only way to get that big whitetail, moose, or elk is to buy a membership, then spend cash for coins to buy bigger and better guns.\n\nI recommend the game if you like great graphics and the feeling of outdoors, but not as a hunting game. Buy one of Cabela's games. Everything is included and you don't have to spend over 200.00 to get great stuff.","October 9, 2014","false","41.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then I went off to try and hunt.\nFound a bunch of deer, yet every shot I took my gun lowered and I got a message saying I have no license.\nAfter a bit of investigating I found out all about the supposed licensing. The "free" part consists of 1 type of deer and a type of bird.\nWent and looked further and decided I'll try the $10US membership so I got all licenses.\nAfter that I went back and things went down hill. Spent quite a few hours playing and the more time went by the less animals I found. Some times I'd be following a track and suddenly the "huntermate" would turn me around or loop over the previously found track. Other time the track I was looking for wasn't actually in the direction I was pointed and other times it'd just go cold out of nowhere. Some "mate" that is.\nOn the way back to the camp I see a turkey out of nowhere and so shoot it, to which I get told off for an "unpermitted hit" for using the wrong ammo. So I leave and go to the shop to find all the ammo costs more real money along with every other item.\nGoing to uninstall this, and if I could I'd have my $10 back too.\nSteam should also remove the "free to play tag" since 99% isn't free.","October 2, 2014","false","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes it sucks you have to actually buy licenses and rifles and such but in this day and age you should expect it and compared to paying $30 for an arcade cabellas game every few months its worth it. The 3 month is $15 and that is crazy cheap for an online multiplayer game.\n\nAs for the game itself. The maps are beautiful and very detailed, most hunting games are either open fields or forrests that seem more like a crop or plantation. Wide selection of firearms and bows, you don't need every single one you can get one rifle and one shotgun and hunt everything in the game, or just one bow. The animals can be a challenge to track more so the trophy animals they are very skiddish as they should be.\n\nToo many people are focusing and giving bad reviews on the fact that this game isnt really "free". I have news for you. It is. You never have to buy the game. Yes you have to put a few bucks in here and there to get everything the game has to offer but you dont HAVE to do that if you don't want. Some people just like hunting mule deer... That is FREE... Ammo for the .243 is FREE, You want to go hunt whitetail then pay a couple bucks and get a license or pay $15 and get it for 3 months.\n\nIf this game does not suit you then go back to Cabellas games. They are great if you like to hunt like you are playing CoD and not actually hunting.","July 3, 2014","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are plenty of animals (with great behavioral mechanics), weapons, levels, and good ol' trophy kill satisfaction to keep you occupied for a long time.\n\nUnfortunately the pay-forever-to-play business model ruins it. They took it way too seriously with the word 'simulator', meaning it simulates everything, even the crap parts of real hunting like having to fork out real money for temporary hunting licences.\nThey argue that many people don't play a game for more than a year, hence the "justification" of having to pay the cost of a full-game every year. But I've been playing Deer Hunter 2005 since 2005 and thanks to this game's poor business model I'll still be playing it in 2015.

The Hunter gives you the opportunity to experience the journey, a complete hunting scenario: Listening out for calls, tracking, and observation, not just constantly providing a slurry of beautiful beasts to bludgeon.\n\nI believe the game suffers when informing new comers. I’d recommend checking out the wiki before jumping in as there are some rules for Guest players who haven’t purchased a membership regarding what you can hunt and where. I have all confidence in the Dev team though! They are constantly active and seem to value and utilise feedback. New content is always on the horizon whether it is new gear, weapons, species or reserves to hunt.

The UI looks crappy and movement seems to be much, much slower. If you think Im comparing it too much to Primal, then look at it this way. Movement is fairly slow in Primal, so in this one it feels like you are tip-toeing through the grass, even when you are running. Its also harmed by quite possibly the worst free 2 play business model I have ever seen. I just couldn't bring myself to play much of this game. However, I will say that when creating a profile with theHunter it is quite nice to pick an avatar for your character.\n\nPositive\n+ Character customisation\n\nNegative\n- Character Movement\n- Crappy looking UI\n- Hunting Licenses (Business Model)\n\nConclusionI feel quite sad for having had to leave this review, quite simply because I love theHunter: Primal so much, it makes me feel grateful that it turned out so good, even in early access.

The Hunter gives you the opportunity to experience the journey, a complete hunting scenario: Listening out for calls, tracking, and observation, not just constantly providing a slurry of beautiful beasts to bludgeon.\n\nI believe the game suffers when informing new comers. I’d recommend checking out the wiki before jumping in as there are some rules for Guest players who haven’t purchased a membership regarding what you can hunt and where. I have all confidence in the Dev team though! They are constantly active and seem to value and utilise feedback. New content is always on the horizon whether it is new gear, weapons, species or reserves to hunt. The game also boasts a strong community to hunt alongside or against in an interesting array of hunting challenges.","June 26, 2014","true","513.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite the game being extremely limited to nonpaying players as to what they may shoot, it does offer a good amount of activities to keep entertained. That being said, it does not limit its game world and what it contains, just bars one from registering harvests (term used by the game for collecting a kill). Regardless of the constraints, I find myself addicted to the gameplay, idyllic scenery and animated animals, which I continue going back to explore.\n\nThe game consists of exploring, tracking, harvesting and if one fails to down their quarry in the first shot, chasing. There are eighteen animals distributed around seven maps called reserves that anyone may explore. The maps are large enough to keep running into animals and not grow bored as one travels from one hunting spot to the other. Most of the fun is following tracks, spotting and then observing what you find. There are also missions one can complete to earn in-game currency (called Gm$ or 'gems'), and a good amount rewards just for tracking and spotting a listed animal or two.\n\nAs said before, the game is free-to-play, limiting nonpaying players to one gun and the ability to hunt all the mule deer they want. Although doing missions could land one with the in-game currency to afford a shotgun, allowing the hunting of cottontail rabbits. Sadly that is the extent of not paying for basic membership. The missions are also finite and some require weapons and hunting license bought with special in-game currency (Called Em$) which is different from money gained through missions.\n\nEven with these restrictions, I recommend giving it a try.","August 1, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The realistic aspect is not to far extreme where you find yourself waiting a whole day to bag and tag a single animal, but at the same time not at all arcade-y where you can gun down 5 deer in a matter of seconds. The pace of this game is rather rewarding is the sense of accomplishment when it come to the hunt.\n\nThe main complaint that many have is there price structure. Yes, it can get expensive purchasing all that is available for this game. In fact If I recall correctly that if you happen to buy everything all at once (not including consumables and a ammo), you are looking at about a $600 price tag.  Yes, a lot of money, but at the same time compare that to Train Simulator 2015 which holds a price tag well over double of theHunter for all of its DLC. This game should not be considered Free-To-Play, but rather Free-To-Test or simple know it as a Demo since you are only allowed to hunt 1 species of deer (Mule Deer) on 1 reserve (Loggers Point). Also some have stated this is a Pay-To-Win game. Far from it IMO. Buying the ingame equipment and such doesnt make you a better hunter than everyone else. You just have more options to hunt and hunt with. Purchasing items in this game is like buying DLC for any other game in the long run. You do get to keep them forever minus consumables, but those can even be purchased with the ingame currency, gm$ which are earned buy completing ingame missions.\n\nAt this current time, theHunter is being offered on the Steam Holiday Sale (2014) for 20% off on bundles.  If you have any  form of interest and are willing to support a game that actually works vs. the latest and greatest AAA titles that havent been, now would be a great time to purchase. The largest bundle is currently going for 39.99.  This includes an annual membership that alone cost 35 dollars during the normal time of the year, but also included in this bundle is $85 worth of gear that will allow you to hunt everything and anything under the sun within this game.  Even when the sale lets up, a price tag of 49.99 is not bad. $35 for the annual and $15  for the additional $85 worth of gear.\n\nAll and all, I recommend this game to those that enjoy a good hunt and are will to invest a little money (the bundle) into it as you would any other game title that isnt listed as Free-To-Play. After all... games dont make themselves.","December 24, 2014","true","373.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pay 2 win, you can kill litterally no animal (ok, 1 animal) without buying a new gun for real money. Also, you can't find ♥♥♥♥ in the forest. I'm assuming that was the purpouse, that the life of a hunter is about waiting for a deer to show up, but this doesn't do that... Oh, that's maybe because of the horrbile A.I. The animals can see you through everything and instantly run away. Just horrible game.

So, yes I know, microtransactions suck, but even if you pay the $15.00 fee for a license(3 months, I believe), you WILL enjoy this game. I happen to find the game really fun. I have decided to buy the $50.00 membership (12 months). The $15.00 and both, the $50.00 plan, come with weapons. The $15.00 comes with a little bit of stuff, but not a load. The $50.00 gives you a bow, two pistols, two shotguns, and two rifles (I may be wrong about that). They both, of course give you a license to hunt all animals and unlimited basic ammo. So if you really don't like the idea of the game, then maybe this will help you face the microtransactions, if you want to play, of course. Thanks for reading this review, this is my opinion of the game, I enjoy playing it, and have collected this informaton since the last time I wrote a review on this game.","June 29, 2015","true","49.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The realistic aspect is not to far extreme where you find yourself waiting a whole day to bag and tag a single animal, but at the same time not at all arcade-y where you can gun down 5 deer in a matter of seconds. The pace of this game is rather rewarding is the sense of accomplishment when it come to the hunt.\n\nThe main complaint that many have is there price structure. Yes, it can get expensive purchasing all that is available for this game. In fact If I recall correctly that if you happen to buy everything all at once (not including consumables and a ammo), you are looking at about a $600 price tag.  Yes, a lot of money, but at the same time compare that to Train Simulator 2015 which holds a price tag well over double of theHunter for all of its DLC. This game should not be considered Free-To-Play, but rather Free-To-Test or simple know it as a Demo since you are only allowed to hunt 1 species of deer (Mule Deer) on 1 reserve (Loggers Point). Also some have stated this is a Pay-To-Win game. Far from it IMO. Buying the ingame equipment and such doesnt make you a better hunter than everyone else. You just have more options to hunt and hunt with. Purchasing items in this game is like buying DLC for any other game in the long run. You do get to keep them forever minus consumables, but those can even be purchased with the ingame currency, gm$ which are earned buy completing ingame missions.\n\nAt this current time, theHunter is being offered on the Steam Holiday Sale (2014) for 20% off on bundles.  If you have any  form of interest and are willing to support a game that actually works vs. the latest and greatest AAA titles that havent been, now would be a great time to purchase. The largest bundle is currently going for 39.99.  This includes an annual membership that alone cost 35 dollars during the normal time of the year, but also included in this bundle is $85 worth of gear that will allow you to hunt everything and anything under the sun within this game.  Even when the sale lets up, a price tag of 49.99 is not bad. $35 for the annual and $15  for the additional $85 worth of gear.\n\nAll and all, I recommend this game to those that enjoy a good hunt and are will to invest a little money (the bundle) into it as you would any other game title that isnt listed as Free-To-Play. After all... games dont make themselves.","December 24, 2014","true","373.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is not a game where you will be wandering round the countryside with a .50 calibre Sniper blasting deer and bears into the next world. You do not get to call in air strikes and there isn't action every 2 seconds. Now onto what this game is.\n\nThis is THE most realistic hunting simulation around. The countryside is stunning, there are weather and wind conditions to take into account, and if you make a wrong step in the wrong place, the animals will spook. You need to take your time and , well, HUNT ...\n\nIf you combine this free game with the Trailrunner pack, you get a 1 year subscription to hunt for every animal, lots of guns and bows to be able to hunt everything and plenty of extra equiptment to aid you in your hunts. You DON'T need the microtransactions if you get this pack, but they are there IF you want them.\n\n£29.99 for a complete hunting simulator, total bargain if you ask me. Just remember, this is a simulator, Try it, download it, run through the first few tutorials and hunt a free animal on your guest pass.

It is a free to demo game, allowing you to hunt all species of rabbit, pheasant, and whitetail deer.  Past that you either need to buy licenses, or pay for a subscription.  That being said, the 50$ a year for the game will get you everything you need to hunt every animal in the game.  You will have multiple rifles, shotgun, bow, and pistol to pick from.  If you get the years sub, which i recommend, the rest is up to you on spending.  You can either spend a large amount of money, or join open games to hunt animals that would be difficult to hunt other wise, water fowl.   The only thing i recommend as a must buy after the years sub is the caller bundle.  Everything else you don't need to enjoy the game.  The game is open map, realistic hunting, at its finest.  You can't blast a rabbit w/ a .300 and get a score as its not an ethical round to take the game with.  The tracking is awesome.  The wildlife interaction is awesome.  The reserves are awesome.  The game is very well done, but it definately isnt a free to play game.  There are competition you can join, and if you place in them you can get the equivalent of $ used to purchase more guns, callers, subscriptions, ect.  I believe the game wouldn't have so many negative reviews if it wasnt marked as free to play.  The devs are very active with making new guns, wildlife, reserves, and updating graphics for both animals, and reserves.","January 9","true","346.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I read someone elses post I guess they changed it to Whitetail, Thats pretty cool. Whitetail are one more then one map so THAT really opens the game up to none paying because now you can hunt other maps. Its honestly just better to pay the 50 bucks get the year sub and all the gear that comes with it. The gear and the year pass has everything to get you out and doing. The game makes you work for the kill at times so if you just want to shoot and kill then you wont enjoy.\n\nPlay free understand its limited to those animals, IF you like it spend 50.

So, yes I know, microtransactions suck, but even if you pay the $15.00 fee for a license(3 months, I believe), you WILL enjoy this game. I happen to find the game really fun. I have decided to buy the $50.00 membership (12 months). The $15.00 and both, the $50.00 plan, come with weapons. The $15.00 comes with a little bit of stuff, but not a load. The $50.00 gives you a bow, two pistols, two shotguns, and two rifles (I may be wrong about that). They both, of course give you a license to hunt all animals and unlimited basic ammo. So if you really don't like the idea of the game, then maybe this will help you face the microtransactions, if you want to play, of course. Thanks for reading this review, this is my opinion of the game, I enjoy playing it, and have collected this informaton since the last time I wrote a review on this game.","June 29, 2015","true","49.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the game for you if enjoy first person shooters, but need something laid back to play after work to unwind on, prior to going to bed and getting up early the next morning.  Absolutely gorgeous, runs on a wide range of machines.  Pacing is excellent for what it is.  The least arcadey of the hunting simulators, but certainly one of the most polished.\n\nNote: If you do see my low hours, that's a bit deceptive... I've put many more hours on it prior to it going on Steam, and only recently crossed it into my Steam account.\n\nLastly... for those that criticize the game for being deceptively marketed as "free-to-play", I say "nuts!"  If you're going to be critical towards a single game, you're going after the wrong target.  The whole industry should move away from the term "free to play" because nothing is free... to include the player's time as well as the player's private information.  Free-to-play these days is too often synonymous with getting a fully loaded game that you & the developer are expecting the die-hards to drop enough cash to cover the expense of making and maintaining it.  Nothing wrong with that... that's a viable model for many games, but that is not "free" either.

It has its bad points and good points, mostly good, but I think it's definitely a one-of-a-kind. At first, it is a free-to-play game, but the options are scarce, and what you can do vastly outweighs the actual point of playing.\n\nThey give you the ability to kill mule deer (males are hard to come by) and cottontail rabbits (which you can't even kill due to the caliber of the gun you are given to begin with. I upgraded to the "Wayfarer" membership and was rewarded with a shotgun (complete with basic ammo) and a revolver, both very useful weapons as now I can practically hunt anything that I want to.\n\nThe gun sounds and mechanics are beefy and feel realistic, the tracking is awesome and finally getting a kill is quite rewarding. The animals behaviours are quite accurate also, being an individual who is thoroughly intrigued by animal behaviour, I definitely felt aware of their naturalistic tendencies.\n\nOverall, if you're looking to play a game that you have to invest a little bit of cash in to play properly, then go ahead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vectrocity/recommended/253710/","Vectrocity","[AE]Vectrocity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vectrocity/","66 products in account","In this review, I am going to list the pros and the cons of this game. I know it is hard to change the minds of people who do not like the game, but i will try.\n\nPros:\nOf course there are 18 different species to hunt, 19 with the incoming caribou!\nActive development team. They have status updates weekly to keep you informed, and even some surprises as well. this week we got camo face paint!\nIt's the only up to date hunting sim out there, last one was probably deer hunter 05.\nBeautiful scenery! This game is powered by the same engine that Just Cause, and Just Cause 2 runs on.\nRealism. It isn't neccasarily 100% realistic, but it's the most realistic hunting game i've played\n\nCons:\nWhile this game is free to play to a certain extent for free, you will probably have to pay at some point, but a 3 month membership, plus a shotgun, revolver, camo cap, caller, and a few other things is 15 dollars for 3 months. That's a hell of a lot cheaper than elder scrolls online, which has you pay 60 dollars outright, and then 15 dollars a month. For 3 months, $105 usd.\nExpensive. This game can get expensive, but, if you're a minimalist, unlike me, you can get a 6 month membership for 32 dollars, and that includes license for all species, access to all reserves, unlimited basic ammo, as well as a .44 revolver, 12 ga pump action shotgun(you can shoot anything with it), .357 revolver, compound bow "snakebite". That's four weapons. along with those you get camping supplies, which is used to travel to campsites or tents, 3-9X40mm rifle scope, wind indicator, 2x20mm handgun scope, boone & crockett cap, basic pants, Backpack, which doubles your inventory space, turkey box caller, basic jacket, and a tent, which you can use to set up a alternate spawn in point.\nMost missions, at some point require you to buy a specific weapon, which is kinda bogus  but oh well.\n\nOther than that, i have no complaints about this game. The game is beautiful, addicting, and fun as hell. I've been playing for 3 months, and i will definitely get a membership extension.\n\nYou pay 15 bucks for three months to hunt everything, and if you get tired of it, you dont have to keep paying. You pay 60 bucks for call of duty, you get bored of it, you take it to gamestop and sell it for a couple bucks.\n\nExpansive Worlds has to make money, and this game is aimed toward a very small group of gamers. This is their namesake, so they have to be able to live somehow. free to play is a bit iffy, and if they put a disclaimer saying that not everything is free from the start, people wouldn't jump in, expecting it, and then getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nTL;DR It's a great game, 15 bucks for 3 month membership plus a couple guns and other stuff, 32 for 4 weapons, plus a ton of other ♥♥♥♥, its aimed toward a small group of gamers, they have to make money somehow. ESO is 105 bucks for 3 months. compare.\n","August 22, 2014","true","760.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I feel it is not so bad compared to a lot of other games that costs much more in total, especially MMO's with higher monthly subscriptions and so forth. I played the free version for almost 7-8 months before I got my first subscription and even though at the time you could only hunt mule deer as a guest I did not grow tired of it. Get a membership bundles, extend with the normal subscription and you will be able to hunt every species for a very reasonable price.\n\nI personally like the slow pace of the game with the thrill of never knowing if the next animal will be a new personal best. There are a lot of competitions and missions available if you want some "direction" of your play. Note that special weapons or equipment might be needed for these. The scenery of the reserves are beautiful and there playing multiplayer with some friends while chatting is really fun.\n\nIf you like these kinds of games, give it an honest try and you will not be disappointed.","January 1, 2015","true","332.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have made good friends within the community and enjoyed thousands of hours in this game.\n\nGeneral characteristics of the game:\nThe Hunter is a game trying to find a balance between a realistic simulator and a fun game. It is not fast paced and it might take some time before you understand the mechanics of the game. You can play in any way you want; some people focus on winning competitions or getting on the general leaderboards, others enjoy luring in birds or just walking around in a reserve, tracking and calling for the animals they love to hunt.\nDownloading this game for free will give you very limited options, you will recieve a weapon that only allows you to hunt 1 species. However, if you are willing to pay for some licenses and gear, you can hunt all of the species you like and use the weapons you are fond of. The achievement system depends on the animals you shoot, and the weapons you use. Killing animals and using different weapons gives you HunterScore, which is the basis for your position on the leaderboards.\nIf you wish to have all the weapons, it will cost you a lot of money. However there are some great bundles that give you good weapons and permission to hunt all species in the game. Buying licenses for specific species is something I would advise against. If you buy membership packs, you get permission to shoot all species for a certain time + some nice weapons and gear. Furthermore, this game has two types of current EM$ and GM$; the EM$ can only be bought with real money and allows you to buy everything in the store, the GM$ is earned by doing missions and special events, and can be used buy consumables that improve your game or a special shotgun.\n\nIf you are thinking about buying things from the ingame store, don't hesitate to message me on steam, I can give you some advice on what to buy.\n\nPros:\n- There are many different species (A-typical and rare colored animals can be found [albino, melanistic etc.] )\n- There are many different weapons (incl. rifles, handguns, bows. Modern and old)\n- Very nice reserves\n- Good graphics\n- Many competitions in which you can compete with fellow hunters\n- It's challenging\n- It will keep you off the streets for years if you enjoy it\n- Frequent updates\n- Many special events (Holidays with special competitions and store discounts!)\n- Many great people in the community\n- A very active forum, where all your questions can be answered\n\n\nCons:\n- It has bugs, it often takes a long time before they are fixed (Some of these have been around for a long time)\n- Server is down a few times every month for a few minutes to a few hours\n- It's expensive if you want to have a lot of gear\n- Very limited options for character customisation\n\nCheers, Gierenhart (Grafzerk in theHunter)\n","February 21, 2015","true","40.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As a free to play player you can only hunt "Mule Deer", granted that the 'free' rifle you get allows you to kill more than that, you obviously can't because you don't have the proper license to hunt them.\n\nWhile you can earn the free currency by completing missions (17 in total for Mule Deer, which is the only ones you can do as a free player), doing so you could afford to buy maybe a 1 day license for whatever species, but then to continue earning the free currency you'd actually have to pay real money to reset these missions for Mule Deer, which is pointless if you either don't want to pay to carry on playing as such, or if you don't have the money spare, but you do want to carry on playing because you do actually enjoy playing. There is no incentive for free players to carry on playing due to basically having the game shove the need to pay real money to really progress.","June 18, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
