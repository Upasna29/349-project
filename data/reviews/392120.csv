Game errors out when trying to run from VR mode - have to actually shut down SteamVR and run game in normal mode to be able to play.\n\nThe concept is fun but in VR (Vive or Rift - tried in both) it is a bit disorienting with the camera being stuck at what feels like a 30-40 degree angle facing the ground and camera follows player. This doesn't feel very optimized for VR. Fix these two things (make camera preferences adjustable and saveable?) and this may end up on my favorites because of the scale and survival/missions concept. Otherwise, can't play further.","April 29","false","1.9"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","29","44","3","5"

It is very confortable and doesn't need a NASA computer to run at 90fps. Good game!","April 29","true","10.1"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","32","51","8","0"

Funny survival mode with leaderboards and a lot of action. Campaign is quite good too but a little short. It is clearly a good investment.

The survival mode is like L4D and feel real with VR. So keep working in this awesome game that  can be big, huge, gigantic, enormous as other games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cussbrother/recommended/392120/","cussbrother","A WINDSHIELD WIPER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cussbrother/","861 products in account","A slow-paced, clunky-feeling shoot-the-zombies game without much gore. Weapons don't seem to have any "oomph" to them - shooting a zombie point-blank with a shotgun feels like you're plinking away at a pink demon in old-school DOOM with the starting pistol. It's just not visceral the way a zombie game should be.\n\nThe UI is really weird, too - possibly an artifact of being designed with VR in mind - your mouse changes the perspective of menu screens, as if they're a sheet of paper in the game-world, but you still need WASD to select options, instead of just centering the option in your field of view.\n\nI don't bother with VR, but other reviews seem to indicate that it's not terribly great on VR - which is a shame, as it's not terribly great with a standard setup either. The game also chugs a lot worse than you'd expect from looking at the relatively simple models - at times, my disk access light was solidly on for thirty straight seconds, like I was doing a defrag or something.\n\nAll in all, there's certainly games that have done it worse, but games that have done it better too, and those looking for the fabled Next Great Zombie Game of legend will have to keep looking - it's not to be found here.","May 18","false","2.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Pretty light on content or anything to make it stay interesting. I bought it specifically for the VR support but honestly it's not a fun game. I thought the mission system would feature something deeper but it's just doing the same copy and paste things over again. Gunplay isn't fun, graphics are bad, this is something you would find on an indiegala giveaway.","May 29","false","0.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

For me the best part is the survival mode. If it adds the multiplayer mode, it could become one of the best VR games on Steam.
