Local multiplayer only.)\nBasically it's another Asteroids clone we already got an abundance of in the past 40 years (almost.)\n\nAt first, I wanted to give it a positive review (since there is no "meh" option,) because while very unpolished and not really good looking, it's not fundamentally bad. Although the multiplayer aspect does nothing for me since it is local only.\nBut then, when I actually sat down to write the review, I started to think, "Is there anything I can say about this game that would put it above other asteroids clones?" and I couldn't think of a single thing. Even if we would look at Steam games only, every other Asteroids clone I found offers way more, is more unique in terms of both gameplay and visuals, and some of them just look gorgeous even though they are games about shapes shooting each other.\nAccording to the developer, he created this game with focus on different physics being implemented in the controls. To be frank, I'm not such an avid player of the Asteroids to feel that difference, but it may be different for other people.\nFeel free to download the demo of the game (link available on the store page) to see how it handles for yourself.\n\nThe only thing about this game, is that it's relatively cheaper than the other clones on Steam.\nAlso note that it is still an early access game, and unlike some other people, the developer of this one seems to want to actually finish his game, so it may still get better later on.","February 19","false","4.5"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","27","37","0","2"

I honestly loved the game and I knew it was going to get on Steam. Pepys is a very nice and kind developer. I know he's doing everything he can to make the best game! I'm really excited for it to come out of Early Access! There are some things I'm very excited for on Space Drifters 2D. One thing I'm really excited and hyped for is Online Multiplayer. This game is fun doing singleplayer, but even more fun during Multiplayer. I trust Pepys instincts and I know this game will be better in the future than it is right now! Great job Pepys, I can't wait to see the future updates for this game, and maybe even new games!\n\nDeveloper's Reply: But just to make sure everyone understands, Online Multiplayer isn't a planned feature for 1.0. However, if and when I am capable of making the multiplayer work it is a feature I truly believe would be good for this game. For now it's not something I can promise.","June 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","1"

I must admit that the controls are a little clunky and weird to get used too. However once you do and coat yourself in the music and simplicity of the game, I found it to be pretty calming. Also its art design is neat.","September 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I don't recommend this game simply because it feels unfinished. I would expect an indie game to be a little unpolished, but this one is too much so. The developers have a great thing going and I could see this being very fun if they just finished making it.\n\nFor example, asteroid defense gives you limited shots, but does not display that anywhere, the "asteroids" are just squares with no curvature at all. Race mode does not show what lap the player is on. I had a little trouble even figuring out what the track was.\n\nThe game is lacking some basic animation as well. Unlike the Asteroids game we know and love, the asteroids do not break apart or even appear to explode. They literally just disappear when hit. Not even a few pixel dots scatter.\n\nSo overall I found it disappointing to say the least. An otherwise great and probably well-selling game fell short due to some lazy programming. I would say to the creators to pick it back up and just focus on user experience. Everything else is there.","April 28","false","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"
