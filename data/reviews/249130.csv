I always wished that there were a lego game about Lord of The Rings and a Marvel lego game after playing Lego Star Wars, because I really liked the relaxed and easy-to-access gameplay style. And then, multiple Lego games later, including Lord of The Rings, it is finally here. After multiple iterations, has the gameplay changed enough to justify the purchase?\nLet's start with the controls. This is my first time playing a Lego game on a keyboard(I do not own a gamepad, sadface). The Lego franchise was definently made for controllers, which I definently noted playing this game. The default controls for moving and doing actions worked fine on a keyboard. My only problems with moving were with the flying in the free-roam section. The flyinf races were just plain annoying to do and caused lots of frustration. I accidentaly kept dropping out of the flying mode while trying to adjust my flight course. But the biggest problem with the controls were the camera controls. The default camera controls were really awkward to use, especially while fighting. I pretty much had to stop either moving or fighting to adjust my camera. This problem is resolved by using a controller, so it's not that big of a deal, but it's still not nice.\nThe gameplay is the same as in the previous Lego games. You control multiple characters do solve light puzzles and fight goons and villains. Which there is alot. I mean a lot, since there is a 100+ characters to play as. Many of the characters have special abilities to solve puzzles, such as Iron Mans rockets to blow up silver legos, Spider-Mans spider-sense to find hidden stuff and the list goes on. The game captures the feel of the characters through different animations and abilities, which is awesome. Mr. Fantastics animations are a definite plus. This game also includes the new Big-Figs, which include Hulk, Juggernaut, The Thing etc. They have their own things only they can do, which is indicated by green handles. They are a nice inclusion, and fit nicely to the regular sized figures.\nThe game ofcourse has a ton of collectibles, which are fun to collect. You could say it's addictive. Those are going to take most of your time, since the campaign isn't all that long if you turbo through that, like I did.\nIn the end, the game is lots of fun to play. I didn't notice any bugs or glitches, which I cannot say for the previous lego game, Lord of The Rings. Experienced a lot of bugs with that game, so it was nice to have a smooth experience with this game. The game doesn't require that much to run smoothly, so pretty much everyone can play this excellent game. It is just pure fun.\nThe game is really solid, and you should buy it, especially if you like Lego games, or the Marvel license.\nPS. This is my first review ever, so apologies if there is any rambling or repetition, for I wrote off the top of my head. Thank you for reading :)","November 25, 2013","true","35.4"," 529 of 563 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","529","563","0","6"

And then I shoved them aside and played through the game myself, cause I was hooked.  I grew up loving both Legos and Marvel.  This is a fantastic merger of both.\n\nPros:\n- This game has a lighthearted storyline that doesn't take itself too seriously.\n- The antics and quips made by the characters are humorous and satiristically appropriate.\n- Kid appropriate means that I can sit down with my children for an hour or two to 'bond.'\n- Marvel.\n\nNeutral:\n- Gameplay is typical of most lego games; get coins, find gold/red bricks, unlock characters.\n\nCons:\n- It does get a bit repetative sometimes; gameplay and 'flavor' dialogue.\n- There are a few bugs still in the game.  Though they don't crop up all that often, it is annoying to have to quit a level simply because the bug prevented your advance.\n- Flight controls were terrible (or I'm old, and just don't get it).","October 13, 2014","true","91.9"," 320 of 333 people (96%) found this review helpful 70 people found this review funny","96","320","333","70","12"

I got this game for my 5 yr old, It's the first video game I've bought with him in mind, he has not shown any interest in any of the games I play, so i decided to buy something for him specifically. I played the first few missions to see if it would be something he'd be able to figure out easily.\n\nI finished the first 3 stages and thought the game was pretty good and my son might enjoy it. Little did i know that the first 3 levels were just appetizers and was barely getting into the main course.  The game becomes an open world game with plenty of things to do. The city (New York) is pretty big, and tons of things to do and characters to collect (Seriously, there are a tons of characters to collect). You can go through out the city and complete mini missions to help out citizens, you get driving time trials and help out Stan Lee a bunch of times!\n\nAfter seeing how the game opened up, I had no doubt my kid would enjoy the game. So i handed him the controller and let him fly around as Iron Man, he immediately loved it, he was having fun. He got the hang of it pretty quick, figured out he had to double jump to start flying, and once he was flying how to ascend and descend, still needs some work with shooting targets, but he was managing.  I then let him try the Hulk, he showed little interest and switched back to Iron Man. Can't blame him, because the Hulk is a lame-o. lol. Then I switched him over to Spider Man, he loved it more than Iron Man. He played for an hour straight before I cut him off...... because it was MY TURN. lol.\n\nSo far i am 13 hrs deep and have not even proceeded to start level 4.  Highly recommended even if you don't have kids.","November 10, 2014","true","30.5"," 235 of 246 people (96%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","96","235","246","45","7"

They could not be further from the truth. The LEGO games are actually fun for pretty much all ages, due to the reference material they use. We've had LEGO games ranging from Star Wars to Harry Potter to Batman, and more. And now we move on to something odd. Marvel Super Heroes. I say odd, because this is a WB game. WB which owns the rights to publish DC related stuff. DC which is a rival company of Marvel. And Marvel, which is now owned by Disney. So this is indeed an dd pairing. Traveler's Tales are just such big fans of Marvel (and who can blame them) that they wanted this to be made. And here it is. And here is probably the best LEGO game to date. A labor of love from fans of Marvel, made for fans of Marvel.\n\nLMSH is a completely original story in the Marvel universe, which borrows characters from the Marvel movie universe and also the comic universe. In fact, it has a roster so massive, it is the biggest roster of any LEGO game to date. You'll find all of your favorites, ranging from the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Blade, Daredevil, Spider-Man, and more, and even an assortment of odd picks like Howard the Duck (who even has his own achievement) and more. Of course what's a superhero game without supervillains. So yes, you can play as a number of baddies as well. Normal sized characters have normal LEGO scaling, and the big bruisers like The Incredible Hulk, Colossus, and others have been turrned into bigger LEGO characters called "big figs". And your larger than life characters like Galactus have been given the normal mini fig versions when you want to play as them.\n\nLMSH features a msssive hub world recreation of comic and real world fused Manhattan, complete with a wide assortment of side missions, challenges, and unlockables to discover along the way. You can run, jump, fly, or ride vehicles to get around the city at your own leisure. and when not tackling main story missions, there is a ton of things to do. Even after tackling the main story, you will find so many things to unlock, from characters to vehicles and new mission. Some things will warrant replays through missions with different characters, shooting replayability through the roof.\n\nAs for gameplay, LMSH offers the most refined combat of any lego game to date, mixed with the usual puzzle solving based on character powers. It's fun, varied, and easily the most satisfying in the series. The game also puts a huge emphasis on combat more than any LEGO game to date.\n\nMy only complaints on this game are the unispired soundtrack, which pales in comparison to previous LEGO games. And also the character creator. It's sloppy. It lacks full customization. And unless you want to unlock a couple of achievements, is completely unnecessary.\n\nPros:\n- Biggest roster to date\n- Best moveset to date for individual characters\n- Big fig characters!\n- So much content packed in. Even after completing the game, there is so much to do.\n\nCons\n- Boring soundtrack\n- Character creator is not good","November 25, 2013","true","72.1"," 225 of 242 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","225","242","0","6"

Not only does the game feature a huge roster of playable characters who actually have the personality and abilities of those they represent, but the game also features a unique storyline where the voice acting actually fits the game.\n\nThe story is fantastic this time around. The voice acting being recorded specifically for the game helps it to not be as cheesy or low quality as before. The cinematics then also can be how they used to be and have a lot more fun and freedom without havign to fit within a prerecorded audio clip.\n\nThe characters are as high quality as they are numerous. Multiple characters and costumes leave almost no one out (except nightcrawler...) and will have a few choices for everyone. They each are unique and are fun to play and although I do wish Hulk could scale buildings they stick pretty close to th source.\n\nManhattan is a great hub area featuring TONS of content to do either while between missions or at the end of the game and are just looking for tokens for new characters and vehicles.\n\nCombat has also been improved where each character has their signature moves and bad guys actually can be comboed and used to make tons of studs. Speaking of studs, there is no lack of them here and you will be hitting 1 millions before half way through the game.\n\nOverall it was the best in the series and I really could not think of much to improve on other then some wonky flight controls and some races that were a bit unfair in that regard.

But it is a great fun and a total enjoyment for any Marvel or Lego fan, let alone of both. Dialogue is fresh as always, having fun with cult movie phrases, the character list would satisfy I believe any needs, characters themselves have their own unique personality and specific set of skills, and the open world lets you roam the streets of the Big Apple up to the S.H.I.E.L.D. carrier soaring above. It has a very decent replayability value too, considering to fully complete any of the missions you have to use more than the basic character list you are first given access to for the specific mission, so that once completed, you can get back with another team and discover more.\n\nOverall it's a very decent (should I add uber cute too?) incarnation of the Marvel universe, giving proper tribute to both the movies and the comic books, with a huge range of characters, vast open world and a story that seemlessly mixes a range of different traditional storylines into one whole big living Marvel adventure.\n\nGive it a try, it's worth it.","November 26, 2013","true","20.9"," 97 of 105 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","97","105","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/249130/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Lego Marvel Super Heroes is an action adventure game developed by TT games and published by Warner Brothers, releasing in 2013 on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4 and Xbox One, and of course, PC and Mac.\n\nGame play is similar to that of other Lego titles, you are able to take control of around 150 characters straight out of the Marvel Universe, and each of them have their own abilities. Each of the game’s levels consist of a series of puzzles which use specific characters special abilities, as well as breaking objects to them build other items to help you traverse the environment. In between each level, you enter a free roam type area around the streets of New York. The free roam contains opportunities to complete small side missions which are narrated by none other than Deadpool.  When in the main missions, there are a few side actives to complete too as well, which include Marvel co-creator, Stan Lee; this segment of the game is called “Stan Lee in Peril”.\n\nThe graphics in Marvel Super Heroes is very much the same as other Lego games, you will find it very hard to fault the visual department of this game; it looks colourful, animated to perfection, everything in the game is made out of Lego, so it has that childish charm that is just gorgeous. There is a wide range of resolution options, but a lack of any other graphical choices, other than texture quality which still only has two levels, high and low.\n\nThere is really no difficulty in the game, there is no penalty for dying, since you just respawn straight away, you will be stumped for ideas on a few of the puzzles and you will just have to experiment with your characters in order to progress. The boss fights are all uniquely challenging and offer various different waves of battle for you to learn.\n\nThe game’s level design is perfect; there is an in game “brick counter” which you can fill up by breaking other Lego objects in game for other smaller bricks. I played the game with my partner and we made it our aim to fill this counter on each level, this adds another challenge to the game, and lets you have the satisfaction of breaking tons of Lego and collecting thousands of smaller bricks. On top of this, there are also plenty of small Easter eggs too, which the odd appearance from Deadpool (who doesn’t appear as a main character in the story).\n\nWe finished the game in just under nine hours on co-op mode with collecting 100% of the bricks on each stage. What makes the Lego games repayable is that after you complete a level, you have the free play option unlocked – this means you can play as any character on that stage to unlock special areas for more side missions and collectables. Whilst on the subject of collectables, there are so many to find! On top of the regular cast of characters, there are over 100 more to find and discover whilst completing side quests, achievements, and finding items.  Complentionists will have a field day with this game.\n\nSadly we did run into a few technical problems during our play through. The main one being one of the levels just freezes all of the time; this is a known bug and the only way you can progress is purely by restarting the level and hoping you are lucky – thankfully this bug is right at the start of the stage, so you don’t lose much progress.  Another issue we ran into was fairly annoying, in that characters can sometimes get stuck in the environment, this isn’t too bad if you are able to kill the character with another player, but sometimes this isn’t possible so the only way you can get around the issue is by restarting the level; this can sometimes be painstakingly annoying if you are right at the end of a stage.  We did have a positive experience both using a 360 controller and the Steam controller to play though. I would strongly recommend anyone picking this game up to use either of the two controller options.\n\nI have come to the conclusion that Lego really make fantastic games; and Marvel Super Heroes is no different. You have two of the biggest franchises in the world today and combined them; you have a recipe for success straight away. We had such a blast whilst playing and I would strongly recommend Lego Marvel Super Heroes to any fans of Marvel or Lego out there. The regular price of £14, 99 is spot on as well. If you can get it any cheaper, do not hesitate to pick it up, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I mean really who doesn’t love LEGO or super heroes? Playing with many of my favorite heroes in LEGO form to battle it out with many great supervillains and lead to a giant battle with Galactus is just a dream come true.\n\nLEGO Marvel is another great addition to the LEGO game franchise that deserves its recognition. The game features 155 different characters to unlock, 26 levels to play through, and a huge New York City to wonder around in. You also have the standard gold bricks and red bricks to find too. There’s plenty here to take up many hours of your time to complete 100%.\n\nThe story is about Galactus coming to Earth to devour it like in the old Fantastic Four story. Silver Surfer is shot down when he was scouting the planet and the supervillains are trying to use his cosmic power to take over. You’ll battle through 15 different levels for the main campaign which will take place in places like the Baxter Building, Latveria, and the Savage Island just to name a few. There are 11 levels you can access after collecting the right amount of gold bricks to unlock them. These are mini missions to play where you find the red bricks and some of the characters to unlock. Voice acting wasn’t too bad in the game and it also had plenty of goofy LEGO humor to go along with it.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as other LEGO games but the characters are pretty good with using their abilities and fighting skills each in their own unique way. Thor fights with his hammer for melee and calls down lighting to power up certain objects or even shoot enemies or Spiderman who shoots his webbing, has a spider sense for hidden objects, and swings around on his webs. I really enjoyed playing through the levels and playing in the open world of NYC but it did become a chore finding everything. Especially the races you had to do to get some of the gold bricks which would become frustrating and annoying.\n\nMost of the game ran fine but I did run into a few bugs. Sometimes I couldn’t pick up objects I needed, I’d get stuck on stuff, or couldn’t get NPC’s to do what they were supposed to do. I even had the game crash on me a couple times. Even with these items I still had a great time playing and they never really took away from the experience.\n\nIf you have enjoyed playing the previous LEGO games and enjoy Marvel comics this is a great game to play. It did feel a little more refreshing and not like every other LEGO game before but it is still a LEGO game so don’t expect a world changing game. Just enjoy it for what it does and have fun. It may bring back childhood memories and can even be fun playing with the kids if you have any.\n\nBear Rating: 8.5/10","February 15, 2014","true","276.5"," 60 of 64 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","60","64","0","3"

And chimichangas.\n\nThere's a reason LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is one of the highest-selling LEGO video games of all time; actually, three reasons.\n\nFirst, the characters. The game features not only the existing Avengers, X-Men and Ultimate Spider-Man LEGOs on the market, but a legion of characters and vehicles either only recently released in 2014 or not even created yet. From the Fantastic Four to the Sinister Six, this game includes the majority of Marvel's well-known characters along with a handful of lesser-known ones. Plus they've included the legendary Stan Lee himself as a playable character possessing multiple superpowers. What more do you need from this game?\n\nSpeaking of characters, the next reason is what the minifigures take part in: the story. You can tell the writers and game designers had fun trying to combine a coherent Marvel storyline with the quirky humor found in every other LEGO game. And you know what? They did it. The story features the Avengers, Fantastic Four and X-Men teaming up against villains like Magneto, Doc Ock, Doctor Doom, Loki, Abomination and Sandman, in an epic quest filled with crazy left turns that only a LEGO video game could have. And it all leads up to a stunning twist you'll never expect (so I won't ruin it for those who haven't played yet).\n\nFinally, the gameplay. I was very pleasantly surprised just from playing a free PC demo of the game which was released online early last year, featuring the game's very first level, Sand Central Station. This level features Iron Man (Mark 6), the Hulk and Spider-Man taking on Abomination and Sandman in New York's Grand Central Station. But what blew me away the most during the level was the sheer number of abilities each character had, from Hulk's famous Puny God move from The Avengers, to Spider-Man's ability to actually swing around on a web. When I finally bought the actual game, I was thrilled to discover that the rest of the characters in the game were just as incredible.\n\nSo, if you're skeptical about buying this game, I suggest you try out the demo featured on marvelsuperheroes.lego.com first, and if you still don't feel like buying the game, then at least you technically tried it for free. But based on my personal experience, I think all of your doubts will go away and you'll want to buy LEGO Marvel Super Heroes right away.","March 9, 2014","true","198.8"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","62","67","0","0"

There are a lot of jokes and funny moments for the children but even that is ok and it matches to the storyline.\n\nI played the game without any DLC and there are A LOT of characters, heroes and villains, from Avengers to X-men to Fantastic Four... Everyone of them has an specific reason to be in the story and it is great, also after finish all the chapters you can change the characters at your will, which is pretty nice.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but very nice, you can fly with Thor or Human Torch, swing with Spidey, run over everything with Hulk, take vehicles like cars, boat and planes and everything works nice.\n\nBesides the story there are A LOT of side missions, new characters and clothes to unblock, things to do in the city like races and help people and hidden items on the chapters that was impossible to get without the ability to change the character at any time. There are so many things that I completed the storyline and was only 20% of the game.\n\nThe voice acting is awesome, the sound is ok, but the soundtrack isn't the most remarkable thing you will hear, after a while playing it seems the same track all over again.\n\nAfter all that, I'm sure that if you like the Marvel universe or Lego games or super heroes (who doesn't???) this game has everything for you have fun.","September 7, 2014","true","13.4"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","40","46","3","0"

Side quests are more varied than in previous games but some of the same types apply here, fetch/escort/race. Flying controls may be a bit weird to get used to but you should be fine with them eventually.\n\nIt took me 36 hours to 100% the game with every achievement/collectable and the story itself is about 9-12 hours.\n\nLAST POINT, yes you can use a keyboard but I wouldn't expect a great gameplay experience as a controller is recommended. Do not expect online coop either, it's local only which means you're playing solo or getting friends/family to play with you by hooking up some controllers (or using the keyboard/mix of the two).\n\nSo yes this is definitely the best LEGO game currently out there right now.\n\nIf you're a LEGO Fan you owe it to yourself to play this, if you love Marvel then you'll enjoy it.

I couldn't give them an answer. They were all about equal in quality, just pick one that is an ip you like. No longer, I can definitively say that Lego Marvel Super Heroes is the best Lego game Traveller's Tales has made to date.\n\nIt has the greatest variety of useful  characters, the most activities, the largest world to explore, and just the best looking visuals and writing. It is also more challenging than most Lego games. Especially if you are going for 100% completion. There are some collectibles (and rescuables) that are quite the head scratcher.  This is enhanced by the open world. Easily one of the best looking open worlds in this type of game. Clearly Traveller's Tales best most detailed open world.  People on the street will often respond to whatever character you are controlling. Every place is properly detailed. It must have cost a lot to create it since they are reusing it for Lego Marvel Avengers. Lego City for the WiiU is a close second.\n\nThe game shows the staff at Traveller's Tales that worked on this game really loved Marvel comics. There were many deep references that casual fans, and Cinematic fans would miss but would delight long time fans. Not that you would need to be a long time fan. The entire game has plenty of clever writing, humor and sight gags to entertain fans and non fans a like.\n\nLet me stress this isn't a perfect game. There are some glitches that happen from time to time. There is one area inside the Statue of Liberty where characters will often slide off platforms and to there deaths for no apparent reason. The driving and flying controls in the open world are particularly frustrating in race events. Nothing that kills the general game play or fun, but if you are trying for 100%, you will get frustrated sometimes.\n\nAlso if you are suffering from Lego game burnout, you might want to take a long break before playing this game because its easily the most Lego of all Traveller's Tales games.  If you are ready for one, this is the one to get. At least until Lego Marvel Avengers or Lego Dimensions comes out.","September 8, 2015","true","73.7"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","30","33","7","2"

It's not innovative anymore (if it ever was in the first place). It's an open world where you can do your own way and complete missions and unlock tons of (hidden) characters.\n\nThe title might have given it away already, but this one is based on the Marvel comics. I'm a big Marvel fan so I was really looking forward to playing as my favorite characters but the game is just meh. It always comes down to; use this character to do this, so the other one can do this and the last one can do this. Which is fun for one or two missions, but come on, 15 missions is just 13 too many for this gimmicky type of gameplay. There's just too little variety here gameplay wise.\n\nThe graphics look sharp, colorful and Lego-y and the humor is, as always, kind of fun (if childish), which is a thing the Lego games manage to do right. The voice acting is also better than expected and some of the original voices have been used. Which is great, but it would've been even better if it used the voices of the original Marvel-movies-cast. Just saying.\n\nCompleting the game takes at least 8-9 hours and to 100% it you can add tens of hours to that number. Impressive, I'd say.\n\nIn the end Lego Marvel Super Heroes isn't a bad game, just not a very innovative one. I wish they change the Lego formula in the future so we can expect some new stuff instead of rehashing the same type of gameplay and putting it around a different theme.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","February 12, 2014","true","10.3"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is an incredible game for both LEGO- and comicfans.\n\nThe Good:\n· A fun story that stays true to the Marvel universe.\n· Countless characters like Spider-Man, the Hulk, Thor, Captain America... Basically any Marvel character you can or can't think of. (Even Stan Lee. Hell yes.)\n· An open world with tons of side activities, collectable Bricks and breakable LEGO constructions.\n· A wide variety of character types that offer for great replayability. Sometimes you will need to replay a level with heroes you have unlocked later on to reach secret areas and so on. For example: Captain America's shield to walk over flames, the Hulk's force to break weak walls, moving metal object with Magneto, and so on.\n· Plenty of fun references to the Marvel movies.\n\nThe Bad:\n· No online co-op, only a local split screen option (that doesn't always respond all to well, unfortunately).\n· The game basically requires a controller to play. You can play with the keyboard just fine but there are no mouse controls, which takes away some of the experience. It's not especially a downside, but I thought I'd list it so you know what you're up against if you don't have a controller.\n\nThe Ugly:\n· For a LEGO game it's absolutely stunning. Gorgeous lighting effects, fun animations, amazing voice-actors... It's a LEGO game to be proud of.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nAn amazing game for both casual gamers, LEGO-lovers and comicbook fanatics like myself.

Most of the missions just feel like a Avengers story. It's nice they throw in marvel characters and all, but the whole story and missions seem more avengers based.\n\nI like the xmen and boy do they get neglected here, also other super hero teams. This game clearly was meant to push the avengers movies or ride on the little success that movie got. Thowing in random marvel heroes who have nothing to do with the games story is enough to not call this Lego marvel super heroes, rather Lego Avengers.\n\nThat little segment with the xmen was lacking and that one particular mission that had jean grey in it, which makes no sense. when was the last time you seen jean outside of a xmen story, without other xmen characters around her, or without her phoenix powers.\n\nI can't even call wolverine a xmen anymore, since hes on every freaking team. Wolverine the team S%^t is what they call him.\n\nAll and all this game has good Marvel fan service, not as deep into the marvel universe as i wanted, but enough to please a loyal comic book fan. The gameplay is great, the controls on foot is perfect, the flight controls is very debatable. The flight controls, the flight controls. I'm not one to complain but, i assume no one tested the controls of the flying heroes, wen putting this game out, huh? They have the nerve to put flying mini-games where you fly through rings, though tight turns in the game which has horrible flight controls.\n\nI can yap on about this game but in the end i loved it. Took me a while to appreciate the game, but at the end of the day i loved it. This being my second lego game, it taught me how to love the lego series. The fact that the series pretty much puts you into a play world and let you go crazy, by giving you options to tackle different things basically over whelm me by choices.

From Abomination to the Wizard, this game is an A-to-Z (well, A-to-W) love letter to the Marvel Universe that starts with the Silver Surfer gliding across the title screen and ends with a credits song that could not have been better chosen. A few technical glitches and some carryovers from the franchise history keep it from being an outright masterpiece, but it easily ranks as one of the best superhero games I've played in years.\n\nIt starts with the characters. Where LEGO Batman 2 offers a sizable roster of heroes and villains, the campaign in LEGO Marvel delivers more playable heroes in a much more coherent story about collecting cosmic bricks around the world before villains do. The first mission starts with Iron Man and Hulk, but the selection of playable characters soon grows to include the rest of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, loads of X-Men, and even Spider-Man. You'll even switch heroes mid-way through many of the missions, with Cyclops and Jean Grey rescuing Storm and Iceman during an assault on the X-Mansion, or the Human Torch flying in to assist Black Widow and Hawkeye as they infiltrate a Hydra base. The entrances and exits are all handled as part of the story, which gives you a chance to play several characters who all feel like they're part of a single narrative.\nWhat's Next-Gen LEGO Marvel Super Heroes Like?\n\nThe same is true of the villains. You can start by chasing Doctor Octopus from the Baxter Building to the Daily Bugle, but you'll soon be flying off to thwart Dr. Doom's plans in Latveria and taking the Rainbow Bridge to stop Loki from stirring up the frost giants in Asgard. I particularly liked how each mission played out as a sort of protracted chase, with the heroes in pursuit of folks like Magneto or the Red Skull, while battling lots of lesser villains like Pyro or the Leader along the way. As great as it all is, telling such an earth-shattering story without major characters like Dr. Strange or Sub-Mariner present feels off. Still, when a game features lesser-known characters like Black Bolt, Captain Britain and HERBIE, it's hard to complain. Maybe they're saving Kang and Ultron for a sequel?\nThe puzzles in the LEGO games are almost always solved by matching the right power to the right problem, and the Marvel take on this mechanic is particularly inventive. Take\nLEGO Marvel Super Heroes\n\nLEGO Marvel Super Heroes offers an original storyline in which Nick Fury calls upon heroes spanning the Marvel Universe to save Earth from such threats as the vengeance of Loki and the hunger of Galactus, Devourer of the Worlds.\n\nGreat Games with Huge Casts\n\nSuper Street Fighter IV: Arcade EditionLeague of LegendsLeague of LegendsLeague of LegendsSkylanders Swap Force Black Widow for example. She, like Invisible Woman, can spoof security cameras, but Widow also has the acrobatic skill of Captain America, which enables her to access remote areas of the levels, and the brains of Tony Stark, which lets her use certain consoles that would be off limits to other heroes. Throw in a gun, and you've got a very useful character made up of a number of different power sets. Storm and Thor, for instance, can both use electricity to power up stations, but Thor can smash open walls while Storm can put out fires. Even though there are only maybe a couple dozen powers to share among them all, the various combinations of powers ensures that no one feels entirely redundant.\n\nYou will get a few power sets that seem a bit out of place; Captain America's ubiquitous shield switches seem a little arbitrary, as does the notion that Wolverine should be really good at digging and climbing. There are also a few that make sense but aren't particularly well implemented. The special sixth sense shared by characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil is really more for recognizing what walls you can climb than for keeping those characters out of danger.\n\nI finished the main campaign in under 12 hours, but I've been coming back to collect extra characters and bricks for days after. In between missions, there's a massive open-world map of Manhattan to explore, from the Statue of Liberty and Battery Park to the X-Mansion up past Harlem. There's also the massive SHIELD Helicarrier floating over the East River.\n\nThe city has loads of attractions, complete with characters to collect and challenges to beat. Over the course of the side missions, you'll help Heimdall take out frost giants on the docks, battle Sentinels in the streets, or take control of a neglectful boyfriend's mind and make him climb the Empire State Building to apologize to his girlfriend.\nExperienced gamers won't find many of the open-world puzzles and challenges to be much of a contest; for the most part, you'll simply need to identify the type of task you're facing and then just go hit the right steps in the right order. It's clear that the challenges are aimed at LEGO’s young demographic, so gamers craving a challenge will be let down here. Still, if the allure of putting Daredevil on a motorcycle and having him race Ghost Rider through the Upper West Side sounds fun, the difficulty is sort of incidental. The rare exceptions are the timed challenges, or those that require you to search out objectives that aren't in the immediate vicinity of the challenge.\n\nThe biggest pain is the inconsistent, confusing flight system. It attempts to use the same control scheme from the missions where the up and down motion of the thumbstick moves your character toward or away from the camera. Now you'll use face buttons to control the pitch of your character's flight. The problem is that the button you use to ascend is also the button you use to accelerate, and I frequently found myself flying into the side of buildings or massively overshooting my objective. Even with a week or so of playing, it still seems weird to me.\nLego Marvel Super Heroes, Manhattan tour\n\nEven with that one chief complaint, there's just so much to love about LEGO Marvel that I've been playing it a few hours a day for over a week now and am still finding new charms. From unlocking Gwen Stacy and making her jump off the Brooklyn Bridge to watching the heroes dance at Tony Stark's house parties, this game is full of the moments that make Marvel one of the best brands in entertainment.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nLEGO Marvel Super Heroes is the best thing to happen to Marvel games since 2006's Marvel Ultimate Alliance. It's a warm and witty, multi-layered approach to the brand that ties in hundreds of Marvel's most iconic characters, settings, and stories. While you can knock out the campaign story in around eight hours, the world is rich with content, and I've found myself up late every night for the past week playing for "just one more hour." It may not offer the challenge or player-driven context of this year's other open-world games, but those games would be hard-pressed to deliver as much fun and happiness as you'll find. 9.5/10","July 25, 2015","true","28.6"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","21","31","3","0"

Since then, I've wrecked this game 100%, and now I'm here to talk about it.\nHere are some of the things that I really liked about Lego Marvel:\n\n1. The hub world of NYC is humungo-jumbo sized. It's filled with tons of missions to do and things to unlock. The Lego Star Wars hub areas are like little fluffy cupcakes compared to the sumo-sized birthday cake that is Lego Marvel's NYC hub. It's big and I like big things.\n\n2. The character roster. Lego Marvel features 155 playable characters (not including DLC), as well as a big number of custom characters for you to create. They even have lesser-known heroes like Moon Knight and Squirrel Girl. The conclusion: the character roster is GODLIKE.\n\n3. The main story and bonus Deadpool missions are good fun.  The story has you playing as different characters all the time, and the villains plotting against you also change constantly. Just like the previous Lego games, the main story has some good content to keep you busy.  I should also mention that co-op play is always available, and that is a MAJOR PLUS.\n\nAnd here are some thing you might not like so much:\n\n1. Keep in mind this game is aimed at younger audiences, so expect lots of simple beat'em up gameplay, simple puzzling, and corny dialogue. Some like it, but it isn't for everyone.\n\n2. This game can be very glitchy. One time I was replaying the first level and The Sandman turned huge. I was about to spray him with water and DESTROY HIM, but instead of destroying him, he slowly sunk into the ground and glitched out of the map entirely. I had to restart the level in order to continue. I have also encountered bugs where hub world missions wouldn’t show up at times and I've even heard that freezes can be common.  Bug-filled games really wound my soul, so be aware of this before purchasing.\n\nAt the end of the day, Lego Marvel is a pretty fun game. I recommend it especially to those who are fans of the Marvel universe or the past Lego games, and to the younger audience as well.\n\nOverall, if Lego Marvel Super Heroes was a beverage, it would definitely be a tangy, chicken-flavored soda drink with an amusing aftertaste that leaves quite an impression.

With citizens walking around, driving in the city, a beautiful sky to fly through, and stunning graphics (not really nextgen graphics, but better than the standard LEGO graphics) the open world is one of the best parts of the game.

I would have to say that despite a lack of movie music and voices, the game is still brilliant. The one and only downside to this is the somewhat problematic flying controls, especially if you're in a race - then it can become a little frustrating.\n\nThat aside, this game is absolutely awesome. Incredibly fun abilities (super strength), attacks, powers, and travelling (especially web-slinging) and a reasonably interesting plot, with an extra dose of both comic and movie references make this something to be savored, especially by fan of Marvel comics - it's not just the Avengers that make an appearance here, there's also the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and of course, a million cameos by Stan Lee, to name a few.\n\nThis game is also very funny, with SHIELD incompetence, bad puns, and amusing dialogue in the cut scenes, accompanied by a healthy dose of Deadpool breaking the 4th wall. 100%, anybody? However, probably the best thing about this game to me is the world map - you can freely roam the city of New York (AND THE HELICARRIER), completing extra quests and acquiring extra characters and vehicles.\n\nDefinitely worth a look.","May 30, 2014","true","57.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's a decent game for the length of the campaign, loaded with the dumb jokes they always put in these LEGO games, but getting all of the unlocks is a sloggy, tedious experience that will take you from one end of the Big Apple to the other, and through each of the campaign missions at least once more. There are bonus missions as well, gated behind 'gold bricks' that you collect by doing little quests and minigames on the world map, and performing specific acts in missions, but they're little one-room things hosted by Deadpool rather than full-blown side stories.\nLEGO games aren't really known for their fine-tuned controls, and unfortunately Marvel Super Heroes takes that a step farther than usual. When you start to move, you walk; after several seconds, you run. This applies to turning and vehicle controls too: hold the stick left, or press B too long, and suddenly you're spinning donuts or your gentle descent toward a checkpoint marker has turned into a hard line straight toward the ground. Makes the races and chases you'll need to do to 100% the game more tha a little frustrating.\nThe ad copy mentions tons of character unlocks, and there is a good number of them-- but a lot of those are reskins. There's half a dozen Iron Man costumes (which do have different powers), but he's an outlier, and most of the unlockables draw from the same small pool of powers that are coded into the game.\nI've logged over thirty hours in this though, and I'll admit that I've had fun for most of them.

Its interesting. As I already finished story mode im going in freeplay and unlocking more storys by collecting gold bricks. The "after story mode (freeroam / freeplay mode)" is not so interesting but its okay to play in free time when bored. And I already know a trick how to get alot of coins in the stark tower (check out my video) , then its not really cool to play the game anymore. I feel like everything is done here.\nBut anyways. The game is cool , graphics are nice and I love how its like "real life graphics" + "lego graphics".\nIts looking really good that way , good job developers. Really nice xbox 360 controller support. Totaly the best ive seen.\nCo-op mode is like in any another lego game , but this one just feels like the best. Sadly , I expected it to have multiplayer , like online not just co-op , but well , its a good game , so I got nothing bad to tell about it.\nAlot of cars and charatchers to unlock while playing , as well as the "hacks / cheats" what you can unlock ingame !\nThats just one of the coolest things.\nAnd what I love most about this game is that it got sounds like people talking not just text what you need to read.\nYou can too add lyrics in settings if you want , I like having "People talking sound" + lyrics.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone from age 5 to 16.\nEven if its lego , its interesting.\n\n~Girl gamer\n~Anna","October 4, 2014","true","83.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I really wish that steam had a middle option between thumbs up and thumbs down.\nIt's definatly not bad, and it plays like a lego game, but as far as I've gotten I've noticed quite a few patterns that i didn't see in previous titles that make the game seem rather lazy.  It is definatly a huge game, with quite a few playable characters, but the story levels seem to be lacking.\n\nAs an example, every boss I've encountered so far has played out the exact same.  You fight a horde of enemies, then you're allowed to his the boss once, then another horde of enemies, then you can hit the boss again, then another horde of enemies and then you hit the boss again and win.  I've gone through quite a few bosses and since every one has played the same, I don't see them changing it up later.  Needless to say it gets rather boring rather quick.\n\nThe humor also seems to be lacking, and I am comparing this to the lego star wars.  Now I haven't played lego lord of the rings, so I don't know if it also has voice acting, but I feel like the voice acting and actual dialouge has really taken away a lot of the humor.  Each character that talks has a single character trait and tends to just repeat it in differant ways.  Spiderman just won't shut up about all the teen-angst he's having to go through.  I don't think I've sat through a conversation with him where he didn't mention having to do homework.  Again it gets very tired very quickly.  The funniest parts tend to be the deadpool cameos.  Those are done in the old lego game style, through humerous movements and noises.\nThe game is also far too story focused.  There are few games where I'd consider this a bad thing, but this is one of them.\n\nThere is a bleeding cutscene every 4 minutes, and this game sufferes from one of the worst features in all video games.  Unskippable cutscenes.  That is almost as bad as micro transactions.  People like me don't care about the story of a lego game.  The story is also incredibly redundent.  There are cosmic bricks from the silver surfer's surfboard and Dr. Doom wants them to rule the world.  There that's the plot.  Be prepared to have that drilled into your brain in every single unskippable cutscene.\n\nAll that being said there is still a really nice charm to playing a lego game.  Playing as the characters and seehing how they're differant to each other is really great fun.  I love being able to swing around New York as Venom (so few games have Venom as a playable character and I don't understand why.  Venom is amazing).  I like being able to go insanely fast as iron man (although, I won't lie, he's an utter pain to control while flying).  That's the main driving point to continue playing; seeing what new character you'll unlock, or working twords unlocking your favorite marvel character.\n\nIt's a really weird situation writting a review like this, because if you play it the way you're supposed to (the story mode) it's really rather boring, but if you play it just dicking around as the characters you unlock, it's rather great fun.   If you don't get bored easily or you like constantly doing the same thing, go for it.  Otherwise I'd say it's safe to avoid unless you're a massive Marvel fan.","December 4, 2013","false","47.5"," 102 of 192 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","102","192","5","10"

You get an interested Cydran.\n\nTo begin, I need to point out this game does not support mouse controls, however I do recommend using a controller when playing pretty much any of these LEGO games.\nThe game itself has wonderful looking visuals, with a nice gloss effect on the characters and certain objects in the unique environments. Every level is designed differently as the LEGO games usually promise.\nAs per usual with these games, there is a massive amount of characters available to play as, heroes and villians from the MARVEL franchise included. Once you unlock a character, you need to buy it with studs, which you obtain through playing the levels of the game (or even through free roaming around the city).\nThis leads me to the free-roam side of the game. After levels, you'll be taken back to the city in which you can explore as you wish. Side quests are available to complete with Gold Bricks as the reward.\nOne part of the game that I think lacks is the combat system. It's the same with every LEGO game but I feel it doesn't flow well, and at often times you're stuck fighting with the controls to hit a single enemy. The same can be said with switching between the three characters you are usually found playing in a single level; sometimes when you try to switch to a character right in front of you, it'll switch to a character that may be in a different direction, causing some frustration.\nSome of the dialogue and voices in the game sound quite low quality, but this seems to only be the case with a few of the voices.\nThe story is as simple as "Found a special artifact, villians steal it, must get it back" but it's done in quite a funny little way.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good game, looks sexy and quite worth the pricetag (although it can go down to $5 on sales).","April 17, 2014","true","14.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are tons of characters and vehicles to collect from throughout the Marvel Universe, It does get a bit repetitive if you intend to go for the 100% like I did, but that's just an excuse to use the vast amount of playable characters at your disposal.","June 17, 2014","true","47.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cydran/recommended/249130/","Cydran","👌 Cydran 👌","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cydran/","768 products in account","I've never been a fan of the Marvel Universe -- if anything, I was a fan of Spider-Man (yet only slighty).\nI've been a fan of LEGO since I was a little babbie.\nWhen you combine these two, what do you get? You get an interested Cydran.\n\nTo begin, I need to point out this game does not support mouse controls, however I do recommend using a controller when playing pretty much any of these LEGO games.\nThe game itself has wonderful looking visuals, with a nice gloss effect on the characters and certain objects in the unique environments. Every level is designed differently as the LEGO games usually promise.\nAs per usual with these games, there is a massive amount of characters available to play as, heroes and villians from the MARVEL franchise included. Once you unlock a character, you need to buy it with studs, which you obtain through playing the levels of the game (or even through free roaming around the city).\nThis leads me to the free-roam side of the game. After levels, you'll be taken back to the city in which you can explore as you wish. Side quests are available to complete with Gold Bricks as the reward.\nOne part of the game that I think lacks is the combat system. It's the same with every LEGO game but I feel it doesn't flow well, and at often times you're stuck fighting with the controls to hit a single enemy. The same can be said with switching between the three characters you are usually found playing in a single level; sometimes when you try to switch to a character right in front of you, it'll switch to a character that may be in a different direction, causing some frustration.\nSome of the dialogue and voices in the game sound quite low quality, but this seems to only be the case with a few of the voices.\nThe story is as simple as "Found a special artifact, villians steal it, must get it back" but it's done in quite a funny little way.\n\nAll in all, it's a pretty good game, looks sexy and quite worth the pricetag (although it can go down to $5 on sales).","April 17, 2014","true","14.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's got so much variation - in the levels, in the free play, and in the storyline that it just never gets old. I completed this game 100% and got all the Steam achievements, so I uninstalled it, and I was quite sad that I couldn't play it any more. Then I found the DLC! A great little bonus. The newer Hobbit game had great levels but quickly became tedious in free play. The Lego Harry Potter games are a very close second for me, because unlike Marvel the free play is quite tricky to navigate in. But I'm a big HP fan so perhaps I'm biased towards that. That said, I'm also a bit LOTR/Hobbit fan, and neither of those games are even close to Marvel Super Heroes.\nMy verdict: if you are going to buy any Lego game, make sure it's this one.","June 20, 2014","true","34.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The map is surprisingly large, and there are a lot of missions and new characters to unlock. I got the game for $5 during a sale, but its easily worth double that with the game play and open world.

The hub, Manhatten, is awesome and very big. Lots of streets to drive on and lots of cars, many fast ones. There are many air vehicles also. Each character has their own ability and specials they do to people while they're fighting. I hope LEGO® The Hobbit™ will be a lot like this game, in Middle Earth... no cars and stuff... Instead, horses! Anyway, I really like this game, I knew it would be fun, everyone's been talking about it, but it was more fun than I expected! It is worth buying. :) The Asgard character pack is awesome, but I wish Sif could throw her sword, like Gamora. Maybe her symbol on what she's going to throw it at could be the same as Thor's, the Asgard symbol, but silver and without lightning. :) I wish there was a DLC for a few other characters, Loki with his black outfit and his other outfit but without the helmet, and Deadpool normal clothes. And I wish Loki's clothes were in the character creator and hair like Viper's and Malekith's but black, I would use it for Loki. :) It's a really fun game, worth getting. :)","December 31, 2013","true","384.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is so fun it is unbelievable, the music is kickass and it every Marvel fan just hit the jackpot with a game with a massive roster of characters and a lot of awesome villains. You will love this game so much if you like games in general. While it certainly is easy and lacks quite a bit of challenge, this certainly isn't a pass by any means and you should get it without a shadow of a doubt. After playing it for about 3 hours on PC, I can tell you this game is absolutely awesome.\n\nIs the PC version good, though? Well, yes. And, kinda. With a spice of no. It barely has any options to tweak graphical settings, and it has some weird problems. I can play it at 720p at about 400fps but then you switch it to 1080p and things mess up. For some reason, during some cutscenes, the game drops in frames. It certainly is not game breaking, but you will notice it and it is really weird.\nThe controls are absolutely awful but thankfully you can change them to make the game playable. Also, I was able to play the game with a controller -- you can play it with pretty much any controller, including Xbox 360/One controllers.\n\nThe story is pretty decent, the game is a heck ton of fun and you will have a blast.\nI don't regret buying this at £3.74 at all.","November 21, 2015","true","9.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Maybe this could be a cons for someone, you are forced to play it twice because there's no way to unlock everything with the first set of super heroes you have in each level in the first playthrough.\n\n20 hours on it and still 75% to go. The main story it's only like 20% of the game, you have a ton of side activities like races, destroy/killing X things in some amount of time, items to collect, characters to unlock, help citizens in distress who needs you to find his monkey (!), common things in the life if a superhero.\n\nSadly it doesn't have online coop only local. Btw, I really liked the split screen (maybe it's something common, but I don't usually play local coop)\n\nDuring story playthrough I got two breaking bugs that forced me to start the level all over, it was a bit frustrating at the moment but in the end, it's so funny to play that I really didn't care of them.\n\nOne thing I didn't get is that you can save in each checkpoint, but the time I did a save and exit, when I loaded the game again I had to start the level from the beginning, so, really don't know what's the point of that save there.\n\nThis being an open world game was a surprise, I really didn't have any idea when I got this, I thought it was just a story with LEGO figures, how wrong I was.\n\nIf you like Marvel don't doubt it, you'll love it.","June 12, 2014","true","23.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/249130/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","A very fun game when I didn't think it would be. I figured it got good reviews and the gameplay looked good so I would give it a try for $5. I have put a lot of time into it now and always am having fun. It can be very cryptic at times during a stage until you get the hang of what the game wants you to do exactly, which for a Lego game shouldn't be so difficult to figure out basic things to advance a level. I have put a bunch of time into going around the city and unlocking new guys and replaying stages on free play to unlock the level secrets. One big problem with the game that I did not figure out until I googled it was how to switch characters while in the city. After coming out of a mission it locks you into two characters and you can't hold Y to switch. Until I researched it, I had no idea that I was supposed to first go to a blue vehicle/character machine to set the game to after you switch that way to then allow you to switch simply by holding Y. It makes no sense and should not be that way. There are a ton of characters to unlock, 100 total I think, a lot I've never even heard of. I just use Hulk and Human Torch most of the time because Hulk can run faster than any other character and can smash up levels and enemies much quicker, and the Human Torch is the easiest go-to flying character on the screen when I can't remember exactly who can fly and who can't. I just unlocked my favorite Marvel guy of all time, Magneto, and thankfully he is fun to play as. The game also has my four other favorites as well; Juggernaut, Carnage, Venom, and of course Hulk. Yay!\n\nOnly Marvel super fans will want to sit and unlock all 100 chars, although needless to say, there is so much to do in this game that I have almost 30 hours in and still haven't unlocked all the characters. I haven't even finished story mode yet because I have spent so much time running around the city and unlocking things.\n\nThe combat, sound, music, effects, story, script, and graphics are all fitting of a Lego game. It looks and performs very smoothly. The only real major complaint I have with the game is that the flying controls for some characters suck bad. I know exactly how the flying controls work, they just simply suck ♥♥♥. The characters that don't control well are the ones who have the ability to fly fast, which so far have been Thor, Human Torch, Iron Man, and Wizard. So it's only true for a few characters, but still annoying since it is the fastest way in the game to get around.\n\nOf all the more challenging action and permadeath games I play, this is a nice casual game I can just relax and play without worrying about dying. Probably the most fun casual action game I've ever played. Worth it on sale but also at regular price if it is $20 or less.\n\n9/10 very good relaxing fun","November 28, 2014","true","29.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soliunasm/recommended/249130/","soliunasm","soliunasm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soliunasm/","258 products in account","What an absolutely wonderful game. For anyone who has ever played the Lego games before, this is a giant step up, particularly if you haven't played since the early games like I have.  They added voice acting, open world, more detail, just everything.\n\nThe amount of characters you can unlock is staggering, and they even group characters that are the same. So the variants of Iron Man are all in one rotating selection rather than separate characters themselves to pad out the character list that's already enormous. The open world of New York is amazingly fun to go through, and the game gives you many ways to go about it. The voice acting is top notch, they even managed to get Clark Gregg to reprise his role as Coulson, although having James Arnold Taylor as Spiderman was a bit offputting at first, kept seeing Ratchet instead of Spiderman.\n\nNew York has many side-quests for you to do to unlock new characters, vehicles, and Gold Bricks, many of which require you to get new powers to obtain them so you can't get them all in one go. The streets are littered with attention, constant amounts of Studs placed around for you to pick up, with each area having completely different patterns and placements so no two buildings are the same. Really appreciate the time the folks who placed those put into it. You can hijack cars, although they're much slower than any form of transportation you already have, and drive into other cars, drive like a maniac, etc. But since it's a Lego game the characters don't break apart, they mainly just fall down and yell at you to watch where you're going.\n\nSide-quests by themselves are pretty standard, either you go pick something up, fight a wave of enemies, escort someone through the open streets, or race someone. The best part of them is honestly the starting and ending comments the characters make, and that makes up for the monotony of the whole thing.\n\nThe writing is great, tons of jokes for kids, tons of jokes for comic fans, tons of jokes for adults, tons of everything for everyone to enjoy. The writing is also really aided by the silly things characters do in the background, like The Hulk sweeping things, or Coulson making jumps to save things Fury threw away, etc. SDeadpool can get to be pretty annoying, but I understand that's his entire thing, so I can deal with it, while Spiderman can be annoying at the start but ends up being enjoyable. Iron Man/Tony Stark is by far my favorite character along with The Thing, they both were great.\n\nThe story levels are very enjoyable from a writing standpoint. It's really nice to hear the silly banter between characters and see them in the cutscenes. The levels feel alright, they're basically just "Find a way to get this guy over here so you can get him to open something up for the other guy to open up" over and over without much change throughout the entire game.\n\nRegarding gameplay, the fighting is the same as it always has been, mashing X to win, although the bosses seem to be way draw out this time. All bosses amount to spending ages waiting to hit them for one damage on their 3-6 heart health bar and then they fly away for a while and taunt you while sending a bunch of mooks your way. There's really no penalty at all for dying, you basically just lose 1,000 Studs which is absolutely nothing even from the start, and there's Extras to increase your four hearts to five as well. The actual use of the characters is fantastic though, any characters with flight, particularly Iron Man, are a joy to use pretty much anywhere and especially in the overworld. You get to go super fast and doing things like falling to the ground and boosting straight through the street never gets old.\n\nNow, the game does have its own share of problems. The draw distance is very poor, you will see stuff in terribly low resolutions on anything pretty much two buildings away even on high. The top of the Empire State Building has its spire and the "fins"(Pardon me, don't know the exact name of those things) in some horribly low quality even when you're standing right next to it. In certain Free Play levels(5 for me) you can get stuck in elevators during area transitions, so you can't progress anymore because one character gets stuck in an infinite death loop and you can't switch or get them out in any way. Save and Quit sometimes fixes it, but not guaranteed. Help messages are a constant if you put subtitles on. They will never go away, they will always show up, even when you've beaten the game unless you turn off the subtitles. Getting stuck in items is very common, I would get stuck in boxes, walls, or sink into the floor at times which would require to either switch to another character and then wait a few seconds for the AI to teleport to me, or save and quit to fix it. The driving is completely awful, you turn so sharply that it's hard to control things and get caught up on the slightest of ledges in certain vehicles which makes the racing missing just that much harder. The AI pathing is awful. If you don't give the character an Iron Man(Or sometimes, even when you do) they will end up running into a corner for eternity because they can't get out. This is especially bad when they're Spiderman-type characters because they will get in a "Jump on wall --> Fall down --> Run at wall --> Repeat" pattern.\n\n\nAll in all, this is a wonderful game. It's extremely charming, appeals to pretty much everyone, and even though it's quite easy and repetitive it knows how to hit all the sweet spots, whether you're a comic book fan or not. You also owe it to yourself to try out Iron Man at least once, flying as him is amazing and done perfectly.","April 20, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love Lego games and this is by far the best so far.  I wish there had been more of the voice actors from the movies, but the replacements do a reasonable job.  In addition to the main story line of missions, it has a bunch of additional shorter missions that are unlocked through the collection of gold bricks.  A much better reason for collecting gold bricks than in previous games.  Also, taking a page from the Lego Harry Potter "Student In Peril" mechanic, the game has 50 "Stan Lee in Peril".  Hearing the father of Marvel comics uttering his classic "Excelsior!" or other amusing breaking-the-fourth-wall quips never gets old.  Speaking of breaking the fourth wall: Deadpool.  He's in it alot.  I'm pretty sure I spotted him in every single stage, "Where's Waldo" style.  He also has plenty of amusing dialogues.  The only other character I have to mention is Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson.  It starts out cool to hear his now iconic voice, but since he bascially acts as the in-game help system that can't be turned off, it quickly gets annoying.  I'm almost at 100% and he's still telling me basic mechanics like "big figures can pull green handles".  Why they couldn't just add an option to turn off help in the menu is beyond me.  The game has an incredibly full roster with 150 characters and I was very surprised at the number of variations of combat moves in the group.  My only real disappointment was the lack of several popular characters like Quicksilver, Scarlett Witch, Namor and others, while they included less popular (and boring) characters like Kurse, Absorbing Man and Beetle.  I don't know what the thinking there was.  But overall I think this is a great game, tons of fun, and a must play for Lego and Marvel fans alike.","May 14, 2014","true","42.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It would be great if they have dlc's that enable us to add more maps to the current game map so we can roam in new places. maybe to that island in chapter 12... or a passage way to Asgard or some rocket to the space station. it would be better if this were in the main game.\n\nnew, 31/10/14- They should add a DLC including the following characters i mention, that i thought should have been in the game due to their popularity and importance: Apocalypse, Ultron, the Vision, Quicksilver, Scarlett Witch & Kang the Conqueror\n\ngreat game overall...\n\n9.7/10","October 5, 2014","true","44.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soliunasm/recommended/249130/","soliunasm","soliunasm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soliunasm/","258 products in account","What an absolutely wonderful game. For anyone who has ever played the Lego games before, this is a giant step up, particularly if you haven't played since the early games like I have.  They added voice acting, open world, more detail, just everything.\n\nThe amount of characters you can unlock is staggering, and they even group characters that are the same. So the variants of Iron Man are all in one rotating selection rather than separate characters themselves to pad out the character list that's already enormous. The open world of New York is amazingly fun to go through, and the game gives you many ways to go about it. The voice acting is top notch, they even managed to get Clark Gregg to reprise his role as Coulson, although having James Arnold Taylor as Spiderman was a bit offputting at first, kept seeing Ratchet instead of Spiderman.\n\nNew York has many side-quests for you to do to unlock new characters, vehicles, and Gold Bricks, many of which require you to get new powers to obtain them so you can't get them all in one go. The streets are littered with attention, constant amounts of Studs placed around for you to pick up, with each area having completely different patterns and placements so no two buildings are the same. Really appreciate the time the folks who placed those put into it. You can hijack cars, although they're much slower than any form of transportation you already have, and drive into other cars, drive like a maniac, etc. But since it's a Lego game the characters don't break apart, they mainly just fall down and yell at you to watch where you're going.\n\nSide-quests by themselves are pretty standard, either you go pick something up, fight a wave of enemies, escort someone through the open streets, or race someone. The best part of them is honestly the starting and ending comments the characters make, and that makes up for the monotony of the whole thing.\n\nThe writing is great, tons of jokes for kids, tons of jokes for comic fans, tons of jokes for adults, tons of everything for everyone to enjoy. The writing is also really aided by the silly things characters do in the background, like The Hulk sweeping things, or Coulson making jumps to save things Fury threw away, etc. SDeadpool can get to be pretty annoying, but I understand that's his entire thing, so I can deal with it, while Spiderman can be annoying at the start but ends up being enjoyable. Iron Man/Tony Stark is by far my favorite character along with The Thing, they both were great.\n\nThe story levels are very enjoyable from a writing standpoint. It's really nice to hear the silly banter between characters and see them in the cutscenes. The levels feel alright, they're basically just "Find a way to get this guy over here so you can get him to open something up for the other guy to open up" over and over without much change throughout the entire game.\n\nRegarding gameplay, the fighting is the same as it always has been, mashing X to win, although the bosses seem to be way draw out this time. All bosses amount to spending ages waiting to hit them for one damage on their 3-6 heart health bar and then they fly away for a while and taunt you while sending a bunch of mooks your way. There's really no penalty at all for dying, you basically just lose 1,000 Studs which is absolutely nothing even from the start, and there's Extras to increase your four hearts to five as well. The actual use of the characters is fantastic though, any characters with flight, particularly Iron Man, are a joy to use pretty much anywhere and especially in the overworld. You get to go super fast and doing things like falling to the ground and boosting straight through the street never gets old.\n\nNow, the game does have its own share of problems. The draw distance is very poor, you will see stuff in terribly low resolutions on anything pretty much two buildings away even on high. The top of the Empire State Building has its spire and the "fins"(Pardon me, don't know the exact name of those things) in some horribly low quality even when you're standing right next to it. In certain Free Play levels(5 for me) you can get stuck in elevators during area transitions, so you can't progress anymore because one character gets stuck in an infinite death loop and you can't switch or get them out in any way. Save and Quit sometimes fixes it, but not guaranteed. Help messages are a constant if you put subtitles on. They will never go away, they will always show up, even when you've beaten the game unless you turn off the subtitles. Getting stuck in items is very common, I would get stuck in boxes, walls, or sink into the floor at times which would require to either switch to another character and then wait a few seconds for the AI to teleport to me, or save and quit to fix it. The driving is completely awful, you turn so sharply that it's hard to control things and get caught up on the slightest of ledges in certain vehicles which makes the racing missing just that much harder. The AI pathing is awful. If you don't give the character an Iron Man(Or sometimes, even when you do) they will end up running into a corner for eternity because they can't get out. This is especially bad when they're Spiderman-type characters because they will get in a "Jump on wall --> Fall down --> Run at wall --> Repeat" pattern.\n\n\nAll in all, this is a wonderful game. It's extremely charming, appeals to pretty much everyone, and even though it's quite easy and repetitive it knows how to hit all the sweet spots, whether you're a comic book fan or not. You also owe it to yourself to try out Iron Man at least once, flying as him is amazing and done perfectly.","April 20, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flinchmeister/recommended/249130/","flinchmeister","flinch1031","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flinchmeister/","145 products in account","Review time! This time we're discussing LEGO Marvel Superheroes. I'll give you the breakdown of the goods and bads of this game. So lets hop right in.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIf you are familiar with the LEGO games, this one does not differ. LEGO games are one of the few games that are rated E that really are enjoyable to everyone. It doesn't matter how old you are, this game is fun. Like all LEGO games, this game is packed full of puzzles, cheesy one-liners, and a huge range of playable characters.\n\nPROS\n\nThis game is entertaining through and through. Both the campaign and the side missions are fun to play. The open world is huge and there's around 136 playable characters to collect (You can even be Stan Lee, who has several superpowers) along with a bunch of vehicles. Deadpool is one of the rarest characters in the game and has his own set of missions that need completed in order to unlock. Like all LEGO games, you can play campaign missions over again with any character you would like (and you'll need to do so if you are looking to 100% the game). Achieving 100% is usually the primary goal of the LEGO games, but many people just play whenever they feel like. I have not quite achieved 100% but I do intend to in the future. As far as the Marvel aspect goes, the characters/storyline do not necessarily follow the movies or comics. This does not take away from the experience at all (unless you're one of those weird die-hard comic guys). You can find almost every character thinkable in the Marvel Universe (except for a few, but I can't think of any off the top of my head).\n\nCONS\n\nThere aren't many cons, but there are definitely some that need noted. LEGO games have NEVER been meant for PC, there are a set of PC controls, but they are awkward, and don't even use the mouse. If you're going to play this game, I HIGHLY recommend using a gamepad. If you don't have a gamepad, don't worry, the game is still playable, the controls are just going to take some getting used to.\n\nAnother thing about controls, while flying, if you run into the side of a building, you will come to a jolting halt and the camera will be a bit weird in adjusting. As you improve your flying skills, you'll run into this problem (no pun intended) less and less.\n\nThe other large con is that you cannot kill civilians in the open world, which is a real shame. While there are enemies in the open world, you can only fight them during side missions or while at The Raft (The prison). This is very disappointing, but I heard it might've been required to maintain the game's E rating. Still, a shame.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThis game is super fun. If you are a Marvel fan, or loved the other LEGO games, or both, then you really need to get this game. Even if you haven't played a LEGO game before, I recommend you give it a try. Pick it up on sale if you can, but I paid full price and have #noregrets.\n\nLiked the review? Let me know by hitting the thumbs up button below.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/recommended/249130/","arborday","arbor day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/","595 products in account","I'm gonna try something different and start this off with all the problems I have with this game.\n\nTHERE IS NO SHUMA-GORATH.\n\nAt its heart, this is a childrens game. That means there are going to be hint messages popping up nonstop. They will quickly get annoying, telling you things you have already proven through gameplay that you know how to do. There's no option to shut these off, and besides cluttering up the screen nonstop, this ruins a lot of moments that you might have to think for a few seconds over which character you should be using for something.\n\nAnother thing you can't skip are the cut scenes. Even when you go back and replay a level in free play mode (as required in these games if you want to get completion) you will have to sit through the majority of the cut scenes. Rarely, it will let you skip one here and there while the rest offer no such option. I'm guessing this has to do with the cut scene in question being an in game cut scene, which many are, or an actual video that gets played.\n\nThere is no online multiplayer. How the hell is this a thing developers still leave out? Not only does including drop in / drop out multiplay make your game more fun, but it means I will be playing it much more once I complete everything.\n\nThe fighting mechanics really need some work. Characters automatically lock on to other characters, which means it is not uncommon to be trying to break an object while your hero constantly punches a harmless npc to death. This is sloppy on the development side, and really doesn't go with the whole "hero" thing they are trying to do with this game.\n\nThe flying controls are also pretty bad. They will not so much block your progress as annoy you here and there. Flying close to the ground can result in landing when you had no intention to do so, and pitching up or down can be cumbersome and lead to you overshooting your desired position.\n\nThe developer seems to have no interest in patching any of the issues people have with the game.\n\nYou'll notice I still recommended the game. That's because it's a great entry to the LEGO series. Granted, I've missed a couple releases (I'll talk about why in a bit), but this changes a lot of the older design choices that were present in the first few titles. There's a real hub now, instead of just a room with doors that lead to various levels. You can run (fly, stomp, drive, whatever) around New York city, doing little sidequests for various NPCs, unlocking vehicles, or collecting studs. You can also return to the shield Helicarrier for other things to do, although it's much smaller in area than the hub is. The hub map can be used to replay levels, so you don't have to run back to the levels location.\n\nThere are an amazing amount of playable characters here. You'll most likely run into characters that you will have to look up on wikipedia, as you may have never seen some of the more obscure ones. Howard The Duck even shows up. Sadly, some favorites are missing from the roster. No Shuma-Gorath? Really? Come on, LEGO. You did the tendrils on Venom and Carnage, why couldn't you have done Shuma's tentacles?  Still, Carnage is a nice addition that I wasn't really expecting. I thought they would have focused more on the characters that the general public was aware of from the movies.\n\nIf you hadn't played a title in this series for a few years, as was my case, one of the first things you will notice is that the characters have voices now. I'm still not really sure how I feel about this. As far as I know, this started with Lord of the Rings. It's the reason I passed on picking up that title. While they aren't badly done, and allow deeper story telling, I feel the voices take away from some of the charm and silliness that the older silent figures.\n\nThere's a lot to do here, and the hidden levels are interesting enough to want to seek out. The LEGO series has been around long enough that you probably know if these are your kind of thing or not. If they are, this is one of the better ones and worth picking up. If not, you may want to wait for a sale. This title goes on sale for five dollars on Humble Bundle and some other sites, so don't pay the full 20 dollar price tag here if you aren't dying for some LEGO fix.","May 20, 2014","true","46.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eeuwit/recommended/249130/","Eeuwit","Eeuwit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eeuwit/","87 products in account","Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a great Lego game that holds hours of content.\n\n>Story:\n\nThe game has his own story that is not based on any of the Marvel Universe movies or comics. Because it is not based on any movie or comic you will find a lot of heroes combining in diffirent teams which you have to use to solve puzzles and fight through heaps of enemies and super villains.\n\nThe puzzles are well made and integrated into the story. Some puzzles might be a bit too hard for children, because the solution is not always showed immediatly. These harder puzzles do make it more entertaining for teenagers and mature people.\n\n>Gameplay:\n\nThe Gameplay is nice and smooth, you don't need to have a very expensive PC to have nice graphics and good performance. One of the bad, yet importent thing in the gameplay is the fighting. Each hero or villain has his own special auto attacks that he or she will use from time to time.\n\nThe auto moves are often not fluently when you are fighting and you down with what you are doing. In my opinion the moves look great, but they should take less time to finish or way to snap out of it since it can get frustrating when you are fighting a boss and there are a lot of enemies to kill.\n\nBesides this the game is great! The game features a great open world based on New York City that you can explore, discover, collect and help people in. In this open world there are story mission implemented. Aswell as in the story missions and the open world you can collect gold bricks which unlock the special missions of Deadpool. All these things will make sure that you are at least 30-40 hours busy to just get all levels and then there is still not everything in the game done.\n\nAnother great feature of this game is that it supports nearly every controler. I plugged in my PS3 and PS4 controller and they both work with the game. The keyboard controls are not very friendly to use. Especially when you are playing with a friend so the ability to plug in two controllers and go is just great.\n\n>Characters:\n\nOne thing I liked a lot about this game is that it features nearly every character in the Marvel Universe. Since this is a thing the movie world has problems with I found it great to play with aswell Iron Man and Wolverine. The game is also made in a way where diffirent characters need to use their abilities to help their team mates. It is impossible to do one level with just 1 character.\n\n>Final Verdict:\n\nThe game is great and gives you more than enough content to play with for the price you are buying it for.  I recommend this game to everyone that likes Lego, Marvel or just puzzle games in general. I am still having a great experience with this game and I love the controller support which makes it so easy to play with my friend.\n\n9.5 / 10","January 31, 2015","true","31.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However it still had some shortcomings, especially if you plan on 100% completion. The fetch quests try to live up to Lego Lord of the Rings, but are ultimately dull and poorly done. However, the races are done a lot better than they were done in Lego Batman 2, and compared to Lego Batman 2, this game is definitely superior. I wouldn't put it too high on my list of favorite lego games, but it's definitely still good. I would strongly recommend this if you're just interested in the story and don't care too much about 100% completion. If you do care for that, I'd recommend Lego Lord of the Rings. 7/10.\n","June 29, 2014","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Heaps of the Marvel characters are playable. Game only _really_ needs two playthroughs.\nBad bits: Many of the (freeplay) side missions are repetitive, boiling down to 'cabby', 'fetch', 'race', 'destroy', and 'obstacle course' (my least favourite). No 'skip' function for Deadpool's intro's (funny, for sure, but once is enough).\nMain story: Made as much sense as any real-world Marvel (or DC for that matter) story. :)\nOther stuff: I loved the inclusion of so many of the Marvel minor players (Squirrel Girl!!). I would've preferred Deadpool was playable from the get-go (but that's me - he's one of my favourite characters). For a game aimed at little kids, I think some of the missions and puzzles were extremely tough, possibly impossible without a very patient teen or adult 'helper'. That said, I had fun.

There's 136 Marvel characters in this game, many with alternate costumes. In-between the story chapters, you have a chance to play around in Manhattan. Here you can use the various heroes and abilities you've unlocked to explore the city, do side-missions, help citizens, and unlock even more heroes and villains. Despite being made out of Lego bricks, most of the environments are pretty impressive. The music is crazy epic for a game featuring Lego characters and would fit in any Marvel film. Finishing the game's story mode is only a tiny fraction of the game. There's a lot to explore and you'll need to collect everything to unlock Deadpool. Set aside some time for Lego Marvel.","December 30, 2013","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a lot of characters to unlock, as well as New York City to explore. I would recommend this game because it has a lot of content to explore and some new features that the other LEGO games didn't have, including another way to obtain red bricks and more entertainment. There are a couple of down-sides though, such as controlling flight; I find it to be quite difficult.  But overall, another fantastic game from LEGO!","September 26, 2014","true","32.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had opened the game, and jumped straight into a level, presuming this was similar to one of their earlier titles, LEGO Star Wars which was mostly just pick a mission and get started. Oh, but this was not that. After I had finished the mission, the game rather quickly decided to show me that this game was nothing short from a sandbox game where you could play your favourite super hero and run, or fly around the city, doing missions and beating up bad guys and whatever else the citizens needed your help with.\n\nThe sandbox element was a great implementation, and certainly increases the lifespan of this game, along with all the collectibles you can get and all the super heroes you can unlock. Which, brings me onto my next point.\n\nThis is a pretty big game, and it's no secret that it will be much more fun with freinds or family, of all ages I should add. The game isn't too hard to get a handle on, there's no gore, no obscene situations that could get you in trouble, and whether you're 8 or 80, you can enjoy this game. The younger audience will be a fan of the fun, enjoyable combat, the cool super heroes and even the humour, and so will anybody else, along with some more adult-esque jokes that won't necessarily be understood by the younger lot, but it won't stop anybody else having a nice little chuckle.\n\nOverall, this is a great LEGO game, and a great game in general for that matter. Loads of content, suitable for pretty much all ages, and an all around good, fun time.","September 25, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So much effort has been put into Lego games as of late that they're really worth checking out, and this may be the best one yet.\n\nIt's an open world manhattan island, in which you can run around as almost anyone you want from the marvel universe, whether you're swinging between tall buildings as spiderman, smashing cars as juggernaut and or recreating your favourite moments on sheild's sky carrier as nick fury, it's all a blast. Obviously it's not as gritty as other sandbox games like GTA, but you can steal cars, even though you feel pretty silly doing it when many characters can fly.\n\nThe gameplay is half action half puzzle, so boss fights are rarely about who can punch who the hardest and much more about how can you leverage the environment to best your foes. It leans hevaily on the Lego dynamic, requiring you in many cases to build solutions to your problems from the rubble caused by the fights themselves, all the while battling increasing numbers of super powered minions to boot. This does get in the way once or twice as boss characters were left standing in the middle of the map, completely invulnerable while I ran around looking for stuff to build. However, once I got into the puzzle frame of mind, these things didn't stand out as much. It's not dark souls after all; once I stopped waiting to backstab the red skull while he was reloading things moved on a little quicker.\n\nLevels are well thought out on the whole with puzzles that require you to switch characters and work as a team; often one character will need to open the way up for the others who can't traverse a particular section yet. Sometimes this feels a little contrived as there are switches which only be opened by Captain America's sheild or Wolverine's claws; probably not the best feature to have inside your evil lair is it Dr Doom? However the game is varied and fast paced enough to keep this from breaking up the flow too much.\n\nThe main draw here is the attention to detail that's been put into creating the Marvel universe, each of the characters make jokes and references to their joint past, especially as shown in the recent films, and it gives a real sense of continuity to the storyline. While it builds on the recent movies, the story itself is completely new. It ties together a vast array of charcters, tying them together in interesting, if not always surprising ways. I think this was pulled off better than in Arkham city, which felt more like a parade of characters, whereas LMSH has the usual suspects joining forces and advancing the plot a little more seamlessly.\n\nIf you're a fan of Marvel give it a bash, the jokes are actually pretty good and the amount of Marvel-y stuff to do will definately keep you entertained. It's not gritty or particularly deep but blasting your way around the New York skyline as your favourite superhero actually doesn't get tiring too quickly.","May 18, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It leans hevaily on the Lego dynamic, requiring you in many cases to build solutions to your problems from the rubble caused by the fights themselves, all the while battling increasing numbers of super powered minions to boot. This does get in the way once or twice as boss characters were left standing in the middle of the map, completely invulnerable while I ran around looking for stuff to build. However, once I got into the puzzle frame of mind, these things didn't stand out as much. It's not dark souls after all; once I stopped waiting to backstab the red skull while he was reloading things moved on a little quicker.\n\nLevels are well thought out on the whole with puzzles that require you to switch characters and work as a team; often one character will need to open the way up for the others who can't traverse a particular section yet. Sometimes this feels a little contrived as there are switches which only be opened by Captain America's sheild or Wolverine's claws; probably not the best feature to have inside your evil lair is it Dr Doom? However the game is varied and fast paced enough to keep this from breaking up the flow too much.\n\nThe main draw here is the attention to detail that's been put into creating the Marvel universe, each of the characters make jokes and references to their joint past, especially as shown in the recent films, and it gives a real sense of continuity to the storyline. While it builds on the recent movies, the story itself is completely new. It ties together a vast array of charcters, tying them together in interesting, if not always surprising ways. I think this was pulled off better than in Arkham city, which felt more like a parade of characters, whereas LMSH has the usual suspects joining forces and advancing the plot a little more seamlessly.\n\nIf you're a fan of Marvel give it a bash, the jokes are actually pretty good and the amount of Marvel-y stuff to do will definately keep you entertained. It's not gritty or particularly deep but blasting your way around the New York skyline as your favourite superhero actually doesn't get tiring too quickly.","May 18, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They all have roughly similar gameplay dynamics - each figure has special attributes that you use to negotiate the level (use Human Torch to melt ice, use Thor's lightning to jumpstart an electric turbine), then you come back through again with your choice of characters and you can do more things to unlock more characters and rewards.\n\nA solid, entertaining romp, largely targeted at the 6-10 set.  The game offers a reasonably large cast of Marvel heroes, including pretty much every one of the company's heroes to ever make it to film, from Blade to the X-Men to Spider-Man to the Guardians of the Galaxy.  It's all set around a LEGO-scale openworld recreation of Manhattan, which is pretty entertaining in and of itself.  You can unlock various vehicles and race through the streets, or do the various game missions, all of which have at least two playthroughs to ensure you find all the goodies.\n\nThe plot in this one is wafer-thin.  Baddies Loki and Doctor Doom are up to no good, assembling a doomsday device, the goodies have to team up to stop them, blah blah blah.  The point of the game is to get your favorite heroes and bash them together in a lovely digital toybox, and the game succeeds at that.  Some of the puzzles might be a little too complicated for younger players, and the controls can be a bit prickly, especially on the "racing" missions.\n\nStill, a nice gateway drug if you're looking to take your young one into the dangerous world of 100% completing games...","July 16, 2015","true","80.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't play through LEGO LotR/Batman 2, and maybe that was an issue in those games as well because of the open world, but in all other LEGO games I found those sections of manipulating the world with new characters to be the best aspect of them. In this, it's a lot of escort quests (that are infuriating because you have to run along side whichever character you're escorting back to the start of the mission) or helping another hero kill some kind of enemy. Collecting the character and vehicle tokens around the world is a little bit more enjoyable, but it's not enough to save what I thought was the most fun part of some of the other LEGO games.\n\nAll that said, the story and Deadpool bonus levels are loads of fun, and Traveller's Tales proves yet again that they can construct a game which stands on its own without relying on another storyline in the property. It's still well worth your time and money, I just didn't enjoy the extra content as much as I have in the past.","January 14, 2014","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me a while, but I managed to finish this game in 100%. It wasn't a walk in the Central Park, though.\n\nI really enjoyed the main storyline and Deadpool stories and even going back through all levels with different mix of heroes and villains to get every possible collectible was quite fun. Especially when some characters have very unique special attacks, which keeps things interesting.\n\nOn the other hand, the free roam on the streets of Manhattan felt more like a chore. The sub-quests for citizens and heroes quickly become repetitive. I suppose the racing quests were supposed to keep things fresh, but, because of dreadful controls, those were an utter failure. Driving races are just so-so, you can do them when you accustom yourself with how the vehicle reacts to a controller. The flying is just frustrating. The idea of using acceleration and free-fall buttons to adjust height must have come from a mind of a sadist.\n\nLet me explain how flying (not) works: to fly upwards, you press A button, but if you double tap it, the flying hero goes into hyper-fast flight (usually in the wrong direction). Similarly, to fly downwards you press B button, but if you double tap it, you loose all speed and just drop to the ground (dragging the camera with you).\n\nOverall it's a good game, but it has it's flaws. Because of it's flawed controls, I enjoyed only main missions part of this game, so I don't think it's really worth full retail price. It's best to wait for some kind of sale or a price drop.","January 5, 2014","true","46.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a very charming story that strikes the perfect balance between Marvel comic-like story and the Lego humour we've come to expect from these games. The character animations are something to marvel at in this game too (mind the pun), they're incredibly well made and give each character their own unique feel. Talking about characters, you will certainly not be left underwhelmed by the sheer amount of them they're are! And if you can sometimes be a completionist (like me) then you'll want to get every last one of them. The open-word area of the game that you'll find yourself exploring makes the game feel more alive than it otherwise would be without it and from my own experience I can say that flying around New York as Ironman, Thor or any of the flying characters is highly enjoyable. Oh and how could I forget, Deadpool is hilarious.\n\nTo summarise, this game really is suitable for people of any age.

The story is exciting and different. A usual good vs evil conflict with classic characters ending with some awesome plot twists. Through the whole story which took me about 8 hours to complete you don't see the same level repeting itself. The different locations you go to always keep it exciting, but the one flaw I have about the story is the lack of characters used in it. You play as majoy heroes and fight major villians, but never the less known characters. Deadpool likes to hide around the levels which was dissapointing because he would have added some great lines, which you get to see at the end. In the game you get to explore an open city with notable cities like Stark Tower, X-Men Manor, Avengers Mansion, Baxtor Building and many more. Even better is that there are hours of side quests to unlock new characters and vehicles. They don't take to long either so it can be fun for a short session. The characters you can unlock are amazing, big characters like the Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man and Carnage to small unknown characters like Squirrel Girl and AIM Henchmen. Hours upon hours can go into this game without it feeling like you're doing the same thing over and over. Only two complaints I had throughout the game is the lack of characters in the story, and lack of DLC. The DLC contained big characters like Thanos but LEGO for some reason doesn't like DLC on PC. Other then that, best LEGO game ever, and best Marvel game in a long long time. 9.5/10","November 28, 2013","true","29.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However it still had some shortcomings, especially if you plan on 100% completion. The fetch quests try to live up to Lego Lord of the Rings, but are ultimately dull and poorly done. However, the races are done a lot better than they were done in Lego Batman 2, and compared to Lego Batman 2, this game is definitely superior. I wouldn't put it too high on my list of favorite lego games, but it's definitely still good. I would strongly recommend this if you're just interested in the story and don't care too much about 100% completion. If you do care for that, I'd recommend Lego Lord of the Rings. 7/10.\n","June 29, 2014","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a huge Marvel comics fan, and being able to play as my favorite heroes and villans (together!) is a blast. The main story is kind of short in my opinion, but that doesn't mean the game gets boring. I am maybe close to half way through, and new missions keep popping up. It is really fun trying to unlock all the characters in the game (which is a lot), along with alternate costumes. I can't really compare this to other Lego titles, since I haven't really played any others, but I still think this is a solid game. Some things (like leaving the helicarrier and cruising around New York City on your own) aren't really obvious at first, but overall if you just play around and keep exploring, you will figure it out and have a great time.

Probably my favorite so far but a really close to Star Wars. The voice acting is quite funny sometimes. Surprisingly unlike other LEGO games the characters actually play vastly different and like they should. In the end I don't know if I will finish it though because well...it is just another LEGO game. I think its time to stop making them. All in all I do reccomend if you are into the LEGO series though. Great game to play with a girlfriend. She will be entertained and its only mildly hard at boss fights.","December 11, 2013","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't play through LEGO LotR/Batman 2, and maybe that was an issue in those games as well because of the open world, but in all other LEGO games I found those sections of manipulating the world with new characters to be the best aspect of them. In this, it's a lot of escort quests (that are infuriating because you have to run along side whichever character you're escorting back to the start of the mission) or helping another hero kill some kind of enemy. Collecting the character and vehicle tokens around the world is a little bit more enjoyable, but it's not enough to save what I thought was the most fun part of some of the other LEGO games.\n\nAll that said, the story and Deadpool bonus levels are loads of fun, and Traveller's Tales proves yet again that they can construct a game which stands on its own without relying on another storyline in the property. It's still well worth your time and money, I just didn't enjoy the extra content as much as I have in the past.","January 14, 2014","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Heaps of the Marvel characters are playable. Game only _really_ needs two playthroughs.\nBad bits: Many of the (freeplay) side missions are repetitive, boiling down to 'cabby', 'fetch', 'race', 'destroy', and 'obstacle course' (my least favourite). No 'skip' function for Deadpool's intro's (funny, for sure, but once is enough).\nMain story: Made as much sense as any real-world Marvel (or DC for that matter) story. :)\nOther stuff: I loved the inclusion of so many of the Marvel minor players (Squirrel Girl!!). I would've preferred Deadpool was playable from the get-go (but that's me - he's one of my favourite characters). For a game aimed at little kids, I think some of the missions and puzzles were extremely tough, possibly impossible without a very patient teen or adult 'helper'. That said, I had fun.

There's 136 Marvel characters in this game, many with alternate costumes. In-between the story chapters, you have a chance to play around in Manhattan. Here you can use the various heroes and abilities you've unlocked to explore the city, do side-missions, help citizens, and unlock even more heroes and villains. Despite being made out of Lego bricks, most of the environments are pretty impressive. The music is crazy epic for a game featuring Lego characters and would fit in any Marvel film. Finishing the game's story mode is only a tiny fraction of the game. There's a lot to explore and you'll need to collect everything to unlock Deadpool.

That is not to say though, that it doesn't have its fair share of problems like every lego game does. While these problems do hinder the gamepaly a bit, they can be overcome with some simple adjustments that I will mention in an upcoming guide. But moving on from that, the story is both based upon the movie franchises continuety and its own, givign the impression that it could be a branch off from said films. It also does something that the films either cannot, or have yet to do, and that is bring in (almost) all of Marvels heros and villains together and no Sony, Fox, or Paramount to stop them from doing so. With that being said, the game mechanics are nice and simple, characters have a unique range of abilities and can speak very truely of their original comic book counterparts. But playing with a friend in two player mode can be a bit tricky if your using an xbox controller and they a keyboard or vice-versa, as whatever keys you've binded to your personal liking will sometimes reset themselves to their default state. A minor nitpick but one that can be fixed by buying another conrtoller or using the default keys. Now as for free play, I will say that there isn't much vaule in it, not like with older lego games such as Star Wars: The Complete Saga and Indian Jones: The Original Adventures, and I feel that this takes away some of the free roaming aspect that I expect in lego games, but at the same time, gives us something new and unique to see. With all that being said, I highly recommend this game to those who are both a fan of Marvel, Lego, and enjoy these games growing up on the Gameboy or who have little ones who've taken an intrest in video games. Despite crashing at times, a few bugs (or should I say ants) and some missing peices, this is a really great game.","January 9, 2015","true","129.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a classic, man. This game's awesome! One of the best LEGO games I've ever played. In fact, this is one of the best Marvel games I've ever played! It kinda made me explore the Marvel universe a whole lot better. As a teenager, it made me remember the nostalgic experiences building LEGO bricks and reading Marvel comic books when I was a kid. This game is definitely a throwback to some of my favorite characters in the industry, like Spider-Man, Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy's Star-Lord.\n\nYou can choose from lots of characters, with heroes like Spider-Man, Iron Man and Captain America, and villains like Doctor Doom, Magneto and Venom! Really liked the open-world as you can explore Manhattan awesomely. Liked the main missions (especially Deadpool's side missions). Liked the DLC also. It's super worth the time waited, consumed and remembered through this game!\n\nWhat I don't like about this game though are the glitches. Not only me but a lot of players have also experienced these glitches. I hope TT Games or LEGO can patch / fix this. This will indeed be a classic if they patch / fix the glitches.\n\nTo sum it all up, if you really like LEGO, if you really like superheroes, and if you really like Marvel, play this game. It's very awesome, and like what Stan Lee says, "Excelsior!"","June 8, 2015","true","47.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no shame in playing it alone, as it is a nice, light and happy distraction for anyone to play. But you have to remember that it is a children's game designed so that the adults playing it don't feel like smashing their faces in the floor while playing it with their kids. Its doesn't have complex controls, the puzzles aren't puzzles, the fights are mostly scripted and there is no challenge in getting through this game. That doesn't stop it from being fun though, the writing was funny enough, the characters and events cute and amusing in their behavior and appearance and the novelty of the story was good. I enjoyed myself playing the game, but having played this game it definitely cooled my excitement over other Lego games since I now know what to expect. It is a definite recommendation for anyone with kids though, the game is huge and will keep them busy for hours on end.\n\nIf you want to read about the game in more detail you can find the rest of the review here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/08/lego-marvel-super-heros.html.","August 1, 2015","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They all have roughly similar gameplay dynamics - each figure has special attributes that you use to negotiate the level (use Human Torch to melt ice, use Thor's lightning to jumpstart an electric turbine), then you come back through again with your choice of characters and you can do more things to unlock more characters and rewards.\n\nA solid, entertaining romp, largely targeted at the 6-10 set.  The game offers a reasonably large cast of Marvel heroes, including pretty much every one of the company's heroes to ever make it to film, from Blade to the X-Men to Spider-Man to the Guardians of the Galaxy.  It's all set around a LEGO-scale openworld recreation of Manhattan, which is pretty entertaining in and of itself.  You can unlock various vehicles and race through the streets, or do the various game missions, all of which have at least two playthroughs to ensure you find all the goodies.\n\nThe plot in this one is wafer-thin.  Baddies Loki and Doctor Doom are up to no good, assembling a doomsday device, the goodies have to team up to stop them, blah blah blah.  The point of the game is to get your favorite heroes and bash them together in a lovely digital toybox, and the game succeeds at that.  Some of the puzzles might be a little too complicated for younger players, and the controls can be a bit prickly, especially on the "racing" missions.\n\nStill, a nice gateway drug if you're looking to take your young one into the dangerous world of 100% completing games...","July 16, 2015","true","80.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It uses characters that almost everyone knows (and many that only a few Marvel superfans will know) and places them in a game that uses mechanics, puzzles and systems identical to almost every other Lego game. However, it's the execution that makes this game amazing. The world looks exciting and is huge, full of side quests that I'm going to spend weeks doing. The missions are surprisingly entertaining considering how formulaic they are. Plus, it has the classic co-op you've come to love in a Lego game. That means co-operation until you get to the main hub at which point, god help us all. This game is full of content that could take months to finish but it's all entertaing.

The dialogue in story missions can be a little cringe-worthy, but it doesn't take away very much from the neat environments you get to explore, like a dinosaur-inhabited island, or a super-villain prison in the midst of a breakout. I must say that the character customizer is very fun, the only downside being that certain powers you may want are linked to a certain hero or villain's piece: For example, you can't have elastic abilities unless you use Mr. Fantastic's hair. Vehicles obviously don't have to play a huge part in this game, since the very first character you unlock is a FLYING minifigure, but it's still nice to have The Punisher's truck, and Ghost Rider's bike. This game is almost like GTA 5 in the sense that there are lots of glitches you can find when playing, but they only seem to add to the fun, rather than be an annoyance. Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone (Regardless of if they like Legos) who enjoys free-roaming and exploring for hours; Even story missions are fun to replay, because there are so many hidden things to find!\n\n... There is just one more thing that bothers me a bit: How come out of ALL the weapons in the game, Moon Knight's BOOMERANGS are the ones that DON'T come back to you after they're thrown?  :P","April 10, 2015","true","681.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know that sounds like a cop-out, but it's pretty much true. The LEG games don't vary too heavily in gamplay, but neither do the Call of Duty games, the Portal games, or the Mega Man games. And guess what? They're still awesome. So is LEGO Marvel. The character roster is of record-breaking size, busting even LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga's impressive list. The world is massive, yet fun to explore, much more so than in LEGO Batman 2, and that was still fun. The voice acting is solid and very charming, with all the characters's protrayals bridging a fine line between proper representation and parody. There's plenty to do, but sometimes it's just a heck of a lock more fun to simply rampage around as one of the unstoppable powerhouse bigfigs.\n\nThe character creator is disappointing, since, while it gives your characters many of the traits and some of the abilities of the templates, it does not give you all of them. For example, with Human Torch's powers, you can shoot fireballs, but not a heat beam, and you can't flame on. That just doesn't seem right. There's also a consistent visual bug with Mr. Fantastic's powers, with the arms and face not rendering when stretched. The concept was a really good one, though, wihich makes this all the more disappointing.\n\nOverall, though, if you steer clear of the clunky creator, you should be good, and you will most likely have a whale of a time with LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.\n\nOh, one more thing. Venom is so totally the coolest character in the game. Don't let anyone tell you differently.","December 12, 2013","true","60.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While some of it is retracing your steps with different characters in free-play modes of the standard non-hub levels, there's a surprising amount to do outside in the hub.\nThe hub is Manhattan, so if you play as LEGO Spidey, you can be playing a simplified child-friendly Spider-Man 4, basically. Each character has their own abilities, and you figure out what character combinations can solve small puzzles together to unlock more characters to play with in free-play or about NYC. On top of that, there's races, citizen-helping, Gold Brick collecting... etc; etc.\n\nBasically, it's a big game with a lot to it, the only /real/ big problem is that LEGO gameplay is pretty familiar at this point, but that's only really an issue if you've played a lot of these.","December 21, 2013","true","27.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a classic, man. This game's awesome! One of the best LEGO games I've ever played. In fact, this is one of the best Marvel games I've ever played! It kinda made me explore the Marvel universe a whole lot better. As a teenager, it made me remember the nostalgic experiences building LEGO bricks and reading Marvel comic books when I was a kid. This game is definitely a throwback to some of my favorite characters in the industry, like Spider-Man, Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy's Star-Lord.\n\nYou can choose from lots of characters, with heroes like Spider-Man, Iron Man and Captain America, and villains like Doctor Doom, Magneto and Venom! Really liked the open-world as you can explore Manhattan awesomely. Liked the main missions (especially Deadpool's side missions). Liked the DLC also. It's super worth the time waited, consumed and remembered through this game!\n\nWhat I don't like about this game though are the glitches. Not only me but a lot of players have also experienced these glitches. I hope TT Games or LEGO can patch / fix this. This will indeed be a classic if they patch / fix the glitches.\n\nTo sum it all up, if you really like LEGO, if you really like superheroes, and if you really like Marvel, play this game.

There is no shame in playing it alone, as it is a nice, light and happy distraction for anyone to play. But you have to remember that it is a children's game designed so that the adults playing it don't feel like smashing their faces in the floor while playing it with their kids. Its doesn't have complex controls, the puzzles aren't puzzles, the fights are mostly scripted and there is no challenge in getting through this game. That doesn't stop it from being fun though, the writing was funny enough, the characters and events cute and amusing in their behavior and appearance and the novelty of the story was good. I enjoyed myself playing the game, but having played this game it definitely cooled my excitement over other Lego games since I now know what to expect. It is a definite recommendation for anyone with kids though, the game is huge and will keep them busy for hours on end.\n\nIf you want to read about the game in more detail you can find the rest of the review here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/08/lego-marvel-super-heros.html.","August 1, 2015","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly the best superhero game I've played. Almost every single character you can imagine is in here and playable, but a lot of them feel same-y. There's a lot of "big" characters for example that don't have their own unique abilities. You'll notice this a lot for a bunch of characters. Also I know how to fly, but timed air races are annoying because of how stingy the timer is. It's hard to explain but mastering flying in this game will take some work. There's a race against silver surfer that's darn near impossible. I've tried it with every flying character I have and silver surfer just bolts ahead and that's it, and the flying is so finicky that accelerating is damn near impossible, not to mention you have to fly through the gates too. Maybe this'll be patch fixed though.","November 8, 2013","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Not only is it a LEGO game, but it's a MARVEL LEGO game! Not only is it MARVEL, but it's based off more than just the Cinematic Universe! It takes bits from ALL the Marvel Universes! (Universi? Fungus becomes Fungi. I don't like seeing 'ses' on the end of plural words. It feels wrong.) It... does fall a littel flat compared to LEGO Star Wars or Indiana Jones because the story is original. You're not re-enacting famous scenes with LEGO characters, you're fighting your way through a new story. Whilst that does suck some of the comedy out of it, the game does still parody Marvel in general brilliantly. I am enjoying it considerably. Oh, it does need a controller though.

While this one doesn't have the impressive overworld map of LOTR, it does have solid gameplay, an original, funny and appropriately genre-fitting story and is one of the better lego games out there. For comic fans it's a must, as I have little hope for any other superhero games coming out as good as this, or with the sheer level of variety of characters, all of whom play with their full range of powers: the avengers, fantastic four, spiderman and x-men dominate the main story, with interesting team combinations throughout and a final level where you team up (and so play) Dr Doom and members of the mutant brotherhood and sinister six. In free play the variety is astounding, including a huge range of heroes and villains from the guardians of the galaxy to captain britain. Great fun with the sort of crazy, epic story you wish you could have in non-lego form.

I think they did a great job including all ther characters from the comics into it and portraying them as they are in the comics as well.\n\n[]The gameplay is great as there are a lot of characters to unlock aswell as cars, helicopters and jets.\n\n[]The levels are easy and fun with puzzles that are hard but not to hard to get stuck on. The humour is also actually pretty good for a childrens game.\n\n[]The new free rome feature they added in is a nice touch as it is a great way to run around and test your new characters as well as looking for new quests, activities, races and puzzles to do\n\n[]The only problem i had with this game was that its main campain was kinda short but all the side activities and the fact you can replay the story with different characters kinda made up for that. The flying was also kinda clunky but not to bad.\n\nI would definetly reccomend this game to anyone who loves the previous lego game or loves marvel, bonus points if you love both!","November 21, 2015","true","15.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I really like this game, and recommend it to anyone that likes Lego and Marvel. Has a huge range of characters and has a large free-roam area to do what ever you want in. the only problem, only two boats, but that's not a big deal.\nThe game can be a bit glitchly at times but keeps you entertained for hours. When i mean glitchy, i mean real glitchy. I found this glitch with Thor, where i turned into the citizen? And i found two spots where i could go under the city and onto the islands in the background? I also was on the other side of the bridge, where i couldn't go. What?\nWhen they say there are a lot of characters, they are correct, because there are something like over 100 playable, and thats without the DLC. The DLC was pretty good, giving you extra vehicles and characters, but most of their abilities were the same as other characters, so i recommend waiting until they are on special as they are not worth their full price.\nThe steam achievments are also good and provide something else to do in the free-roam city.\nJust a warning, there are cheat codes, but the one for the hulkbuster prevents you from getting 100%, so i don't recommend using them.\nThere are a lot of bonus levels, which some give a good laugh. Suitable for all ages, even little kittens. XD\n\nAlso, LEGO are bringing out a LEGO Avengers game, so lets hope that is even better then this one.\nGamingwaffle's score 9.5/10","May 2, 2015","true","372.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

While this one doesn't have the impressive overworld map of LOTR, it does have solid gameplay, an original, funny and appropriately genre-fitting story and is one of the better lego games out there. For comic fans it's a must, as I have little hope for any other superhero games coming out as good as this, or with the sheer level of variety of characters, all of whom play with their full range of powers: the avengers, fantastic four, spiderman and x-men dominate the main story, with interesting team combinations throughout and a final level where you team up (and so play) Dr Doom and members of the mutant brotherhood and sinister six. In free play the variety is astounding, including a huge range of heroes and villains from the guardians of the galaxy to captain britain. Great fun with the sort of crazy, epic story you wish you could have in non-lego form.

I want to get that out of the way, as I'm sure that my review will have several negative points in it.  That being said, this game does much more right than it does wrong.  If you've played a LEGO game before, you know what to expect from this title.  It follows the formula laid out by previous LEGO games, but does it so much better due to the expanded amount of content available in the Marvel universe.  The story is much longer and much more diverse than previous titles, and the number of characters and playstyles available to the user is amazing.  That being said, a game this large is bound to be hampered by technical difficulties.  In my time playing this game, I experienced the following:  the game crashing, players getting physically stuck and the game requiring a reboot, items/events on the New York map not appearing and requiring a reboot, etc.  All of these experiences detracted from the overall product, but I think it's telling that they served to only take away from the overall experience and not define it.  The last point that needs to be made is that if you play this single player, your AI partner will be incredibly dumb and basically useless.  Seriously, if you play single player the enemy AI will be better than your partner AI and your partner will constantly get their ♥♥♥ kicked.  It's embarrassing to watch a random trash mob kick the crap out of a brand name super hero, but that's a reality in this game.  This is a great game and I would rank it an 8.5.  That being said, if you're planning on playing it solo I would give it an 8.0; and if you have a comic book loving friend who is willing to play through coop with you, I would give it a 9.0.","March 20","true","53.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was in despair for i longed to see another 100% but it was either get a wii U,Xbox one,or PS4. I knew this wouldnt happen so i gave up. And when i saw the trailer for this game i was just sad and heartbroken because i knew i couldnt get what was my dream all these years...BUT ALAS I earned those 20 bucks from dog sitting and hardwork,looked at all the awesome games i could buy like a kid in a candy shop,and after deep search and thought,I got what was rightfully mine. This game is so fun, the platforming is amazing and the freeroam is wide and the city is lively with people going about their day and not even caring about the world they live in, the puzzles are a bit unique compared to my standards,and the graphics are very crisp and lively to me beacuse ive played on wii, the characters are so filling and fun to play with i cant even choose a favorite this game will keep you bust for a long time. So if your a gamer with way too much time on your hands and beat every game that comes along like *snap* that. And if you love Zeld like adventure puzzle games then this my friend will stimulate your brain waaay more than Call of Duty. So all this being said i give it an A/5 (100%).","September 9, 2014","true","93.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonmoonmist/recommended/249130/","crimsonmoonmist","ANDY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonmoonmist/","183 products in account","Lego Batman 2 was quite an achievement in Traveller's Tales' long-running Lego series with its large sandbox city filled with tons of collectibles and an equally large roster of colorful and varied heroes and villains. The storytelling aspect got a major writing overhaul by officially leaving the 'mime' humor behind by bringing in the A-team of voicework that made the game able to tell its own, unique story rather than simply act out a film's plot.\nLego Marvel Super Heroes does what any sequel should and expands on everything its predecessor was and more.\n\nThe sandbox of New York city is positively ginormeous and filled to the brim with personality,\nbe it in the faithfully constructed Marvel landmarks or the various quirky side-quest granting citizens and puzzles. There are even secret stages to uncover if you search hard enough!\n\nThe stages themselves have also taken a boost and are more layered,\nboasting strong location variety and quirky creativety.\nThe creators also managed to finally truly nail the length of the stages so that they go on just long enough while throwing encounters and thrills at you around every corner to satisfy\nwithout overstaying their welcome and just becoming stale.\nThere are boss-fights a plenty in this game, even more than ever before\nand, while they are all fairly unique, few bosses actually change their tactics mid-fight,\nleaving what will initially strike many players as impressive and fun fights\nto become rather repetitive by the time they land the final hit.\n\nOne thing that has taken a hit since the last game, however, is the combat.\nUnlike Lego Batman 2, which used a miniaturized version of the Arkham games' combat\nby allowing you to unleash special moves when your multiplier was high enough,\nin this game, those moves now just randomly happen.\nIt certainly adds visual flair to the fights,\nbut feels even more button-mashy than previous incarnations.\nStill, all is not lost, most characters now have unique moves\nthat can be triggered by pressing B at any time\n(it used to be a generic grab-button in LB2), which does add some much needed variety.\n\nSpeaking of variety, Lego Marvel Super Heroes boast one of the largest rosters in any Lego game and all the characters look, move, fight and feel like they should, which is a large plus for comic-book fans who can finally say their favorite characters have a game that does them justice.\n\nUnfortunately, this game is not without glitches,\non a 100% playthrough, you're sure to run into some sooner or later.\nIn my experience, I had situations were certain NPCs wouldn't load,\nNPCs wouldn't jump into your Taxi and the game wouldn't accept 100%\nuntil I re-beat the final stage again.\nIn all cases, simply continuously resetting the game until it worked eventually prevailed,\nso luckily, there is no truly gamebreaking glitch that'll make 100% impossible.\n\nUltimately, Lego Marvel Super Heroes is superior to its predecessors in almost every way,\nthough, as it IS more of a simple\n(unless you set your eyes upon the lofty goal of achieving 100% completion)\nand quirky puzzle-game by nature,\nI'd recommend to pay with caution if you expect something grander.\nHowever! If you like the Marvel universe, collect-a-tons that keep you playing long after the credits roll, puzzles or large sandboxes to roam around in and explore,\nthen you can do little better than Lego Marvel Super Heroes.","September 5, 2014","true","47.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The lore is rich and the open world elements make the game outstanding, also the next-gen graphics make it look straight out of the Unity engines cupboard. The story is about a teenager named Chad, who discovers on a week of mountain biking and parachuting that he has super mutant powers, the first power he gets is the ability to score sweet hatricks while playing football on the beach. The second power he gets is the ability to change into Elvis whenever he wants. I've saved the last for the best, his last power is the ability to turn into a biscuit when ever he so pleases. As it says in the game description it was highly inspired by Bad Rats, most of it is like Bad Rats, basically a upgraded version of Bad Rats.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story revolves around Chad and his gang of extreme skateboarders. He lives in Canada and there is a very big skateboarding competition coming up and Chad is feeling insecure because his Girlfriend dumped him. Then, Chad requires his powers and fights all the evil crime in Canada, he doens't have to use his powers that much. Alot of childhood character make a appearence what can bring nostalgia into your brain, such characters as Johnny Neutron, and Ben 10. Like I said, the lore is awesome, when you come across a a landmark, you'll get a snippit of lore to find out about the certain object/landmark. My favourite was the bodybuildingorange because it supplied with lore that was not known to me, and it made my day. For the story I'd say it makes the game, but I've still got Gameplay to do, and other stuff, but the story is spectacular and I spent countless hours washing my body in it.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nLego Marvel Superheroes takes a change from the other lego games, adding in a XP system with a leveling up system, at first you begin at the NOVICE stage with very little perks, but as Chad progresses he levels up unlocking powerful abilities to defeat evil people, in his quest to become popular and win the Skateboard contest. The combat is amazing, including bloody finishers and great visual stunning takedowns (Non-Lethal and Lethal). One of the characters called Spider-Man can do a sick flip and snap someones neck, what personally I think is quite cool, plus it looks cool in awesome but blocky graphics. But, that's another section, for gameplay I'd say it's fantastic, good combat, good mechanics, and good takedowns?\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are visuallly stunning as I mentioned, everything has a reflection, when I say everything I MEAN EVERYTHING it's like the floor of a bathroom toilet on every model, seriously it is. But anywho, the graphics are nice and saturated and colourful and really bring in the life to this game, this game in black and white wouldn't be as fun. It was obviously made on the Unity engine, making it stunning graphics and really demostrating what the Unity engine can do when you put lego blocks and make a game with them, cool.\n\nFinal\n\nAfter countless years, and days of binge playing this game, I think I can settle on a verdict of 6/10 because although the game is truly groundbreaking and breathtaking at everything else, I think the game would've been better if they included more rare pepes.","July 24, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","1","2","3","0"

The game is pretty awesome and fun, but has some downs sadly about it. If you were looking over as playing as Deadpool, that might not be possible until you finish the game. Same with Stan-Lee, but this doesn't turn the game bad, yet still very very comedic and intense with characters from all sround the universe. There are must-buy-with-real-money characters like Thanos I know people are willing to play, so just wait for Lego Marvel Avengers Visdogame For that! The keypad controles are screwed and is horribly diffucult to control the characters properly. This game requires a game-pad, seriously.

Deadpool.\n-10/10 Would Stan Lee again\n\nShort Review\nGreat game. Fun Open World, Cool Charcters most of us will know, fun levels and worth the money. Better than the Avengers edition of the game. Voice actors are good, but not the same as the ones in the movies. Controlls can be wierd and has a some bugs .Save system is wonky, but you figure ot out eventually. Great game.\n\nLong Review\nGreat game. The Open World is by far the strongest feature. NYC is full of hidden places to explore and has so many things to do, find, and enjoy. I cannot stress this ebough. If you like open world games, this game is great for that. Compared to games like Skyrim of the Witcher 3, the world is a little small, but it still decent size on its own and is jam packed full of stiff to do and characters to unlock. Even if you beat the game, the open world is a fun place to run around, destroy things, ride cars of bikes, and just have fun. The storyline is OK, albeit a bit short (15 levels), but the levels are long, and you can save at specific parts in the level. It is a bit buggy and the controls can be a bit goofy and cramped. The best way to play is with a controller, or spacing out the WASD movement keys from the action keys. Otherwise, it feels like your hands are cramped together. If you are not a Marvel nerd and dont know all the heros and villians, dont worry. The game isn't really full of random heros. If you have seen any modern day Avengers or X men movies, you will be mostly fine. There will be some characters you do not know, but it doesnt detract from the game. The game does a really nice job of blancing heros and villains in the story, and playble ones. The more common ones are used in the storyline, and the more obscure ones are used in free play annd are unlockable. And if you are a Marvel Superfan, it does have easter eggs, hints, and other things you will enjoy as well. Extra levels and usage of the gold brick make this game have even more replayability. Deadpool and Stan Lee  cameo a lot, adding to the funny atmostphere of the game. The chrarcters, while not voiced by the actors from the modern day movies, still are well voiced, and drop a lot of puns and jokes, customary to all lego games. The fact that it is a Lego game makes it even better. Definetly worth the money and better than the Avengers edition of the game.","March 23","true","27.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fight enemies, break stuff, build stuff, solve minor puzzles, beat level, repeat.  It's simple but addictive, especially with all the hidden stuff in every level.  There's a large "overworld" where you can basically play Lego GTA in New York only without the lego cops coming after you for smashing things, attacking people or stealing cars.  The characterizations are cartoony and a bit tongue in cheek but still spot on for the personalities of the characters and combat...  Oh my god, how on Earth did they manage to make combat in a Lego game feel closer to how the characters would actually fight than in ANY other comic based game I've ever played?  Hulk flings people around, Spider-Man does web slinging antics, Black Widow does ridiculously cool moves...  Excellent job.  The graphics aren't going to blow anyone away but what impressed me was how amazingly well this game plays with the graphics settings cranked all the way up on my graphics card that has a hard time playing newer games AT ALL.  As always, the button mapping on keyboard is really weird.  This game was clearly made for consoles as you can't type anything when you'd expect to.  You also have to use unusual buttons for confirming and cancelling selections.  Definitely play with a controller and not a keyboard.  Overall, fun game if you like Marvel and the Lego games at all.","April 3","true","64.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Great controller support, but the standard control set up is awkward and does not seem very practical when in game. I have not seen an in game option to reassign key bindings, but that would be wonderful!","June 26, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Seriously. Lego Star Wars: The Video Game was my very first video game, and it still holds a fond place in my heart.\nThat being said... I don't know if I'd necessarily recommend this game or not. Here are my opinions, and you can decide:\nPROS:\n-Free-roaming is one of the best aspects of gameplay in LMSH.\n-The sheer amount of characters included in the game (including people you never see in a Marvel game, like Psylocke or the Guardians of the Galaxy, or Phil Coulson, or Stan Lee himself!).\n-The team pair-ups in the levels themselves are very pleasantly unorthodox, such as Captain America, the Thing, and Storm teaming up.\n-The story in LMSH, while drawing elements from the Marvel films, is totally original and manages to connect to the comics fairly well.\n-The character creator allows you to make some very fun combinations (for example, I gave Thor's hammer to Mary Jane Watson).\n-There is a huge amount of attention to detail in the design of the levels, the overworld, and the characters in particular.\n-Every car you see is more than willing to let you just jump in and "borrow" it for "official superhero business."\n-Everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) makes bad jokes or puns throughout the game.\n\nCONS:\n-You NEED to play this with a controller. There's not really a good way not to.\n-There are a lot of small bugs and glitches in the game, such as characters taking too long to switch between, or someone's arms disappearing.\n-Some of the hitboxes or ranges on the different powers/abilities are not very clear or consistent (i.e., activating a power from right beside an NPC or several feet away from them sometimes doesn't work).\n-The character creator, while it has A LOT of combinations, is sometimes very goofy in the way that some of the combinations work together. For example, I paired Wolverine with the Human Torch, and the character got all of the shared powers except flight.\n-If you are not playing with two people, the second player's AI is garbage. Often times they will get stuck in a location, or go off somewhere else just when you need their help.\n-The levels themselves...just aren't very fun. Numerous times throughout my playthrough I found myself completely confused about what I was supposed to do, particularly during the boss fights. The hint system for the Minikits and overworld locations is sometimes just as bad.\n-For me, there was not a lot of replayability in LMSH. By the time you unlock all of the characters, you've essentially done everything the game has to do several times over, so even though I had gotten some characters I love playing as, there was nothing left for them to do...besides run around and "borrow" taxicabs.\n\nWhile this game is fun, it feels a bit hollow. 7/10","May 18","false","44.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I cannot play with the Symbiote Spider-Man that I have paid extra money for. I can't refund the game because I have over 2 hours of gameplay. Guess what? I lost my money. And the worst part is that they will NOT fix this bug since the game is 2 years old. An awesome game, became the most annoying game ever.

Tons of Marvel heroes and villains to unlock and play as in free mode.  Lots of replayability when going back in free mode looking for extras and such.\n\nThis game teaches good lessons about cooperation, and shows that even superheroes can't do everything alone.

I especially enjoy the fact that they actually attempt to capture each of the character's personalities and replicate them in this game (mostly from the movies they've been in of course) but everyone's dream-take on every character isn't going to be here of course. It's an awesome game for adults to burn some solo-play time on and it will even hold the attention of any parent with a careful eye out for what they put in front of the eyes (and ears) of their kids. There's also a few hidden nuggets (as in all Lego games that have come before) for all those players willing to go the extra mile and actually find each and every last thing in the game. Keep up the great work TT games and I'm sure players (and fans) will happily keep shelling out the bucks...","January 21, 2015","true","51.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wish I could have been a kid playing this.\n\nThere's no emoticon for what I'm feeling.","June 24, 2014","true","92.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nearly-consequence-free collect-it-all-a-thon. Simplistic gameplay, drop-in and drop-out local multiplayer, and lots of cool fan pleasing Easter Eggs. I'm a fan of the Traveller's Tales Liscensed Lego Games namely in the references to the source material and the fun treatment they tend to give it and this entry only expanded on the original formula, as I'm sure the series will continue to do in the future. It's great for kids and fun for bored, nerdy, or faint-of-heart people who don't want the stress that comes with certain more intensive platformers and brawlers.","February 6, 2015","true","67.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My kids love this game and I like playing this game with them.\n\nAmong all the Lego games, this one is the best. Batman ones are not that good, Hobbit is ok, Lord of the Rings is a bit better.\n\nBut nothing really captures the fun and enjoyment as this game. Flying around as Iron Man or webslinging across NYC as Spiderman never gets old. Each char is unique and there's a lot of replayable value.\n\nGreat game","October 17, 2014","true","103.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My son and I play, but he plays mostly..   There's a lot to do, but the only minor thing I hate is having to GRIND to get DEADPOOL.  .    Still, there are lots of characters to tickle your nostalga bone.. okay that was a weird way to put it, but none the less you'll feel pretty cool being your favorites from Marvel.   The Lego games in general are great at teaching kids the basics of gaming.   The puzzles are great for kids, and learning to fill up a meter , find bricks, and running around with a pal is always fun..    Adults will have a great time too.  The lego characters are funny and the story is goofy.. Just a good time ...again especially if you have children..

In terms of the positives, the gameplay is fun, although simple. There is a robust cast of characters from the Marvel universe, each with their own unique abilities and many of which that have multiple costumes and so forth. There are some puzzle areas where characters must work together to overcome an obstacle. There are plenty of collectibles to keep you playing and keep you coming back.\n\nNow for the reasons I cannot recommend this game. I cannot tell you the number of times I ran into gamebreaking bugs. There were so so many and all of varying types. In some areas where an event is supposed to trigger, it simply doesn't and you can no longer progress, forcing you to restart from your last save point or the beginning of the mission. Other times, your character can end up in an infinite death loop, again making it impossible to progress. Then there are times when you switch to controlling one of your other characters who the A.I. managed to trap behind a ladder. Try killing him and he respawns in the same place, right behind that ladder, still stuck. Again, this makes it impossible to progress. Add to this the occasional crash and there you have it. The game becomes too damn frustrating to want to play anymore. And this isn't a once-time or occasional thing. These game-breaking bugs occur REGULARLY. When I looked some of these bugs up, I found guides to the game that specifically had to warn you about these bugs and actively show you how to avoid them as part of the game guide. It's like there was absolutely no QA testing on this game. The Lego franchise games are usually terrific, but this one was a terrible misstep in the series, which is unfortunate because it had the potential to be one of my favorites considering the universe in which it is set. Do not play this game unless you have the patience of a saint.","June 20, 2014","false","9.4"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","21","44","3","0"

It just seemed like a quick cash-in. Getting 100% studs, while I usually dont care about getting them, was so easy that not even going out of your way to get them results in 100% studs near the halfway point in every level. They didnt even bother to make it any kind of challenge. Being forced to use control stations around the world to change characters until you've completeled the story was very annoying too. That just seemed like a way to pad game length even further. The engine didnt seem to be very optimized either on PC. For such a simple game the fps would almost drag to a halt in certain non-intensive areas.\n\nWhile I appreciate that the story didnt follow any of the movies (I find those Lego games to be boring as ive already seen the movies) this still felt lame to me and after seeing recent Lego Marvel's Avengers gameplay it seems that will be a proper Lego Marvel game, but sadly its going to follow the Avenger movies. UGH, booooooooooring.\n\nNot worth full price, but its something to play, at a discount, if you're a devout Lego game buyer  :|","January 13","false","6.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","4"

I really did. I mean, I love lego games, and I love Marvel comics (even if I think that DC is better). How could it go wrong? It was like a match made in heaven! Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be one.\nFirst off, it isn't really a bad game, it can even be considered as a pretty decent one. But for me, It was a massive disappointment.\nI'll start with the pros:\n+The hughe cast of character. There is a LOT of character, and that is great.\n+The open world sections are pretty fun, it can be really amusing to run around New York as one of your favorite characters.\n+The levels are pretty well made, forcing you to play with various characters and using their abilities to reach the end, like in any lego videogame. I know a lot of people don't like this mechanic, but I don't mind it.\n\nAnd the cons:\n-I hate comic books movies. I really do. And why I really hate marvel movies, is because they now leave their mark in comics. For exemple, Hulk is now stupid again, we have the "Nick Fury jr" and Coulson bullcrap, and Iron Man, one of Marvel's worst and most hateable character (at least, in my opinion), is now the big figure of Marvel. And the game is fully influenced by the movies, with Iron Man everywhere (Urgh), Coulson and many more things that are just here to please people who only watch the movies.\nHo and poor Dr.Aldrich Killian and Mandarin. Iron Man 3 ♥♥♥♥♥ you and this game continues.\n-There is a really poor use of characters. A lot of great characters are here, but they are just not the characters that I grew up to love. Their personnality is either altered, or thrown in a wash machine. They are often used in a really poor way. I get it, most of it is used for the humor and all and all, but sorry, Doctor Octopus cleaning up Daily Bugle office? really\n-Many characters are here. But you need mondey to buy them. And they aren't cheap. At all. So be prepare to do a lot of grinding if you want them all. I don't mind grinding, but for this game, it was just not worth it.\n-The music is annoying as hell. More than once, I cut the sound. However the one when you jump of the Hellcarier is actually pretty good.\n-Boss battles are repetitive as ♥♥♥♥.\n-The final level... I won't say anything. Just knowing that it exists is enough.\n-Also if like me, you don't have a controller, you may find the control a little bit unfriendly. The game wasn't made for a keyboard and you can see it really quickly.\n\nConclusion: I excpected a lot from this game, maybe too much.

I am playing on PC, so this may be due to the port.  However, I use WASD for movement of my character as well as selection in SOME menus, while I can only use the arrow keys for selection in other menus.  Sometimes the key to press to make a selection is Enter, other times it's U, J, or H with apparently no governing rules regarding why ONE KEY ISN'T ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE.\n\nSpeaking of one key, the U key is used to switch between characters so you can use various powers to progress in puzzles and advance the story. In free play, an extended pres of the U key brings up your character menu so you can access areas or items unavailable to the characters allowed during story play.  Unfortunately, with characters that have a second identify (last I checked, that's literally all of them, though this doesn't happen with every single character) such as Spiderman's Peter Parker or Bruce Banner's Hulk,  you have to wait for a three to five second animation  while they change identities because you can press the U key again to bring up the character selection menu.\n\nRegarding the character selection menu: there are 155 playable characters in this game.   While this sounds cool on it's face, it gets to be somewhat annoying in practice.  Instead of having 155 individual selections in the character menu, versions are grouped into one selection which cycles.  Iron Man is a prime example as to why this bogs down the game.  There are 5 or 6 versions one can play, some with different abilities.  One of Iron Man's abilities is an energy ray with is used to cut or destroy gold objects (Mark 42).  If you want to select this from the character menu, you have to highlight the selection and wait for it to cycle through.  Not every version has this ability, meaning that if you want a specific one, you have to time your selection properly or wait for it to cycle through again.  This may appear to be a small gripe, but having to wait every single time you wish to select this character for that ability adds up quickly.\n\nThere are no controls governing camera direction while in the game.  If a character has an ability to aim, one can use this to somewhat direct the camera, but it's still time consuming and not always easily accessible.  If something ends up behind the 4th wall of your screen, you have to move towards the camera long enough for the games to spin it around to your character's back.  Adding this to the lack of finesse in moving a character adds more headache to the game.\n\nVehicle movement is even worse than character movement.  In a game where a large portion of side missions require racing to acquire an object, hard turning becomes your enemy.  The challenge becomes not hanging one's self up on the sides of the track instead of getting to the goal in the allotted time.\n\nOther issues with the side missions are that most are fetch mission where in you have to go somewhere, usually across town, acquire an item or find an individual, and return to the NPC which started the mission.  This means you may swing halfway across the city as Spiderman or fly quick as Thor, Iron Man, or anyone else with the ability, find your target, and then WALK this secondary NPC back to the starting point.  If you move too quickly, you have to turn around to get them to follow again.  Not every side mission is like this, but other issues regarding the camera or character movement suck most of the fun out of these.\n\nWhile a tutorial level isn't necessary for every game, most controls are only mentioned at random during loading screens.  Given the immense size of the game world, it would seem that a quick run through could have been included without sacrificing any of the overall game play.\n\nThis game is not as much fun as it should be, given how many fun LEGO games are in existence.  I picked this up during a sale for 4.99 and I still feel as if I over paid for it.  The initial excitement of getting to play as my favorite Marvel characters has quickly diminshed and I may finish this game at some point.  Right now, it's run through part of a mission, save (assuming it doesn't lock up, though I accept that may be a lacking machine as opposed to poor programming), and then come back for another small snippet at a later time.  It's difficult to get into this game for longer than 20 minutes in that the 2 second wait here and difficult controls make that feel like a drudgingly long time.","May 6, 2014","false","75.3"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","3","11","2","4"

I bought this during the Warner Bro.'s Publisher Sale for $5.00 USD. It was not even worth that. Huge waste of money, and time. Problems with so many things, I can't even list them all. Within the first level I had to reset 6 times because of players getting caught, poorly explained mechanics, and a broken engine. When I finally did beat the level, the game crashed!

I did so, and when the game booted, the option to continue my game was available, however, once I clicked it, I was told no save data could be found.\n\nPerplexed, I began the computer-wide search for said files, (I do know what I'm doing) without success. I then proceeded to search the crap out of forums, community hubs and other sources for a solution or suggestion. After much digging and searching, I discovered where my saves SHOULD have been, but were not. No trace. Not even the parent folder.\n\nI checked my 9 day old system back-up, only to discover that the file structure was in place, and the saves (albeit from a much earlier session) were there.\n\nThis does not make me happy, can you see why? Something, somewhere, has decided it had the authorization to delete files from MY computer without my knowledge or say so. It is a bug in the programming, not windows, not steam, and certainly not user error.\n\nIt hasn't been widely reported, but I'm not the only person this has happened to, and from all I can find, it's not at a certain point in the game, or a certain percentage level of completion, but it has deleted both the saves and the parent folder of the saves on other peoples systems.\n\nNEVER, have I had a problem with any LEGO game in the past, but this made me furious. To the degree that I will not purchase this game, ever. I have deleted the shared copy and I willl never play it again, and I will discourage all my friends from supporting it. This is sloppy, the bug hasn't been addressed and considering the money behind the game and the name it's representing, I expect far better.\n\nWell done on ruining what could have been another fantastic experience.","July 15, 2014","false","11.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Traveler's Tales released yet another LEGO game, what a bore.  Hmm? What's this?  It's based on Marvel Comics?  Hmmm...then this game might have a chance.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn't. If you have played (most of) the previous LEGO games made by Traveler's Tales, you'll see what I mean.  Every single LEGO game that comes out is the same thing: Break stuff, build stuff, get studs, buy stuff with studs, use specific characters to unlock secret stuff, etc. and the series just gets crappier and crappier. Nothing really changes in the LEGO games, but hey, at least they talk in this one.  The gameplay in LEGO games never change, sure this game is one of the first open-world hub LEGO games, but that doesn't change its gameplay. The puzzles and things you do are still the same silly, unoriginal, ridiculous things  that actually make it feel like LEGO, but not the thing that's in LEGO form, not for one moment in these games can those puzzles and stuff you do be serious and original.\n\nA lot of people say the controls are crappy in this game, but I kind of grew up with PC gaming so I am used to any PC controls no matter how bad.  Yes, the flying and vehicle controls are kind of weird and eventually get annoying, but I don't really care and it doesn't bother me anymore.  By the way, who gives a flying rats crappy behind about mouse control?!  Seriously, it's a LEGO game, they never have mouse control, deal with it you freakin' idiots!\n\nThe story is original, I'll give it that, but terrible. The humor is weak and there's too much of it. And some of the story doesn't even make any sense, for instance, Doctor Octopus and Agent Coulson cleaning up the Daily Bugle, seriously?  I know this game's audience was heavily targeted at children, but they could've been a bit more serious with this game. Come on, it's Marvel, treat it with respect you loony-toony game developers. And what the heck is Howard the Duck doing in this game?  Better yet, what the heck is Howard the Duck doing in Marvel in the first place?!\n\nNow I want to go on record and say that I LOVE the Marvel films, but this game just makes a mockery of all of it. They even left out some key Marvel characters: Quick Silver, Ultron, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and other important characters.\n\nOh wait, you want to get %100? Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh hoooooh! These games are RELENTLESS when it comes to secret content. It will take you MONTHS to unlock every single little damn thing in this game. I only own ONE LEGO game where I got %100, ONE. Trust me, don't waste your time unlocking all that crap, it's just not worth it. I would rather watch Disney's Frozen a thousand times so I can play the whole damn movie in my head while having Let it Go stuck in my head in the process than get %100 in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes.\n\nThis game is crap. Don't you DARE buy this game, because if you do, you'll be giving Traveler's Tales money and giving them another reason to create another one of these LEGO-shaped garbage cans.\n\nIf you're a kid, this game will probably be the best thing that's ever happened to you. If you're an adult, not so much.\n\n3.8/10\n\nSeriously, don't bother with this game. If I were you, I'd instead wait for Rovio to come up with an Angry Birds Marvel Super Heroes and buy it immediatley. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Marvel in Angry Birds would probably be a whole lot better than this stupid game, trust me.","June 20, 2015","false","10.2"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","3","12","2","0"
