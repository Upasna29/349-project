That it makes you adapt to its own pace: slow, almost languid. There is no rush, the game says. Come, sit down, have something to eat. Let’s just talk and watch the world in its endless beauty for a while.\n\n\nIt’s an easy one to pigeonhole: a first-person, fixed-perspective point-and-click adventure game with a heavy emphasis on dialogue and some mechanically light but clever puzzling. Populated by weirdos. Childlike art, lots of words, copious amounts of deliberately groanworthy puns. Moderately long. There we go: the Urizen within us is satisfied.\n\nAnd yet it’s more than the description of its moving parts. Perhaps most of all, it’s a game about reading cheerful nonsense while listening to achingly beautiful and soothing music; it’s silly and playful and aware of itself and aware of you. It’s a love letter to Greece as it exists in the imagination. It’s a game about the wonders of the world, about the awe and joy of being alive, at this point in time, in this place, for now and forever. But it’s also a game of profound sadness, the sense that something is ending and the future is uncertain and scary, but even if we one day look back and see that some of the stops along the way were bad, we’ll know the journey has been worth everything we had.\n\nConstantly weaving between hilarity and melancholy and everything in between, wearing both its childish wonder and its world-weariness proudly on its sleeves, but in the end always joyful, even in the face of tragedy, that’s what TSWCE is like. Unhurried, contemplative, happy. A drinking white wine in the sun kind of game: a rare and beautiful animal.\n\nBut also very, very silly.\n\n\nThe game is part of the Lands of Dream cycle, but knowledge of the other stories is not at all required for understanding the plot. You know what, though? If you’re even moderately interested, give The Fabulous Screech[landsofdream.net] a try. It’s a free, very short and beautiful game, and the Lands of Dream in a nutshell. And when you come back, The Sea will still be here. And in the end, it will claim everything.","March 24","true","5.0"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","54","58","0","1"

The Sea Will Claim Everything is terrific, just all around brilliant. Great writing, great jokes, great philosophizing. The best part is the way the game keeps blowing itself up over and over; every time you think you know what's going on, the camera pulls back, the scope gets bigger, more adventure appears. It's such a fun feeling of discovery. It was the first Lands of Dream game I tried, and I don't regret it for a second since it introduced me to the rest.\n\nShortly after I played The Sea Will Claim Everything, I remember reading the creators describe it as inspired by half forgotten shareware games on long lost demo discs, only The Sea Will Claim Everything actually has the rest of the game attached to it. That really stuck with me, because it's a perfect way to describe the game. The Sea Will Claim Everything is like all the adventure games I wanted to finish playing as a kid, but I finally get to explore the world beyond the end of demo screen.\n\nCan't wait to see what's been tweaked and polished in this new version four years later.

Should have done it sooner.\n\nTSWCE is a game full of whimsical charm. The Land of Dreams as a setting is a creative and engaging one filled with the strange and magical. There’s also obscene amounts of flavor text for things such as every book and mushroom in the game. The writing is filled with corny jokes and silliness that while it may not always hit is still really endearing. The game also has a really strong fairy tale/children’s story aesthetic and the music is great too. TSWCE is also a political fable, being very critical of the economic policies that led to the Great Recession of 2008 as well as reactionary ideologies in general. Philosophy is also a major part of TSWCE and the some of the game’s major themes are the dangers of ignorance, greed, and strict adherence to dogma and that one of the most important ways to make the world a better place is for people to be open to change and have an understanding and empathy for the people and world around them. This all done well and a major reason why is because the setting and characters have so much care put into them so that the message doesn’t envelop the narrative and instead works alongside it and they enhance each other.\n\nGameplaywise it’s more of a point and click game, the magic screen is your UI and most puzzles are more simple stuff such as item gathering, talking to people, and exploration. As the game tells you from the get-go it’s a bit of a slow paced game, but it’s still real engaging.\n\nOverall TSWCE is a unique and  enthralling game with a lot of heart and a well-crafted message.","March 26","true","4.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The hand-drawn graphics seem crude, but they engorge you in a matter of minutes. That's not to mention the peaceful, relaxing music.\n\nThis is a game that you can play for hours, just searching for easter eggs and funny rhymes. There is just so much packed into every scene, you could say it runs at 1 frame per half-hour.\n\nYou'll befriend all the friendly characters throughout the Fortunate Isles, and despite being composed of an unmoving image, each one is unique and captivating.\n\nThe gameplay and storyline are very meta, but the game handles the concept well. It might seem like the biotech window would ruin the immersion, but somehow the opposite is true.\n\nTo summarize, this game is basically a storybook brought to life and expanded to see a glimpse of the lives of many creatures in another realm.

And I lost my whole night to it - several nights, in fact!\n\nThe primary focus of the game is on exploring and examining things, and there is a surprisingly large number of scenes to traverse.  Every object has a unique description.  And while they're not all profound, you have to appreciate the effort it took to write that many unique descriptions of mushrooms.\n\nBe warned: there is a tremendous amount of text to read, and the art is all static.

If you're familiar with his work on The Talos Principle, you should have a good idea of what to expect.\n\nIt will subvert your expectations of more traditional adventure games and draw you into the wonderfully bizarre world full of interesting and unique characters, all brought to life with lovingly hand-drawn art and fantastic soundtrack. It'd probably be easy to dismiss it as 'just an adventure game', merely describing the story or features wouldn't change your mind on that, but it's ultimately more than the sum of its parts and an experience that is both entertaining and thought provoking.\n\nIt's not entirely without flaws, but the faults I have with it are minor, pedantic at best, and don't detract from the overall quality in any significant way. My only real criticism would be that it's somewhat short, although not in a way that the story felt rushed or not long enough, moreso that I just didn't really want it to end.\n\nWhile it may not appeal to everyone, The Sea Will Claim Everything is a game that deserves far more attention and one that more people should try. If you're still unsure, there is a demo available here[landsofdream.net], where you can also play the other games in the Lands of Dream series for free (which you should).","March 30","true","5.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

Almost every object in TSWCE can be examined, giving you interesting descriptions. The game goes as far as giving each of the mushrooms their own little backstory. Reading these is always enjoyable, thanks to the great writing.\n\nTSWCE is very nonlinear. There are two roadblocks near the beginning that restrict where you can go, but beyond those, you can do nearly everything in any order you want. There are a lot of objectives to accomplish, which can get overwhelming. Since the explorable area is quite large, it's sometimes difficult to find what you're looking for. The puzzles themselves are easy, so anyone should still be able to finish the game with enough patience.\n\nThe graphics are nice and colorful. You meet several imaginative characters along the way, all of which are well illustrated.

It has a similar style to classic graphical adventure games: travel around to various locations, click on hot spots to collect items, read description, or perform actions, and complete quest objectives.\n\nWhat makes it stand out as such a special and exceptional game is the immense love that has gone into this hand-crafted world. The graphics are hand-drawn, and charmingly so. The story is well-written, with engaging characters and surprising depth. It's one of those games where you actually care about the people in it. Almost every tiny thing in the world can be clicked on to read a description, and everything is so wonderfully quirky, you actually want to click on every last thing and read the details. There are so many hidden surprises to be found, exploring the world is worth the price alone. (In fact, it's worth trying to click on everything in the game window, as there are several weird and unexpected results.)\n\nBecause everything in the world is detailed in such a wonderful way, it can be easy to overlook how well the simple gameplay suits the genre. In classic adventure games, there are often multiple modes for the mouse cursor, but TSWCE doesn't need a cursor that switches between a hand and an eye and so on -- if you can pick something up, you will. If there is an interaction to be had, it occurs. It allows you to focus on the immersion without worrying that you missed picking something up or turning something on.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the game treats you like a person. This may sound a weird thing, but it's a wonderfully weird game, and one that's worth playing after you've "beaten" it and solved the main plotline's problems.\n\nIt really is a special game and a special experience.

But while not being my favourite genre, is still one of my favourite games of all time. TSWCE has a very slow pace, beautiful music and crudely drawn but very nice graphics. Full of small jokes, puns and references, many of which are quite obscure, there is something in there for everyone.\n\nIt's not like the story is incredibly compelling, or even that the gameplay is unmissible. The music is very nice, but still quite average. I don't know what it is about this game, but it is incredibly charming, and extremely fun to play (You won't even notice the time passing, you  will intend to play 20 minutes and end up actually playing 4 hours xD).\n\nTSWCE is another great example that a good game doesn't need amazing graphics, with processor hungry lighting shaders. Or even compelling gameplay. Because I still give this game 9.2/10.","April 3","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
