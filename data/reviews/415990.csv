You have to get the light to change to the correct point whilst changing colours if necessary. There are also a lot of rules behind the game, as to what changes colours and what mirrors can move. In fact it’s probably wise to have a notepad with what happens to which colours and what makes it change to what colour. This can make the game a little scary. I just played the game blind and got pretty far and enjoyed what I played. I’m not the smartest of people though so I did get stuck quite often. Here are the positives and negatives:\n\nPositives :\n+ Great audio\n+ lots of content\n+ really good price\n+ Level editor\n+ Graphics are really good with the lighting effects\n+ Gamepad Support\n\nNegatives:\n- No Audio sliders\n- No Windowed Support\n- No Mouse Support\n- Lots of rules to colour changing which can be hard to memorise\n\nChanges:\n- No Audio sliders  (Audio sliders have been added 20th December)\n\nI personally would recommend this to people who enjoy puzzle games and those who enjoy light and colour changing. The music really adds to the game and I often find myself nodding and tapping my foot whilst trying to find out a solution. If you are slightly leaning towards purchasing, I would go and purchase it myself as for the price you really cannot lose (much.)\n\nI would not recommend if you are not very good at mixing colours or if you dislike keeping lots of notes down about colours. I would also not recommend to people who want to use their mouse as the game has no mouse support but keyboard and gamepad.\n\nOverall, I feel for the price it is worth a purchase.","December 19, 2015","true","7.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","2"

If you're a puzzle collector, get this. The simple interface and simple concept but challenging puzzles make for a nice, approachable game.\n\nLong version:\nLightbender is a good way to spend 10 minutes or 2 hours, solving incredibly mind-bending puzzles. Such a simple concept, just mirror, reverse, break or combine light; and yet it is very challenging. Sometimes you'll solve the puzzles by accident when you're trying out something new, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It'll teach you to think. There are also user-created maps, as well as a whole plethora of maps on the developers' part, so you won't be speedrunning this game.\n\nThe critical things that I would have to say would be that the music could be a bit better-ish. It's not bad but it can start to irritate you after repeating over a same puzzle for a long time. Fortunately, as always, you can turn it off in the options if you don't like it. Other than that, I can't really think of many bad things to say. If the game continues to be what it has been so far, it should be a nice, small little puzzle-game. To be honest, it might not be one of the most memorable ones because it doesn't seem to have a plot of any kind, but it's overall very tidy and nice game.","February 17","true","0.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The devs are so responsive and polite, and the game will leave you really impressed with the attention to detail and challenging puzzles. The tutorial is really simple and so is the basic idea of the game. The soundtrack is pretty nice, too. I'm not one for puzzle games at all, but I couldn't just quit when I couldnt figure out the solution. The learning curve is perfect- not too steep, not too slow.

Mouse UI for moving objects would've been nice, but keys/controller is sufficient.  Some minor annoyances like hitting "next" on the last puzzle in a group restarting the same puzzle.  All-in-all good as long as you're alright with a few menu quirks.","December 22, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack sounds like something from the 80s or 90s or something. It has interesting mechanics. Good for playing when bored (and rich).\n\nHowever, to use an engine which specializes in good graphics in a flash-like game? AND TO PAY FOR IT? Just, what. At least make the gameplay 3d so we can appreciate the graphics.\n\nedit: From what I've heard, you can change the camera angle now.\nThat's nice.","December 18, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MANdersson/recommended/415990/","MANdersson","Andersson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MANdersson/","392 products in account","Edit: Great and fast response and patching from the devs, only thing missing now is mouse controls. Would definitely recommend! Worth the price! :D\n\nOld Review at launch:\n1. Mousecursor is locked inside the window sometimes. Doesn't make any sense whatsoever.\n2. Not sure if it's only me, but there's no mouse control. Moving your mouse does around the menus does absolutely nothing, but for some reason left mouse buttons works as a confirm button. Really infuriating, especially because of point 1.\n3. No audio controls at all. Have to go into the windows audio mixer to mute or lower the volume of the game.\n\nThis is my first impression after 5 minutes of playing. As someone who regularly work with unreal engine, I know that mouse controls are not difficult to implement. Get on it.\nI am a sucker for mirrors and lazer though, and the game itself seems to have a decent amount of levels in it, even user levels. It's mostly those three points that are bringing it down for me. I would give this a thumbs up review if it weren't for those small issues.","December 18, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
