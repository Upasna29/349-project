Playing a Russian secret agent, your investigations in the murder of an undercover partner imply that a criminal organisation stealing Russian weapon systems might be interested in the nuclear submarine Kursk K-141.\n\nThe story then takes you onboard the submarine to conduct further investigations and covers 9 chapters. My first playthrough took me ~20 hours which I find sufficient for a game priced at 18€. I've seen games three times as expensive offering a considerably shorter playtime. Furthermore, unlike many other games which I stopped playing after a few hours because they just didn't thrill me, Operation Kursk's storyline was overall exciting and I always felt motivated to keep playing.\nHowever, the last two chapters felt a little like recycling to me, I personally would haved merged them into one chapter.\n\nFocussing on the technical aspects, the game honestly can't compete with blockbusters like GTAV in terms of graphics and animations. However, that didn't really bother me because I think it still creates an authentic athmosphere. Yet, I have to agree with Gwynlar that the voice acting isn't good (both in English and German versions) and generally lacks some passion. This actually disturbed me a little but after some time I got used to it and I felt it got better after the first chapter.\nOn the other hand, I have good news for all of you who are annoyed by the fact that hardly any recent game was released or even patched bug-free: I did not encounter any bugs throughout my entire playthrough!\n\nMost of the item combinations and interactions were pretty logical, some required a little creativity, and a few weren't really conclusive to me and I didn't know how to proceed in order to advance the story - especially when I needed to use one item multiple times in a row to trigger a reaction. But probably this is the nature of a Point and Click Adventure and makes up its charm - sometimes you just have to find out by trying things which don't seem obvious at first.\n\nIn summary, the aspects I liked and did not like about Operation Kursk K-141 were:\n+    overall thrilling story and setting, authentic athmosphere\n+    no bugs\n+    sufficient playtime\n+/- item combinations/interactions and puzzles\n-     technologically a little outdated\n-     rather passionless voice acting\n\nI would give the game an overall rating of 7.5/10 and recommend it to fans of Point and Click Adventures in particular and generally to anyone who likes to uncover the truth about a conspiracy theory, set against a thrilling background. If you are someone who doesn't put state-of-the-art graphics first (people who don't mind playing GTA San Andreas or  Minecraft know what I mean) and if you want to enjoy a stable game without bugs, you will be fine provided you accept the rather passionless voice acting.","December 14, 2015","true","24.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

As are all agents from this elite group, you have been given a new identity upon your appointment! Your new name is Milena Belyaeva and you have been given the task to look into a new criminal organization, “VORY,” which recruits former members of the Russian Secret Service, and is suspected of stealing their own military equipment. You will be thrown in the deep end – you will have to investigate the activities of the personnel aboard the submarine Kursk K-141 in order to find out who the traitor is.\n\nUndercover Missions: Operation Kursk K-141 is a point and click adventure game divided into 9 sensational and captivating chapters. You are going to embark on a thrilling adventure that will keep you constantly thinking about what do to next, and where to go to in order to move forward into the story.\n\nI consider myself well known to this genre of games, but I can tell you that I did not feel too smart about my methods of deduction or logic in more than one occasion!\n\nOn the bottom right of your screen you will have a magnifying glass, a car and a setting button. The magnifying glass button will help you to find all clues in each of the locations that you will visit. You will use the car button a fair bit when you are on-board the Submarine (I would prefer a map icon rather than car) where you will constantly move from one room to another to find more clues. I really enjoy the combination between the objects which, when put together, become a new brand item.  Sometimes the objects are not so obvious and you might find yourself in a pickle, really not knowing what to do next. Perseverance will prevail and your effort will be rewarded by entering a new chapter. YES!!\nThe graphics are good and the game runs really well, I did not encounter any issues throughout the entire game which took me a good 16 hours to finish. The voice-over is not the greatest, to be honest, but this should not put you off purchasing this game. The mini games are fun and can be a bit tricky.\n\nThis is a really solid and well-constructed point and click adventure game but it is not an easy one, which is what you want.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good and well-structured story\n-	Good graphics\n-	Makes you think all the time\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Voice-over could be better\n-	No  games achievements\n-	No trading cards\n\nA good and well-structured point and click adventure game - you can’t afford not to have this game in your game library!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE\n","January 13","true","16.8"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

I can't say that I had much fun playing Undercover Missions.\n\nThe story suffers from a rough English translation. There's quite a bit of engrish and nonsensical sentences in this game. All of which is voice acted rather blandly and monotone. Even when things get exciting. Our heroine sounds like she is about to fall asleep.\n\nFrankly, I can't say much about the story because it didn't make much sense to me. All I got out of the plot was that someone wants to blow up this sub for some reason and yeah they are on the sub. Maybe a lot of the story was lost in the translation. Perhaps it's better in German. Also it seems like a lot of the minor plot lines are forgotten about. That whole bit about your missing partner isn't talked about much. Hell only the steam description really talks about it.\n\nAs for the puzzles. I found them to be very frustrating and I mean frustrating in a bad early 90s adventure game way. There is a fair bit of moon logic in this game. Most of the number based puzzles in this game have to brute forced through. I can't say I find it fun having to trying a dozen different number combinations until I chance on the right one. Also, key items are often hidden in places that you have already checked before. Or worse are in places that make no sense but are only reviled after clicking on it a bunch of times. To me it seems like the dev just threw stuff around haphazardly. Likewise, there are a lot of red herrings in this game. You'll pick up a fair bit of items and interact with a number things that seem important or useful but aren't.\n\nAt the end of the day. I spent most of my time in this game reclicking on everything. Unsure of what to do and where to go. I just didn't have a fun time here.\n\nOver all I know this is an indie game. But even as indie this game feels cheap and unfinished. The ending doesn't make any sense and the story goes nowhere. While the puzzles are just frustrating. Maybe this game would be better with a walkthrough. But I don't think anyone has made one yet. So for right now it's a 5 out 10 game for me.","December 17, 2015","false","10.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I didn't tried the german voices but im sure they are better than the english ones (wished the game had russian voices for more realism though). The animations of the characters are terrible too.\nI may refund depending on how bad this continues, so far it looks interesting...but that's it.\nIf you are looking for buying it, check it out its interesting (as a point and click adventure that looks from 2004 and has a deficent plot can be) but have in mind that you may end up asking for a refund.\n","December 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

However, after finishing the game and realizing they must have run out of money at the end, I wish they had gone the 2D route and invested more in story development.\nPuzzles are the bread and butter of any adventure gamer. If they are good, they keep you invested in the story. If they are bad, they ruin everything.\nWhile there are some good, smart puzzles in the game, they are mere exceptions to the "WTF" reactions to the step-by-step walkthrough one has to use in order to finish the game. Radom objects apearing and disappearing without reason in different rooms - check; uninteresting, unidimensional and useless characters - check; combining objects in illogical ways - check; have to click objects several times in order to be able to use them - check; open, unsatisfying ending - check and so on.\n\nSo don't get this game unless it's on sale and you are desperate for adventure.","May 11","false","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
