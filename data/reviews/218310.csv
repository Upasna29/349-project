Point to the one of the two actions that you want to do (move, shoot), confirm, execute.\n-Simple damage and cover mechanics.\n\nCons:\n-The more you upgrade, the more you die.\n-Want any "meaningful" upgrades? It's no longer a "Free-to-Play"\n-String of repetitive campaign maps with no real story or purpose linking them together.\n\nDescription of my experience:\nLoaded up my two-man team, killed a few enemy, got some upgrades, and "proceeded to die in a loud, groutesque, military manner" (name that movie).\n\nFor just about every worthwhile upgrade, you'll pay actual money. This isn't like most F2P games where if you're willing, you'll have to grind about ten times as long to earn upgrades. Nope, that option isn't even available.\n\nThe other thing that is pretty irksome is the fact that you will NEVER outgun your enemy. I upgraded my free chap with a rifle. So did the enemy, and he brought two friends.\n\nI upgraded my second free chap with a machine gun... yep, you guessed it! The enemy upgraded too, and brought more of his friends! By the way, the extra kit that your guys carry it slows them down, but it does not slow down the enemy. The more you upgrade, the more you'll die.\n\nIt's a shame. I think I would have gotten a few more hours out of this one.","November 10, 2014","false","3.7"," 85 of 96 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","85","96","6","2"

Tried it on the PC, thinking I could link my game to both devices. That never worked for me and playing 2 separate games felt like a waste. I enjoyed the game a bit until I realised how pointless upgrading is. If you get a better pistol, the enemy gets the same one. If you buy a sniper, the enemy gets a sniper. Buy a med kit, meet a med kit. What's the point, then? Most missions are easiest with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starter gear, since the AI seem to utilize then less effectively.

I decided to do this neat little game called Frontline: Tactics. I played this during the summer due to boredom thinking "Hey, this game looks cool." After some thought, I downloaded it. I played it for about 15 minutes and thought it was pretty fun. I progressed to the difficulty of 'Easy' above 'Very Easy.'\n\nIt honestly felt like "Very Hard.'\n\nI quickly realized that one of the many reasons why it got harder was because it was a free-to-play game. The enemies are using one shot kills and unfair shots; prompting you to go "I need to get an upgrade. These basic weapons aren't going to cut it." Unfortunately, these upgrades cost REAL money. (But is that much of a surprise?)\n\nI prefer not to spend money on a F2P game. This is not a 'Free to Win' game where you can use any weapons at your dispose and try to win. This is a 'Pay 2 Win' game. I'm sorry but this is my honest opinion. Good day!\n\n","December 2, 2013","false","1.5"," 35 of 57 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","35","57","0","3"

There is a lot of missions but you need to get them. BARRACKS: Option taht makes you customize your soldiers using your credits earned by completing missions. You can change your soldier's name, buy a new gun or add attachments, give skills, change profiency, give armor, give grenade and see his statistics. You don't get much money when you complete a mission but that makes you safe money round by round which is a good thing.\nMULTIPLAYER: I tried playing with my friend and I have to admit multiplayer is t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e, you shouldn't not try it, it is like the worst thing there is in the history of video gaming, the lag is incredible, you shall not try the mutliplayer.

From what I have seen after playing 40+ hours, there are a few things here and there that makes me scratch my head and think, "are you being serious here?" The first thing is the business model consists of buying camos for your soldiers and additional soldiers along with extra credits to burn through, but I have never spent a single cent on this game because you can get everything you need after playing for a while so I never saw the point into buying anything from the store in the first place. Most of the time I can beat the AI just fine, but there are a few occasions that made me feel like the AI is cheating a bit with enemies who moves before you and they always outnumber you equipped with every piece of equipment you have bought. Once you've unlocked everything you wanted, there really isn't a whole lot to do left so most likely you're pretty much done playing Frontline Tactics. It's a nice little game to kill some time if you're bored, but that would be better suited for mobile devices than on PC because there are so many other games that is worth your time over Frontline Tactics. I still don't know whether to give Frontline Tactics a thumbs up or a thumbs down because I actually had a decent amount of fun with this game, but at the same time I already said to myself "I'm done with this game because there's nothing to do now" so I will give this game a thumbs up because the game is still worth trying out to see if you even like these types of strategy games, but I think the appeal won't last very long for some people.","September 21, 2014","true","49.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game has an awful Pay to Win aspect and an unplayable Singleplayer with dead multiplayer servers, that makes this game one bug waste of Hard Drive space This is one of the worst Free to Play games I ever played...\nOverall: 3- Fails to achieve anything, and pisses off FTP Player while they're at it...\n+ The game plays with great potential of becoming a rival to the Frozen Synapse game\n- This game is not only pay to win, but pay to ENJOY\n- Dead servers\n- Horrid Singleplayer\n\nGraphics: 6\nI understand where the graphics are getting at, it's a free game, and it's birds eye view, even though it looks like a mobile game port, I never really had expectations for the graphics in the first place.\n\nGameplay: 3\nIt feels like a dumbed down Frozen Synapse, but that's okay, but once you play you'll realize how cheap it really is, and how unrealistic and foolish players can be and STILL win. Speaking of horrible players, have I mentioned the singleplayer? An abysmal singleplayer is what you would expect from a mainly multiplayer game, but see, they effed it up REAL bad! The A.I. either A. bum-rush you, or B. DON'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL. It basically relies on luck, whether or not the enimies will be cheap no matter how strategic you are, or they will be dumb no matter how much you're winning. You never feel like you get a rewarding experience from it at all.\nOh, and one more thing, the Pay to Win is beyond some of the worst I've seen, in-game credits are worthless, and only worth something if you have 5$ along side it, if you don't want to pay, GOOD LUCK, you'll be stuff with a guy with a pistol and a guy with a MACHINE PISTOL while everyone has 5 guys with riot shields and f*cking Snipers. It's frustrating, beyond that it's ABYSMAL!\n\nUniqueness: 6\nWe've seen it before, XCOM, Frozen Synapse, etc. But what stands out about the game is that it actually some what succeeds in making that content stand out, but fails just as you jump right into Singleplayer, and as you fail to decide to spend money, it's just a dumbed down Frozen Synapse with nothing to offer.\n\nMusic: 5\nThere isn't much music, but there is a background theme in the menu that sadly repeats are has no variation, also the in-game sounds are also, but barely qualitfies as music, but just noise.\n\nStory: 2\nThere is, technically a warfare story in the game, but it's told in text and is barely established, nonexistant...","April 28, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is not easy but the game is not hard. You can't run and gun, you can't zerg, you have to 'take your time' with each mission, not like 30 min. I complete a very low threat mission in 5-8 minutes, and walk away with at least 30k, from a mission that has a base pay of 18k-21k\n\n\nThis game is simple and easy to use. point and click for movement, for attacks, and use of Skills like smoke bombs. The combat is like many other tactics games, which is I assume, why you went seraching for a tactics games. You deploy your troops, outmaneuver your opponent, have better positioning and over come the odds.\nSome of the people reviewing this game seem to be upset about the "paywall". I had almost everything unlocked, with out ever spending a dime. Will I spend some money later? Most likely, I like the camo outfits I can get. But I wont be paying for unit upgrades. You can get upgrades from in-game credit. The enemys will not use anything you dont have. If you dont have access to stealth units, the enemy team will not have one. IF you have access to Snipers, then so will the enemy team even if you dont deploy a sniper. So you have plenty of time to accumalate a lot of money and then deck out a new trooper with a new class,  new guns, armor, and skills. The balance I fill is well done, It is a tactics game, you have to out think the mission.\n\nKeep your guys alive, you get money for doing so, Get crossfires, you get money for doing do. outside the base payment for missions, you can really rack up some cash with crossfires. I can get 30k-40k off a mission that was only going to pay out 20k.       SKILLS, Skills, Skills, SKILLS Pay attention to skills.\nIt will take about 4-5 missions to get a new peice of gear, or skill.\nAfter every 5 mission wins you get an unlock you get to choose from new mssion types, an extra trooper or lots of cash, and even new skills.\n\nbiggest issue, I got a new computer, and when I reloaded Frontline, I had nothing unlocked. It is a big issue, Steam has cloud save, Frontline should be able to incorperate.\n\nNot so big of an issue, It does take time to gather the reasources to deck out a new trooper. But not so much that I did nto have fun doing so. The time it takes does give you time to learn the new class you just acquired.  Also, The lets go kill brown guys who all have brown guy names, cliche and over used.\n","July 14, 2014","true","42.7"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","0"

Sure, it feels like it was someones first video game project they ever made and some stuff like graphics and sound design feels a bit... off considering the game was made in 2012. Part of the reason may be that the game was ported from mobile devices to PC.\n\nBut that's not really the problem here. The biggest nuisanse comes from the quite thin but still existent pay wall. You need to pay money in order to get powerful units right from the start or play the game for hours and grind your way slowly through quite tough missions in order to get more units. This isn't much of an issue since the game only offers fun for the first few hours and then slowly starts to lose the fun. Missions begin to be repetitive and not really challenging at all after getting your first powerful units and there aren't really many multiplayer players with good unit builds. So you are either stuck with an extremely boring single player or quite dead multi player. Your choice.\n\nOh and I almost forgot. One of the achievements requires for you to use real life money in to the game in order to unlock it... Quite the cash grab achievement for completionists.","July 6, 2015","false","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The AI is very well thought out with the occasional moment of derpiness but overall it is great. The guns on this game are phenominal and the upgrades are incredibly well thought out, always making you think 'oooh I must save for that' or 'Would that help me?' Money can be tight but when you get an upgrade it is always noticeable. The In-Game purchases aren't forced upon you and you really don't need them.

Also you can shoot through things that shouldn't be shot through, so take that into account.\n\nOne thing people should note is that you can upgrade weapons by only doing a few missions worth of credits. It really does make a big difference when playing this game.\n\nUltimately, I'd say play it, especially if you have a dollar or two to blow from all your steam trading card money.

I also find gaining money quite hard.\nBut overall this is a amazing strategy game with a twist.\nI enjoy the idea of starting with only 2 units and slowly getting more, I just wish there was a guide in game to tell you what Unit type to buy that would help you most E.g I purchased a Heavy gunner at the start and I just found him constanly dying and i thought that maybe a snipe ming help.

Tutorial in this game is completely useless, especially when it teaches you the crossfire mechanic - there is no indicator to actually show where a unit is vulnerable.\n2. Graphics despite being on 1080p, are still ugly as they are on even 480p - would be better as a flash game.\n3. Character movement and shooting sometimes is unresponsive at times.\n4. Shooting after movement DOES NOT display arc of fire a character has.\n5. Character skills are completely absent, even specialist classes don't have any special abilities - profiency trees can actually be detrimental to your character!\n6. This game ACTUALLY encourages you to spend money to get an achievement and to buy credits - it's Pay-To-Win model and the price isn't worth it. Easier to grind. Eg. $100 for 64mil credits!\n7. You can shoot through walls.\nThere is alot of room for improvement.","November 5, 2012","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As such, you will like or hate this game based on the same reasons you liked or hated the Ghost recon game, but if you played that game then I recommend this becasue it has a similar playstyle and can be fun for a few hours. It's not perfect, but so far I'm having fun.\n\nI will say that the singleplayer is pretty nice, it's not too in your face with popups about buying credits or whatever and it is pretty challenging. It is also possible to get through it without spending any real money. In my opinion it is one of the best free to play models I've seen. Most of the upgrades are cosmetics camofloage etc, you can buy classes but you can unlock them through gameplay, they seem to cost a lot of credits at first but each level awards 20'000+ depending on how well you did so you will soon have the classes you want.\n\nAll in all I will have to recommend it for the singleplayer alone, it's not perfect but hey, its free and its keeping me entertained for now I haven't spent any real money and I don't think I will be pushed too hard to pay money. I have played the multiplayer with friends and it was fun but I wouldn't recommend playing online with people you don't know until you have good loadouts on your characters because it can be a little unforgiving in that respect.\n\nJust play it, you're not losing anything by downloading a free game from Steam.","May 23","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its especially well suited to those moods when you want to game, but also sit back and chill watching something on tv or even just playing with a pet while also distracting your mind.\n\nSome call this game pay to win etc. I call BS. I dropped a meager 2 dollars on the DLC complete pack during a sale and that is more then enough of a leg up for even the least tactical minded player to push through the rough start and get ones groove going.\n\nIm going to have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable little turn based tactical strategy games with some RPG character development Ive played since the classic fallout tactics and final fantasy tactics , a couple of my fave of the genre.\n\nIf your looking to start it Id personally wait for a nice discount sale on the DLC to give you that extra oomph, but its not some magic I win button.\n\nIm also talking largely from the single player approach. I dont know exactly how the PVP maps play, but if they use your own soldier team then frankly Id not touch it till my squad feels complete from the solo campaign. By that I mean having a solid 5 man squad all with developed primary and 2ndary specialties, and at least the teir 3 weapon in each.\n\nThat is about where I started to feel like I was playing my characters rather then as the mere meat puppets they start out as in my eyes.\n\nSeriesouly if you have any love for the genre, and a few bucks to drop during a sale on the DLC Id stress you DL the game and give it a few missions to pull you in.\n\nI think many will be most surprised when they start seeing just how much each unit can be developed and customized over time to suit given play style approaches.\n\nIve re rolled a few characters including some of the pay for dlc guys, playing with comboes to find what I personally like.\n\nFor example I first tried making my medic a sniper but found the combo so slowed him down as to make him worthless. I ended up using a small arms/ medic who is fairly quick, hits decently hard at close range to defend himself, and move quickly to get to those who need him.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/218310/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Frontline Tactics is a free-to-play squad level, turn-based tactical game where missions become available on a strategic regional map and missions take place on an isometric map based on one of several static locations (Fishing village, tank battle, etc).\n\nThe basic aim of the game is to complete missions on the game map with the soldiers you have available and the skills and weapons at their disposal.  As you complete more missions you earn credits which can be spent upgrade your team.  For every 5th mission completed, you get to unlock certain strategic options, such as more mission types (Liberate area, Defend area, Timed survival etc), more locations (maps) plus bonuses such as +credits or +team member slots.\n\nIts basically a pay-to-pay game, with anything from squad members, solder proficiencies, soldier skills, equipment, weapons, weapon attachments being able to be purchased with in-game credits.  However you do not have to pay, credits can be earned while just playing through missions, which is what I have done.  Its slower, alot slower but, it just means you will have to play alot more missions to get you squad up to spec.\n\nI have mixed feelings about about this game.  On one hand the gameplay is fiendishly addictive but, on the other hand it can be enormously frustrating to play.  Luckily its quite forgiving if you get your squad killed or fail a mission as all soldiers have infinite lives and you can replay missions when you lose.\n\nWhat it does do really well is provide a great representation of squad scale tactical battles which are fun and furious and include: use of cover, crossfire, close and ranged combat, thrown explosives, use of camoflague, decent mission variety, overwatch, soldier perks & skills and a decent range of equipment and weapons.\n\nWhat it doesnt do so well is that it isnt balanced on two levels.  It doesnt provide a fair challenge as in alot of missions you will be outnumbered, the enemy will move first in droves and sometimes they will move twice before you even do so and kill several of your men before they have even had a chance to move.  Secondly the rate at which you can upgrade is quite slow depending on your strategy.\n\nHowever once you do put in a few hours and have completed around 40 missions you will have earned enough credits to have a decent team with dual proficiencies (rifles, smgs, close-combat, hand-to-hand, sniper or heavy weapons) with some armour, some may have grenades (stun, frags) even if your team will have basic skills (one for each proficiency) and basic weapons (which can be upgraded from late 80s to future-tech).  At this stage the game gets to be very enjoyable as even if your enemy gets the jump on you, you should be able to recover and lead your team to victory in most cases.\n\nWhile I havent purchased any in-game credits I did buy the extra soldier dlcs when on sale, and they were more than worth it as you only start your team with 2 solders.\n\nOverall the game is just about recommendable as it is more enjoyable than frustrating and worth the time of anyone who loved Jagged Alliance 2 or any game of that genre.\n\n** Just be warned that if you are after 100% achievements there is one were you must buy £80/$100/100euros worth of credits just to unlock.  ^^ **","August 13, 2014","true","63.9"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","23","45","0","3"

Your weapons do damage base on the range short, medium or long rang. The basic damage is then reduce by other factor like cover and armor.\n\nThe control of the game and it mechanic is fairly easy to learn. But I found the camera control awkward and I didn't find the option to change them. If I would've been a lefty I would have found them just find.\n\nThe big downfall of the game for me was that for some obscure reason, I could not buy or upgrade anything. All I was getting is a screen saying "Loading...". So I was stuck with the two starting guys and their low grade weapons. In PvE mode the missions get harder and harder. At some point it's simply imporssible to complete a mission without upgrading your gear and getting more men. There's no way I'm going to try PvP with 2 guys and the starting gear. I have to note that one of my friend tried the game at the some times as me and he had access to the shop so you might not get my bad luck. So in short my most negative point about the game might not even affect you.\n\nIt's at least a few minutes of entertainment and it not only free but also a small download.\nI don't think you'd lose much trying it out, but I still deleted it after less then an hour (4 missions).","October 11, 2014","false","0.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS. This was the biggest waste of time I ever played. The "tactical" aspects of Frontline Tactics are barely there with most enemies standing devoid of cover, making it child's play to take them out. Granted, your own forces face the same problems, and when there is cover, missions can drag on as you do minimal damage to each other.\n\nOntop of that, the F2P aspect makes you game horribly limited. Mission after Mission is required just to afford even the most mundane of equipment or even more soldiers, and special options like camo or unit customization are strictly Pay Only.\n\nBetweem simple AI, simplistic graphics, and very limited customization options from the get go, I would not recommend this to play at all. There are much better Tactics based games out there, either free or cheap enough to buy.","May 4, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, it's just a game. You earn credits no matter if you lose or win and it helps to learn from your mistakes. Eventually you'll have enough credits to upgrade yourself which will help make it easier to play as your performance is improved. I have the patience for it and this is sure is a game I would play weekly. Yet if you don't enjoy losing once in a while because of a unfair advantage, you might flip tables and end up like the people in the comments below who are complaining something that is just a game. I would suggest a few things to improve the game: #1 would be a sense of realism. In this game, all the enemies rush in at a specific distance from you, I noticed, and it would be more realistic if the AI felt fear in the sense that they'd keep somewhat of a distance if the player was to rush in or throw a nearby grenade. Instead of everything being all gunz a-blazing, haha! My second suggestion is if in defending missions we could create our own base/map to defend off AI's and other players! I think it would be awesome to be able to put down buildings, damaged vehicles and bunkers. My final suggestion is to have our own custom camouflage. Like if we could choose between an array of different colors or maybe even have zombie camouflages, just for fun? The runescape graphics in the game don't really bother me at all and I really like how blood sprays everywhere just by shooting someone!","February 15, 2014","true","27.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Requires strategy and planning if you want to win battles.  But, can be played just for fun, too. Winning is not everything.\n\nClose the game and Steam in order to reset the bases for attacks/defenses/escapes.  The game has a tendancy to favor the newest unlocked bases otherwise.  Downside, it does not allow you to pick from all of them, that were available at certain times in the game.

Which means that you have to constantly drag it around to see what's going on.\n\nTry it out before you buy anything - the base game is free, and I can guarantee that the first 2 missions will be enough to decide if you like it.","October 24, 2014","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However, there is a reason why I love them, mostly because they are well made and fun to play than just because they are turn-based strategy.\n\nThat being said, this game ♥♥♥♥ing blows. The graphics suck, the story is non-existent, and if you want to successfully play more than 20 missions it will cost you (a LOT of) real money due to yet another ludicrous free-to-play microtransaction model. I had fun for an hour or so, but it has been awhile since I have played XCOM. This game briefly reminded me of what I have been missing, before becoming about as much fun as finding out you have AIDS.\n\nGood: It's free... sort of. Crossfire is a cool tactic and there is a decent amount of customization.\n\nBad: Graphics, Sound, AI, Story, there are people out there who worked on this and/or spent money on this, and I'm not sure which is worse.\n\nUgly: Graphics.

It's all of it based on a massive strategy, on your strategical move. One of yours may fail the whole game. It's about time of playing to realize how cool this game may be. Starting first mission, getting payed, unlocking achievements, upgrading the stats, personalizing your soldiers, and yes, I said soldierS. You can carry up to 4-5 soldiers in a mission, even 12 if you get the Pack.

It takes a lot of time to get anywhere and does a poor job of not appearing pay to win at the start.\nYou can earn more soldiers as you play with unlocks. However the difficulty curve and some levels are incredibly poorly designed. Cover system is pretty garbage as you can only use half walls/obstacles as cover and apparently full walls dont count nor are soldiers able to go prone.\nThis game I would say falls under the nearly unreasonable grinding to win.\nAs a tip though, if you run out of missions that are beatable in single player, wait a few hours and some new missions should show up.","December 25, 2014","false","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So heres a narrative of what happened.\n\nFirst thing I notice is that the controls on the menu are messed up. After struggling for a few minutes I manage to get into the singleplayer.\nNext I notice  that my progress was lost. I didn't consider this a problem since I remember the game being fun and looked forward to starting again.\nNow I look to select a mission and see that it is randomly moving the mission select around. I randomly click on play mission and get a completely different one than what I clicked on.\nAfter loading the mission my controls immediately rush my curser into the upperleft of the map. After trying to coral them long enough to move my characters, I decide to quit and start up again since we now have full controller support.\nAnd to my great suprise the controls are still broken when I start up again.\nI quietly shut down the game and delete it from harddrive so that i never have to see it again.\n\nThis game used to be good and now it is utter ♥♥♥♥♥ to play.","March 19, 2013","false","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first few missions on F.T. weren't bad, but as I got further into the game, the more annoying it became ...\n\nI'll start off by saying I prefer turn-based to R.T., and there's what looks like a solid option on here to do either, so I went with t.b.  You CAN do missions this way - but it will end up taking you upwards of 6 RT hours or more if you're like me and you like to turn over every stone, looting as you go ( I hate missing stuff ! ).\n\nOk, so after the first mission or so, it begins to take a really long time - not so bad ?  Well, also, you can't save during combat.  In fact, you can't save AFTER combat either, unless you manage to get back to a base.  On some games I could understand this ... on a game like F.T. where (turn-based) it takes you 6 hrs or more to finish a mission, it's nigh unforgivable.  Even so, that STILL wouldn't be so bad, except ...\n\nWhoever designed the layout of some of these missions was a sadistic @#$!  Don't get me wrong here - fighting's great, you can change up weaponry fairly easily, standard stand, crouch, crawl, walk, run ... but when you look at the map and the checkpoints, then eyeball the overall terrain itself, it'd be nice to think if you decided to go one way to get to, say, Checkpoint X on the map, you wouldn't discover 90% of the way there that some hip-high barrels had been placed strategically along the way to ensure that you COULDN'T get there from here ... The iso view is annoying in that way b/c of the level of obscurity you have to deal with (i.e., is that alleyway running behind that building blocked, or is there a clearcut way to get down it and out the other side?).  Generally, any time you have to wonder about that answer in this game, assume the answer is a big fat NO.  The game delights in having you do an amazing amount of backtracking.  Granted, there are a few things you can crawl under.  But there's no climbing over or rolling barrels out of the way.  If you get to a hip high sandbagged wall, there's no way of removing said sandbags from your path so your vehicle can get through ( I tried dynamite even w/o any luck ).  Perhaps if you play the game in R.T. this wouldn't be nearly the hassle that it is in T.B.  Just my 2 cents.","July 4, 2015","false","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is exactly what you have to do if you do not pay-to-play/ win. Most of the levels cannot be beat with the basic stuff that you get and the price of items. It is playable without paying to an extent, but overall I think the paytoplay ruins what might have been a decent game otherwise.","March 1, 2014","false","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the most awe inspiring graphics but it fits for its purpose.  A special ops squad often outnumbered, or at least in the early stages.\n\nMy first review for a game, and there is others I played more, but this one..this one got me to break that silence and share about my own fun within.\n\nI've recently unlocked a third team member, do note if you pick the close combat specialization, he starts with a knife so try and unlock that second weapon quick..it takes credits, not real cash.\n\nOverall a solid 8/10 for music and gameplay.\n\nWhat would improve on what I've already seen?  Well, one grenade in those odds isn't enough of an equalizer.  Two, purhaps but no more than three would be better.  Too many and the strategy of position and the type of play I enjoy goes out the window, and it just becomes a grenadeathon.","January 1","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
