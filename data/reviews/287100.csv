Chaos Domain proves that a lot can go wrong when attempting something that the Japanese have mastered two decades ago.\n\nAt it's core, Chaos Domain is 2.5D Contra-wannabe that sufferes from failing at grasping the most basic concepts of classic running & gunning. It kinda looks the part, but as soon as you actually start playing it, it feels off. Way off.\n\nControls are somewhat floaty and have a tendency to be unresponsive at times - this means a lack of much needed precision, precision the game demands in parts but simply cannot provide. Especially ducking and shooting left and right without getting up is next to impossible on the analogue stick. And the character has the nasty habit of just jumping a few pixels too short  and getting somewhat stuck in the terrain or suddenly gaining crazy amount of momentum - possibly remains of the UE physics engine or something that hasn't been properly deactived for a 2D game. Currently the game only supports the analogue stick on the 360 pad with no option to change that as far as I am aware - not helping the case of unresponsive controls.\n\nThe button layout is pretty much original Contra-style, with an added button for items. What it's lacking is the weapon angle lock that the newer Contras have - due to that you will be jerking all over the screen looking like your character has a seizure or two while shooting in all directions.\n\nEventhough the controls are kinda crappy compared to much better efforts like Völgarr the Viking or Oniken, they are still the best thing about this game. It only goes downhill from here.\n\nLet's start with the leveldesign - bland and boring. This is on the same page as crappy 90ies shareware games for MS-DOS. A bunch of rooms, lots of platforms and the occasional elevator or conveyor belt. Games from 1988 bury this title when it comes to memorable, fun enviroments to fight in. And all looks pretty much the same too, as it is  all happening on a spaceship - and that is what you get: metal boxes, metal floors, metal walls. There may be small variations in the graphic sets (the levels have a slightly different hue of color, the laboratory is more blue-whitish while other areas might be more green or red) but it's nothing exciting to look at. And the levels themselves are so dull, no rhyme or reason to the layouts, there is no flow or rhythm to these stages - enemy placement seems random at best (certain enemies spawn in the same place - but they don't seem to be placed there with any care or thought).\n\nEnemies aren't much to write home about either, they did get one thing right though - the majority of them are popcorn enemies - thank the retrogods for that. Still, they basically have the same weaponry as you and casually fire in your general direction even though they seem to perfectly know where you are. Again, there is this weird feeling of somebody not thoroughly studying the old games that did this many times better - I have died so many times to delayed shots that were just fired when enemies felt like it. There were no patterns or timing involved. It makes judgement of situations next to impossible - that is why you will probably try to kill the bad guys close to offscreen for the majority of the time - if you actually want to survive long enough to get that highscore.The designs themselves are largely forgettable, xenomorph heads on space marine bodies and a wizard-looking guy with a wand. Yawn.\n\nBosses are some of the worst I have seen in a game like this since … forever, really. They are crappy beyond belief. The patterns in particular are laughably bad - some of them even have safe zones where you cannot get hurt, like at all. They are also very slow and incredibly unexciting. And they suffer from providing next to no feedback, especially hit confirmation is nearly non-existent. Bosses are awfully quiet too and there is not much of an visual indicator of targets to shoot at or that you are actually hitting the targets. They are kinda small as well, and very unimaginative - I know the devs wanted to be cute when they put in the Powerloader from Aliens or an exact copy of an Vulture Omnimech from Battletech, but I am not convinced. The bosses are lazy, boring crap. Heck, halfway through they ran out of "ideas" and let you chase after the same guy in mildy remixed versions of the same fight. This hurts the game tremendously, because bosses (the awesome, screen-filling kind) are one of the high-points of these games amd reason I play them - to fail so hard at something so important boggles the mind.\n\nFinally, there are a lot of general game design decisions that I don't get. Like the upgrade system; instead of giving you upgrades during gameplay and having you handle different guns every now and then you are stuck with a standard gun and very scarce weapon pick ups. In order to upgrade weapons you take the money you get from beating a stage and upgrade your weapons in a shop. The problem is, this system is hardly balanced - the starting weapon without upgrades is complete garbage, putting you in a spot of severe disadvantage - as you simply can't fire fast enough to counterattack. However, once you grind  a bunch of levels for cash and get the guns up to snuff, they are immensly overpowered. Again, not much thought seems to have been put into this.\nApparently there are items in the game too, but each use costs money and I did beat the game without using a single item - so I honestly don't care. Instead of spending money on a shield taking two hits, I'd rather buy an upgrade for the spreadshot - thank you very much.\n\nThen there is a combo mechanic and a score system going, but it is so simplistic it's hardly worth mentioning. I pretty much did "perfect" scores on 80% of the levels without even trying - so either I am pretty good, or the system is flawed (hint: it's the system).\n\nLet's wrap this up with the presentation: the game looks alright, but lacks any graphic settings - I had to force V-Sync by fiddling with .cfg files. Also, there is an annoying grain filter going on that makes the game look like an animated gif if you take a closer look. The music is a bland industrial/metal/techno-something - it fits the game but it's not particularly great. Sounds are pretty much standard, but the bosses oddly miss a lot of sound effects as mentioned above (the Vulture explodes and it's the most silent explosion I have ever heard).\n\nOf course there are the occasional glitches: random spawns with no weapons that don't move but block fire, I had the game crash at one point and since then achievements have stopped working, the camera usually isn't fast enough to keep up with me forcing me to make leaps of faith (and die in the process, also fall damage!) and other small stuff like not actually being able to buy items via gamepad/controller. I could go on, but I think this is a way too indepth wall of text already.\n\nAnyway, If you haven't figured it out by now - stay away if you want a good 2D action game. Chaos Domain is an amateurish attempt with so many obvious flaws that I highly recommend you skip this and check out something like Oniken (pretty much the closest thing to a Contra game on Steam right now), Völgarr the Viking or the somewhat poor port of Metal Slug 3 instead.","May 2, 2014","false","6.7"," 223 of 268 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","223","268","0","0"

The developers offer no support on the matter, so you should not risk spending your money on something that most likely will not work.\n\nIn the event the game does work, it is still a pretty poor game, and not nearly as good as the original contra, which is sad, given that Contra is about 30 years old.   Your main character is Anubis, althoug there is no story as to why or how that ties into Egyptian mythology, and you just run through the levels, which all look the same and fight the same looking enemies over and over again.  It is very repetitive and the placement and attack patterns of the enemies do not induce that heart pounding tension that these types of games are supposed to produce.\n\nThere is an upgrade system in place, where you can buy useless temporary upgrades and upgrade your terrible gun into a slightly less terrible gun, also power ups are few and far between, which means you will spend most levels armed with oonly your basic pea shooter, which further adds to the monotony of this game.","August 2, 2014","false","1.9"," 103 of 127 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","103","127","0","0"

I'm going to talk about many more aspects of the game because that's kinda my thing, but the key takeaway here is how poorly balanced the challenge is. It's a problem so huge that regardless of what you think of the rest, it makes the game virtually unplayable. But don't fret, the rest is garbage too.\n\nChaos Domain dumps you into the cyberboots of future Anubis, fighting hundreds of cyberdudes along wholly unremarkable cybercorridors. Levels have only two components, hallways of fixed height that only scroll in one direction, and shafts that you can platform up and down freely. Platforms mostly hold enemies that fire slow, creeping bullets and die in one hit, but can also be laden with health pickups (more like 1-ups), new guns, or point-granting ankhs. I will go ahead and tell you now, I have no idea what is up with the Egyptian theme, especially since it only extends to the player character and point items.\n\nThere are ten chapters, three levels to a chapter. They take a few minutes to run through, assuming you are quick on the draw and don't touch any of the numerous enemies, bullets, explosives, explosive barrels, electrified floors, or glitchy crushers littering the levels. One touch of anything instantly kills you, respawning you in place a moment later and costing you one of your three lives. Lose all three and you start the whole level over. The problem here should be apparent, because as early as the second chapter you'll be fighting shooting dudes, running dudes, grenade dudes, and rocket launcher dudes all at once.\n\nI was unimpressed but tolerant until the final level of chapter two. There's an elevator that cages you in and brings you to a floor with a dude that shoots you immediately. A few minutes later you have to fight the chapter boss, who is fully invincible while spraying shots at you and is only vulnerable while sending waves of dudes to kamikaze you. And when you lose all of your limited lives, you get to do the whole level over, murdervator and all. Even if the graphics weren't bland and strangely grainy, even if the weapons didn't feel like Nerf guns, and even if there were some kind of story at all, Chaos Domain would still be too incompetently designed to stick with. The lowest bar you can set for a platformer is to have a reasonable sort of challenge, and it can't even clear that.","February 19","false","0.3"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","30","38","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HammerTonk/recommended/287100/","HammerTonk","[BTB]Hammerdown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HammerTonk/","526 products in account","The first negative review I've written and certainly not something I take much pleasure in.\n\nChaos Domain as has been mentioned by many reviewers is a return to the age old Contra formula, static 8 directional shooting (much like the sort a classic D-pad was meant for) with awkward platforming, enemies that can shoot you through platforms that are supposed to be solid objects and ridiculously slippy controls without all the fluidity of Contras double jumping, this game is best left on the wayside.\n\nFor those of you like me, who don't own a 360 controller and don't necessarily see it as a requirement for games on a PC- don't get me started, the control scheme is a nightmare. I'm left handed and the standard controls are made with a right handed user in mind so you'll need to go through the borish task of arranging them to better suit you. The keyboard controls are poorly responsive and in a twitch shooting game where dozens of enemies might be shooting at you at once this is unacceptable.\n\nNow on to the basics, I played one mission- that's three sections of a map that are broken up to create a single mission- so three 'check points' as it were. The beginning of the game as you might expect has you running to the right- but not able to return to the left (!) to collect missed pick ups or kill enemies and has you repeat this process three times, all while being shot by enemies through floors and walls, ceilings and anything else they seem to teleport their bullets through, which would be forgivable if you didn't get three lives (and one continue on the easier difficulty per check point) and died when you were hit once.\n\nAt the end of the first mission I was faced with a boss that is clearly a rip off of the loader from Aliens and other titles in the same franchise where it might well crop up. You are on a conveyor being dragged towards it while it fires either on a platform above it, or down the conveyor you are travelling on. You MUST hit it in the cockpit, meaning you need to be on the upper platform- not an issue, if not for the respawning guy on the platform above, lobbing grenades down at you that have an AOE far larger than is indicated by the explosion shown on screen.\n\nIt was at this point I turned the game off, and cursed myself for even bothering to pick it up.\n\nI'm not going to list pros and cons for this, as I can't be bothered to do so. I'll simply offer my honest advice, keep your money, don't waste your time and don't waste a friends time- unless he/she and you are equally brain dead, by forking cash over for this half baked attempt at a classic and realized concept. Your friendship will swiftly end, your irritation will reach maximum levels in record time and your relatives will swiftly disown you if they learn you have this in your library.","November 13, 2014","false","0.1"," 49 of 84 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","49","84","0","2"

As much as us in the PC Master Race hate to admit it, consoles were the only real place to play games before the 90's or throw your quarters away at the arcade. Sidescrolling with limited lives, continues and patience. This game doesn't have graphics that will sweat your 780ti or 290X, or make your processor cry for mercy, it doesn't have a pulse pounding 5.1 soundtrack, or multimonitor gaming, it doesn't have a near endless list of graphic options,  or a lengthy tutorial on how to play, it doesn't have some loose story (in fact it has none at all) with bad voice acting or a star studded cast.

These controllers today just do not have the responsiveness of the old Arcade sticks of yore.\n\nOh well, if you want to play a game that is a short time killer, or enjoy being challanged by having to discover how to play on your own, or just like baddies that can hit you with ease and love tossing your controller; This game is worth the $10 entry fee.\n\nNeed your hand held all the time, or need eye bleeding graphics, a forgiving system that always makes you feel superior, or if you just need to feel like a PC Master Race ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by never touching a controller; This game is NOT for you.","January 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

If it were an early access game, it would make more sense, because it shows all the hope of an unpolished tech demo.  The graphics are nice in a technical way, albeit one lacking in art direction.\n\nHowever, the levels seem all but unfinished, with the bizarre inclusion of the NES can't-walk-left restriction on certain parts.  If retro feel was the intended effect, why then is it absent throughtout the rest of the title?  No, wait, there are some very retro aspects to the controls, which are sluggish and prone to causing jumps off platforms just as you land, but the retro games it makes me think of are 90s Shareware, best left in the past and forgotten by sane men.\n\nMaybe it's fun co-op?

So I got this game for free. But I still find it too expensive for the "enjoyment" it provides. And I'm not talking about the hardness or such.\n\nTo judge how fun this game is to play all you need to do is to check the Steam Achievement stats for Chaos Domain. I reached the "5 star rating on any area of the game" and "Kill 50 enemies" achievements in just 17 (seventeen) minutes gameplay according to Steam. This is a good thing, you might say, with levels filled with tons of enemies. But the stats also shows that 39 % of the players achieved 5 stars while only 16 % achieved 50 kills which I did in 17 minutes.\n\nThis means that most people just stopped playing this game after the first or second level and they did not even invest 17 minutes of their lives into this game. If you don't believe the reviews, this must convince you how awful this game is.\n\nThe good part:\n\nThe music is not bad\nYou might enjoy that you have to dodge bullets since every single hit is instadeath. You have three lives and one continue for each level (on easy).\nIf you read this review and decide not to buy this game my life was not pointless and the time I put into this game and writing this review was good for something and that makes me happy.\nAnd the bad:\n\nThe controls are dreadful and absolutely ruins all the fun which the game could provide (if any). In theory you can aim into 8 directions but you can't aim diagonally while standing still. Even the rebind keys menu is lying to you. It says "Aim up: W", "Aim down: S" which is not true. If you stand still, S just chrouches and does not aim anywhere. It's not better even if you try to play with a controller.\nYour gun is pretty weak. If you pick up a better one and you survive the level with that one, it doesn't matter. On the next level you get back your basic gun again.\nDid I mention that the controls are so bad that make you stop playing?\nYou can spend your cash into items like shield which absorbs one (1) bullet. But it does not regenerate or anything. It's a single use shield for a single bullet for a lot of money.\nThe graphical options are nothing more than a limited list of resolutions you can choose from. And the sound options are limited to the music volume settings.\nAnd the controls are bad too.","December 5, 2014","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Constantly. Even moreso once I saw the screenshots. Then I got it for free in a giveaway.\n\nIn 20 minutes, I've played up until the first boss fight.\n\nIt does indeed keeps the spirit of old arcade run 'n gun like Contra and Metal Slug, to a degree: One hit kills, 6-directional non-mouse aiming, run left or right, jump, shoot, repeat.\n\nMake no mistake, however: This game is exactly as bad as they say it is.\n\nLevel design is bland, not because of the art style (although it's nothing new either), but because of the extremely simple layout (even moreso than the first Contra).\nYou die if you touch enemies. Bullets to the face may also present a threat.\nBoss fight can be tricky, but it's just a matter of getting used to it.\nSame goes for controls.\nOST is not exactly annoying, but after a while you'll want to play without it because it's composed of short loops.\nI have got past the first boss, and I can confirm that the crash on 2-2 is triggered by a flying robot. This can be bypassed by anticipating the robot's position and shooting it as soon as in enters the screen, although it also may randomly pass by without crashing the game just playing it over and over.\nEnemies are also 6-directional on their attacks. This may be tricky.\nYou can buy upgrades, but I figured how to open the upgrade menu but le ♥♥♥♥'s expensive so I didn't get jackshit yet.\nYou can also pick up weapons.\nGraphics are nice. (thank you based Unreal Engine)\nYou can't backtrack most of the time (camera only moves left, so if you miss an item you dun goofed). There are a few exceptions to this, mainly in levels that have two paths.\n\n10/10 it goes beyond bad if you look further into it, but it's so bad that it's somehow good.\nI actually like it, and intend to finish it.\nThen again, maybe I am just the rare weird individual who plays awful things and likes it.

But since it is one of the worst pieces of entertainment I have ever seen, I will. The default configuration is wasd/move and space/jump, and fire is the K key... you cannot rebind it to mouse 1, this game is keyboard control only. There is no gamepad support which is inexcusable. I could probably program gamepad support myself into a game, yet it eludes the capabilities of these people. Nobody wants to play a sidescrolling platforming game with keyboard only, or any game for that matter. Even if I could use my gamepad, I wouldn't want to. Everything about this game sucks bad but it is not worth my time to elaborate on details, that is how bad it is. It feels like someone's first raw attempt at making a game with some game maker program you can buy on steam. One thing I will say is that it had horrible screen tearing, which is especially noticeable in side scrollers, because vsync is off by default and there is no option to enable it. I could have forced it with Nvidia control panel but again, the game is not worth the time.\n\nIf the next time I am at a fair and I pop a balloon with a dart and I can pick either this game or to drink after a homeless guy with mouth herpes, I would choose the latter.\nThis game has NOTHING on Tiger wrist watch games and I sincerely mean that from the bottom of my heart.

Your default weapon can shoot once per second.

Sometimes an explosion that barely touches you will kill you. At least when you die, you get 2 seconds of invincibility, otherwise most of the time you'd just die ASAP.\n\nThe menu responsiveness has considerable input lag.

He won it in a giveaway and it wasn't his style of game.  That being said, I come from the era of Contra and R-Tyle, etc.  This game is a ♥♥♥♥-poor attempt at the frentic run-n-gun platformer genre.  I'd love to find something good to say about the game, but I sadly can't.  I was only able to play for about 45 mins before I got so infuriated at the controls and general buggyness that I had to call it.\nThe controls are extremely slipshod; you cannot angle your gun 45 degrees without moving, you cannot aim your jumps well, and the general feel of moving the charactor is jerky at best.  This is the heart of RnGP's, how can you screw that up, honestly?  It's beyond infuriating.\nVisuals are bland and uninspired, same level designs over and over from what I could get through, same enemies with slight weapon variations, and simply lackluster environs.  I could almost forgive that, given the nostalgia twang it tried to invoke, but it's seriosly worse than Simons Quest.\nThe music is repetitive, and not in the good way.  I can understand a lazy repetitive score on the older 8/16-bit games, but even if you're going after that feel, there is no excuse for re-using the same boring tune throughout.\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this title, it simply isn't worth it.","January 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It has potential, but it is practically BEGGING for another play-testing cycle.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's mostly functional, but so badly put together...\n\nThe enemy AI, for example: there is none. They just stand still, waiting for a bullet, occasionally shooting one at you, usually with no warning signs as to when they are about to shoot. Most of the enemies shoot you as soon as they enter into frame, and the result is many bullets you can't honestly see coming.\n\nSo, you'll get hit, and you die with 1 hit, metal slug style. And the death animation is a simple ragdoll that goes on for 5 whole seconds, so you don't get entertained for dying: for example, in Metal Slug when you die you see your character screaming, fall, roll on the ground lifeless. In Chaos Domain your character just falls. Like someone pulled the plug or something.\n\nAs I've mentioned, most enemies just stand still waiting for a bullet. None of them comes running into frame (like the enemies in contra or metal slug), and so the stages feel lifeless and dull. There are also soooo few enemies to shoot at. You spend most of the time running in the stage.\n\nAnd the stages layout is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's just a mash of random floating platforms, boxes and barrels. It's boring to look at too.\n\nJust...don't buy it. For 10 dollars you can find much better stuff to keep you entertained.","December 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The bullets go THROUGH the floor and platforms.....how'd they miss fixing that before it came out? Fight same 1 guy and use same boring gun. You even die if you  don't get shot but if you touch a guy or if you touch the side of a smashing object that missed you and you're standing to the side of it; as opposed to it just stopping your progress because there's nothing on the side of it that could damage you, let alone kill you.

If you watch a video, it looks pretty good. There are a few simple problems with this game that need fixing. First, it is the controls. The control scheme simply does not feel very good. Second, the jump simply doesn't work well for this game. On platform shooter type games with lots of jumping, you need to have good control over your jumps. This game doesn't give that. For the most part, you can either jump straight up or to the sides. There is virtually no control over changing the direction of the jump once you are in the air. Pair this up with a Super Mario Bros. 1 feature where the screen only goes from left to right and does not permit the player to backtrack, it just doesn't work.\n\nTo the makers of this game- Fix these problems, and you're scores will go way up, and perhaps you'll make more money on it too.","April 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emoleveldesigner/recommended/287100/","emoleveldesigner","EmoLevelDesigner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emoleveldesigner/","249 products in account","It is a good and fun game. No overdetailed graphics that run at 5 fps and are hard to look at, just very well done, various, solid design which reminds about mods HardQore (for Quake 4), HardQore 2 and Z-Hunter (for Doom 3); smooth 60 fps.\n\nAnd the spirit of challenging classic 2d games is there, but modernized. In those ones you spend months of retries to complete one game, here you spend minutes of retries to complete one level, so it's nostalgic but not annoying.\n\nAnd if a level is still too hard for you, you can buy one-time powerups or permanent upgrades for your weapon to make it easier.\n\nThe challenge was very fun for me, and interesting to see how far I can go, so I completed all game without any items and upgrades, only maxed out the standard gun before last boss because it seemed to be impossible to complete otherwise.\n\nReplay value is also very enjoyable. It is a pleasure to revisit the game with more skills and better weapons.\n\nIt's funny how enemies sometimes fly off the screen. It's another nice homage to old games, modern remake of their enemies' falling through the floor.\n\nHilarious ending rewarded me with a good laugh.\n\nWhat i'd like to criticize is that randomization of enemies and powerups didn't seem to work well at times for me. At few occurences it led me to luck-based encounters where I had to replay the level over and over until the amount and type of running enemies happened to be manageable, sometimes I got a medkit at the beginning of the level which was useless due to 100% health.\n\nOverall, it's a really enjoyable nostalgic experience that's worth playing.\n\nUpdate: it has come to my attention that some players experience a crash on level 2-2. I decided to do a quick test and successfully reproduced the bug. It happens when the flying powerup collides with an enemy, so you simply need to kill him before the powerup appears, and then you'll be able to continue.","December 27, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

The biggest of them being the fact touching an enemy is insta-death, and that in a 2D shooter where you can not see what's ahead of you, but even worse UNDER you is a terrible, terrible choice. Another complaint I can have, although not that big, is that the projectiles pass through platforms like they weren't there, not something unforgivable but surely irking when you are just minding your own business and are shot by a random projectile coming your way.\n\nNow, the worst part would be the controls. Like many said you have to use the up key and movement key at the same time, resulting in being unable to steadily aim towards an enemy above you without moving around and risking on either falling or missing the shot. But the worst of it all, is you CANNOT USE THE MOUSE TO FIRE! That's right, no LMB, you have to press the K key to shoot, resulting in even more awkwardness coordinating the whole thing. Not that bad after all, but still quite an annoyance in this day and age.\n\nNow, there are some positive points to this game I guess...the levels look interesting enough and the main character is a...Anubis...thing...with armor? I mean, that's rather cool.\n\nEither way, I'd say only get this game keeping in mind the kind of trouble you are going to run into. Maybe wait for a discount, or maybe just avoid purchase at all.

You might expect good or at least decent graphics in an Unreal game but this is not the case. The graphics are blurry and rather bleak. Controls are weak need a lot of work as well as the AI. I can see where they were going with this make it a possible Contra like game and it's fine if it's difficult but this is nearly unplayable as it was most likely a quick way to earn cash on a terrible game. 2/10 Try harder next time and thank god I got this for free","June 2, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Recently reinstalled it because sometimes I like to have access to a game I can easily pick up and put back down at any time, you know a game where you don't have to memorize combos, just something simple.\nWell, I started playing it and realized how bad this game, the game feels a bit stiff for my liking, enemies seem to have that almost perfect timing of hitting most the time if you don't slow your pace down, I should also add that because you can't remain stationary to make angled shots, you have a hard time trying to hit enemies in certain positions and weapon drops are a little scarce, so a lot of the time you'd just be using your default gun. Don't know if it's just me but sometimes the screen gets like a bit blurry/jittery, doesn't help that there doesn't seem to be any graphical options you can tinker around with.\nI went and had this game removed from my library.","May 11","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
