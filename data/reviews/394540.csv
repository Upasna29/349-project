Those who just want to finish the game might be able to do so in 4-5 hours.\n\nSCORE:\n7.2/10\n\nI am the sort of gamer who, fearing scarcity, hoards useful items and ammo in anticipation of difficult battles or the end of the game.  Unfortunately, one can never be sure if the particular game that he is playing is the type that rewards that strategy or the type that does not.\n\nSpaceport Hope does not.\n\nI hurt my own enjoyment of the game by using the primary gun (weak and overheats, but has infinite ammo) 95% of the time outside of boss battles.  If you buy this game, I strongly recommend that you do not hold back as much as I did, though you might want to hold on to the rocket launcher and beam weapon ammo for bosses.\n\nI also waited until quite late in the game to explore the other planets, assuming that there would be some barrier to progression and that the plot would take me to them eventually.  Again, learn from my mistake:  most of these planets are totally unrelated to the plot and free to explore, often containing a health upgrade, new weapon, or both.  Visit them as you see fit.\n\nIf I hadn't made these mistakes, which were based on assumptions I made because of my experiences with other games, I would have been better able to enjoy the weapon variety.  Besides the starting gun, there are 11 weapons to be discovered, given, or created, including a flamethrower, machine gun, grenade launcher, and the curving beam weapon seen in the trailer.  Some of these do share ammo, so using it all up on one weapon may make another unavailable, but ammo can be found sitting in the environment or as a drop from enemies, albeit a little too infrequently for my tastes.\n\nThere is decent variety among the enemies as well.  You'll find classic enemies that try to walk into you or shoot at you from a distance, but you'll also find ghosts who can fade out and reappear at your location, eels that randomly shoot off electricity or charge at you when you get close, machines who hide behind armor if you shoot them too much, aliens that leap into the air to try to crush you, and more.  The most noticeable problem with the enemies in this game is how much health some of them have, which is ironically more noticeable because enemies do not have health bars.  I acknowledge that my poor choice of weapon may have had something to do with this, but there are enough enemies (some of whom can become invincible for a time) that I don't think that I would have had enough ammo for the other guns to deal with them all anyway.  These bullet sponges can make some areas tedious to pass if one tries to kill them all, so I recommend running past them when appropriate.  At least they don't respawn until one moves to a new area.\n\nBosses are also varied.  There's a boss who shoots at you as you platform your way up to his arena while lava rises below you, one who can only be harmed once you've charged up some pylons on either side of his arena, another whose projectiles must be knocked back at him, and many more.  They all look different and have a few different attacks and none of them comes across as unfair, though the final boss is considerably harder than any of the others.  But the game does feature 3 health packs that must be used from the inventory and totally restore health, so the final boss is manageable even if one is going for the achievement for defeating him using only the starting weapon.  If you want more of a challenge in general, I recommend that you avoid using the solid beam weapon against the bosses, as it makes very short work of a few of them.\n\nWith a water world, lava world, labs, a prison, and more, you shouldn't tire of the environments, either.  Additionally, the enemies and bosses all seem to fit their environments, so there will be no moments where you are pulled out of your immersion--at least what little immersion a simple 2D platformer/shooter has to offer.\n\nTo conclude the list of positives, I want to point out that the developer (at least the programmer, who talked to me) seems like a great guy.  I had some questions about achievements and he offered clues one-on-one to help me out as well as edited my save file so that I could get a missable achievement without having to re-play a large portion of the game.  (That achievement pertains to the lockpick, an item used for two doors but which can only be used once, that you can find in the level where you have to assemble a ship.  The game indicates neither that it can only be used once nor that it is related to an achievement.)  We ended up chatting a bit about other matters and he claimed that the team plans additional content for the game.  I have only praise for him.\n\nAs for the negatives that I did not already cover:\n\n1.) At any point, you can press 'H' to see your objective.  In the last third of the game or so, I often had no idea where to go even with that objective.  For example, I did not know where to find the council.  Even if I had known, I would have first had to find the place that unlocks the door to the council.  It was only because I stumbled upon this place first and saw a cutscene of the door opening that I knew where to go.\n\n2.) Checkpoints, which save the game and are the only way to heal besides using one of the three health packs, are usually spaced apart fairly.  But there are a few areas where another would be appropriate.  For me, the most notable absence of a second checkpoint was on the lava planet.  There should be one around the place where one has to platform past lava geysers to get an item, then platform all the way back to the beginning of the world.  I made it with only 1 HP left.\n\nI also wish that the game had more puzzles.  There are a few at the moment:  one involves determining the next number in a sequence, one or two involve adding the right numbers together, and one involves figuring out how to get a bunch of lights activated at the same time.  Simple as they were, I enjoyed them and they served to break up the usual gameplay.  But I recognize that this game is fundamentally a platformer and shooter and that the average buyer probably does not expect them, so I don't hold this against the game.\n\nThere is also no real replay value to the game, which doesn't bother me, but may bother other players.  However, one shouldn't expect too much from a game that is $8 at full price.\n\nFor its variety in every category, rewarding exploration, and helpful developer, but also for its bullet sponge enemies, occasional lack of clear direction, and ammo limitations, I give Spaceport Hope a 7.2 out of 10.","October 2, 2015","true","10.4"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","32","33","0","0"

Some of them require a certain item that you must find or buy first to be able to safely go there.\n\nThere is no controller support, which is unfortunate for a game like this. It does work fine with xpadder.\n\nYou start with a hand gun with unlimited ammo (although it does overheat and you have to wait a few seconds for it to cool off). I found another weapon about 10 minutes in to it. After 4 hours i have 4 weapons.\n\nThe enemies are not the standard 1-2 hits to kill. They (and you) have HP, not hearts. Some of the early enemies are taking many hits to kill (you can't see their HP.) The enemies do have simple AI and do more than walk back and forth.\n\nGiven that a screen with 3-5 enemies can take a little while to kill, the checkpoints seem a bit far apart for my tastes, but I'm not very patient with redoing content.\n\nBecause of the distance of the checkpoints, for me at least, the fast action seen in the store page video is just not realistic. You can't jump around getting hit as much as the video shows without constantly running back to the last checkpoint to get healed. It could get faster paced once I find more weapons, but so far it is more of a careful crawl to make sure I survive to the next checkpoint. This is especially true when you also have to go through a long series of spikes and moving blocks.\n\nThe checkpoints are my only real complaint about the game. It might be better if the enemies dropped some form of HP.\n\nThe bosses are on the easy side.\n\nOnce you get a ways in to it, there is a suprisingly large variety of enemies, most of them unique in one way or another.\n\nOverall it's a pretty nice game, and worth the price.\n\nEdit: I finished the game in just under 7 hours. The checkpoint spacing was not as bad as it seemed early on. They are a bit sparse in the beginning areas.\n\nThe bosses remained fairly easy all the way to the end. The final boss took me three tries, and I was one hit away from doing it in two tries. No boss took more than three tries. About half of them I killed on the first attempt, and I'm not especially good at boss fights.","September 15, 2015","true","6.9"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/394540/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","My favorite platformers are the ones that let you loose in a great big world to explore. Metroid gives you planets, Castlevania gives you, well, castles, Shadow Complex gives you a valley, and so on. If you ever played the Knytt games, they might have actually been the best about making you feel like you were on a grand journey. Spaceport Hope might not have the polish or the depth of the games I just listed, but it's a solid adventure that's big on the joys of journeying and exploring.\n\nYou play Cole, the one competent adventurer on a peaceful colony world that produces medicine. A routine delivery to Spaceport Hope goes bad, and it's up to you to uncover the dark deeds behind it. There's nothing groundbreaking about the story, but it serves as a very effective driver throughout the game, keeping you bouncing around the different planets and closing in on a satisfying showdown and resolution. There are a number of planets to visit, and many of them are actually not essential to progress. You can travel to any of them at any point, though you may need special items to pass certain roadblocks.\n\nThe core gameplay is extremely straightforward. Your character doesn't gain any additional abilities and starts with a double-jump, so aside from finding key items, you're going to be looking for guns. Spaceport Hope has 12 guns you can find, spread across 3 archetypes. The green ammo guns fire rapid energy bolts, the red ones fire explosives, and the blue ones do constant damage like with fire or lasers. There's some neat variety among them, like a homing plasma gun and a rocket shotgun, so you'll definitely want to scour the planets for them. You won't need to look for hidden walls or secret passages, though... the exploration is all a matter of checking all the side paths and areas, and remembering which doors you need to return to with the right key.\n\nI didn't find the music or the sound effects very memorable, and the weapon sounds in particular are pretty underwhelming. The rest of the presentation is classic pixel art, with some real love shown to the environments and enemies you encounter. That really helps open the galaxy up and encourage you to explore every corner of every world to see what's there. As you get further in you find more and more connections between the items you collect and the barriers you run into, and as the exploration angle clicks so too does the fun. There are NPCs to talk to and shops to purchase from, which round out the worlds and can give you further reasons to keep poking around. Spaceport Hope doesn't really do anything new or exciting for the genre, but it's a solid couple of hours gallivanting around the galaxy, and I can always use more of that.","November 8, 2015","true","4.1"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ercicin/recommended/394540/","ercicin","erc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ercicin/","873 products in account","Spaceport Hope, from a development team of four, is an indie action-platformer stylized after 16-bit console titles of the 90s. The simple yet functional story puts you in the role of Cole, an interplanetary courier whose latest job takes an unexpected turn that results in an adventure of a lifetime for him.\n\nAt its heart, Spaceport Hope can be best described as a metroidvania. Yet it utilizes the adventure itself as its driving force rather than levelling up and collecting gear. As events unfold, your journey sees you travelling between the planets which are themed differently from one another as well as housing its own bunch of baddies. Even though Cole does not level up, exploration is rewarded in the form of HP upgrades and additional weapons, which is welcome since enemies take more than one hit to go down and healing is only possible through the use of checkpoints.\n\nThus the gameplay revolves around going after your current objective and figuring out how to overcome your enemies efficiently. Alongside a few puzzles here and there, most of the areas have classic platforming hazards to mind too. It is possible to form a weapon set of ones own out of the twelve available to collect, which share three types of ammo. All weapons are prone to overheating, which is to be taken into consideration when tackling the situation at hand. Thankfully, the arsenal itself is varied and every gun has a use and strategy of its own, adding enough depth and fun to the combat which might otherwise be repetitive.\n\nVisuals wise, the game is simply pretty. All the work of a single artist, Spaceport Hope offers elegant pixel art and makes sure every visual element, be it a character sprite or a small detail like a GUI icon, works within the overall thematic vision. The chiptune soundtrack backs up the visual representation of the planets perfectly, with tracks ranging from melancholic to suspenseful in feel. Technically, it was a bug-free ride for me and the native support on offer for the Logitech controller I use made the experience even more smooth. As a sidenote, the graphical bugs I encountered and reported were fixed by the developer in a day's time.\n\nAll in all, teambitclub's first title ends up as an accomplishment. If you like metroidvanias with an adventurous feel, or even 2D platforming in general, Spaceport Hope is here for an enjoyable as well as highly nostalgic 8-hour ride.","January 9","true","8.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The music was fairly good, the controls were solid, and the art design is servicable - you'll never get lost in the stage (visually) and all but 1 danger are clear and easily seen (one enemy shot is very small, and fades into the last stage's background fairly easily, especially if you've upgraded your main gun). At $.50, the game is well worth it. At $5, it's much more iffy. Catch it on a sale. 8/10\n\nThe Full: The plot is an excuse - early on, you run afoul of The Man and go to jail - never comes up again. Medical supplies are tampered with, but no one mentions it outside of The Plot, and the planetary government doesn't seem to care. There are 2 dudes who mess with you regularly, and you aren't ever sure why (Odds are good they work for the big bad, but that doesn't really get confirmed one way or another)\n\nNone of this matters, you are here to run, jump, and blow [expletive] up - and, oh lords, can you! You can control quite a bit of where you go, both on the ground and in the air, the jumps feel good, and while some jumps are a little tricky, none of them are frustrating (the game tends to fall on the "too easy" side of things in it's platforming). Biggest difficulty is keeping yourself under control while firing (all your guns have kickback that will move you a little. When using a rapid gun, like your main one, this can add up if you don't pay attention). Also, you input gets cut when you move from screen to screen. For example, you may cross a screen, stop dead, fire at an enemy, and be knocked back into the previous screen - this can get frustrating. Also kicks in after cut scenes - holding the firing button as the boss loads won't let you start firing the minute you get control, you have to re-press the button.\n\nOn the "blow things up" measure, you do have a lot of options, some of which are very fun...but you probably won't use them. Firstly, you can win without ever switching out the main weapon to fight. It's hard, but do-able. There were only a few bosses that even made me think of switching up. Further, there are 3 types of ammo, so you don't really want to use all of the guns you are given. Ammo isn't exactly hard to find, but it can be a big deal if you run out of one type (and it isn't hard to do so, with certain weapons). For example, you get a rocket launcher, a "frag" gun, and a grenade launcher - all use "red" ammo. You will almost never use the frag gun - it's half as powerful as the rocket launcher, and there just aren't that many times when you want to put out a massed number of weak shots.\nThe Pulsar is twice as powerful as your main gun, but you'll mostly use your main to conserve ammo. If you want more oomph, you'll go to a better gun that doesn't suck ammo like a kid at a soda shop - the rocket launcher, for example, or the Ultimate Destroyer. Same problem with the Wave Gun and the Laser - too much ammo eaten for the damage dealt.\nDon't get me wrong, a lot of the guns are fun - a lot of fun - but you just aren't going to have the ammo to play around with most of them a lot of the time, and when you Need a special weapon, the rocket launcher is almost always the best bet, unless you have side case - using the Hydro gun to shoot through a wall, for example, the Grenade launcher for indirect fire and traps, or the flame thrower to burn a bone pile.\n\nMusically, half the stages are merely meh, while one or two are pretty nice, and the rest fall in-between. Nothing is particularly painful, and everything is servicable. I consider the sound effects to be fairly good, if a little loud.\n\nReplay-wise, this game doesn't have a lot going for it - there isn't enough challenge to make a replay satisfying, there aren't enough secrets to make a completionist re-run it (without really trying, I cleared 95% of the game's hidden/side bits. Just have to figure out what to do with one item).\n\nTime to cost, the game is probably worth $5 bucks, but I do recommend taking it on a sale - there wasn't anything really spectacular about the experience, and 4 hours to clear the main game just isn't a great return. Definitely better than a movie ticket, though.","May 2","true","8.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now let's get into it.\n\nThis is a really rather lovely game. The controls are very tight and responsive, the pixel art is some of the best i have seen, although i am no connoisseur, and the gameplay is quick and to the point, with a lot of unique and interesting enemies and weapons.\n\nAnother high-water mark is the soundtrack, which sounds appropriately melancholy and retro, and it matches the tone of the game and its art to a tee.\n\nThe game does have its drawbacks though. For example it does seem a bit aimless and directionless at times, and the balancing isn't quite there yet (infrequent health pickups means you are often ill-equiped to take on enemies),\n\nAll in all, it's a surprisingly tightly packed little game, and a fun experience.","December 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Have not entirely beat it, but then, after crashing 3 out of the 4 times I went to change my controls, I dont want to.\n\nIf you like 8-bit style games, you'll like this.\n\nControls seemed good and responsive. Gamepad support was good.\n\nIt was alright, what I played, but after the first crash, I remember saying to myself "I'm just done with the game really".\n\nHow do you use the invetory? Is it that you have the items in your inventory, so you automatically use themm, or is there a special combination you need to press?\n\nThe hit box for you and objects you need to jump on seems too big (mine boss for ex), where as the hit box for bosses seem a bit small.\n\nI was never invested in the story, not even enough to look up a playthrough on youtube. It really feels like an indie story. Sorry.\n\nAforementioned crashing when trying to change controls.\n\nPersonal cringe: using "to" when you mean "too". Does not weigh on my review, but if you're going to sell yourself as professional, you should not overlook that in a text heavy game. Maybe you missed it, and that's fine. Just a tip.\n\nDon't get me wrong. There is potential, and everyone is different. You might like it, but I can't recommed it when I've seen cheaper games hold my interest more.","April 25","false","3.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Havn't played long but don't think I'll play more so I'm leaving my thoughts, feel free to take that in to consideration.\n\ncons:\n-Wants to use the keyboard, cannot access to manu with a controller, controller support is poor; forces you to use the analogue stick for movement making it really sloppy to control and since it's not made for a controller there is one set jump height(we've had better since nintendo..).\n-Can only fire in the four cardinal directions with your basic gun.\n-The story setup is just amateurish. I'm ok with next to no story in a game but this one, at least at the start, is just silly; I'd have rather just been dropped in the field with a memo of whatever's happening. You're also given poor direction; only when you exhaust your places to go do you come to the conclusion your ship is not parked in town but instead all by itself on the other end of a monster-infested cave, because, your character is as indifferent to that kind of thing as he is to being set up and imprisoned.\n-No map I could find, at least at the start.\n-No way of knowing what pits you can jump down and which insta-kill you; I'm not really used to instant death environmental hazzards in metroidvanias either.\n-I don't mind pixel graphics but these were rather rough; I suppose that's a matter of personal preference, though.\n\npros:\n-Nice looking and laid out environments.\n-Really good music.\n-Looks like a nice big inventory of guns to find.\n\nHopefully they work out some of these shortcomings and streamline things because I think it's got potential; if and when that happens I'll be the first one back to give it another try.","May 2","false","1.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I know your gonna say "Oh well you probably just suck at the game. No, they need to add different difficulty levels, and I do like that they have Key Bindings but the default controls are just plain terrible. If you add difficulty levels and better controls? Maybe I would recommend this game. I think this game has a lot of potential, because the soundtrack is very nice and the story I have played so far is meh.

Special abilities like double jump and even a pea shooter have more value when you know what the game feels like without. It also suffers from poor default controls, doesn't detect my controller, and no useful key rebinding or mouse aim. Couple this with poor response and Knytt characters minus the life that made Knytt fun, and the fire inside your soul dies. There are much better products on the market (Even the NES Adventures of Link) and anything poorly thought out at first glance generally is. Also, it runs on Java. Last I decided that was a cup of rotten coffee that I would have avoided were this not part of a Humble Bundle. Maybe I'm a biased tea drinker, but it's basically the worst of 3 browser game engines.","May 13","false","0.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","2"
