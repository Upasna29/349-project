Sadly, its just a way to waste time. Its mildly fun for about 60 seconds. The outlandish planes you fly and large bosses you fight against are neat, but not worth the price of admission. This would be a neat arcade game for $0.25/life, but at $9-10, its a waste. Also, as a port, its terrible. I have 1 resolution, no video options, no control list, the view distance is terrible, and given how the horizon moves I must be on a planet the size of a basketball.\n\nA lazy port designed to make some cash. Glad I could help, Team6! Now everyone else stay far away.","January 24, 2014","false","0.2"," 271 of 293 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","271","293","0","0"

Unfortunately, it is.\n\nThis game is by Team 6 Studios, who also brought you Glacier 3: The Meltdown, another terrible game that bears many of the same hallmarks as this one. Not only does it not give you the option to change the controls, it doesn't even tell you what they are. From what I understand both these games are ported from the Wii, where a digital manual is available from the Home screen at any time, but frankly that's no excuse for at the very least making that information available in some form. The game is locked at a very low resolution, and the store screenshots look much nicer than anything you'll ever see in-game.\n\nAs far as gameplay, I came hoping for Star Fox, but got nothing of the sort. Bland enemies, awful flight physics, uninteresting levels, and the requirement to both move the plane and aim the gun (which I imagine was originally designed to work with the Wii's pointer functionality) just doesn't do the game any favors. There's no controller support in this bare-as-bare-bones-ports-get game, but because of the pointer thing even when I mapped what buttons I knew about (and I think I'm missing something because the game mentions buying bombs on the mission score screen) through Xpadder, using an analog stick to emulate mouse movement has never been a good idea. Playing a Star Fox-like game on PC with a controller would have made me very happy, but unfortunately, this was not that game.","July 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","57","65","0","0"

But sometimes you don't have to bother waiting when there are glaring problems.\n\nThis is easily Top 10 one of the laziest ports ever made. You play this with the keyboard and mouse (arrow keys to move, mouse to aim) and no option to change that those key bindings. I don't know about you but when I'm using the mouse for aiming I'm more comfortable using WASD for movement. But here's the really fun part! You have to use the R key to dodge. Just stop and thing about this for one second. Your left hand is on the arrow keys, your right hand is on the mouse, HOW EXACTLY are you supposed to reach that R key?! And to add insult to injury you can't simply just press R to dodge, you need to R+direction in which you wish to dodge.\n\nSo! You take your left hand off the arrow keys and move it to the R button and you take your hand off your mouse and move it over to the arrow keys, and presto you can dodge! For something like an on-rail twitch shooter dodging is an essentially core gameplay mechanic. This is broken, the controls in this game are broken.\n\nI kinda want to like this game, I'll probably play it a few more times, but until they patch this up and let you customize your key bindings I can't help to tell you all to stay away from this. I can see why this went for $0.99 during the sale.\n\nStay!

I dunno this is a rail-shooter game until installed it and trying this one. FYI, I love rail-shooting genre. Its classic. Remind me about arcade game Afterburner by SEGA or Star Wars Rebel Assault by Lucasart. This Hyper Fighters want to be like that, a phenomenal plane rail-shooter game. But it failed & broken in many ways, such as :\n\n-. There is no way to change video configuration, wtf ... this is a pc game !?\n-. There is no way to change control mapping ... wtf again !?\n-. The only option is adjuts or reduce sound / music and invert controller.\n-. Bad port from Wii. Just copy paste with a little changing for PC port.\n\nController are fix with mouse for aim, arrow key for move ... but R key to dodge.  How can I push the R key if move with arrow key. If we can used WSAD, its become playable but its not.  Well, this is the most horrible game in my library and a bad PC Port ever.\n\nSo, is the worst game that I'd ever play.

It was given to me in a giveaway from Indiegala.\n\nHyper Fighters is a game in which you float ambiguously behind a jet-plane. The jet controls itself as a standard on rails shooter. You point at things, you click on things and they blow up.\n\nThis is a classic case of something being so bad it loops back around to become endearing again. It has this very odd and misplaced voice over. “This is suicide”, “I'm going down” Whenever a boss shows up or you end up failing to succeed in your task. It sounds like he is talking into a tin can and it gives it a very early nineties feel if you catch my drift. However in all honesty, the soundtrack is pretty rad. I should mention the music is available in the directory as .ogg files.\n\nIts my understanding this is a port of a Wii game in which you were actually able to at least maneuver the plane within the field of the screen though it was still on rails. Half way through stage 2 I figured out you can speed up with MMB and that the rockets can be fired with RMB and a pass over to lock on. So despite being a colossal disaster; There is at least some faint strategy in when to shoot or use rockets for the stage as they are limited and the guns will overheat.\n\nAnd in case you were wondering, just forget about there being a real options menu.\n\nLook, this is game terrible but it made me laugh and I didn't pay anything for it. Wait until someone is giving it away again and give it go. You're allowed to like dumb things because they are dumb.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImBoredToo/recommended/267960/","ImBoredToo","ImBoredToo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImBoredToo/","436 products in account","This is a classic example of how not to make a game. If you want to make games, buy this in a bundle or something as an example of everything you shouldn't do.\n\nIt took me 1 hour to finish all 14 levels of railshooting intensity on easy because I'm not going to waste my time on a bad game. I even left the game running during a boss sequence--I only died once while inactive for a good 5 minutes--to look up the unrebindable mystery controls since they are never told to you in the menus or the game. LMB = fire the constantly overheating gun, RMB = hold/release to lock-on/fire the unreliable missiles, MMB = Hyper Speed (TM), ARROW KEYS TO MOVE, AND B OF ALL KEYS to refill missiles at the cost of score, which doesn't matter. Basically what you do is hold down MMB for the entire game to rush to the boss fights where you spam all your missiles and shoot it for a few seconds. You only get 12 missiles on a boss fight but they usually take out 1/2 to 3/4 of its HP (to be fair, easy difficulty). You gain random powerups of unknown duration for no apparent reason throughout the level, and I think you get lives by having large combo kills; all the more reason to just hold MMB the entire time.\n\nThose photos must be doctored because the game doesn't look like that. It is god awfully ugly and there is no way to change that. Enemies are bland and blend with the environment, making them difficult to see. Trying to bring up the steam overlay freezes the game and takes about a minute. Triggering the overlay sometimes pauses the game, when it feels like it. Also your aircraft takes up a good 1/3 of the screen and the game is never clear how far you can move with the arrow keys. Whenever you try to move the plane, the cursor for your weapon moves as well, which screws up your targeting. The targeting reticule turns into a circle the instant you hover over an enemy so you don’t really know if you’re hitting it or not. The bosses look cool, but the fight sequences perform the same camera loops for every boss intro and fight, which leads to some awkward camera angles; also their deaths look pathetic. Additionally, you don't have to kill everything on the boss for it to die, which doesn't make sense to me. Two levels don't even have a boss and just end abruptly.\n\nThe only other good thing I can say about this game is the 3 or so metal tracks are nice in a cheesy sense, but are repeated on some levels. The voice acting is atrocious, if you can hear it, and so is the writing. Not that I was expecting much from a rail shooter but at least spell and grammar check FFS.\n\nDon't get this. $10 is a blatant rip off. I'd barely pay $1 for this near alpha level trash.","May 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

I just played it again to be reminded why I didn't like it so here's my breakdown so you don't make the same mistake and try it twice like I did.\n\nThis game is supposed to be a nod to Afterburner, the massive arcade hit. In this game, you are in a plane of some sort - I don't know, I didn't pay attention to the story. This plane is extremely special in that it has nothing you would expect a modern plane to have. There is no radar, no speed control, and the control scheme is laughable. It REQUIRES you to use the mouse to aim and the arrow keys to move. Left click shoots, right click locks rockets and fires. Minimal voiceover, typos in the text, etc... One of the most unique features in the game is the magical water. I call it magical because somehow you can see the propellor on any boat you fly over but cannot see submarines until they surface to launch missiles at you. This brings me back to the radar, there isn't any. This means that there is no warning if a rocket is about to hit your ship. It just slams into you. If you're looking for a game to play with a younger child, this one might be good. Nothing looks real and they can "fly" the ship while you shoot. MAYBE that would make it enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/267960/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","Poor arcade port.\n\nHyper Fighters is 3d "on the rails" shooter developed by team 6 studios originally on the Wii and ported to PC. As an on the rails type game you have limited control of your jet as you focus on shooting down enemies coming at you. There isn't much of story, but you play as fighter pilot whose task is to save the world from villains accross the world.\n\n\nPositive\n- 14 levels - Each levels leaves you facing waves of foes and in most levels there is a boss.\n- 3 planes - each plane has different stats in three areas: armor,firepower and manouvarability. Planes also carry different amounts of rockets.\n- 3 difficulty settings - Easy, medium and hard.\n- Replayability - You can replay levels you won previously with the ability to choose a new plane or new difficulty setting.\n- Extra lives - You unlock extra lives while playing which allows you to respwan right after death.\n- Boosts/upgrade - You earn random boosts (i.e invincibility, auto shooting, laser targetting) during game play.\n\n\nNegative\n- No control customisation - There are no options to customise controls, so your stuck with using arrow keys to move and\n- Poor graphics - The environment looks bad with low detailed textures. Aircraft textures and models don't fair much better either.\n- No option to change resolution\n- Short - Completed it in an hour (on easy)\n- Repetition - Most of the mission will require you to go through waves of foes before meeting up with the boss aircraft. There are only 2-3 missions where there are no bosses and just simply waves of foes.\n- No upgrade/boost indicators - when you recieve an upgrade, a word quickly flashes on the screen which tells you what you got. the problem is that the words are too small and appear breifly. Another issue is that you don't now how long the upgrade lasts for as there is no timer or bar to show you.\n- Poor Audio - Weapon effects don't sound good (passable at best). Background music sometimes appears during level;s but they aren't good either. There is very limited voice acting with the pilot (I think?) saying something forgettable before level, plus before and after a boss fight.\n- Limited weapons - You only have machine guns and limited rockets, thats it...\n- Limited planes and no customisation - You can't customise or upgrade your plane at all, you can only choose bewteen 3 planes.\n- Limited choice - Once you choose your plane you have to continue playing with it in the next level.\n- Limited foe variety - You face Jets, helicopters, battleships, submarines and giant ships (which serve as bossses). Sounds like alot, but you will see them again and again.\n\n\nOverall, I suggest you pass on this and look for a better game.","September 8, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When I first started the game, which was no more 30 seconds ago, the first thing was that it looked like a PS2 game.  I proceeded to check the graphical settings (as most of us would do) to only be presented with simple buttons that change the game slightly such as muting the music.\n\nLets move on to the game itself. I would expect the ability to move the jets around with the directional keys but you can only aim with your mouse and shoot with the buttons. This was a big NO for me. I immediately closed the game and started to type this review.\n\nHopefully, from this review I quickly made, you would know what this game would deliver.

It's a somewhat old game, arcade-style, and ported from the Wii of all consoles. Of course it'll have that.\nCoD fanboys also complain about the resolution. Again, it's a Wii game, and the low res doesn't really mean it's bad, else Contra would be bad, wouldn't it?\n\nBut other than that, the pros are mainly the sountrack. The music is truly enjoyable. The other feature I like is the aircraft design. Gun aiming and plane movement are separate things, that's also a welcome feature.\n\nThe cons are the controls: Mouseaim is fine, but moving with the arrow keys? Seems unconfortable to me, especially since you gotta buy extra rockets with the B key. I'd rather move with WASD. Don't get me wrong, they are not otherwordly, but can be unconfortable and a little annoying to get used to. Next con are the levels. They are not quite bad, but they can be repetitive and a little bland. But then again, it's emulating arcade-type games, so I can let that one pass.\n\nOverall, don't give a single ♥♥♥♥ about what others say, if you like arcade shooters like Afterburner 2, you may like this and should give it a try.\nAs with Chaos Domain, I suggest you rather get it as a gift, in case you regret it.\n\nTL;DR:\n>arcade style plane shooter\n>weird controls\n>cool ost\n>wii port\n>not for everyone's taste\n\n10/10 would run out of rockets again","January 16, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The game doesn't feature any sort of controller support or even configurable key bindings - which this game sorely needs as the default control mapping is hideous at best. Not only the game only accepts movement through arrow keys, there's a barrel roll key as well. Guess what it's bound to?\n\nR.\nNo. seriously. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to be shot in the face.\n\nBoss fights basically resume to spam all your rockets at the boss, die, and finish it off. Normal waves involve shooting at patterns of one-shottable aircraft, combined with eventual ships requiring several seconds of fire to take out, submarines that manage to shoot several missiles at you before you can destroy them, and difficult-to-spot SAM sites. Later levels also include helicopters(mostly a nuisance) andd attack craft(which come in groups of at least 3, with each one firing several high-damage missiles at once).\n\nYou also get powerups for no apparent reason. These powreups also seem random at best, such as resetting weapon cooldown despite the weapon overheat gauge being at 0, shooting weapons automatically even though there are no enemies on screen, or refilling your rockets even though you had all rockets you could carry already.\n\nThe most infuriating part of the game is enemies you can't aim at still damage you, courtesy of a fixed camera system. Bullets shot at you are occasionally dodgeable, but appear to be hitscan most of the time.\n\nThe game is also surprisingly short. I've completed it in roughly an hour of gameplay. Story is lackluster and almost completely nonsense at times, voice acting ignores the situation completely, and the soundtrack is repetitive.\n\nThe only interesting mechanic in the game is drag-based missile lock-on - you can fire multiple missiles(which ingame are named as rockets) at multiple targets by dragging the mouse cursor at the targets you want to hit and releasing it to fire the missile salvo.

The strongest gripe with this for me is that they should've kept controls in that format and removed the annoying cooldown. Then we'd have a fighting chance. It's playable, but I'd say it's more luck based due to the difficulty of maneuvering and the cooldown. Still is playable on easy mode.

The grapics wheren´t amazing and i disliked that the game did 80% of the things in the game (controlling the plane and stuff) but other than that the game is good and pretty relaxing as the game does almost everything for you.\n\nbut...BUT why so many bad reviews? Like seriously? how can anyone dislike this game so much? The answer is pretty simple: they are playing wrong genre. Not everyone likes strategy games, it´s like a first person shooter player played a strategy game and said: OMZ COD IS MUCH BETTER 0/10 DIS GAM IS SOE BAD. Note that if you don´t like strategy games don´t buy them in the first place. Srsly everybody who reviews games on steam keep your reviews creative: You are the one who gets those players who just cannot find a game for them (like me) to buy the game and play it. If you don´t like the game tell us whenever it´s a bug, bad gameplay mechanic or you just don´t like the game.\n\nEdit: so as some people clearly see i haven't played very much this game and there is a good reason for it. If your computer can run good AAA game at 60fps and you are playing this what are you doing? Solid 1H of any new game can be worth 5h of playing this game and i agree.

I don't even want to put in the effort to give a long review, because I just don't feel it's worth my time.\n\nThe graphics are passable. I mean, on-rails shooters don't exactly need the best graphics that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 56 can offer. They're not bad at all - they're passable enough to get the job done.\n\nMusic and sound effects are alright. Nothing exactly stood out to me, but the music did give the game a feel that it was more exciting than it actually was.\n\nGameplay is horrible. I mean, it's an on-rails shooter, and you can have your own opinions about those, but as far as on-rails shooters go, this game is dreadful. Enemy fire seems very, very accurate and constant, almost like the game is designed to make sure you lose all your lives in one level. You don't have much room to move around to dodge enemy fire, so you'll get hit a lot no matter what. The controls are not explained, and there is NO CONTROLLER SUPPORT, hell, NO WASD SUPPORT EITHER. I was stuck to use the left mouse button for firing my gun and the arrow keys for movement. The game does not tell you how to fire rockets, so I never figured that one out.\n\nStory?

This game should be around 6.5 because it could have potential but the developers didn't care enough about it. I will give it a thumbs up just for this and i hope that the developers will change it....or at least the community.","December 20, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However in order to move around you have to reach all the way to your arrow keys. To aim and shoot you use the mouse. To dodge via barrel roll you have to press the R key. You can't rebind the controls.\nPretty lame looking textures all around.\nThere's an incredibly minimal amount of gratification in destroying baddies if there was even any.\nA rather small game but three incredibly short missions in and I figured that I don't like this game.

Least I hope it was, cause if this was a pc original game, it would just make it worse.\n\nThe first thing one can notice long is the lack of graphics configurations, or any configurations except for sound, music and control inversion for that matter. The controls were not intuitive (at least for me), and there was little in the way of explination for them. Mobility is limited within a window, in which you make a very big target. While the game was meant to be a rail shooter I think, it leaves much to be desired. Oh, you also have to buyy rockets once you run out, but how to do so is a mystery (some sort of pay to play maybe).\n\nI personally didn't play past the first level, as I as expecting something more then what I got, and trying to avoid getting shoot was becoming too troublesome with a medium plane. If this is indeed a phone port, I would suggest trying it there, and not wasting your time and money on the pc version.","September 24, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is lacking in almost every aspect of what can be considered a good game.\nFirstly the controls cannot be changed at all. Zero customization.\nThe basic premise of the game is this, you control a fighter jet with the arrow keys, and aim the mouse around the screen to destroy other jets that appear. There is almost no story to the game, except for the little tidbits you get in the beginning of the mission. Finally, the graphics are completely terrible. I mention this last, because graphics don't make a great game, in fact many games have 8 bit graphics and they are amazing.

I got this in a bundle that I paid a dollar for and I overpaid for this by a large margin.  If you have a problem with the amount of time I played this game, good for you, pat yourself on the back but don't bother to comment telling me I haven't played much of the game because .1 hr was too much time to waste.\n\nPros:\n- Quit function works.\n- Uninstall also works.\n\nCons:\n- Absolutely everything pertaining to this game.\n\nIt's clearly either a mobile port or something because the actual amount of in game help is nil, there are no control settings or graphics settings.  You might look at the screenshots on this store page and think "Well the game doesn't look half bad for a game from 2011", and if they hadn't been massively touched up in an editing program I'd agree with you, but the screenshots are a lie.\n\nThe genre is rail shooter so if you're thinking it's like Afterburner, Space Harrier, Time Crisis, Area 51, you are giving this game too much credit, it's nothing like those games aside from the genre type.  In this game you are often going to be hit with weapons fire that you can't see because your craft takes up about 40% of the screen, enemies are almost indistinguishable from scenery, and you have almost zero control over your craft or it's position on screen.  You can use a boost with the middle mouse click, but there's little to no point in using it unless you feel like ramming enemy planes.  Also your missles are almost a waste of time, you can lock on to enemies but you'll be lucky if they hit.\n\nSounds aren't terrible for a game of this type, but I didn't bother to list this as a pro because decent sound isn't going to save this game.\n\nI strongly suggest you keep skip this one regardless of whatever price it might go down to.","August 8, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
