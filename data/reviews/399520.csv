I like that this game is free even though I would still buy it at around ¬£0.99 but nothing more than that because of the length of it, which leads the game downwards however it does have replayability with the choices of jokes and a chance to get all of the points in the game and I'm not sure if there are multiple ending as I have only played it through once but although I'd like to hope so.\n\nIn essence this game has a large focus on an aspiring comedic star and the bumps and turns of a comedian itself and trying to find insperation within the real world and depending on how you play it failing miserbly or making your dreams come true, (I think) this is a nice 8-bit game as well however the audio is less tuned and background noice can be heard in some parts when the voices both cut in and out other than this I would say this is one of the best free games steam has to offer.","September 2, 2015","true","1.9"," 34 of 44 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","34","44","3","1"

The game itself can run pretty terribly though and has some weird quirks, like resolution issues, sped up dialog and mouse sensitivity. Overall though if you dont experience those, or can work through them, you will find a decent game.","September 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","18","22","5","0"

It was a cool little game with some clever voice acting and some good funny dialog - all for the sake of Questing for Comedy!  It doesn't take long to play it front to back, and you can save your game to go back and try new jokes, new responses to situations, or new endings.  Overall it was a lot of fun to play, and I will certainly try for a different ending!\n\nDefinitely worth the download and is more fun than a lot of games you have to pay for.

The whole concept of the game was rather short & sweet; as it focuses on making choices made by you, the protagonist. The whole art & style of the game had a rather fetching retro feel to it, otherwise it would be bland and tedious. The humour was quite cheesy as I felt as though it took a more australian approach towards their wittiness. In contrary, There were some dull moments where your objective was to repetitively hand out fliers - it made it seem as though I had nothing better to do.\n#AustralianBanter","September 8, 2015","true","2.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","13","17","6","1"

Where it waits for you to do things before generating any new changes.\nThe way the stage works is pretty good, it has kinda vague descriptions of the jokes you will perform, which makes it kinda hard to choose how something will go, like things i thought would be funny based on the description were poorly worded/performed. Even with that, its a great game and even that aspect is reminiscent of how difficult and frustrating these style of games were when they were all that was around.\nWell done Grothers, love it and cant wait to see more content from you.","September 2, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The game isn't your average point 'n click but it revolves around the choices YOU make unlike most games in the genre. Its a short but very fun game with brilliant voice acting and funny dialouge. It has some interesting mechanics that make the game charming and its better than a lot of the free games on the platform. There's also replay value due to choices affecting how the story and some conversations go which can result in different endings which are definitely worth replaying for if you enjoyed the game! While I definitely think its short length is a positive as it doesnt drag on It would've been really cool if it was a bit longer as I feel some parts were kinda rushed and you aren't given a chance to learn about the world more and the rest of the characters aren't considered too important which is a shame considering I really liked some of the characters and found the parts in which you got to hang out with them pretty funny!

Its unique in its being, yet it doesn't stand out as one of "my best games" ever played. Basicly its a point and click game about a comedian. And so far, most of what I had to do is pretty straight forward. There is a bit of a puzzle element in it, but it seems to rather focus on the conversations and notifications of the environment. I believe the game is about 2 hours long, so it's a pretty short game. Overall, if your looking for something short, which isn't to difficult and has some humor in it, then this is worth a try.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5QCxxVCJr0&feature=youtu.be","September 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Nothing special. One of the biggest issues I've had with it is that if you hold down the arrow keys to move, the player just twitches his leg. I would like an update that would fix this issue. Also, the game feels kinda choppy, with the animations feeling sort of strange and not as smooth as they should be. I suggest adding more frames to the walking animations. Overall, the game isn't quite bad, and if you want a game to kill time, I suggest you get this. My final review is a 7/10.

Most importantly, the game itself is enjoyable. And, it's so short that there's really not enough time for its bad points to start to get on your nerves.

There's a good mix of simple adventure puzzles and having to make the right choices during your character's stand-up shows. There's even a fun taxi chase and an easter egg! Highly recommended, especially if you like lame jokes.","January 12","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing about the jokes is that a lot of them are intentionally eye-rollers; the idea is that when you "earn" a good joke by finding it in the environment (remember, at the end of the day this is a point-and-click adventure) it stands out among the others.  This means that the better (or, if we're being honest, simply more thorough) you are at canvassing the environment, the better the in-game jokes will be.\n\nThe one real complaint I have about the game isn't actually with the game itself, per se; it's the engine.  It's either trying so hard to recreate nostalgia that it fails to modernize, or it actually is an engine from an earlier time that hasn't matured.  It's functional, don't get me wrong, but after having played other point-and-clicks I guess I've been spoiled by vastly superior inventory management.  Also, there's an issue (I won't quite call it a bug, since it might just be an unfortunate coincidence) with hitting Shift-Tab to bring up the Steam overlay that causes the inventory display to go all wonky.*\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a fun little indie game if you remember what it is, what it's trying to achieve, and don't hold the low production values against it.  I quoted one of the jokes to my friend as I was playing the game: with a joke at least that good in a free game, it's certainly worth the price of admission (your time).\n\n\n\n\n* Side note: if you hit this issue, I found that some combination of holding down Esc and clicking on the different action buttons (at the bottom of the inventory window) does seem to eventually unstick it.\n\nIf you like this game, check out...
