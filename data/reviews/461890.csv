"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/461890/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","North is an indie adventure title, developed by Outlands. During the game, you play as a man who is seeking asylum in an industrial, cyber-punk world filled with alien-like creatures. The guy has also reached out to his sister to join him in this new city. The game is centered around the current event refugee crisis, and it comes wrapped up in a synthpop soundtrack.\n\nAs soon as this review is finished, I'm refunding the game; I've never bothered to refund anything less than $3 before, but North really takes the cake. The title starts off promisingly enough with a pretty, one minute unskippable intro of a sunset-laden lake with surrounding clouds, and then you're thrown into a dark industrial city. Immediate exploration either takes you to a church, your home, or "work".\n\nIf you enter the church, you're told to press the right mouse button to "convert", but you're never seen by the all-seeing eye, and then you're kicked out of the area; it should also be noted that the FPS here drops down to 10-20 for no reason. If you enter your home, you get to look at some artwork scattered about and talk to an alien. If you enter work, you get to proceed to the mines which I guess is a puzzle area; I couldn't make it past here, I kept dying. I guess the main objective of the mines is to turn a certain number of "jackhammers" on, and I ended up getting three but couldn't find any more. You're on an undisclosed time limit, where after every few seconds one of your three health blocks disappear.\n\nThere's no main menu, options menu, and no direction of what you're supposed to do. The store page says that the "game is very straightforward"; complete and utter bull ♥♥♥♥, North is the epitome of vague. Whenever you perform certain actions, you get an envelope that appears in the bottom left corner of the screen. This generally indicates a note or memo having been created, but I've found no way to open any of these notes; I pressed literally every button on my keyboard trying to figure it out, along with the middle mouse button. I also see that I'm not the only one with this issue, which reassures me that I'm not just an idiot.\n\nThe only thing that North has going for it is a decent soundtrack, which struck me with a Silent Hill vibe at the very beginning. This game is too abstract and art-chic for its own good, while trying to be different it ends up being frustratingly off-putting. I guess I'm just not artsy enough to get this one at all. If only there was a way to read the notes... like, maybe being able to press the "J" button for Journal, but I guess that idea is too mainstream.\n\nRating: 0.5/5.0 - Abysmal, avoid it like the plague.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","May 2","false","0.2"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","28","43","0","0"

As it stands, it's a passing setup for a puzzle adventure. While it's short and not very complex I think North does deliver on atmosphere, and the game mechanic with the letters home that function as a combined narrative and hint system works quite well. Final verdict is thumbs up but not much more - let's say 6/10 or so.","May 1","true","2.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Apparently the game takes 20-40 minutes to complete, but I spent 30 minutes walking around having no clue what to do. I assume the letters that appear in the bottom left corner contain the information I need to move forward, but for the life of me I couldn't work out how to open them! I even restarted the game to read the input controls but nothing helpful there either.\n\nThe game performs badly in some areas too (particularly the Church where my FPS dropped to around 10) and at one point in the Mines it crashed on the 'YOU DIED' screen. Having to restart the game and watch the 1 minute unskippable intro for the third time is not fun..\n\nWhile I appreciate that the developer was trying to give me a sense of unfamiliarity and mystery - the game is about a refugee in an unknown land after all - at times I felt it was much too vague. You'll end up going into rooms and being given a cryptic message which doesn't explain what you're supposed to do, nor point you in any direction. Maybe I should consult the letters I keep receiving? Oh wait, I don't know how to open them. Though maybe I'm just stupid and everyone else got it, I don't know.\n\nIn all, I like the concept of this game but it needs polishing. Give me a few more clues or at least tell me on screen how to open those darn envelopes and I'm sure I'd enjoy this a lot more.\n\nEDIT - For anyone interested here is the video of me playing North. It didn't go so well, but I may go back to this some time in the future and give it another go!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=676152140","April 29","false","0.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","14","20","3","0"

The game tries to relate to current issues of the contemporary refugee crisis. I am unsure if the game really sticks to this issue well throughout the game though\n\nGameplayThis game seems to be according to the story as you play throughout the game. But as I got nearer the end of the game I felt like the whole game sort of forgot about the main issue the game was tryign to promote. Being a refugee in the city and having to deal with these new and weird experiences that you may come across.\n\nThe story of the game is rather interesting, but doesn't really tell the story in way that other games do. Throughout the game you will find letters that will tell the story and the story as the character you are playing as. This is a rather interesting way of portraying your game, that is if you are able to re-read these letters that you have collected. This wouldn't be a issue if the letters you find give you a background to the things that you must perform in order to progress. I mean I have found the letter, you would of thought that this person would keep these letter. Apparently not.\n\nThis issue with the letters also leads to another point that the game suffers from a lot more than it needs to be. This is the way that the game doesn't really help you at all, making it very unclear on what you have to do. I guess this can increase your game time in the game but walking around aimlessly not knowing what to do is a major flaw in this game. Possibly giving hints would be nice if the player is stuck at a certain point in the game.\n\nThe graphics of this game are rather bright and really do work well, although it doesn't seem to be as fancy as some of the other games on steam nowadays, and sometimes feel a bit flat. The game can be really dark at some points though, this does mean that there are some things that you can't see that you are suppose to walk upon such as doors and stairs that you are required to walk through in order to progress. The animation of the characters you play as is rather odd, it does seem like your character sort of floats from place to place instead of actually walking like normal people do nowadays.\n\nPros+ Good price for the game\n+ Interesting story\n+ Tells the story in the form of finding letters\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Steam Trading Cards\n\nCons- The game is short\n- Somewhat feels incomplete\n- Can't re-read previous messages, these messages have clues on how to progress or solve puzzles\n- Character seems to be more hovering rather than actually walking\n- No hints for what to do through the game\n- Graphis sometimes feel flat\n- Lighting in some areas is too dark to see where to go\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsI feel like I can't really recommened this game, it feels slightly incomplete and I feel like the game sort of loses it's touch with the issue that it's trying to promote throughout the game. The graphics could have a bit more work done, and some areas need better lighting. The story is intersting and telling the story through letters is a ncie mechanic.\n\nRating: 5/10","May 10","false","2.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

You are chucked right in with only a letter that you wrote to your sister. From there you have to gain asylum to the city. To do this you need to complete a few different  puzzles that aren't explained very well. I got quite lost and annoyed at the beginning but once the ball gets rolling it becomes quite fun and engaging.\n\nOne problem that I’m not sure if anyone else is having is bad performance issues. It runs quite slow in certain areas, especially the Mines and Church. The controls also feel pretty clunky and mouse movement feels slow. The art style was interesting although it could be refined a bit more. There are parts where the graphics look pretty bad and the Anti-Aliasing is terrible.\n\nApart from that this is an interesting little game. For £1.50, it is a pretty good deal. It is slow but at least it is trying to do something with limited gameplay. 6/10.","April 30","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only thing you have to guide you through a dark, bleak city is the letters you send your sister. There is no main menu, no saves.\n\nIf you love an almost cinematic art house feel in a game, this is great. If you don't, you will hate it, just like all the reviews of people complaining about a lack of direction, objectives and explanation. I'm not passing judgement on them, but they didn't like the game, so if you are looking for something a little more structured in that sense, you will not like it either.\n\nThat being said, it is very linear, and while you can choose the order of how you tackle the main objective, there really is only that objective and one way that it can be achieved.\n\nThe worst thing about the game was the controls. I am on a Mac, and the Mac version had frequent problems with the mouse - there were several points it became broken and unresponsive (playable, but only just) and also the mouse speed was not what I was used to. There were also parts that, seeing other people's screenshots and playthroughs, were not rendering right, like the Doctors area.\n\nBut all these things were not going to stop me from finishing it and I must say it was enjoyable. This game is what you would define in music as a "concept album", and if you like that idea, then this might be a fun one for you. If not, don't get it.","May 6","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you like your hand being held as you go through interactive story telling, this is not the game for you.\n\nThe first half hour is full of "Wait what?" moments but it's completely appropriate for the ideas the game is conveying. After that, it all begins to make sense and you can get quite engrossed in the experience and it can become quite scary in a psychological way.\n\nI only have two criticisms for this game overall. First of which is the inconsistency in the bio on the store page and the actual game, “Sprawling mega-city” is is not. In fact, there are only three floors of the map and the top only has one room. The second criticism is only a small one. At the end of the game (No spoilers) there are a bunch of dialogue boxes but one of them has a completely different tone all of a sudden and it really ruins the end of the game.\n\nHowever, the games message has not been lost by the end, you really feel like an Alien who has to jump through hops just to get people to accept you as a being. Overall, the game is exactly as long as it needs to be and you never have to do anything more than once.

The sensititvity constantly jumps around from being so slow i have to swipe my mouse across my desk aas fast as i can to even barely move the camers to being so fast i have to barely move my mouse. When i entered the mines for the fast time was when i gave up on the game. The was no explanation for what i had to do and i started losing hearts (which also had a totally different art style to the rest of the game) for no apparent reason. i also had black bars appearing on the screen for no reason at all. The graphics are weird and grainy. not in an artsy style but just weir.\nYes i can see that the devs tryed to make a weird game that makes you think and doesnt need to explain anything but you really need to explain what the f*ck is going on.\n\ndo NOT buy this. i have already made a refund request","April 28","false","0.2"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","0"

Didnt recieve a single badge card thing.\nSpent a hour on this game.. getting a headache.\nSpent a hour on this game.. becomming a slave to society.\n\nI mean, for its price.. I guess it was ok. (sale) It kept me entertained to continue due to its weirdness and just wanting to know how it ends I guess. Tho; I couldve spent my time better, on a different game.. that would actually give me the 3 trading cards I wanted! :D","May 16","false","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/donswordsman/recommended/461890/","donswordsman","Don Swordsman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/donswordsman/","17 products in account","Not a terrible game for the price, you could do a lot worse.\n\nBut, as a mac user some of the controles arn't intuative (Right clicking is nessisary and there is no way to change the controles).\n\nThe game is way to dark, to the point of not being able to see things like doors or stairs so exprect to walk around a lot looking for new locations... also each objective you need to achive is explained only after you have tried it once and then go back to the mailbox... this is an intresting idea, but over all it isn't quite as satifying as feeling like you could get it on your own with out a hint. The graphics are okay... nothing fancy very flat, and the charecter just sort of glides which at times makes it feel like your sliding around. Certian areas have graphical errors that apear as black spikes across the screen.\n\nOverall an intresting sorty, and I am willing to check out other titles by Outlands, but this game feels like it is incomplete and if a little more had gone into development as well as a longer story, It could have been something fantastic.","May 10","false","1.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
